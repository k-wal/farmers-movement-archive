The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) said the woman is the boy’s stepmother, a claim that the police refuted.Urvija Goel, deputy commissioner of police (west), said they found injuries on the boy’s body. “There were marks on his face, abrasions on his back and injuries on his hands,” said Goel.Goel said the boy has been handed over to his father on the instructions of the Child Welfare Committee and an FIR under the Juvenile Justice Act was registered against his mother. According to the police, the boy’s mother suffers from mental illnesses.According to the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) — which said they “rescued” the boy and accused the police of ignoring complaints from neighbours about the alleged torture — the boy’s father lives in Mumbai and claimed that the child lived with his stepmother.Goel, however, said that the accused woman is the boy’s biological mother, and both lived at her maternal grandmother’s Hari Nagar home. She added that no complaint had been received in the past.Both agencies said they responded to calls from neighbours on Tuesday, after which they checked on the boy to find him being beaten by his mother.“He was not allowed to leave his house. His mother would tie him up when she stepped out. The boy was made to sleep on the floor and wasn’t offered proper meals,” read a statement issued by the DCW.The boy was produced before the CWC on Wednesday.“The CWC rebuked both parents and handed over the child to his father. The CWC did not direct the police to take any action, but we have registered a case under the JJ Act,” Goel said.The DCW demanded that the boy, on his request, be handed over to his grandparents, who live in a southern state.“This is a very shocking and scary case. A young boy was subjected to such brutality and torture. This incident has put humanity to shame. The commission went out of its jurisdiction to save the boy’s life,” DCW chief Swati Maliwal said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/boy-who-beaten-tied-up-by-his-mother-rescued-101613843893165.html
20-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG sets June 30 deadline for takeover of DLF 1-3||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has set a deadline of June 30 for DLF to complete all the remaining civic infrastructure works in DLF Phases 1-2-3 and hand over the three colonies to the civic body.A decision in this regard was taken during the second review meeting held between MCG and the private developer on February 10, for reviewing the progress of deficient development works being carried out in the areas. The proceedings of the meeting were approved on Friday and accessed by HT.In the previous meeting held last month, DLF had been directed to give the shortest possible deadline, for completing the remaining civic work, in the next meeting. As per the document, DLF had given a tentative timeline between July and December to complete the work.MCG officials, however, stated that the timeline submitted is “too long considering the fact that in the last meeting DLF Ltd had committed to complete the balance work (remaining civic deficiencies) by the end of June 2021.”Hence, the MCG decided to stick to the June 30 deadline.The takeover of the three colonies has been on paper since February 2016, when Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced that the MCG will take over the maintenance of the three colonies along with Sushant Lok-1 and Palam Vihar.“The handover of the three colonies has been a long-standing demand of residents of the three areas. By getting a definite timeline, residents can now look forward to the MCG taking over their respective colonies in just over four months and expect optimum civic services. Around 65% of the work by DLF has been completed. The MCG has, hence, given them four months to complete the remaining 35% of the work,” said RS Rathee, councillor of Ward 34, who had attended the meeting with the developer said.Officials of DLF declined to comment on the matter.In the previous meeting, a committee of MCG officials had been assigned the task of inspecting the repair works done by DLF in the previous meeting and subsequently, submit a report on the matter within 15 days.The MCG officials concerned said that they are yet to carry out the inspection. The committee has been given a week to carry out the inspection and file a report on the matter latest by February 26.“We have been waiting for the MCG takeover for the last five years. It is the first time that a timeline has been set for handing over the colony, which we are viewing as a positive development. We have seen MCG upgrade civic amenities in several other private colonies they have taken over in the past two years, and have been waiting for our turn,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Qutub Enclave residents’ welfare association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-sets-june-30-deadline-for-takeover-of-dlf-13-101613843594814.html
20-02-2021||Gurugram||Three held for operating fake call centre in Udyog Vihar||The chief minister’s Flying Squad on late Friday night raided a fake call centre, which had been operating out of a building in Udyog Vihar Phase-2 for the past four months. Three persons were arrested, including the call centre owner. The police also recovered data of US citizens from their possession. The police said there were around 35 telecallers, who were found making calls when they raided the call centre. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, crime investigation department (CID), said that on Friday night, they received a tip-off that a fake call centre is operational and that the owner was present at the spot. “When the team reached the building, a few of executives were seen walking down and having tea. We followed them and saw that the call centre was fully operational. When we asked the manager to explain the work, he got frightened and tried to mislead us,” he said. Yadav said the executives used to collect information, such as names, mobile numbers, e-mails and later sent them a voice mail. They trapped them after offering them a grant by the US government. “They used to ask victims to purchase Google cards, and then redeemed 100 to 500 dollars from their cards. Through this, they managed to dupe more than ₹50 lakh from over 600 people in the last four months,” he said. The Flying Squad has busted eight such call centres over the last six months and has also carried out a mapping of the areas from where illegal call centres have been found to be operating across the city. In the latest raid, the police seized two laptops, two pen drives, five mobile phones and hard disks from the call centre. A case under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document as genuine) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 43, 66D and 75 of the IT Act was registered at Cyber Crime police station in the wee hours of Saturday. The police said suspects did not possess any valid OSP(Other Service Providers) licences from the Department of Telecommunications or any other agreement or MoU related to their work. Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s Flying Squad, said that they had conducted a reconnaissance of the area and were sure of the operations of the fake call centre. “The executives used to make calls and inform the US citizens that the government was offering grant. They used to print a coloured forged cheque to show them the amount sanctioned and used to charge money from them. They used to target two kind of customers — first those who were keen on taking the grant and second who had a low credit score,” he said. Budhiraja said with the help of cyber police and local police station, a raid was carried out on the second floor of the building. “They had a script in front of them and were speaking in English in an American accent using their headphones. They were asking the customers to transfer the money to an account holder in US and later transfer it through a gift card,” he said. The police said the telecallers were explaining the victims that they were providing government grants like loans at zero percent interest. They used to offer them grants anywhere between $1,000 and $5,000 and duped them by deducting $100 to 500 dollars from their Google cards. The suspects were identified as Sarjeet Kumar (21) of Jhunjunu in Rajathan, who is the owner of the call centre, Kapil Dev (32) of Ahmedabad, and Bhudev Lohar (27) of Dungarpur in Rajasthan. The suspects, during questioning, revealed that they had duped more than 600 US citizens so far. The police said the suspects were produced before the local court on Saturday and were taken on a one-day police remand for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-held-for-operating-fake-call-centre-in-udyog-vihar-101613843594219.html

Strict biosecurity measures are being followed to protect the birds, workers and public from the disease. The zoo administration has made the decision on the basis of the surveillance report, opinion of the animal husbandry department, and the report of a state-level committee. During the closure, repair and maintenance works were completed to make them more attractive and safe for visitors. Chhatbir zoo officials had on January 5 closed the walk-in aviary amid bird flu fears after Himachal Pradesh became the fourth state to confirm an outbreak with 1,800 migratory birds, most of them bar-headed geese, being found dead in the Pong Dam Lake sanctuary and thousands of birds perishing in the poultry hub of Barwala in Haryana.The closure had come barely after a month when the zoo was reopened for public on December 10. It has been hit financially too, suffering losses of ₹5 crore since it earned revenues of an estimated ₹8 lakh a day before the lockdown.Authorities say it will take at least six months to recover from the lockdown losses .Chhatbir zoo, one of the largest in India, is spread over 505 acres of forest area in Mohali and is home to around 1,500 animal and avian species, including five adult tigers and three newborn cubs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bird-enclosures-reopen-at-mohali-s-chhatbir-zoo-101613842993239.html

"If any VIP wants to attend the shahi snaans (royal baths) then he has to attend it like a normal devotee.""Apart from this, to enhance coordination, it has been decided that every officer from state and Central agencies would be appointed as a nodal officer in Mahakumbh coordination committee.He also informed that the state police would also form a separate Facebook page on Mahakumbh to share relevant details with the devotees. Apart from that, they can also know more about the mega event through the state police's Twitter handle.The development has come after reports emerged that the four-month event would be cut down to only about a month from April 2-April 30 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, as per the Hindu calendar, it used to commence from Makar Sakranti in January till April 30.About a week ago, the state government issued the SOP for the Covid-19 pandemic to be followed during the Mahakumbh mela.Under the SOP, the state government made it mandatory for all the devotees to carry an RT-PCR negative test report of Covid-19 with a 72 hours validity. It also asked all the devotees to get a medical report from a competent medical authority on the lines of Amaranth Yatra before coming to attend the mega-event in Haridwar. The mela authorities would strictly heck the aforementioned reports, and no devotee shall be allowed to attend the event without the reports.Similarly, the state government would also discourage devotees aged above 65 years, pregnant women and children less than 10 years from attending the event. To ensure the health and safety of the health and frontline workers to be deployed in the Mahakumbh, the state would deploy only the vaccinated ones.All complainants to get receiving in police stationsState DGP Ashok Kumar on Saturday said that to ensure that all the complainants coming to lodge their complaints are being heard by the police stations concerned, the complainants will get a receiving after their complaints are lodged."In a bid to work towards more public-centric policing, all complainants will be getting a receiving.

However, the amended MV Act states that driving licence will be suspended for the second or subsequent offence in case of speeding.Covers all challans issued after Dec 2019All traffic challans that were issued after the December 2019 notification will fall under this criterion. Over 30,000 speeding challans were issued in 2020 after the traffic police acquired three automatic number plate recognition systems. Drivers who were issued e-challans using these machines won’t have their licences suspended if it was their first offence and they haven’t paid the fine yet.Senior superintendent of police (traffic) Manisha Chaudhary said: “We will inform RLAs to revoke the suspension of licence for the first-time speeding offence since the date of notification of the Amended MV Act.”The traffic police only recommends licence suspension, which is executed by the Registering and Licensing Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-licence-suspension-on-first-speeding-challan-in-chandigarh-101613841673343.html

According to the data presented before the state steering committee on Friday, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, continues to lag behind with just 25% coverage so far.Even the region’s premier health institute, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, has been able to inoculate just 31% of its workers. Frontline workers associated with the Chandigarh health department have been the most forthcoming, as 46% of them have got the first dose.Meanwhile, frontline workers from police, municipal corporation and other departments have also shown reluctance to take the shot, with just 15.5% covered since the drive to inoculate them began on February 3.“The drive for the next group will begin in March, and it is unlikely the health workers will be provided with more chances (to get the free vaccine) after February 25. The same stands true for frontline workers from other departments, for whom the mop up rounds will end in the first week of March,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, UT health department.Dr Kang said with the number of Covid-19 cases seeing a spike in some parts of the country, it is important for the reluctant workers to come forward.“Sufficient immunity will be generated only after two months from the date of first dose, and thus it is important that we achieve maximum coverage. It will help us weaken the second wave of the pandemic. The onus lies on the workers,” she said.The administration this week had expanded the network to inoculate more people with the number of people getting the jab touching 1,101 on Saturday. The daily inoculation capacity also touched around 5,400, which was 500 when the drive began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/66-health-workers-skip-covid-vaccine-in-chandigarh-101613841374076.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||Govt, states should come together to set up manufacturing hubs across India: Delhi CM Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Saturday stressed the need for creating manufacturing hubs across the country, and said if it is pursued on war footing, India can leave China behind in the sector, a Delhi government statement said.Speaking virtually at the sixth Governing Council meeting of Niti Aayog, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he also said that attention was not paid to the manufacturing sector in the country over the last 70 years, enabling China to capture local markets, he said."We saw how China has been challenging us on the border, and on the other hand, it has captured our markets and Chinese products are replacing Indian products on a large scale. If we all work together, India can overtake China in manufacturing," he asserted in the meeting.Kejriwal suggested large-scale creation of manufacturing hubs across the country with facilities and tax benefits for production of cost-effective goods, the statement said."The Central and state governments should come together to build manufacturing hubs across the country, to provide facilities, and give tax breaks to MSMEs, manufacturers, and industrialists, for import substitutes and exports," he said."This will help them make products that are cheaper than those made in China and create jobs. This will also help us in leaving China behind in the field of manufacturing and the growth of India's GDP," he said.He also supported favouring small and medium industries in the country. The youths in the country have new ideas and plenty of energy and they should be provided facilities and capital to start businesses, Kejriwal said at the meeting. The Delhi Chief Minister stressed that it is necessary to "aggressively pursue" manufacturing for India's economic progress, creation of jobs, and GDP growth."In the last 70 years, our country has never given importance to the manufacturing sector, as a result of which people are leaving the manufacturing sector and are moving towards the trading and service sectors. Our country is lagging behind in the manufacturing sector," he said. In the last one year, Covid-19 pandemic "hugely" affected the manufacturing sector and many jobs were lost, he claimed."We need to aggressively promote start-ups. It will help us in creating a huge number of jobs in the country." Citing his IIT background, Kejriwal said back then a lot of people used to go outside the country after studying in IITs. "This trend has declined in the last 10-15 years, and our youths want to stay in India and start their own business. If the Central and state governments come together and provide facilities to our youth, we will have a huge contribution to the progress of the nation," he said.He expressed hope that all the stakeholders will take a resolve towards expanding the manufacturing sector in India, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-states-should-come-together-to-set-up-manufacturing-hubs-across-india-cm-101613840550842.html
20-02-2021||Patna||One nation, one rate: Nitish Kumar pushes for uniform power rates for all states||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has mooted the idea of “One Nation, One Rate” on electricity supplied to states by the Central government power plants.Speaking at the governing council meeting of the Niti Aayog on Saturday, Kumar said different rates were charged from states on power supplied from the Central government’s power plants. “We purchase very costly power, as a result of which, the state government has to give more subsidy to provide cheap power to consumers. There should be a uniform rate. It will be good if a uniform policy for the purchase of power is implemented,” he said.Bihar has been raising the demand for uniform power rates for a few years.Kumar said power consumption in the state had increased from 700 MW in 2006 to 5932 MW in June 2020. “The state is paying ₹5,000 crore as subsidy to the people.”Also read: Military commanders discuss further disengagement in eastern LadakhThe chief minister also proposed an increase in the credit deposit ratio. “Bihar’s credit-deposit ratio is 36.1 per cent against the national average of 76.5 per cent which is 100 per cent in some states. The state deposits ₹3.75 lakh crore in banks, which provide only ₹1.35 lakh crore as loans. The money deposited in banks from states like Bihar goes to the developed states,” he said and suggested the opening of banks in every panchayat.“We are ready to provide Panchayat Sarkar Bhavan for the opening of banks. If industries are to be promoted in the state, there is a need to look into these basic issues,” he said.Kumar said the state had made its policy to promote industrialisation. “Bihar is a landlocked state. In 2011 we had demanded that a facility of port must be provided in Odisha which will help us send products from Bihar. We have placed this proposal several times and this needs attention once again,” said Kumar.Hailing the decision of production of ethanol, he said this would provide an alternative source of energy and reduce dependence on petrol and diesel. The chief minister also welcomed the Centre’s decision to install prepaid metres.“Bihar has already started the project. It will help check misuse of power, which harms the environment,” he said.Kumar, once again, supported the three farm bills and said these laws were in the interest of farmers. “The Niti Aayog had earlier brought the proposal to amend the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act. In Bihar, it was abolished in 2006 and now the procurement has increased. Last year, the procurement of paddy was 20 lakh metric tonnes and till Friday, the procurement of paddy was 32.89 lakh metric tonnes this year,” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/one-nation-one-rate-nitish-kumar-pushes-for-uniform-power-rates-for-all-states-101613839855240.html

She regretted that marginalization by society has forced the community to beg or indulge in sex work.She also explained about the need for a comprehensive scheme or a policy by the government to support transgenders to enable them to be part of the mainstream in society.Simran, one of the representatives of the transgender community, said lack of education and accessibility to employment was forcing transgenders to beg on the streets and they were subjected to harassment on the streets.Other transgender representatives – Imtiyaz, Chandramukhi, Vyjyanti Mogli and Asifa highlighted various other problems faced by the community such as inability to find houses to rent, intimate partner violence and intra-community violence.Responding to various suggestions at the meeting, the Cyberabad police commissioner announced that an exclusive “Transgender Desk” would be created at the Cyberabad Commissionerate which will address the grievances of transgenders. He promised to take their issues to the government from time to time to find a solution.Sajjannar, however, warned the transgender community against involvement in any illegal activities or trouble the public by way of harassment. He also requested them to act within the framework of the law and reiterated that no form of violence would be tolerated.“If any transgender is involved in illegal activities, the police will take stringent action as per law,” he said and requested the public to Dial 100 or report on WhatsApp number 9490617444, if there is any issue regarding transgenders.Apart from the commissioner, several senior police officials including deputy commissioner of police Shamshabad N Prakash Reddy, Cyberabad traffic deputy commissioner of police S M Vijay Kumar and deputy commissioner of police (women and child safety) C Anasuya took part in the interaction with the transgenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cyberabad-police-to-get-exclusive-desk-to-resolve-issues-of-transgenders-101613832630276.html

The pleas noted that the Supreme Court had on January 13 directed the government to facilitate the return of the acquitted foreigners to their respective countries.While acquitting the foreigners from 14 countries of all charges in December last year, the court had said the prosecution has failed to prove the presence of the accused at the Markaz premises during from March 12 to April 1.The court had further said in its order that as per the list of evacuees, none of the accused was having Covid­-19 symptoms and hence there was no question of any negligent act on their part, which to their knowledge or belief was likely to spread infection.“It is beyond comprehension of the court, as to how, Investigating Officer (IO) could have identified 952 foreign nationals out of 2,343 persons, who as per Station House Officer, were found flouting the guidelines, without any Test Identification Parade, but on the basis of the list provided by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India,” it had said.

In his letter, Naik said that the move was against the spirit of the Constitution and requested him to maintain the status quo in the bordering villages.Alleging illegal conduct of elections by Andhra Pradesh in the three villages of Kotia gram panchayat in Koraput district of Odisha, Naik alleged that the Vizianagaram district administration not only conducted elections in Kotia of Koraput but also tried to hold polls in some villages of Rayagada district.He also alleged that the Srikakulam administration tried to conduct polls in some villages of Ganjam and Gajapati districts and Vishakapatnam administration in some villages of Malkangiri.“This is not only against the spirit of the Constitution but also against the spirit of the federal structure of the country. The activities of Andhra Government are going against the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling in 1968 to maintain the status quo,” Naik wrote in the letter, adding that it was a grave constitutional crisis.Also read: Over 5,000 Covid-19 variants in India - Here are more transmissible ones"In the year 1942, in the joint survey of Odisha, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, seven villages of Kotia Gram Panchayat - Turia, Barabandha, Talakanti, Gumelpadara, Mathalamba, Suliamari, and Katraguda under Patangi block - were recorded as the revenue villages and revenue was collected accordingly by the government of Odisha. But as per the above notification of the Government of India, it is clear that these villages belong to Odisha. These villages were part of Kotia Gramapanchayat, Pottangi Block, Koraput District since independence. How can your government claim some villages of a panchayat as their land," he asked.Naik said the holding of panchayat polls in Odisha villages showed the expansionist mindset of Andhra Pradesh. "Please look into this. Andhra and Odisha have a very strong cultural relationship for thousands of years. We should carry forward our relationship not fighting for the lands," he said.In the first hearing on the contempt of court petition filed by Odisha in the Supreme Court on Friday, the Odisha government sought a four weeks’ adjournment to reply to the submissions of the Andhra Pradesh government. The Andhra Pradesh government in its affidavit before the SC said that three villages – Ganjaybadra, Pattuchennuru and Paguluchennuru – fall under Araku parliamentary constituency and Saluru Assembly constituency of Andhra Pradesh. Lok Sabha and Assembly elections have been conducted by Andhra Pradesh in the villages since 1952 while panchayat polls by the AP government were held in the villages in 2006 and 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-leader-of-opposition-writes-to-andhra-cm-on-bordering-villages-101613836101949.html

Under the scheme, employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic pay along with dearness allowances and the state government is required to make a matching contribution.As per the CAG audit report on state finances for the year ended 31 March 2019, the state government collected ₹86.74 crore from employees as a contribution towards the NPS and contributed only ₹58.17 crore as its share towards the scheme. Therefore, failing to discharge its statutory liability as it could not contribute ₹28.57 crore as its matching share under the NPS.Also read: Maharashtra records 6,281 Covid-19 cases; highest spike in Mumbai since DecemberFurther, the report noted that against a total collected fund of ₹144.91 crore, the state government transferred ₹111.47 crore only to the designated authority, the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), failing to transfer ₹33.44 crore to the NSDL for further investment as per the provisions of the scheme.“Thus, there was a short transfer of ₹62.01 crore ( ₹33.44 crore not transferred and ₹28.57 crore short contribution) to the NSDL and the current liability stands deferred to future year(s),” the CAG report said.The audit further revealed that the state government has created interest liability on the amount not transferred to the NSDL, incorrectly used the funds that belong to its employees and created uncertainty in respect of benefits due to the employees, while affecting the avoidable financial liability of the government in future and thereby leading to a possible failure of the scheme itself.The CAG underlined that the state government should ensure that employees’ contributions are fully deducted, fully matched by the government’s contributions, and fully transferred to the designated authority/trustee bank on time to avoid interest liability.The CAG report was tabled in the state assembly on the last day of the budget session on February 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nagaland-government-wrongly-used-funds-belonging-to-employees-cag-report-101613833863135.html
20-02-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: “My favourite theatre guru asked me to sing in his class!”||While I was designing the structure of a workshop I was supposed to conduct, I realised that most of the things I was going to talk about or teach were taught to me by one teacher! I have attended workshops by Indian and foreign “theatrewallahs”, but the one that has stayed with me the longest was that by the late Pandit Satyadev Dubey. The first-ever workshop that I attended was by the late Chetan Datar. He was an excellent writer and director and was also responsible for the resurgence of the experimental theatre group – Awishkaar. I was probably the youngest in that workshop and was a part of it only because I was tagging along with my college seniors. It was a weeklong workshop and Chetan must have mentioned Dubeyji at least once every day. When I asked my seniors who this person was I was told that most of the actors and directors working in Pune or Mumbai have been trained by Dubeyji directly or indirectly. I was intrigued to know who this person that my first drama teacher was speaking so highly of is!I got that chance after two years. Dubeyji was slated to come to Pune to conduct a workshop in May 2005. He was going to teach again after many years and the moment I heard about this, I registered myself. All the participants were given a patch in Hindi written by Dubeyji himself. It was about how almost every young person in India wants to be an actor. Very briefly it also underlines what all is at stake for a person who is seriously thinking of becoming an actor. It’s pretty famous in theatre circles. We were asked to memorise that article. The technique to memorise it was given in the article itself and it was pretty simple. Read the article in front of a mirror at least two hundred times (“at least” being the key word here).As luck would have it, an entrance exam I was preparing for a year was scheduled on the first day of the workshop. In a different city! I had no choice but to miss the ever important first day. Honestly, I wouldn’t have missed it had it been my choice, but at that age most of your decisions are taken by your elders. Anyway, the next day I went to the workshop fully prepared that I might be thrown out and it could end up being my last day there. I had heard that Dubeyji was extremely strict and was capable of throwing the choicest of words at his students.I had gotten all the updates of the first day from a friend who was attending the workshop. It had helped that I had attended Chetan’s workshop earlier because most of the exercises were similar. I had indirectly been trained by Dubeyji.The next day I sat with all the students. There were about thirty of us. And then I saw him for the first time! With grey, long hair and clean-shaven wearing light blue jeans and plain black kurta, and bushy eyebrows over an extremely intense gaze. He looked at all of us with that gaze and it stopped at me. “Get up,” he said. I did as I was ordered. “You are new!” I nodded. “Why are you new?” Other participants sniggered a little. I started speaking, but just after I had uttered my first word, he gestured me to stop. I thought that was the cue where he will throw me out. He said, “Breathe before you talk! It helps to speak louder. Remember that, always. Before saying any dialogue, your first action should be to breathe. Always remember to breathe!” I just realised that I had gotten my first lesson! I took a deep breath and told him about my exam. He was looking directly in my eyes the whole time and I tried not to avert his gaze. After I was done he took a long pause and simply asked “Can you sing? I want to end our daily sessions with some music.” “I sing. But I don’t know if you will like it,” I replied honestly. Now everyone sniggered openly. Even he gave the faintest of smiles and to everyone’s surprise, especially mine, told me to sit down. I couldn’t believe my luck! I was finally going to be Dubeyji’s student!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-my-favourite-theatre-guru-asked-me-to-sing-in-his-class-101613831951812.html
20-02-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka releases guidelines for travellers from Maharashtra: All you need to know||The Karnataka government on Saturday released a set of guidelines with regard to people arriving in the state from Maharashtra. This comes in the backdrop of a sudden spike in Maharashtra’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caseload. More than 6,000 cases (6,281 to be exact) of Covid-19 were reported in Maharashtra for second consecutive day on Saturday, according to state government's health bulletin. The worst-affected districts are Amravati, Pune and Nagpur.The new guidelines - majorly focusing on students - are also applicable for all other people that arrive from the western state to Karnataka. Earlier in the week, two Covid-19 clusters had emerged in Karnataka's capital Bengaluru which led to fears of emergence of another wave in the state. The state government then had only issued guidelines with respect to travellers coming in from Kerala. However, the guidelines have now been extended to include visitors from Maharashtra as well.Also Read| Maharashtra records 6,281 Covid-19 cases; highest spike in Mumbai since DecemberOne of the primary requirements under the guidelines issued by BS Yediyurappa-led Karnataka government is that people from Maharashtra will be required to produce a negative RT-PCR test report which is not older than 72 hours if they want to enter the state. Strict Covid-19 norms such as social distancing, wearing of masks, hand sanitising among others have to be ensured by colleges, hotels and other complexes.Here is a look at what measures will have to be undertaken by those coming into Karnataka from Maharashtra:1. If there are five or more coronavirus disease cases found in hostels - boarding or residential - and educational institutes, such places would be declared as containment zones by the local health authorities and special surveillance measures will be enforced. After seven days of notifying the area as a containment zone, RT-PCR tests will be done on students and staff members again.2. The state government said that it is very important to ensure strict enforcement of all Covid-related precautions such as social distancing, wearing face masks or coverings, usage of hand sanitizers among others in hostels and educational institutes. In case of any lapses, the heads of such institutes will be held responsible.3. All those arriving in the state through buses/flights/trains/personal transport will be compulsorily required to produce a negative RT-PCR test report which is not older than 72 hours. For those arriving by flights, the report needs to be checked by the airline staff. For bus travel, tickets will be provided upon production of the test report or it will be checked by bus conductor while boarding for those who booked tickets online. The TTEs will check the report for those travelling in trains. With regard to personal transport, random checking of the testing report will be done at toll gates or entry point, the circular stated.4. People arriving from Maharashtra will be asked to show the negative RT-PCR test report which is not older than 72 hours when they are checking into resorts, hostels, home stays etc. The owners of all such complexes should ensure that the reports are shown.5. For all hostels and colleges, students are not permitted to have any visitors/relatives without obtaining express permission from Covid nodal officers. The students are also required to compulsorily produce negative test reports not less than 72 hours each time they return from Maharashtra and till the overall situation improves. Those residing in hostels should avoid frequent travel to their native places unless there is a justifiable reason.6. The rule of producing a negative RT-PCR test report which is not older than 72 hours is also applied to all short term travellers from Maharashtra. This report will be valid for seven days and travellers are requested to self- monitor their health for fourteen days and seek immediate medical help and Covid tests in case of any respiratory symptoms.7. Employees from Maharashtra working in multinational companies (MNCs), resorts, hotels etc. in Karnataka should get the tests done at their own costs.8. All colleges and other residential facilities that are accommodating people from Maharashtra have to strengthen their Covid-19 surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-releases-guidelines-for-travellers-from-maharashtra-all-you-need-to-know-101613830293120.html

With this, the total number of weapons recovered from the accused has climbed to three. A SIT member, on the condition of anonymity, said that the remand period of the accused has been extended to five more days. “We have also arrested Sukhvinder’s friend, Manoj Kumar, who is a resident of Uttar Pradesh and had provided him the weapons,” the official said.He added that Manoj Kumar is currently undergoing treatment at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences and will be interrogated soon to extract more evidence against the main accused. The SIT member also revealed that the accused, Sukhvinder, is continuously changing his statements during interrogation.On Friday, the family members of the victims had demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the matter.Rohtak superintendent of police (SP) Rahul Sharma said he has written to the district and sessions court judge to move the case into a fast-track court. “We have sent the clothes worn by the accused during crime to a forensic lab to see if the blood on his clothes matches with that of the victims. We have started a speedy probe and will demand strict punishment for the accused,” the SP added.A SIT member had earlier revealed that Sukhvinder first killed coach Pradeep Malik and then proceeded to kill coaches Manoj Kumar, Satish Dalal, Manoj’s wife Sakshi and national-level wrestler Pooja. He allegedly killed the three coaches in one room and the two women in another and locked the gates. “After shooting five people dead, Sukhvinder brought Manoj and Sakshi’s three-year-old son, who was playing with his cousin on the ground floor, to the room where his mother and Pooja were killed and shot him in the head,” the official said.

The JCP, which comprises a gallery with a capacity to accommodate nearly 30,000 spectators to witness the flag lowering ceremony at the zero line of India and Pakistan border, was closed for the spectators in the first week of March 2020. “There has been no plan so far for allowing spectators at the retreat ceremony. Only 100 to 200 spectators witness the Beating Retreat ceremony on the India-Bangladesh border. However, the count of spectators at Attari touches up to 30,000. We will follow the ministry of home affairs and health department guidelines for allowing visitors,” said a senior BSF official. Another official posted at the JCP said, “Due to the restrictions, only flag-lowering ceremony is being performed every evening. The daily military drill on our side is also not taking place.” Pakistan had re-opened its gallery for the spectators in October 2020, said the official posted at the JCP. On the occasion of the Republic Day, a joint parade was held with the rangers at the border after around nine months. Students of various colleges had also organised a cultural programme at the JCP. Traders, vendors waiting with bated breath Due to the closure of the JCP, thousands of traders and small vendors have been hit hard and they demand early re-opening of the gallery. Jagdish Singh (56), who runs a dhaba at the Attari border for the last one decade, has been struggling to make ends meet. He said his dhaba is closed since April 2020. “Five workers at my dhaba now pull rickshaw. Our business was totally dependent on Attari visitors,” he said. Several restaurants, vendors selling patriotic accouterments near the border, hotel and taxi owners have also suffered a lot. Mandeep Singh, a cab driver in Amritsar, said, “More than 10,000 cab drivers have been hit and we are waiting for the spectators.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-decision-yet-on-visitors-at-attari-wagah-retreat-ceremony-101613829434742.html

20-02-2021||Jaipur||Prices of premium petrol cross ₹100 in 19 districts of Rajasthan||The rise in petrol prices is taking a toll on consumers' pockets in Rajasthan with the price of premium petrol crossing ₹100 across 19 districts.These districts include Alwar, Sri Ganganagar, Bikaner, Hanumangarh, Sawai Madhopur, Banswara, Dungarpur, Sikar, Pali, Udaipur, Churu, Pratapgarh, Kota, Karauli, Rajsamand, Jhunjhunu, Jalore, Sirohi and Barmer.The highest rates of premium petrol amongst the above-mentioned district were recorded from Sri Ganganagar, where the price of a litre of petrol is at ₹103.59, followed Hanumangarh where it is selling for ₹102.95 per litre.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, in a social media post on Saturday, blamed the Central government for the rising prices of petrol.“Prices have been increasing continuously for the last 11 days. This is the result of the wrong economic policies of the Central government. Crude oil prices in the international market are currently half of that during the UPA regime but petrol-diesel prices have reached an all-time high,” he said.Also read: India, China hold 10th round of talks, focus on further disengagement in LadakhGehlot said that the central government has imposed excise duty of ₹32.90 on petrol and ₹31.80 per litre on diesel. He said during the UPA government in 2014, there was an excise duty of only ₹9.20 on petrol and just ₹3.46 on diesel. The Modi government should reduce excise duty in the interest of the public without any delay.“Due to Covid, the state's economy has been badly affected and the state's revenue has decreased. But to give relief to the common people, the state government reduced VAT by 2 per cent in the last month itself. Instead of giving any such relief, the Modi government is increasing the prices of petrol and diesel every day,” the CM said.He further said that some people are spreading the rumour that the Rajasthan government has imposed the highest tax on petrol, so the prices are high here. Tax on petrol in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh is higher than in Rajasthan. Hence, the price of petrol in Jaipur is less than in Bhopal.“Rajasthan has the highest VAT and the state government should reduce it and give relive to common people. Madhya Pradesh is behind Rajasthan in terms of charging different type of duties. The CM is blaming the Center for the failure of the state government,” said Ramlal Sharma, chief spokesperson, Rajasthan BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/prices-of-premium-petrol-cross-rs-100-in-19-districts-of-rajasthan-101613826590504.html
20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Consult state in fixing Covid vaccine priorities: Punjab CM to Centre||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday urged the Centre to consult the state before fixing priorities for Covid-19 vaccination, as it is a matter involving the entire population. With the portal created by the Government of India for the registration of health care and frontline workers frozen, several such workers of the state willing for vaccination registration have been left behind, he said, calling upon the Centre to allow the entry of such workers to improve the status of vaccination drive. In his speech at the Niti Aayog meeting, the chief minister also requested the Centre to allow 100% use of available SDRF towards expenditure for Covid management, instead of the present ceiling of 50%. Further, in the event of the SDRF yearly budget being exceeded due to enhanced expenditure on Covid-related matters, the state may also be allowed to use previous years’ funds, he suggested. Captain Amarinder urged the Centre to provide immediate financial assistance of at least ₹300 crore to upgrade health infrastructure, equipment and other healthcare needs (medicines and consumables) in view of the pandemic. The chief minister requested the Centre to consider the Gurdaspur medical college project on priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/consult-state-in-fixing-covid-vaccine-priorities-punjab-cm-to-centre-101613823852069.html

The rate of diesel has also gone up by ₹0.38 and has reached ₹86.36 per litre.In Pune fuel, prices have been steadily increasing for the last 12 days. If the trend continues regular petrol will also cross the mark of ₹100 per litre by early next week, a worrying sign for transporters.“Premium petrol has crossed the mark of ₹100 per litre and regular petrol will also follow these rates it seems. Common people have to suffer because of this,” said Baba Shinde, a member of the transporter association.“In transport business we mostly use diesel. The diesel prices have also reached to record the highest level. Our business is not even sustainable now. We have written to the Central government. Otherwise, we will have to give the call of a strike,” he said.Vivek Velankar, RTI activist and president, Sajag Nagrik Manch, pointed out that the fuel prices for airplanes are far less than the prices at which commoners are purchasing the fuel.“Central government has negligible taxes and cess on the aviation industry fuel. As a result fuel of an airplanes is 40 per cent cheaper than the fuel of a truck. Why common man has to pay more? Why the taxes and cess for development are imposed on only common people? Are those who travel by planes, poorer than the common people and transporters?,”he said.Reacting to increasing fuel prices, Shiv Sena Member of Parliament Sanjay Raut took a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government saying not just others, but party’s voters too are affected by higher rates.“If the BJP voters across the country are also affected by increasing fuel prices, at least government should consider reducing the taxes on it,” he said.Normal petrol price touches ₹99.11 per litre in ParbhaniMaharashtra’s Parbhani town in Marathwada region, meanwhile, has the highest prices of fuel in the state. Regular petrol has reached ₹99.11 per litre in Parbhani and the rate of power petrol is ₹102 per litre.

Chouhan asked, and the people replied, "Narmadapuram!"The chief minister then said, "We are now sending a proposal to the Centre to change the name of Hoshangabad as Narmadapuram."The state government will not allow "cement-concrete structures" to be built along the Narmada river, he said, adding that sewage treatment plants are also being constructed in the cities located on its banks.Meanwhile, BJP workers, led by protem Assembly Speaker Rameshwar Sharma, expressed happiness over Chouhan's announcement and burst firecrackers on Saturday morning.Sharma had earlier made the demand to change the name of Hoshangabad."This is a historic moment. Narmada is the lifeline of Madhya Pradesh. Hoshangabad was so far named after an attacker Hoshang Shah, but will be known after the lifeline Maa Narmada, which is a matter of happiness. I thank the CM for making this announcement by respecting the public sentiments," he said.State BJP president VD Sharma and several other leaders also thanked the chief minister for the decision.However, state Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta termed the announcement as the ruling BJP's ploy to divert the attention of people from important issues like inflation and rising prices of fuel."BJP only changed the names related to the Mughals, but not of those linked to the British rulers. Why the nameof Minto Hall (old Vidhan Sabha building) has not been changed? This is just to divert the attention.

20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM urges PM to redress farmers’ grievances urgently||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure the urgent resolution of the farm agitation “to the satisfaction of the protesting farmers by addressing all their grievances”. The chief minister, through his speech submitted for the virtual meeting of the Niti Aayog, reiterated his government’s stand that agriculture is a state subject and law-making on it should be left to the states in the true spirit of “cooperative federalism” in the Constitution. In this context, he pointed to the state amendments passed to the central legislation by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha in October 2020. Captain Amarinder could not attend the virtual meeting as he was indisposed. The chief minister said any reform that is sought to be introduced in a sector subsuming almost 60% of the country’s workforce must be done only through a process of extensive consultation with all stakeholders, of which Punjab is key, being at the forefront of ensuring food security. Citing fears among farmers of the state that the minimum support price-based procurement regime through Food Corporation of India (or agencies on its behalf), introduced as part of food security measures in the 1960s, may be discontinued in view of the Shanta Kumar Committee Report of 2015, the chief minister urged the Government if India to decisively dispel any such impression “to instil proper confidence in the farmers of the state”. The chief minister reiterated the state government’s demand for bonus of ₹100 per quintal of paddy procured as straw management compensation, which can be used for purchase or rental of new equipment, attaining skills for efficient use, and to reduce cost of operation and maintenance. He requested the GoI to provide ₹5 crore per MW financial support for biomass power projects and ₹3.5 crore per MW for biomass solar hybrid projects to the state as viability gap fund (VGF) to help alleviate the effects of paddy straw burning through ex-situ utilisation of paddy straw with good returns to farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-urges-pm-to-redress-farmers-grievances-urgently-101613818091457.html

The area is home to over five lakh residents and is one of the most important business hubs of eastern Pune which sees a large number of visitors from different parts of the city. Due to lack of public toilets, people are seen utilising abandoned plots, NIBM reserve forest areas, secluded spots near residential societies, Bhairoba nullah open area as alternatives to toilets. NIBM area does not have a single public toilet facility for the citizens while Wanowrie has one near Bhairoba nullah and it is covered with a tin sheet and locked out for the general public.NIBM residents visiting marketplaces expressed their disappointment with the Pune Municipal Corporation of its failure in erecting public toilets. Sanjay Dabhade, a visitor, said, “We come here for work daily but whenever there is a need to use a toilet, we find it difficult as there is no facility in the area. We are forced to use open spaces and even the forest area. There is no option left for the citizens as PMC is least bothered or concerned about the people.”“The citizens are not hygienic at all,” notes writer Abrar H Rashid who is a resident of NIBM area . “Both - the Cantonment Board and the PMC - do not pay heed to the fact that urinals are a necessity of life. MG road has got only two urinals. East Street has none. The well-known NIBM has none. Neighbouring Salunkhe Vihar road has only one. How does the government expect India to be clean when the authorities themselves are not bothered about it?” he questioned.Social worker Danish Khan, a resident of Imperial Society in Mohammadwadi, said, “Neither NIBM nor Mohammadwadi area has public toilets. It is essential that the PMC sets up public toilets as citizens don’t have any such facility here. The reserve forest area plot near NIBM main gate and the entire surroundings, the spot opposite Voyage to the stars building along NIBM annexe connecting road, entire Mohammadwadi and parts of Salunke Vihar are without a public toilet. We need robust toilet blocks which are citizen and environment-friendly. The citizens want toilet facilities and the PMC must provide it to them as it is their right.” Additional commissioner Madhav Jagtap, said, “If there is no toilet in any area then it has to be proposed and where that has to be constructed will be decided by the ward office as citizens do have objections. Ward office of Wanowrie will be directed to open the locked public toilet.”Public sanitation systemAccording to the ease of index report published by the government of India in August 2018, Pune was adjudged as the most liveable city in the country, but the city suffered from like poor public sanitation system especially lack of public toilets.The city with a population of more than 44 lakh, currently has only one toilet for every 244 persons in the city. As per international standards it should be one per 50 for a city.According to the information provided by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials, there are about 1,332 public toilets within PMC limits with more than 18, 000 toilet seats for both men and women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lack-of-public-sanitation-irks-nibm-residents-101613817672151.html

The incident came to light on Saturday when the septuagenarian’s other son, who lived nearby went to his father’s house to enquire about him. The elderly farmer’s son said that his father owned only one acre in the village. He said his father had taken loan from a co-operative society which he was unable to repay, and this kept him under stress. In the two suicide notes, the father and son mentioned the debt and blamed the Captain Amarinder Singh government for not waiving farmers’ loans despite promising to do so. They wrote that the Centre was ruining farmers and they were ending their lives in protest. “Farmers have spent the winter on Delhi borders, but the government is not listening. We see their plight on TV channels and read about them in newspapers. We are ending our lives in protest,” wrote the elderly farmer.

20-02-2021||Delhi||#ShwetaYourMicIsOn: DU students react to bloopers in online classes||Audio bloopers have become a common error in most virtual interactions, but how lethal can these be when in an online classroom, that too in Delhi University, can be witnessed in the recent trending #ShwetaYourMicIsOn. Herein, a girl named Shweta accidentally shared intimate details about her friend’s love life, during an online college class. The recording made way to social media, and the trend even caught singer Shweta Pandit by surprise, when the latter saw her name trending worldwide! Well, in a class that has multiple students and a single teacher figuring out how to mute one student from a bunch of faceless DPs, this is what happens and leaves everyone in splits, so much so that the incident becomes a social media sensation and even inspired meme machines to flood the internet! “There have been many instances in campus where students don’t realise that their mic is on, and the entire class gets to hear whatever they talk to other people at home or to someone on another call, says Tejas Malhotra, a student of Sri Aurobindo College, adding, “Many a times a student is recorded shouting at their family members to keep their voice down and in the process is accidentally heard yelling by the entire class. Now all this has in fact become common for us, but we still get a good laugh from time to time and this time it was due to #Shweta. Cooker ki seetiyan while providing background music while giving answers are quite often met with a funny jab from a co-student asking aaj khaane mein rajma ban rahe hain kya?” The viral audio cum video and memes on #Shweta’s oops moment have left almost all Shweta’s in colleges across the city feeling hassled and embarrassed. “I’ve a friend named Shweta, and she’s so upset since this incident has taken place because a lot of her classmates have called her up to check if she’s the one whose conversation has gone viral on social media,” says Aatika Choudhary, a student of Vivekananda College, adding, “I on my part can feel for her, but can’t help laugh about the whole thing because such audio bloopers have become common in online classes. Honestly, I don’t even know if this one is a fake video or a real one, but I can imagine how embarrassing it would be for the real Shweta. I just don’t know why her classmates didn’t call her a little early and stop this from becoming major! I hope she has someone to counsel her after the entire incident because such moments can have varied effects on people... like I for now check four times if my mic is on or off!” Youngsters are often quite conscious about their impression on others. So what happens in case of such an eventually? Does it have the potential to become a stressor? “I think so. But take it from a senior, these things happen on campus life. Try not to take it too seriously. Because we are on an online campus, and the most embarrassing thing is certainly a viral audio blooper. When we use to be in offline campus, such incidents and fights and rivalry between college boys kept happening as a part and parcel of college life. So today it seems big, but a few years down the lane, this could become a college memory for keepsakes,” smiles Mukul Malik, another student of Sri Aurobindo College.“Pehle Sonali ke naam ka audio bhi aise hi viral hua tha, I remember. Ho jaata hai, theek hai na.... No point feeling embarrassed about it because it was neither Sonali’s mistake nor is Shweta’s. They genuinely didn’t realise that their mic was on,” opines Manish Mourya, of Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, sharing how it should be taken in one’s stride.He adds, “The best strategy to cope with such a thing is to ignore it. Of course becoming a meme doesn’t really help you to ignore and get on with life, but I think if the person can emotionally detach from the situation maybe they would be able to laugh along with others!” Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shwetayourmicison-du-students-react-to-bloopers-in-online-classes-101613809033993.html

20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Wanted for R-Day violence, gangster Lakha Sidhana calls rally at Punjab CM’s village||Wanted by Delhi Police for instigating violence during the farmers’ tractor rally at Red Fort on Republic Day, gangster-turned-social activist Lakhbir Singh, alias Lakha Sidhana, has called a rally in support of the farm agitation in Bathinda district’s Mehraj, the ancestral village of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, on February 23. In a Facebook video posted on Friday night, Sidhana urged people to gather in large numbers at the grain market in Mehraj, 35 km from the Bathinda district headquarters. He said farm union leaders should also stay united against the Centre to strengthen the fight against the three farm laws. Gangster hints at joining Mehraj rally on Tuesday A native of Sidhana village in Bathinda district, Lakha is on the run since January 26 and has hinted that he will join the rally on his home turf. Delhi Police had on February 14 announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for information on the whereabouts of Sidhana. Various teams of Delhi Police, along with the special cell, had conducted searches for the gangster across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR. Sidhana was last seen in Punjab when he had visited Moga on January 20 to garner support for the tractor rally on Republic Day. Bathinda range inspector general of police Jaskaran Singh said the district police have not received any communication about Sidhana. “I have learnt that a rally has been planned at Mehraj. It’s up to Delhi Police to arrest him, but the Bathinda police have hardly any role in it,” the IGP said. The 13-minute video appears to have been shot in a tent. Though there is no confirmation on when it was shot, Sidhana starts by congratulating supporters on ‘Maa Boli’ Day or International Mother Language Day that falls on February 21.Charged with murder, dabbled in politics Mehraj is a part of the Rampura Phul assembly segment from where Sidhana had unsuccessfully contested as a candidate of the People’s Party of Punjab (PPP) in 2012. The PPP was floated by state finance minister and Bathinda MLA Manpreet Singh Badal and later merged in the Congress. Sidhana was booked for murder, attempt to murder, loot and violation of the Arms Act. He was jailed several times between 2004 and 2017. During this duration, he also came in contact with politicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wanted-for-r-day-violence-gangster-lakha-sidhana-calls-rally-at-punjab-cm-s-village-101613802790506.html

He couldn’t have foreseen then that Covid-19 would make remote employees and migration of software engineers from the cities back to the villages the norm during the pandemic, but he did return with the vision of working from Tenkasi, and hiring and retaining local talent.In January, Vembu, 54 was awarded the Padma Shri, India’s fourth-highest civilian honour, in the trade and industry category. He is founder-CEO of Zoho Corporation, a cloud-based business software that provides online applications.The company says that its apps are used by more than 50 million people globally. Subsequently, in February, Vembu was appointed in an advisory role to the National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), led by National Security advisor Ajit Doval.Vembu spoke to HT on video from his village via one of his products- Zoho Meeting -- with birds constantly chirping in the background.“The peacocks here keep me up at night,” said Vembu, who runs a global business with offices across the world. “In fact, we had a meeting with our employees in the US, Brazil, Singapore and multiple locations in India just last night and it went flawlessly with fibre optic internet. The tools of remote working are getting better.”The company launched one during the pandemic -- Zoho Remotely. “The pandemic has accelerated remote working. We are going to open up more rural offices. The goal is to have smaller centres rather than have everyone come to Chennai.”Zoho has expanded its offices to 13 districts in Tamil Nadu, two in Kerala and one in Patna. It has about 9,000 employees around the world and 90% of that workforce is in rural centres in India. The Tenkasi office has 450 employees recruited within a 50 km radius.Often dressed in a traditional veshti, Vembu moves around on a cycle or his preferred electric auto, developed by a Coimbatore-based company, which cost ₹1.6 lakh.“It gives you freedom of mobility with minimal footprint,” says Vembu.An early riser, he walks to his farm and local tea shops in between his work and meetings. “ Ten minutes of traffic can get you tired. I cherish these open spaces and quietness the most working out of here,” he said.Vembu was born in Tamil Nadu’s Thanjavur district to a family of farmers and was the eldest of five siblings.“I studied in a Tamil medium school,” said Vembu who in 1989 graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras. With the help of a scholarship, he received an MS and PhD in electrical engineering from Princeton University, all the while knowing his future would be back in an Indian village.He worked as a wireless systems engineer at Qualcomm for two years and later founded AdventNet in 1996 with two of his brothers and friends. The company was later renamed Zoho.He says he should have come back home sooner. “I realised we were doing fancy mathematics to say something very simple. Spending time building business is far more valuable economically than fancy theories,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/54yrold-who-left-silicon-valley-for-tn-village-looks-to-nurture-local-talent-101613801067559.html
20-02-2021||Kolkata||Who is Pamela Goswami? BJP youth leader arrested with cocaine in Kolkata||Two leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) youth wing were arrested on Friday with 100 grams of cocaine from south Kolkata's upscale New Alipore area, police said. Among them were Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader Pamela Goswami and Prabir Kumar Dey. Another person Somnath Chatterjee, 26, was also held in connection with the seizure of about 90 grams of narcotic substance in Kolkata, reports said. Who is Pamela Goswami?Goswami is the state secretary of the BJYM, who actively posts updates on social media and shares pictures of party events being held across the state. She was along with her friend Dey in her car on Friday when both of them were nabbed, police said, adding that around 100 gm of cocaine "worth a few lakh of rupees" was found in her handbag and other parts of the car. The police claimed that the two had been purchasing drugs from a peddler in the New Alipore area and they had prior information about their visit on Friday following which they were intercepted at the spot. Women police personnel were also deployed to carry out the search and arrest."She was involved in drug trafficking for quite some time. Today, we got information that she, along with her supplier Prabir, was reaching the spot to hand over the drugs to the purchasers," a police officer told news agency PTI on Friday. A team of policemen in eight vehicles surrounded Goswami's car and apprehended her, the officer said. The BJP youth wing leader's security guard, who was inside the same vehicle, was also arrested, the officer added.Samik Bhattacharya, the BJP’s state spokesperson, however, said that Goswami may have been framed. “I have heard about it but we are yet to gather details. If she has really done something illegal, then the law will take its own course. But it could also be planted. The elections are near, and the model code of conduct is yet to be enforced. The police are now under the control of the chief minister. We also need to keep these in mind,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/who-is-pamela-goswami-bjp-youth-leader-arrested-with-cocaine-in-kolkata-101613800273452.html
20-02-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka cops put ink away as fingerprints go hi-tech||Even though Bengaluru is known as the technology capital of the country, police in the Silicon Valley of India was using the archaic method of using ink for taking fingerprints until two months ago. It is only in January this year that the state police launched a digital database of fingerprints and introduced software from Japan to record and compare fingerprints from a central database.More than 1,000 fingerprint scanners and proprietary software, costing approximately ₹1 lakh each, have been deployed at all police stations across the state. Inspector-General of Police, R Hitendra, who holds the additional charge of crime and technical services said this software will now enable the force to compare the fingerprints recovered from a crime scene without sending them to the police headquarters for manual verification.“In the earlier system, when a criminal is caught, his/her fingerprints were taken on a paper after applying ink on their fingers. This paper was then sent to the district headquarters following which the details are entered into a database,” Hitendra said.As the fingerprints were stored across each district headquarters, city police commissionerates or other nodal agencies, a police officer had to send them requests whenever they needed to compare a fingerprint.“In case the officials of a police station needed information on the set of fingerprints they found at a crime scene or from a person they arrested, they have to send the paper prints to one of these headquarters. These prints were matched with details in the database and a report was sent back. This was a time-consuming process,” the officer added.With the complete digitalisation of the database and the introduction of the new software, every police station now has access to fingerprint data.While explaining the latest process, the officer said that it is nowhere close to what is seen in pop culture. “Fingerprints are not verified by looking through a bunch of photos or graphs of the fingerprint patterns. To explain it in layman’s language, the patterns on each finger is given a number using a formula. The combination of the 10 digits for 10 fingers forms the unique id for each person,” he said. “Since a unique code is attached to each fingerprint, a criminal record of the person is attached to the data as well. Thus, a fingerprint and criminal background updated in any part of the state would be available to the police stations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cops-put-ink-away-as-fingerprints-go-hitech-101613798680352.html

20-02-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka looks to allay hesitancy as vaccination numbers stay low||The Karnataka government on Friday said that it has written to the Centre, seeking approval to inoculate at least 1,000 influential people like religious leaders, film actors, sports personalities, jurists and eminent journalists to mitigate the poor response to the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Bengaluru.The state government hopes that the measures, if approved, would help allay fears around the vaccination drive and encourage more to come forward in a state that has so far achieved around 57% of its target.“We are roping in some social influencers and people who can motivate. I have written to the Union government to allow us to inoculate around 1,000 people who can be influencers from various walks of life. These include people such as religious pontiffs, sports personalities, film stars, eminent jurists and also influential journalists,” Dr K Sudhakar, state’s minister for health and family welfare and medical education, told Hindustan Times.“I hope we will receive a favourable response,” he added, without naming any of the public figures that are likely to be roped in for the plan.The vaccination situation is particularly alarming in the state capital where the (first dose) coverage for healthcare workers is 36% and frontline workers is 24%, government data revealed. In fact, the coverage is the lowest in the state and when compared to 63.5% in Delhi and 70% in Mumbai.Out of 354,527 people authorities set as target for vaccination in the first dose, Bengaluru has inoculated only 117,985 of them. A total of 8,052 people have so far received the second dose of vaccination in the city, the data mentioned.In comparison, Gadag, about 387 km from Bengaluru, has managed to cover 83% of its population.A total of 626,752 people have taken the first and second dose of vaccine across the state as against a target of 1,106,889 people.The measures come as part of the strategy to increase vaccination coverage across Karnataka and Bengaluru, where responses have so far been poor overall over fears of developing complications.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the city’s civic body which is in-charge of the drive, has made all efforts to convince workers and even threatened to end free treatment if those in the list continued to evade the inoculation drive, but to little effect. “BBMP is not proactively involved and will be meeting them tomorrow (Saturday). There are some districts that are performing very well and some districts are below 25-30%. The collective responsibility should be on the district administration,” Sudhakar said.While Bengaluru, the state’s growth engine, had gone into lockdown much before the other states, restrictions here were also lifted sooner than elsewhere. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa, who had tested positive for the virus last year, had decided to lift the curbs to bring in revenues for the cash-starved state.“There are some reasons (for poor turnout) like apprehensions over the vaccine and misconceptions such as the beneficiaries cannot consume alcohol after vaccination. For many others, it is time constraints of not being available to take the dose among other reasons,” N Manjunath Prasad, the BBMP commissioner, said.He also said that there have been instructions that the government will not bear any Covid-19-related expenses for those who refuse to take the vaccine.Home to hundreds of large corporations, Bengaluru, like other large cities in the country, has encouraged companies to extend the work from home (WFH) policy to keep the crowd away from public space.However, politicians, irrespective of their parties, carried on with their large political rallies, weddings and other events, undeterred.Approximately 18 people developed serious complications after receiving the shot across the state, including at least three fatalities, according to government data.Ever since the first case was reported in Bengaluru on 8 March last year, there have been 403,236 cases so far, of which 394,583 have been cured.Bengaluru reported 209 cases on Friday out of the total 386 across the state. Four more people died in the city that accounts for 4,445 fatalities out of the total 12,287 across the state.Karnataka was one of the worst Covid-19 impacted states the whole of last year but later saw a drop in cases. But the fight against pandemic has been stymied in the vaccination drive over hesitancy and spread of false information, Sudhakar said. The state government has held meetings with district administrations to seek reasons for the low turnout and ways to overcome them, officials said.The state government has put in place measures to closely monitor people coming in from Kerala and Maharashtra among other places. Dr. R Ravindra from Bengaluru-based Suguna Hospital said technical glitches with the CoWIN app, launched by the government for the vaccination drive, has been a major reason behind inaccurate reports on coverage than reluctance. “This app (Covin) is not working properly. The names of a lot of people who took the first dose are not showing up as vaccinated and the (city) corporation has asked us not to administer the second dose to such people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-looks-to-allay-hesitancy-as-vaccination-numbers-stay-low-101613797664333.html

20-02-2021||Other||Will drop cases against anti-CAA protesters: TN CM||Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami on Friday announced that all cases against those who protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and violated Covid-19 lockdown restrictions would be withdrawn, continuing with his outreach efforts ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in the state.“A million cases filed during the lockdown period and 1500 cases filed during the anti-CAA protests will be withdrawn in public interest,” Palaniswami said. “Except for cases filed against specific serious offences, and for not allowing police personnel from discharging their duty, all other cases will be withdrawn.” A statement subsequently issued by the state government added that cases of violence or obtaining an e-pass fraudulently would continue to be investigated. Activists welcomed the state’s decision.During the anti-CAA protests, a case was filed against human rights activist and senior advocate of the Madras high court Sudha Ramalingam. “After students were attacked in Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, we held a candlelight vigil. Police stationed there shook hands with me for keeping the protest peaceful,” she said.“Months later I came to know that an FIR was filed and I was accused No. 1. It goes on to show how the entire police machinery and criminal law is being abused by the state to silence people. The CM and the politicians know that there is really no case here and when taken to trial, it will end up in acquittals. That’s why in most cases there is no charge sheet filed. It will be kept pending. One fine day it will be dropped and that’s nearer to the elections. It’s time we take cognisance that these were cases foisted by abusing the process of law,” she added.The state’s ruling AIADMK, which is fighting the elections with its ally the Bharatiya Janata Party, supported the CAA that fast-tracks Indian citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Christians and Buddhists from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanisation who entered India before December 31, 2014.The withdrawal of cases would also appear to be part of Palaniswami’s strategy to broadbase the AIADMK’s appeal, especially in the context of its alliance with the BJP.Palaniswami also announced on Friday that his government would consider withdrawing cases filed against people who protested against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) that were lodged between 2011 and 2014.The charges range from petty offences for unlawful assembly to sedition.“By withdrawing these cases the government has recognised that peaceful protests is a democratic right,” said Henry Tiphange, executive director of People’s Watch, a human rights NGO. “We had included this in our human rights manifesto which we submitted to all political parties in January. We demand cases to be withdrawn against all other protestors too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-drop-cases-against-anti-caa-protesters-tncm-101613779143603.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||All transport services to go digital by April, trials underway: Gahlot||Transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Friday said the Delhi government is working on an “ambitious project” of shifting all its transport services in the Capital online from April this year. Once commissioned, the project, which aims to decongest all the 13 regional transport offices (RTOs) of the city, will allow people to get important documents including renewal of driving licenses (DLs) or transfer of vehicle ownership from the comfort of their homes.Gahlot said the transformation to “faceless services” (online services) will be carried out in two phases. Once implemented, only the applicants seeking a learner’s license or permanent DL or vehicle fitness certificate will have to physically visit the RTOs to undergo various tests.“Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, this is the biggest reform package from the transport department that we have planned this year. Under the first phase, 12 services will be made 100% online. Trials and testing of the software is currently underway and we are planning a soft launch next week. The second phase will include 58 services. Our aim is to shift all transport services online from April 1,” he said.The Delhi government offers a total of 70 transport services for which currently only online appointment booking facility is available. After taking an appointment online, an applicant has to visit the RTO to get the documentation completed.The services that will be made completely online in the first phase include renewal of DL, duplicate DL, change of address in DL, transfer of registration certificate (RC) for resale vehicles and so on. In the second phase, services such as permit transfer, NOC for other states and yearly authorisation will be made online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-transport-services-to-go-digital-by-april-trials-underway-gahlot-101613771098102.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||No curbs, but must exercise caution: HC to TV channels||Leaked information that can influence the investigation cannot be disseminated, the Delhi high court said on Friday, while also refusing to restrain TV channels from reporting on the case related to the purported protests “toolkit” for which Bengaluru-based environmental activist Disha Ravi has been arrested.While protecting journalists and news organisations from revealing their sources, the bench asked them to check the authenticity of the information and not to sensationalise the issue.The order said that “leaked investigation material” should not be circulated to prejudice the probe.Justice Prathiba M Singh also said that the Delhi police can hold press briefings on its investigation in accordance to the guidelines laid in an Office Memorandum of April 1, 2010 as long as the rights of 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi are not violated.Ravi, through her counsel Abhinav Sekhri, moved the Delhi high court on Thursday seeking to restrain the city police from leaking any information related to investigation in the toolkit matter.In her petition, Ravi said that police took away her mobile phone on February 13 and forced her to provide them with credentials of her private accounts. The police denied the charges on Thursday and also filed an affidavit in this regard.Ravi’s particular contention was about some channels revealing details of her WhatsApp chats. Her petition claimed that the “media houses have published one-sided defamatory, suggestive innuendos, and half truths about the petitioner”.The court admitted that “recent coverage by the media definitely shows that there is sensationalism”. It said “while police briefings and the happenings in court proceedings etc. can also be broadcast and disseminated, leaked investigation material ought not to be disseminated so as to prejudice the investigation.”However, it declined to entertain Ravi’s request that the content be taken down saying the removal of articles would be considered at a later stage.The court asked editors of the channels to exercise proper editorial control so that the investigation is not hampered in any manner.“If the charge-sheet is filed in the meantime and the same is made public, once the investigation reaches some conclusion, dissemination of the contents of the charge-sheet would not be interdicted in any manner,” the judge clarified.The court also asked Ravi to ensure that people related to her do not share information after the police.The Bengaluru-based climate activist, through her counsel, senior advocate Akhil Sibal, assured the court that neither Ravi or any other person directly associated with her intend to indulge in any kind of maligning of the police or the investigating authorities.Appearing for Network 18, counsel Mrinal Bharti sought time from the court to verify the broadcasts and go through the petition filed by Ravi.On behalf of India Today, advocate Hrishikesh Baruah, told the court that the only publication referred to in the petition is an online article that does not relate to India Today TV channels. He said that in any event, Ravi does not seem to be claiming that the WhatsApp messages are false or incorrect and cannot be attributed to her.Advocate Kunal Tandon, appearing for Times Now, told the court that the Right to Privacy would be restricted only by public interest which has to be “overwhelming”, according to Supreme Court’s judgment on privacy.Following submissions, the court posted the matter for further hearing on March 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-curbs-but-must-exercise-caution-hc-to-tv-channels-101613770862000.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||Road accident fatalities hit 30-year low in 2020||Fatalities due to road accident in the national capital dipped to a 30-year low last year, data released by Delhi traffic police data shows.Data released during the Delhi Police annual press conference on Friday showed that in 2020, 1,163 fatal accidents were reported in the city. This was nearly 19% less than the fatal accidents reported in 2019, which was 1,433. Special commissioner of police (traffic) Taj Hassan said that this reduction in the fatal accidents in the Capital was the lowest in 30 years.Though the police did not share data of last 30 years, statistics available on the Delhi police’s website shows that 1163 fatal accidents in 2020 was the lowest since 2000 at least.“The key strategy used by the traffic police to reduce road accidents was a combination of increased deployment of personnel on the roads, improvement of road engineering solutions and increasing road safety awareness campaigns,” said Hassan.Data shows that the city has been seeing a steadily declining trend of fatal accidents. In 2018, the number of accidents that lead to the deaths of those involved was 1,657, which was nearly 14% higher than 1433 in 2019The presentation made by the traffic department also showed that the number of traffic violations last year had also seen a jump compared to 2019.In 2020, 13,802,973 violations were reported, as compared to 10,580,249 in 2019. The amount collected in challans had also gone up from ₹94.07 crore in 2019 to ₹124.16 crore in 2020.Manish Agarwal, joint commissioner of police (traffic), said that the department has also been able to improve prosecutions even though the city dealt with a nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, which kept private vehicles off the roads for nearly four months. This, he said, was also because the traffic police relied a lot on camera-based prosecutions last year.“Currently, we have around three to four types of camera prosecutions—to detect speeding, red light jumping and stop line violations, and to check unauthorised parking,” said Agarwal.Traffic officials stressed that the department will continue to increase the use of technology throughout 2021. For instance, the Delhi traffic police are planning to implement Phase-II of the intelligent traffic monitoring system, which will increase the use of camera-based policing and therefore prosecutions, leading to a deterrence among drivers.“The department will be preparing a detailed project report (DPR) of ITMS for an integrated implementation of the technology. We are also planning to improve enforcement and regulation for better traffic management and also improve coordination with civic agencies and other stakeholders,” Hassan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/road-accident-fatalities-hit-30-year-low-in-2020-101613770584900.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||On back of incentive scheme, cops trace more missing kids||From August 6, the day Delhi Police announced that policemen and women would be rewarded with out-of-turn promotions for tracing missing children,the number of children reported to be lost until December 31 was 1,968. In the same period, the police traced 2,027 children, more than the number reported missing.It turns out that the police had found children reported to be lost as long as two years ago. Delhi Police said on Friday said that it was the first time in many decades that the number of recovered children was more than those reported missing.At his annual press conference, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said that since August 6, police personnel across the Capital had been striving to trace missing children, citing one woman police officer as an example.“The success story of ASI {assistant sub-inspector} Seema Dhaka is proof that our personnel on the ground are working round-the-clock to ensure that a parent does not lose his/her child. Our officers are visiting states across the country to reunite children with their families,” said Shrivastava.Dhaka, who was a head constable, was promoted to the ASI’s post after tracing 76 children within three months last year. Two constables also received similar out-of-turn promotions for tracing more than 50 children.Police said that the number of recovered missing children was also high in 2020 compared to the previous year.In 2020, at least 4,297 children were reported missing and 4,052 were traced – a recovery rate of 94.29 % and an improvement of 32.65 percentage points compared to the previous year. In 2019, 5,412 children had been reported missing, of which 3,336 were traced- -a recovery rate of 61.64 %.On August 6, the police chief had issued an order that any constable or head constable who finds at least 50 missing children aged below 14 (of whom at least 15 children must be younger than eight years) in a year would be eligible for an out-of-turn promotion.The incentive is only valid for constables and head constables who are the junior-most in the police force.Officials had said the emphasis was on children below eight although more children above that age, especially those in their teens, are reported missing because teens often flee home on their own and refuse to return.In the normal course, constables become eligible for a promotion after five years in service and that too only if they clear a test. If a constable does not take the test, it takes around 10 years for promotion to the post of a head constable.Former IPS officer Amod Kanth, who runs Prayas --an NGO for children -- said that reuniting so many children with their families is a commendable work. “We should appreciate the Delhi police for this. One of the few campaigns the present commissioner has undertaken is giving out of turn promotion to officers tracing these lost children. It also speaks of the priority of the police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/on-back-of-incentive-scheme-cops-trace-more-missing-kids-101613770228672.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||Amid protests and riots, Delhi Police puts faith in tech||In 2020, when the overall crime in Delhi dipped, the Delhi Police faced newer challenges in the form of mass protests and riots leading the force to deploy technology to deal with crimes that involved mobs instead of the conventional crime, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said on Friday.Addressing the annual press conference, Shrivastava said technology was used extensively to investigate over 750 cases related to the northeast Delhi riots that led to the arrest of over 200 people.“Of them, 137 were identified through FRS (Facial Recognition System) when matched with criminal records and remaining 94 were through driving licence photographs,” the commissioner said.Communal violence broke out in north-east Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.In January this year, farmers protesting against the three new farm laws clashed with the police and stormed the Red Fort during the tractor rally on Republic Day.Since these challenges involved protests leading to violence by unidentified mob, the Delhi Police brought in the face recognition technology -- an intervention that helped the police zero in on suspects who were allegedly part of the mob.Shrivastava said the police are using video analytics, face recognition systems, geo location, drone mapping and DNA finger printing to gather scientific evidence and conduct that is helping help them to conduct “free and fair” investigations.Referring to the investigation in the violence during tractor rally, Shrivastava said of the 2,700 video clips and pictures that the police have received from general public and hundreds of CCTV and mobile phone videos were analysed using video analytics and face recognition. The data gathered was then matched with driving licence database to identify suspects.“We are also using technology to help us with handwriting analysis, in tracking funding for anti-social activities and to retrieve deleted data from electronic devices,” he said.To demonstrate how the police were using the face recognition technology, police showed how a man who was wearing a yellow- blue jacket was identified by the software at multiple places during the north-east Delhi riots. The photo was then matched with the driving licence database to identify him.Shrivastava said FRS was being uploaded in the phones of beat constables so that they can scan the face of a suspect to check his criminal record.Former IPS officer Ashok Chand said scientific evidence is helpful as it cannot be disputed and is accepted in the court of law. “It is considered to be conclusive evidence in court and helps take an investigation to its logical end, and build a strong case,” Chand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-protests-and-riots-police-put-faith-in-tech-101613769945881.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||Snatching cases up, most hot spots located in E Delhi||The Delhi Police at their annual press conference on Friday said they were working in accordance with a strategy to keep residents safe, even as two street crimes, snatching and robbery, rose in 2020 compared to the previous year, despite a two-month-long Covid lockdown, and curbs on movement and gatherings for a large chunk of the year.Nearly 22 people were victims of snatching every day, while at least five daily robberies took place in Delhi in 2020, a 27.11% and 0.36% increase respectively compared to 2019.Police data also showed that they solved three of every five snatching cases last year, a percentage point increase from 2019. Robbery solving percentage increased from 91.92% to 92.21%. The police also arrested 6,496 persons for snatchings, a 24% increase from 2019.SN Shrivastava, Delhi Police commissioner, attributed the increase of the two crime FIRs to an encouragement of registration of cases as they occurred. But he pointed out that the calls to the police control room (PCR) about these two crimes, like overall offences, had dipped last year. “We kept PCR calls as the benchmark of the crime scenario,” he said.The PCR calls for snatching saw a peak in August 2019 when 5,292 such calls were received. In comparison, 1,060 such PCR calls were received in March this year, the lowest through 2020. Similarly, robbery and dacoity calls to the PCR unit peaked in August 2019 at 1,848 such calls and dipped to 498 in April 2019.Sharing the example of Shahdara district, the police showed a map of how hotspots of snatching and robbery such as Shahdara, Farsh Bazar, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar and Jagatpuri were identified and barricades set up strategically at important roads which could lead to a getaway and motorcycle patrol teams were deployed to chase down suspects at those locations.The police were similarly identifying hotspots of crime against women. Bindapur, Dwarka South, Dwarka North, Sagarpur and New Usmanpur were the top five police stations in the list of such hotspots. Santosh Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), under whose jurisdiction four such police stations fall, said, “Such cases here are high because we register every complaint we receive,” said Meena.Vikram Singh, former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, said the police leadership needed to examine the profiles of the snatchers and robbers arrested. “The police need to find out if such criminals were first-timers, whether they took to these crimes due to loss of jobs or payment of EMIs. That can help them know about the kind of criminals striking in a year of lockdown,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/snatching-cases-up-most-hot-spots-located-in-e-delhi-101613769634626.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||A woman is raped every 5 hours, 10 mins in Delhi||While the overall number of crimes against women decreased in 2020 when compared to the previous year, the national capital still reported 1,699 rapes, 2,186 instances of molestation and 65 cases of sexual assault against children.The cases were fewer when compared to 2019, when 2,168 rapes, 2,921 instances of molestation and 109 cases under the POCSO Act (The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012) were registered.Delhi Police on Friday said this was the first time in several years that all types of crimes against women had reduced. To be sure, in 2020, owing to the Covid-19 lockdown in March, the movement of people had remained curtailed at least for four months, which could also be another reason for the reduction in numbers.The absolute numbers and per-day averages of several key crimes, however, remained high — highlighting Delhi’s dark underbelly.The city still experienced a rape every five hours, a murder every 19 hours, and a car theft every 15 minutes — though these averages were better than in 2019 (when the corresponding figures for rape, murder and auto theft were 4 hours, 17 hours, and 12 minutes). A snatching took place almost every hour in 2020, as compared to 17 in a day in 2019.Experts said while the overall reduction in crime against women is heartening, the figures for 2020 show that women continue to be under threat in Delhi and there should not be even a single case of a crime against women.On the rape cases, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said less than 2% accused persons in the rape cases were strangers to victims. “The number of strangers involved has further reduced this year. In percentage terms, 1.77% of the accused were strangers as compared to 2.20% in 2019. As part of our strategy to tackle such crimes, we have identified hot spots (from where a high number of crimes against women are reported). Our teams work on such hot spots to reduce the numbers. Every complaint is monitored at the highest level,” he said.The analysis of rape cases also showed that in 318 of the 1,699 rape cases, the accused was “in a live-in relationship” with the victim or “had refused to marry ” the victim.Delhi Police attributed the reduction in cases to better policing and their strategies such as deploying women personnel as beat constables and getting police vans to patrol vulnerable stretches.Madhu Vij, a Delhi-based gender expert, said,”I am not contending that the authorities have done a lot of work, be it making a mobile app for reporting your location or getting residents’ welfare associations and citizen groups involved to create awareness, to make Delhi safe for women. But I would say a lot still needs to be done. The city is still unsafe, especially for younger women. I still worry if my daughter or daughter-in-law stays out after dark and that is not because I think women should stay home and not live their life. It is because we still need to feel safe and perceptions will only change once the reality changes. There should not even be a single case (of crime against women),” Vij said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-woman-is-raped-every-5-hours-10-mins-in-delhi-101613769257083.html
20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Lowering of guard behind Covid surge in Punjab||With Punjab being among the four states where coronavirus infections have seen a sudden surge in the past few days, the officials attribute it to lowering of guard by the people. As per the health department, focused sampling of teachers and students after reopening of schools has also added to the number of infections in the state.Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19, said: “As people have lowered their guard against the virus and the use of masks has reduced drastically, the daily cases are increasing.”As per health department figures, even since focused testing of teachers was undertaken after schools were opened by the state government, more than 55 have turned out to be Covid positive in the past two weeks. The figures suggest that as many as 275 school students were also found infected in this period.In Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar, earlier known as Nawanshahr, 23 teachers and 189 students have been detected positive in this duration of testing, becoming the major reason behind the surge in the virus cases in the district, health officials said. With 495 positive cases so far, the district now has highest number of active cases in Punjab, followed by 368 in Ludhiana and 367 in SAS Nagar. As of Friday morning, the state’s active cases stood at 2,642.Notably, when Covid-19 struck the country, SBS Nagar had become one of the first hotspots. Later, however, the district led by example and maintained a significantly less caseload throughout the lockdown period. But once again, it is back in focus due to the sudden surge in infections. “Our cases in general sampling have not increased. Assessment shows that a sudden rise has come due to the detection of the virus in teachers which has further spread to the students and their family members,” said Dr Bhaskar. “We are also sending a few samples for genome testing to a Pune lab to check for the possibility of another virus strain,” said the nodal officer.The department analysis suggests that most of the students and teachers turning out infected with the virus are mostly asymptomatic.Meanwhile on changing school timings, education minister Vijay Inder Singla said parents firmly supported the decisions of Punjab government on reopening of schools.
20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Govt may de-reserve Bathinda mayoral post||The Punjab government is likely to de-reserve the post of mayor in the high-stake Bathinda municipal corporation. In July 2008, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD’s) Baljit Singh Bir Behman was elected as the first mayor of Bathinda as a general category candidate. But in the next civic body polls in 2015, the top office of the local body was reserved for a Scheduled Caste candidate. In March 2015, Akali leader Balwant Rai Nath was elected unopposed for the coveted post when SAD-BJP alliance was in majority. In the latest civic body elections, Congress successfully managed to penetrate the political bastion of the SAD after decades by winning 43 of the 50 seats. Veteran Congress leader Jagroop Singh Gill is being seen as the strongest claimant to head the civic body. Gill was asked to quit as the chairperson of the district planning board to contest municipal corporation elections. He successfully contested from Ward 48 and won the municipal polls for the record 7th time. Gill was polled 1,452 votes whereas his nearest rival Nirmal Singh of SAD got only 876 votes. Gill had also held the posts of the chairperson of the Bathinda Improvement Trust, vice-president and president of the local civic body and the president of the District Bar Association. Sources said the Congress leadership had handpicked Gill for the elections and he is likely to get rewarded with the mayoral post. Official sources said the state government is yet to issue a notification on the category of mayoral posts in all the municipal corporations will be reserved for women or SC candidates or not. 
20-02-2021||Delhi||Crime capital: Snatching rose in year of lockdown||Nearly 22 people were victims of snatching and at least five robberies took place every day in the national capital in 2020, as these two key street crimes that are considered benchmarks of law-and-order in a city registered a rise last year despite a two-month-long hard Covid-19 lockdown and restrictions on movement and assembly that lingered for several months.There were 7,965 snatching cases registered in 2020, a 27.11% rise from 2019, according to official police data released on Friday. Robberies, on the other hand, increased 0.36% with 1,963 cases.In all, 266,070 criminal cases of all kinds were registered through the year — a 15.87% reduction from 2019; the first time such a dip has been noticed in at least a decade. Experts said this was along expected lines given the Covid restrictions.The absolute numbers and per-day averages of several key crimes, however, remained high — highlighting Delhi’s dark underbelly.The city still experienced a rape every five hours, a murder every 19 hours, and a car theft every 15 minutes — though these averages were better than in 2019 (when the corresponding figures for rape, murder and auto theft were 4 hours, 17 hours, and 12 minutes). A snatching took place almost every hour in 2020, as compared to 17 in a day in 2019.Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava said the police was trying to shift the focus of its crime analysis from cases filed to calls received by the police control room (PCR) — ostensibly to account for a possible gap between reporting and registration.“We kept PCR calls as the benchmark of the crime scenario. That shows a 38.19% decline in overall PCR calls [in 2020],” said Shrivastava. There were 24,746 PCR calls related to snatching last year, a 55.84% dip from the 56,037 such calls the year before that. PCR calls about robberies fell 37.01% from 18,210 to 11,471. “Once a person makes a PCR call, it is recorded in the system. One cannot hide the numbers,” Shrivastava said.Vikram Singh, former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, said that the crimes were expected to dip due to the lockdown. “If the police are pointing to decrease in PCR calls, that was bound to happen due to a decrease in interactions between the public and criminals on the street for several months. If there was lesser interface between them, PCR calls were bound to reduce,” said Vikram Singh.Of the 472 murders in the Capital in 2020, police data showed that personal enmity and disputes accounted for about 44%, and 21% were triggered by “sudden provocation” or “trivial issues”.“Fifty-three of these deaths happened in the north-east Delhi riots. If they hadn’t occurred, there would be over 100 fewer murders last year compared to 2019,” Shrivastava said.The comment underscored how 2020 was a year that saw several protest-related incidents in the city — be it the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act clashes at Jamia, the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, or the January riots in north-east Delhi in which 581 people were injured, according to data released on Friday, apart from the 53 dead.With vehicles parked for months, rather than on the roads, and borders closed during the Covid-19 lockdown, auto thefts were the lowest in five years — 24% down from 46,215 in 2019 to about 35,000 in 2020.There was also an overall reduction in crimes against women — rapes dipped from 2,168 to 1,699 and molestation from 2,921 to 2,186.Vikram Singh said that if anything was to be credited for the decrease in crimes, it were the prohibitory orders due to the pandemic. “The policing in Delhi had nothing to do with the reduction. It is just that the criminals also couldn’t leave their homes,” he said.The police said that cyber crimes rose during the lockdown period and reduced after the restrictions were lifted. In any case, 66 “mega frauds” mentioned by the police led to over 165,000 people being targeted. These 66 frauds also led to 213 arrests.Police said that the number of recovered missing children was also high in 2020 compared to the previous year, thanks to a scheme of offering out-of-turn promotions to police personnel who help recover a large number of missing children. In 2019, 61.64% of the 5,412 missing children were traced. In comparison, last year 94.29% of the 4,297 children gone missing were recovered.The police said that certain “violent crimes” such as extortion and kidnapping for ransom fell 33% and 27% respectively. “Violent crimes create scare and anxiety among residents,” Shrivastava said on the reduction of such crimes.“If street crimes such as snatchings and robberies are increasing they indicate that criminals are not in check. There can be many reasons behind that, the prime being the involvement of first timers whose surveillance is not easy to do. These crimes can be brought under control only when beat constables focus on intelligence gathering and are kept away from law and order duties,” said Ajai Raj Sharma, former Delhi Police chief.In an interview to Hindustan Times in December 2017, the previous Delhi Police chief, Amulya Patnaik, recognised snatching as one of the Capital’s biggest law-and-order concerns and proposed bringing in sterner laws and harsher sentences for the guilty.While overall registered crimes dipped in the city, the number of people arrested for the offences rose 15.43% to 125,000 in 2020. These included eight people booked under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and 120 of those who carried rewards on their arrests. The data did not mention people booked for sedition, or under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA.The police commissioner said the data trend showed that the police has “encouraged registration of cases as they occurred”, pointing to how online FIRs, which can be filed without police interaction, decreased nearly 30% in 2020 as compared to 2019. “But offline FIRs, where police are involved in the registration process, have increased nearly 27% over the last two years,” he said.Former Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar said, “Unlike the number of registered cases where there are chances of burking, calls made to the police control room (PCR) regarding crimes is a sure method and a reliable data to understand the crime trend. PCR calls are the clear indicator of crimes being under control. If there is a reduction in PCR calls, I should say it’s a happy situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crime-capital-snatching-rose-in-year-of-lockdown-101613763156603.html
20-02-2021||Mumbai||Treat us as frontline staff, give us vaccine shots: Air India’s Mumbai staff||National carrier Air India’s Mumbai-based employees’ union has appealed to the management that they, as frontline workers, should be inoculated against Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19, on a priority basis. “The employees of Air India have been on the frontlines since the beginning of the pandemic. Employees at every level have put their service to the nation before their own lives and worked tirelessly for the Vande Bharat Mission. In this context, we request that the employees of Air India be given the vaccination on a priority basis. This will ensure that Air Indians can continue serving the nation,” stated a February 19 letter to the chairman from the Air India Employees Union (AIEU). In December, AIEU had also written to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri requesting a meeting and seeking an extension of the medical scheme, leave encashment and provident fund benefits in the event of privatisation of Air India. Due to the privatisation process, the union had urged the aviation ministry to ensure that the present medical benefits are extended, arrears to the employees are paid, the two provident fund trusts and the leave encashment scheme are continued.In January last year, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) initiated the privatisation of Air India. However, the process was delayed due to the pandemic and December 14, 2020, was fixed as the deadline for bidders to submit expressions of interest. Air India had a total of 14,032 employees, including 9,426 permanent and contractual workers, as of November 1, 2019, as per the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) issued on January 20 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/treat-us-as-frontline-staff-give-us-vaccine-shots-air-india-s-mumbai-staff-101613763060995.html
20-02-2021||Other||Active Covid-19 cases on rise, next 15 days crucial for Mumbai||Due to the sudden spike in the new Covid-19 cases, active cases in the state have increased by almost 29% in the past one week. Civic officials said the next 15 days will be crucial for the city.In Mumbai, Covid-19 cases have increased by 37%. On February 12, the city had recorded 599 cases, which increased to 823 on Friday.“We are expecting that cases will increase further in the next 15 days. So, the next two weeks will be crucial to ascertain the spike in Covid-19 cases in the city,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.As per data from the state government, on February 12, Maharashtra had 31,479 active cases, which surged to 43,701 on Thursday.Active cases indicate patients who are currently ongoing treatment.“The list of active patients include those who started their treatment prior to February 12, along with the newly added patients who got diagnosed that date,” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate.The gradual relaxation in lockdown restrictions, citizens violating safety norms and the possible mutation of Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – are cited as contributing factors to the rise in the cases in Maharashtra.“With the flattening of the pandemic curve, citizens started putting down their safety guards. People have been participating in wedding ceremonies and birthday celebrations without wearing masks. In fact, the safety rules of maintaining social distance are being violated, which has been contributing to the rise in Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Awate.Preliminary genome sequencing has found two mutated variants of Sars-CoV-2 which is spreading “aggressively” in districts such as Amravati and Yavatmal, said officials.“The epidemiological characteristics of the new mutated variation of Covid-19 have a faster infection rate. Thus, we are witnessing more infection rate in Amravati and Yavatmal, which have the highest positivity rate in the state,” said Dr Subhash Salunke, technical adviser to the Maharashtra government on the Covid-19 outbreak.Medical experts said the state might be facing a second wave of the pandemic, as was seen in Europe after the initial phase of the downward slope in the curve.“Just like Europe and the UK (United Kingdom), there is a possibility that a second wave may also start in India if new cases don’t come under control and citizens don’t act more responsibly,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, who is a part of the state’s Covid-19 task force.Due to the rising fear among the public, the state and civic officials are facing resistance from citizens during contact tracing and while conducting tests.“Many patients from the same families are getting infected. But when we try to get the contact number and address of their close contacts, they refuse to cooperate. In many cases, the infected patients give false addresses which turn into an obstruction for contact tracing,” said Dr Suresh Asole, district health officer (DHO), Akola.All the district officers have now been instructed by the state health department to bring stringent rules to implement the safety rules as per the guidelines of the central government.“We’ll depute marshals at public places to fine citizens without masks. Also, we will run inspections at wedding ceremonies to control the gathering of the public,” said Amravati DHO Dr Dilip Ranmale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/active-covid-19-cases-on-rise-next-15-days-crucial-for-mumbai-101613762941020.html
20-02-2021||Other||365 samples, including 90 from Mumbai, sent for genome sequencing||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sent 90 swab samples of Covid-19 patients to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genome sequencing on Tuesday. Additionally, three districts —Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola — which have the highest positivity rates in the state, have sent 275 samples to the institute on Fridays. While Amravati and Yavatmal sent 100 samples each, Akola sent 75 samples. The samples were sent after preliminary examination had revealed that four samples from Amravati showed a mutation (E484Q), while another four from Yavatmal showed a second mutation (N440K) of Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19. To ascertain the virological characteristics of the two mutated strains, the four districts have sent a total of 365 samples of infected patients to NIV. At a time when the state’s overall positivity rate stands at 13.4%, Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola have recorded a positivity rate of around 50%, 47% and 25%, respectively. To look into the epidemiology of the virus among the newly infected patients, a few samples were also sent to BJ Medical College, Pune, for genome sequencing. The number of new Covid-19 cases has doubled in Mumbai in the past 10 days. “Though our positivity is still under 5% unlike many other districts, we didn’t want to take any chance. We therefore sent 90 samples for genome sequencing, and expect a report within 12 days,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Genome sequencing is a technique that involves analysing the genetic code of an organism and is done with the help of powerful computers. “We have found a mutation in the virus, but we need to understand its epidemiological nature to gauge its implication in spreading the infection among the public,” said Dr Dilip Ranmale, district health officer (DHO), Amravati. In addition to having the highest positivity rate, Akola, Amravati and Yavatmal are also reporting a large number of people from the same families contracting the infection. “People across the state have put their guards down and are not maintaining safety norms. But how has then the positivity rate of only these districts gone up at such a whopping rate? We believe that one of the reasons behind this is the new mutated virus, which just like the UK variant, is transmitting faster,” said Ranmale. The swab samples are being sent in three categories—mildly, severely symptomatic and asymptomatic. “We have sent 25 samples in each of three categories for analysis,” said Dr Suresh Asole, DHO, Akola. Doctors said that if NIV finds out anything alarming about the mutated variants, the government should seal the boundaries of the districts to stop the further spread of the virus. Amravati is already going into a partial lockdown after 6pm till Monday. “If the cases keep rising with the new variant of the virus, then it will be essential to impose local lockdown in those areas,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist. Meanwhile, the three swab samples that were sent from Satara for genome sequencing have not shown any mutation. Dr Aniruddha Athalye, DHO, Satara, said, “We had sent the samples 10-12 days ago, but didn’t find any variant.” Medical experts said there is nothing to worry as virus mutation is a regular phenomenon. Also, the same two mutated strains of the virus have been observed all across the country. “These two mutations are not new. So we aren’t observing any drastic changes until the detailed analysis at NIV finds something unique. Hopefully, the report will be available in the next eight days,” said Dr Subhash Salunke, technical adviser to the Maharashtra government on the Covid-19 outbreak. “But yes, the new mutated virus is spreading aggressively. However, it is not severe as it hasn’t pushed up the mortality yet.” DHOs, in addition to virus mutation, have also blamed the careless attitude of citizens as one of the contributing factors for the rise in cases. “People went for functions such as weddings and birthday celebrations without wearing masks. Now, the collector has instructed us to impose heavy fines on those found without masks. We will also inspect wedding functions to keep a check on the crowd,” said Dr Asole. Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, also said the recently held gram panchayat elections played a role in spreading the virus. The state health department in a press release on Friday announced that so far, no new strain similar to Britain, South Africa and Brazil have been discovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/365-samples-including-90-from-mumbai-sent-for-genome-sequencing-101613762641066.html
20-02-2021||Other||Jayant Patil, Rajesh Tope take count of Covid-positive Maharashtra ministers to 24||Amid a marked resurgence of Covid-19 infections in Maharashtra in over a week, a number of the political leaders, including health minister Rajesh Tope, have been tested positive for the virus. “I have tested positive for Covid-19. Though I am doing fine, I’ll follow the advice of the doctors. With all your blessings, I will defeat Covid-19 and be at your services soon. Those who have come in contact with me in the past few days must take all the precautions and get tested, if they develop any symptoms,” Tope said in a tweet on Thursday night. The health minister is being treated at Fortis Hospital in Mulund under the supervision of Dr Rahul Pandit, who is also a member of state’s Covid-19 task force. Apart from Tope, water resources minister Jayant Patil, food and drugs administration minister Dr Rajendra Shingne and minister of state for water resources Bachchu Kadu are currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19. Besides, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian Raksha Khadse and former minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party leader Eknath Khadse also tested positive for coronavirus. Eknath Khadse was found positive for the second time after he was infected with the virus in the last week of December. State Congress president Nana Patole has undergone a Covid-19 test after he developed flu-like symptoms. His test report is awaited, officials said. On February 5, home minister Anil Deshmukh was tested positive for Covid-19. Around 24 ministers from the ministerial council of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government were infected in the past 11 months. On Friday, the state saw a further rise in the daily cases, as it clocked 6,112 patients, the highest single-day count, since November 27 (after 84 days), when 6,185 cases were recorded. This has led to concern among the state authorities and the government indicated that lockdown restrictions could return if there’s a constant rise in the cases. The spurt in daily infections is being seen since February 10, when over 3,000 cases were recorded. To control the spread, many districts, including Mumbai, imposed restrictions. Yavatmal district has imposed curfew from Friday midnight, prohibiting the gathering of more than five people, among many other strict restrictions. The authorities of Amravati district decided to impose a complete lockdown on Sundays. Similarly, Akola also decided to impose a lockdown on Sundays and night curfew from Thursday onwards. “These measures will be taken in targeted areas where the virulence of the virus is more. Hence, some more districts may follow them as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the local bodies to take all the necessary steps to contain the spread. They have been asked to focus on the enforcement of standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the state to ease the lockdown restrictions in a gradual manner,” said a senior official, privy to the development. Meanwhile, legislative Council chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar wrote to the state government, requesting that the legislators be immunised, in the backdrop of the Budget session of the legislature starting from March 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jayant-patil-rajesh-tope-take-count-of-covid-positive-maharashtra-ministers-to-24-101613762280683.html
20-02-2021||Mumbai||‘Start Covid-19 vaccination phase 3 before second wave hits Mumbai’||With the sudden spike in new Covid-19 cases, health officials and city doctors have begun emphasising on the need to start a mass immunisation programme for those above 50 years, at the earliest. Individuals aged above 50 years with underlying health conditions are most vulnerable to contracting Covid-19. In Mumbai alone, more than 80% of the total 11,430 deaths (till February 18) were from this age category. In a meeting held on Thursday with civic officials, a suggestion to speed up the third phase of the vaccination process was put forward by the state Covid-19 taskforce. “With the rise in cases, a suggestion was made to begin the third phase of vaccination so that those above the age of 50 can start getting inoculated as they are the most vulnerable group in the population,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, a consultant physician with Bombay Hospital, who was part of the meeting. After the first dose of the vaccine, it generally takes around two weeks for the development of antibodies needed to fight against Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19. Doctors said the faster the elderly group gets vaccinated, the sooner the spread of the virus can be contained. “If we can immunise the vulnerable group at the earliest, we can control the spread of infection if we are heading toward a second wave of the pandemic, like in Europe,” Bhansali added. Citing a report released recently by the Oxford University, which produced the Covishield vaccine, Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist, said, “It has been seen in the study that the first shot is enough to give protection [after antibodies are developed] against the Covid-19 virus for almost three months. The second dose, which acts as a booster, may further strengthen the immunity for more days.” A similar appeal to vaccinate those above 50 years was recently put forth by ward officers. A ward officer from M-West ward, which covers Chembur and Tilak Nagar, with the highest Covid-19 growth rate, also requested the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to initiate the third phase of the mass immunisation programme. “We have been told that the direction to start the third phase has to be initiated by the Central government. Without its approval, the civic body cannot start the third phase,” said Prithviraj Chauhan, assistant commissioner, M-West ward. Civic officials, however, said the third phase is expected to begin from the first week of March, where over 3 million probable people in the city will be immunised. “Though we haven’t been given clear instructions, the third phase is likely to start along with the ongoing first and second phases, in the first week of March. This will be beneficial for those in the vulnerable group,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-North ward, which covers Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim. Starting the third phase will be an uphill task for the civic body as only 35% of the total 400,000 registered healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers have been inoculated so far. Additionally, due to the ongoing technical glitch in the centralised CoWIN mobile application, private hospitals are also facing problems in the immunisation process for their in-house HCWs. “It is expected that the civic body will allow private hospitals to vaccinate the public in the third phase. But before doing so, the Central government needs to fix the app or it will further lead to chaos,” said a senior official from a private hospital who has been vaccinating HCWs since Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/start-covid-19-vaccination-phase-3-before-second-wave-hits-mumbai-101613761680688.html
20-02-2021||City||Congress’ poll eve promise of ‘dating destinations' in Vadodara invites BJP's wrath||Congress' poll promise for local municipal corporation election in Gujarat's Vadodara has run into controversy. The party stated it would set up “dating destinations with coffee shops for youth, students, couples and corporates”, and also open up English medium schools, if voted to power in the local municipal corporation in Gujarat’s Vadodara.The BJP has called it “trappings of an Italian culture”, claiming that it has “offended the sensibilities of the sanskari nagari (Vadodara is called a sanskari nagari).”When asked about the ‘Iconic Vadodara’ manifesto promise, Vadodara Congress president Prashant Patel told Hindustan Times, “The BJP has a problem since they can’t think out of the box. They speak of swadeshi but welcome Walmart with open arms.”Also read: Mumbai, Nagpur, Amravati - New restrictions as Covid-19 surge continues“What is wrong if the Vadodara Municipal Corporation provides affordable coffee shops to youngsters, couples and even corporates who can’t afford the expensive cafes, where one cup of coffee is sold for not less than ₹100?” Patel asked.He wondered why should youngsters from weaker sections of society be left out just because they couldn’t afford to go to a branded coffee shop. This facility would be for them. “Then there are joint families in Gujarat, where a husband and wife can’t discuss their issues and aspirations openly. Here, they will have a space to spend some moments together,” Patel said, explaining the purpose.He said the Congress party was promising a modern life with affordable amenities, and this was why it had promised to set up English medium schools and a full-fledged hospital run by the municipal corporation. “BJP has ruled Vadodara since 1995, they couldn’t even think of these things,” he asserted.The BJP, which has not released any manifesto for the city, called it a desperate attempt by Congress to lure the young voters “by hook or by crook.” The party has also issued a press release, stating, “Youngsters, as well as corporates of the 'sanskari nagari' Vadodara, are furious by this. They can’t come out of Italian culture.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-poll-eve-promise-of-dating-destinations-in-vadodara-invites-bjp-s-wrath-101613761395135.html
20-02-2021||Mumbai||Fee hike in Maharashtra schools: Regulation doesn’t help, say parents||Over the past 10 months of the Covid pandemic, parents of children studying in private schools have filed numerous complaints – online and offline – over indiscriminate hiking of fees, with the most recent one on February 16 at Azad Maidan, seeking government Action. However, according to parents and educationists, the major bone of contention is the state’s Fee Regulation Act, which grants enormous powers to private schools to fix fees, leaving hardly any scope for the state to intervene. The Act In 2018, then Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government brought in an amendment to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, that allowed schools to hike fees by up to 15% once every two years. It also allowed schools to declare fees for the next five-10 years when a child gets admission in Class 1, thus undermining the role of parents and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) in fee-related decisions. The Act was called out for its pro-privatisation and pro-management stance and its passage was followed by protests from parents across the state. While the resistance faded away as the government turned a blind eye, the concerns raised then have now become major hurdles in addressing fee-related disputes in schools. Tough timesA few days after schools in the state were closed owing to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown in March, classes moved online. With many parents losing jobs, facing salary cuts and financial pressure, requests to grant concessions on fee payments started pouring in. The state released a government resolution (GR) on May 8, 2020, stating schools should stay all fee hikes for the new academic year (2020-2021) and must allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26, in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. Petitioners argued the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules. Consequently, while several private schools in the state hiked fees, notwithstanding requests from parents, many others continue to charge Activity fees, laboratory fees and miscellaneous expenses, which, parents say, need to be scrapped as children continue to learn from home. Several schools have used provisions under the Act to pressurise parents into paying huge amounts. Non-payment of dues and delayed payments has led to schools removing children from online groups, calling parents incessantly and at times, forcibly asking them to move to another school. Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents’ Association, said the state education department has not solved even one complaint with respect to private schools in the entire pandemic period. “We have submitted a list of more than 80 schools, but there is no Action. Every time we try to meet officials and ministers, we are told about the pending court cases. The root of the problem is the fee Act which is anti-parent in its very essence. We demand an amendment to it soon,” said Sahai. The other sideWhile the current fee Act gives the government very little powers to intervene in fee-related matters of private schools, parents allege the government is turning a blind eye to even the few provisions that exist in the Act. For instance, the Act mandates the Divisional Fee Regulation Committee (DFRC) to handle fee-related disputes. Since the previous committee was dissolved in 2019, the government has failed to make a new one operational. “Similarly, the Act allows the government to audit the accounts of private schools and mandates them to upload the balance sheets on the website. The government has neither done audits nor uploaded a single document in all these years,” said Prasad Tulaskar, a parent from Dadar. Tulaskar is still awaiting Action in a complaint he made against a Dadar school in 2016. SC Kedia, secretary of the Unaided Schools Forum, which is one of the petitioners in the ongoing case in HC, said a majority of schools have stuck to rules with respect to fees during the pandemic. “There might be a small per cent of private schools who do not follow norms, but there is a mechanism to Act against such schools. Parents can complain against such schools and the government can Act if violations are found,” he added. Jayant Jain, president of the Forum for Fairness in Education that organized the protest on Wednesday, said, “The government is not serious about the issues of parents. While schools make enormous profits, parents are left in the lurch. Schools are removing students from classes which is a clear violation of their Right to Education, despite which the government is not Acting against them.” Despite several calls and messages, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad remained unavailable for a comment. Officials at the education department denied commenting on the issue stating that “the matter is subjudice”. Sunita Goenka, chairperson of Goenka and Associates Educational Trust, which runs several schools in the city, said with delays in fee payments, schools also faced several challenges during the pandemic. “Even though our schools did not hike fees, many parents did not pay during all these months. We also have to pay for a lot of costs, including maintenance and salaries of staff, and ensure that students continue to learn irrespective of their fee payment status. It is only recently that fees have started trickling in,” she added. Francis Joseph, a city-based educationist and the co-founder of SLN Global Network, said, “We must learn a lot from other countries when it comes to fee fixation. In several Middle-East countries when a school is permitted to break ground, they need to submit a financial plan which aligns to the expenses and revenue, which finally determines the fee they can begin with. We will also need a transparent and corruption-free mechanism which allows both the schools and parents to choose what’s best for them and their children. No one stakeholder should pressure the other based on assumptions and perception.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fee-regulation-remains-a-tough-act-to-follow-for-parents-101613761500770.html

The Central government, however, has informed the legislature that since politicians have not been included in the prioritised categories, they cannot be inoculated out of turn.The state government, in its meeting held on Thursday, has made RT-PCR testing mandatory for all the legislators, employees and people attending budget session beginning March 1. The health department has also suggested the state legislature to hold the testing session at three-four days’ intervals to contain the infection. “In an earlier meeting, the idea had come forward. We enquired with the state government, which, in turn, asked for nod from the ministry of health and family welfare for such vaccination. The Union ministry informed that no such inoculation can be allowed as politicians have not been included in the prioritised groups of beneficiaries,” said an official from Vidhan Bhavan.Ramraje Nimbalkar, chairman of the legislative council, and Narhari Zirwal, deputy speaker of legislative Assembly, had insisted on inoculation. “Hundreds of people including legislators, employees, and officers attend the session. RT-PCR needs to be repeated every three days. We had demanded for inoculation of legislators as it would have facilitated holding the session,” Nimbalkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-tries-to-get-vaccine-for-mlas-for-budget-session-centre-says-no-101613760300343.html
20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn puts power privatisation on hold||After rushing into power privatisation, the Chandigarh administration has now slammed brakes on the process to get more clarity on norms for the bidding process. The process has been put on hold, for now, said UT adviser Manoj Parida, adding that the administration would wait for the Centre’s final approval regarding the “company formation and share transfer process to be adopted”.The central government has insisted on a uniform bidding process to be followed in all the Union Territories where power privatisation process has already begun. Currently, the administrations of Chandigarh; Andaman and Nicobar; and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu are following different criterion.The decision comes at a time when the administration was in the final stages of handing over the electricity department to a private player. It had set February end as the deadline to complete the tendering process.The administration had first invited bids for privatisation on November 9, 2020. Of the 20 companies that bought the request for proposal, six — Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NESCL (NTPC), Adani Transmission Ltd, Tata Power and Torrent Power — had submitted their bid documents earlier this month. After scrutiny, the administration was to announce the date for opening of bids and finalisation of the company.The hiccups so farThe decision to privatise the department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre. An empowered committee was constituted to oversee and implement the process. The administration had assured the Centre that the process would be completed by the end of 2020.But, the first setback came on December 1, when the Punjab and Haryana high court stayed the process on the plea of UT Powermen Union.After nudged by the Centre, the administration approached the Supreme Court on January 12, which stayed the high court order. A day after the SC relief, the administration immediately invited bids from interested firms.The privatisation move has been opposed by employees, who have questioned the move to hand over a profit-making and well-running department to a private player. Resident welfare associations have also criticised the move, fearing hike in power prices.In the recently held administrator’s advisory council meeting, too, former Member of Parliaments Pawan Kumar Bansal and Harmohan Dhawan had condemned the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-puts-power-privatisation-on-hold-101613760000284.html
20-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops arrest Agra resident in sextortion racket||DB Marg police on Friday arrested a 23-year-old man from Agra, Uttar Pradesh in connection with a sextortion racket. The gang has allegedly extorted money from a number of people across cities, the police said.The accused, Anupsingh Bhupendrasingh Badhoriya, has been arrested in connection with the first information report (FIR) filed based on a Grant Road resident’s complaint last month. The complainant had, in December last year, received a friend request from a woman on a social media site. The complainant accepted the request and the two started chatting. After a while, the woman allegedly insisted on exchanging contact numbers and made a video call to him. When the complainant picked up the call, the woman undressed and made the complainant take off clothes. Few minutes later, the complainant received a recording of the video call from the woman’s number. She then allegedly threatened to send the video clip to the complainant’s relatives and friends if he failed to pay ₹21,000, said the police.He sent ₹5,000 to the woman, asked her to give him some time to arrange the rest and then approached DB Marg police. Police officers analysed call details of the caller and found that the money was first transferred to an e-wallet account and from there to some bank accounts. “One of these accounts belonged to Bhadoriya, who was subsequently arrested. Bhadoriya works as an agent for opening new bank accounts in Agra and was managing many bank accounts. He was involved in diverting extortion money from one account to another. His bank accounts had large number of suspicious transactions. He is a member of the sextortion racket,” said inspector Raja Bidkar of DB Marg police station. Police have secured his custody from the court on Friday and are interrogating him for more details on other members of the racket, Bidkar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cops-arrest-agra-resident-in-sextortion-racket-101613759880151.html
20-02-2021||City||Odisha teacher arrested for marrying four women without any divorce||An Art teacher in Odisha's Cuttack district was arrested on Friday on charges of marrying four women in the last 10 years.Police officials in Cuttack said that Krushna Chandra Nayak, an art teacher at Gopinathpur High School of Salepur area, had married a woman in 2001. Later he married another woman in 2008 without divorcing the first one.Cuttack deputy commissioner of police Prateek Singh said during the Covid-19 lockdown last year, Nayak married one more woman. He was with his fourth wife when the police arrested him.Nayak's first wife alleged that after marriage, he used to demand money from her family on the pretext of pursuing his studies and other needs. "My husband started living separately on the pretext of pursuing higher education. He never looked after me and tortured me. In 2004, I finally lodged a complaint against him at Purighat and Mahila Police stations. However, I withdraw the case after his family members assured they'll look after me," Nayak's first wife said in her complaint. In 2008, he married for the second time.Also read: Mumbai, Nagpur, Amravati - New restrictions as Covid-19 surge continuesNayak's third wife who had married him in 2016 said he would visit home occasionally. "In March 2020, I informed my family about his strange behaviour when I came across his photo with another woman on his mobile phone,” she said.Nayak's misdeeds came to light after his first and third wife lodged complaints with the Mahila police station in Cuttack. Based on the complaint, the police registered a case against Nayak under Sections 493A, 323, 294, 494, 500, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, and arrested him.Last month, the video of a man in Chhatisgarh had gone viral of him marrying two women at a time even though his first wife was living with him at his ancestral home.

20-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra crosses 6,000 new Covid cases after 83 days||Maharashtra on Friday saw an 83-day high in new Covid cases, as it crossed the 6,000 mark, with 6,112 cases. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 823 new Covid cases, the highest in 77 days. Despite the surge, the health department and experts on the state-appointed panel are not calling it another wave, and are confident of containing it with measures, higher testing and wider tracking. The state’s Covid death toll rose to 51,713 with 44 fatalities reported on Friday. Mumbai reported five deaths, taking the city’s Covid toll to 11,437. Mumbai has added 4,408 fresh cases in the past seven days. Its surrounding cities – Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli – have added 800, 663 and 748 new cases, respectively, in the same period. The rise in the city and Mumbai Metropolitan Region is being attributed to opening of local trains for general public since the beginning of February. The cases in Amravati, Nagpur, Yavatmal, and Pune continued to remain high. Amravati added 623 new cases — the third highest in the state on Friday, after Nagpur which clocked 630 fresh cases. Amravati’s rural areas reported 132 new cases. Pune city reported 535 new cases, while its rural area saw 211 new cases. Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 259 new cases. Yavatmal added 258 fresh cases. The health department on Friday issued a statement saying no foreign strain of the virus causing Covid-19 has been found in Amravati and Yavatmal districts of the state so far. The statement was issued after news reports and speculations suggested a mutant strain similar to one found in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil was found in the state. Following the spike in cases, the state health department and local administrations have swung into damage control mode. In the districts where the cases have shown a surge, local administrations have decided to introduce stringent restrictions. Schools and colleges in Wardha district of Maharashtra have been ordered to remain closed until further notice, district collector Prerna Deshbhratar said. Weekend lockdown, excluding emergency services, will begin at Amravati and Akola from 8pm on Saturday and will go on till 7am on Monday. This is to check crowding at market places during weekends. Yavatmal district has already imposed a 10-day lockdown since Friday. Schools for students of Classed 5 to 9, colleges, and coaching classes in the district will remain shut till February 28, district officials said. Experts said the situation is still under control. A senior bureaucrat said the measures are largely similar to those being followed by administration for the early part of the pandemic. “Since CM’s review [on February 16], the districts have been asked to become more vigilant. There is nothing beyond the three Ts — tracking, testing and treatment. The districts have been told to impose restrictions depending on the severity. The mutation of the virus in some parts of the district has led to a faster spread. Micro containment zones should be marked to keep the spread in that pocket,” the official said, requesting anonymity. State health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said that district collectors and municipal commissioners are already directed to track at least 20-30 contacts within the first 48 hours of identifying the index case. Vyas, in a letter to district administrations on Wednesday, said the number of tests per day for Covid needs to be at least 20 times the new cases coming in that district or municipal corporation. All symptomatic cases necessarily need to be tested on RT-PCR and use of Rapid Antigen Test be kept minimum to the extent possible. “There is a definite increase in the number of new cases over the past one week and we need to be alert, as at present the number in absolute terms seems small but the nature of infection is such that if appropriate containment measures are not taken immediately, the cases are likely to rise exponentially,” Vyas said. The state’s statement said, “Four samples each from Amravati, Yavatmal and Satara have been tested at BJ Medical College in Pune. According to test reports, no change has been found in the genetic sequence of the virus in the samples taken from these districts.” Twelve samples from Pune have also been tested in this medical college and no change in genetic sequence has been found in them either, it added. “Further investigations are underway and some more samples from Akola, Amravati and Yavatmal districts have been sent to the National Institute of Virology and National Institute of Cell Science, Pune for genetic testing. A detailed report in this regard is expected by next week,” the health department said. Dr TP Lahane, director of Medical Education and Research, said although the cases are on the rise in Mumbai and in districts such Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal etc., it cannot be called a second wave. “In any epidemic, there are troughs and crests. There was a decline earlier, now it is increasing, but it is not a second wave,” he told reporters. Dr Shashank Joshi said, “We want to prevent another wave; this is not second wave. There will be a small peak which can be prevented. Micro-containment will help. The lockdown that is imposed [in the districts] will also help.” He added people should avoid traveling unless necessary, while masking is absolutely mandatory. He further said the people need to remain more vigilant for the next 15 days. Meanwhile, on Friday 14,880 beneficiaries got inoculated across 413 centres in the state. The health department attributed the low numbers to public holiday. Of the ones inoculated, 12,032, including 7,661 frontline workers, got their first shot, while 2,848 healthcare workers got their second dose. So far, 854,985 beneficiaries have been inoculated. A health department official said, “We are confident that the turnout will pick up. Those who think that vaccination is not of any help should reconsider. Even though there were isolated cases of some doctors getting infected after the first dose, the vaccine is important to build herd immunity. With vaccine shots, nearly 80% will remain protected against the virus. Those who might get infected after taking the vaccine, too, will only have mild symptoms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-crosses-6-000-new-covid-cases-after-83-days-101613759820570.html
20-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai crime branch busts card cloning racket, arrests four||Mumbai Police’s crime branch arrested four people including a hotel manager for allegedly duping several people to the tune of around ₹20 lakh by cloning their debit and credit cards. The accused withdrew money using the cloned cards from distant places in Pune and Satara districts, so as to avoid being traced.The arrested accused are Mohammad Faiz Choudhary, 27; Yashwant Gupta, 23; Azaruddin Ansari, 23; and Ishtiaq Jamal Khan, 22 — all residents of Goregaon and Jogeshwari. Police said the gang was operating from more than six months.Police officers have received details of 20 victims so far and are trying to retrieve more information from the laptop of an accused.Activities of the gang came to light when an official of a nationalised bank approached unit 9 of the crime branch in Bandra complaining about several customers being duped by online fraudsters, though they had not shared their card details with anyone.The complainant also informed that all the victims had visited the same hotel at Powai, said a police officer.Crime branch unit 9 then inquired with the hotel owner and learnt that he had removed Yashwant Gupta alias Sonu, manager, a few days ago after learning that Gupta skimmed customers’ debit and credit cards using a device, said inspector Nandkumar Gopale.“We laid a trap near the hotel and managed to nab Gupta on February 17. During interrogation, Gupta said he had instructed waiters to bring customer’s credit and debit cards to him and he discreetly swapped the cards on a skimmer device” added Gopale. He further said that he used to personally visit the customer concerned at their tables and used to see the customer enter the PIN and memorised the same, said the officer.

20-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai BJP leader held in illegal immigrant case: Congress, NCP seek probe||The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have demanded a probe after police arrested Rubel Jonu Shaikh, president of north Mumbai minority cell of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for living illegally in the country for years. Shaikh is allegedly a Bangladeshi immigrant living in Malad illegally for around 10 years. Malvani police recently arrested 24-year old Shaikh in a crackdown on illegal immigrants and booked him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Passport (Entry into India) Act and Foreigners Act. The police investigation revealed that he was a Bangladesh national who has been living in Mumbai illegally since 2011. The investigation also revealed that the accused had prepared fake identity cards such as PAN and Aadhaar cards with the help of forged documents.Shaikh is the chairman of minority cell of the party’s north Mumbai youth wing, according to the police report. NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase wrote a letter to state home minister Anil Deshmukh seeking an investigation into the Bangladesh connection. “I am surprised that BJP leaders, who are always on the forefront for action against people speaking against them, terming them anti-nationals, are silent on this issue,” he said.Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “On one hand, the BJP is bringing Citizenship Amendment Act for the action against illegal residents, on the other, its own office-bearers are proved to be Bangladeshis. The party should clarify if they have made some special provision in the Act for their own people. Is this some type of jihad in the party?”BJP leader and legislator Ashish Shelar hit back at the Congress and raised question over the nationality of the Congress leaders. “None of our party workers or office-bearers belongs to Bangladesh. Police are free to take action against any such person if they have sufficient evidence. Sawant’s allegations are baseless and levelled for the sake of publicity. We would not ask him which country his party president belongs to,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bjp-leader-held-in-illegal-immigrant-case-congress-ncp-seek-probe-101613759640182.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||Dense February fog leaves weather experts surprised||Delhi over the last one week has witnessed a “never seen before” weather phenomenon for this time of the year. The temperatures have remained higher than normal, but the morning and evening hours have witnessed dense fog.IMD categorises fog into four categories based on visibility-shallow (visibility up to 500 metres), moderate (up to 200m), dense (up to 50m) and very dense (zero visibility).India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said that Delhi has been witnessing dense fog since Monday, when visibility had fallen to less than 50 metres for some hours. Delhi, however, was not alone to be covered in this thick layer of fog. According to MeT officials, this fog cover has persisted during morning and evening hours above the entire Delhi-Haryana-Punjab region since February 11.Scientists said that such dense fog over this region in the latter part of February was “never seen before”. IMD recordings show that till February 19, Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport had already witnessed dense fog conditions for 13 hours, as against the average of 12 hours that is usually witnessed for the entire month.Data also shows that in December last year, Delhi had experienced only one hour of very dense fog when visibility had hit zero.In February, very dense fog has already been recorded for 3-4 hours. On Friday too, visibility at the Palam weather station fell below 50 metres. Other parts of the city also witnessed moderate fog.RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre, said that such a long spell of dense fog has not been witnessed at such a large region at this time of the year ever before.“This pattern of fog over Delhi and neighbouring states is unusual and has never been seen before. We have recorded dense fog over Delhi in February before, but that is only for two or three days, and that too in the first week of February. This time, the fog spell has occurred even when the night time temperature was 2-3 degrees above normal and that is unique,” said Jenamani.He added that this weather phenomenon has also led to the visibility falling to zero in parts of Punjab as early as 7-8pm.Weather recordings show that Delhi has been experiencing higher than normal maximum and minimum temperatures this month. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that except for four days, Delhi this February has recorded temperatures 3-4 degrees above normal.“The maximum and the minimum temperatures have seen a spike this time and this is primarily because of clear skies and the absence of an active western disturbance over the plains for a prolonged period. Because there is no cloud cover, sunlight is hitting the ground with no interruptions,” Srivastava said.On Friday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, was 26.8 degrees Celsius, two degrees below the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was 9.9 degrees Celsius.He also said that high pollution in Delhi is also contributing to low visibility.“The low wind speed is not letting the pollution particles disperse and that coupled with the fog is also hampering visibility,” Srivastava said.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that on Friday, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 311, in the ‘very poor’ zone.Scientists also explained that the last active western disturbance over Delhi was on February 4, and such a prolonged absence, can also be a reason behind foggy mornings and evenings. Another reason behind high temperatures and fog conditions is low wind speed and easterly winds coming into Delhi from Madhya Pradesh.Easterly winds tend to be high in moisture content, and this has kept the levels of humidity high in Delhi. High moisture and low wind speed are basically the perfect combination for fog formation.IMD forecast also showed that February this year is expected to break records of higher than usual temperatures and could also be the month when most number of dense fog days are recorded.“There are no western disturbances forecasted, which means that foggy mornings and higher temperatures are expected to continue,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/never-before-seen-fog-phenomenon-in-delhi-leaves-met-experts-surprised-101613756759528.html

The green war room, set up to receive complaints against various agencies, is also being strengthened so that action could be taken against the erring officials, Rai said.“An action plan will be prepared, after discussing the suggestions received at the round table conference with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal,” the environment minister said.He said officials have informed him that the smog tower being constructed in Connaught Place with a cost of ₹20 crore will be completed by June.A team has also been formed to monitor the work on the tower so that timelines for its completion are strictly followed, Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-forms-seven-member-expert-group-to-draw-up-long-term-pollution-action-plan-101613756758887.html
20-02-2021||Other||Makeshift structure comes up near site of razed Chandni Chowk temple||Nearly one-and-a-half months after the Hanuman temple in Chandni Chowk was demolished for the redevelopment project, a new temporary structure has come up on the central verge near the old site. The makeshift structure, locals claim, was constructed on Thursday night, though it is not known who built it.Till late Friday evening, there was no clarity from various government departments whether there was any permission for construction of the temple structure or not.The structure has been built on the 1.5-km-long stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid, which has been made a vehicle-free zone.The old temple, which was located on the pavement of the carriageway towards Red Fort, was demolished by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on the directions of the Delhi High Court on January 3. The action led to protest by various right-wing groups and triggered a blame game between the Aam Aadmi Party government and the Bharatiya Janata party-ruled North corporation.On Friday, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and Mayor of North corporation Jai Prakash, along with other senior party leaders, visited the makeshift temple to offer prayers.In January, leaders of the BJP met Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to request allotment of land near the old site for the reconstruction of the temple. When asked if the land has been allotted for the construction of the temple, Jai Prakash said, “The temple has been constructed by the devotees of the Lord Hanuman. I’m not aware about the permission given to construct it. But the temple will only add to the beauty of the area and the redevelopment project. The structure has come up on the central verge, where other facilities are also located.”Gupta said, “When I got to know about the new temple at the site, I went there to offer prayers. The old temple shouldn’t have been demolished in the first place; it was a mistake. Religious sentiments of lakhs of people living in the area and in the city were hurt when the 100-year-old temple was demolished. The new structure will not obstruct traffic and pedestrian movement; it will only add to the beauty of the area.”Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said he will visit the new temple on Saturday. Pathak tweeted, “Local residents of Chandni Chowk have constructed the old Hanuman temple. I’ll visit the temple tomorrow and offer prayers.”Throughout Friday, devotees queued up before the temple to offer prayers.Officials of the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the nodal agency for the redevelopment of the Chandni Chowk project, didn’t respond to HT’s query whether permission to construct the new structure was given or not.A senior police officer who did not want to be named said on Friday morning PWD officials informed the police the makeshift religious structure. “The structure is not at the same place where an old temple was demolished. The requisite police action is being taken. We have informed all agencies concerned. A formal complaint is yet to be received. We will take the legal action after a complaint is received,” the officer said.When contacted, the Delhi government in a statement said, “We are examining the issue”.The area falls in the jurisdiction of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. A senior North corporation official said, “As per our information, no permission has been given for the construction of the structure. We are examining the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/temporary-hanuman-temple-comes-up-in-chandni-chowk-101613756699519.html
20-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi may bring back Covid checks for domestic flyers||The Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) will convene a meeting on Monday to decide whether it was necessary to put in checks and safeguards — such as mandatory negative RT-PCR test reports — for people arriving from states where Covid-19 cases are spiking, said senior government officials on Friday.The meeting comes in the backdrop of Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday asserting during an event that the Capital is out of the “danger zone”.“The DDMA is meeting on Monday for review of Covid-19 situation in other states and union territories, especially those in which the number of cases are rising again,” confirmed Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev.Another senior official in the executive committee of the DDMA, who did not wish to be identified, said: “On Monday, the authority will also decide whether, at this stage, it is necessary to impose conditions such as mandatory RT-PCR test results – that are valid for 72 hours – for people arriving from the states where cases are rising again.”The DDMA is chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is the authority’s vice-chairperson.In Delhi, the daily test positivity rate has remained less than 1% for more than two months now. On Friday, government records showed, Delhi recorded 158 new Covid-19 cases and a positivity rate of 0.26% with 60,836 tests — of which 39,931 were RT-PCR tests, that are believed to be more accurate — being conducted. So far, 637,603 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in Delhi of which 625,653 people have recovered and 10,897 have died.“I feel now that all the three waves of Covid-19 have hit the city and it will die down eventually. Now it is no more a pandemic but an endemic… I hope we won’t see 8600 cases in a day. I feel we are out of the danger zone but we still need to take proper precautions, masks and social distancing needs to be maintained,” said Satyendar Jain on Friday at an event to felicitate health workers at Lok Nayak hospital – the city government’s biggest Covid-19 facility.At its peak, Delhi recorded 8,593 new Covid-19 cases on November 11 – the highest for a single day in the city.HT on Friday published a report that showed how Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir have witnessed their seven-day averages of daily Covid-19 cases rise by between 20% and 69% , which highlights the potential risk of a surge in cases amid fears of mutant strains gaining ground, and laxity in adhering to protocols due to Covid fatigue being reported across the country. In Kerala, the first wave continues unabated.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Cases are going up in several other states. With that, Delhi should immediately scale up surveillance and tests. The state should have anyway gone slow on some relaxations, especially those concerning closed spaces, such as movie halls and banquets. So, Delhi cannot scale down tests at any cost. Imposing conditions such as RT-PCR test for people arriving from other states, especially those where cases are rising again, should also help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-meeting-on-monday-on-deciding-covid-protocols-for-travellers-from-other-states-101613756698891.html
20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab tax evasion racket: HC dismisses bail pleas of 3 excise officials, 2 others||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed bail plea of five persons, including three excise and taxation department officials, in a multi-crore tax evasion case of Punjab.The high court bench of justice Jaishree Thakur, while dismissing the pleas, observed that no doubt the personal liberty of the petitioners is at stake, but in the instant case the custodial interrogation would be required to unearth the nexus between the them and the intermediaries. “In the case in hand, there has to be a deviation from normal rule of bail rather than jail, since the allegations and prima facie investigation revealed that there was evasion of tax at a large-scale and officials were being paid bribes on a monthly basis,” the bench observed adding that the investigation is at a very nascent stage and petitioners are also persons of influence and would be in a position to scuttle a proper investigation. The bail pleas were of ETOs, Ved Parkash Jakhar, Piara Singh and Tarlok Chand and two others Harmeet Singh and Yadwinder Singh. The FIR in question was registered on August 21, 2020 by vigilance bureau in which 12 officials of the excise and taxation department and four private persons were booked. Allegations were that in connivance with private transporters, these officials caused huge losses to the state exchequer. Tax evasion was committed through transporting goods of various traders into and out of Punjab paying less or no tax at all. The senior deputy advocate general, Gaurav Garg Dhuriwala had told court that there is sufficient evidence available with the state to prosecute them including mobile phone conversations between them among other evidence. Bail pleas of other accused are still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tax-evasion-racket-hc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-3-excise-officials-2-others-101613754958495.html
20-02-2021||Lucknow||Dalit girl had turned him down. He wanted to avenge insult: Cops on Unnao case||Two persons including a minor have been caught by the police for the murder of two teenage girls found in a field in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao district, a senior police officer said on Friday evening. A third girl, the oldest of the three, is in critical condition in a Kanpur hospital.The prime accused, Vinay Kumar, 21, wanted to rape one of three girls who had turned him down earlier. He offered her water laced with a pesticide in the hope that she would fall unconscious. But the other two also drank from the same bottle. Vinay Kumar panicked when all three fell unconscious and fled with his accomplice, Lucknow Range inspector general Laxmi Singh told reporters in state capital Lucknow.Vinay's family owns a field next to the one owned by one of the girl’s fathers. During the lockdown, Vinay regularly visited the field, so did the girls, to collect fodder. He came closer to one of them and met her frequently. Vinay wanted to develop physical intimacy with the girl but she rejected his overtures regularly, said the police.“Vinay told the police he had asked for her phone number, proposed to her but she always refused. He was angry with her and sought revenge for his insult,” said Singh.Also read: Toolkit case - Greta Thunberg extends support to jailed activist Disha Ravi"On the fateful, day he reached the fields with his friend. He offered the girls some chips. Then the girl he eyed asked for water. He gave her water that was laced with pesticides. Soon, the two other girls also drank from the bottle, he told the police," said Singh.As the girls complained of vertigo and fell unconscious, Vinay and his friend panicked. They dragged them to their field and ran away.With the help of villagers, the police learnt about Vinay’s presence in his field at the time the girls were there. The Special Operation Group team picked him up with three others from Pathakpur village. The brothers of the girls were also detained for questioning.One of the brothers remained a key suspect as he was unable to account for his four-hour-long absence from the village. Both the brothers were released on Thursday night and Friday noon respectively.Vinay broke down when his location was also found at the field during the time of the commission of the crime and as per some eyewitness account of people who had seen them fleeing the field in a state of panic.While Vinay is 21 years old, the minor is 15, according to the police. Both accused have been held on charges under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The police have also slapped Section 201 against the accused for disappearance of evidence on a complaint of a victim’s father, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/unnao-case-police-say-boy-sought-vengeance-as-girl-rejected-physical-intimacy-101613752170984.html

Cloudy weather was seen at some places in the state on Friday. Dada Bhuse, Maharashtra agriculture minister, said, “I visited some areas in Nashik district where onion, grape and pomegranate crops were damaged. Only after survey by the department will the exact estimation of damage be known.” Bhuse said, “I have instructed the agricultural department to carry out “panchnamas” (inspection reports) of damaged crops and submit a report to be placed before the cabinet and seek compensation for farmers.” Many districts like Pune, Nashik, Satara, Kolhapur, Solapur and some parts of Konkan saw unseasonal rains on Thursday. Shankar Bhamre, a farmer from Nashik district, said, “My grape vineyard ready for plucking was damaged by the unexpected hailstorm.” Vilas Jagtap, who has farmland in Alephata area, said, “Our standing crops were damaged by unseasonal rains.

20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat procurement: Centre has allowed us to pay farmers directly or through arhtiyas, says Punjab minister||For the upcoming wheat procurement, expected to begin from April 1 in Punjab, the Centre has allowed the state government to make disbursal of crop payments to farmers either directly or through the arhtiyas (commission agents). As mandated by the Centre, state’s food and civil supplies department has already implemented public finance management system (PFMS) two years ago and have made payments of two each rabi and kharif crops through the system. “The central ministry (food and public distribution) had earlier asked the Punjab government to make mandatory direct payment to farmers through the PFMS system and has given a deadline to implement it in the upcoming rabi (wheat) procurement, but there are farmers who are reluctant to adopt this system,” said state’s food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. He added that at a meeting with home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday in Delhi, the issue was discussed and state the government was allowed to make it optional on the pattern of Haryana. Shah’s meeting with Ashu took place after Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh took up the matter with the latter. The issue cropped up as the Centre wants the states, particularly Punjab and Haryana, where foodgrains are procured in huge quantities, to restrict the role of arhtiyas. “For that, we have to amend our agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) act so as to negate the role of arhtiyas. However, on state’s request, the home minister has agreed that in case farmers give the consent for getting payment through arhtiyas, there is no problem,” said Ashu, hoping that an official order is also expected in the coming week. The state government has started the process for wheat procurement and sought ₹24,400 crore as cash credit limit (CCL) from the Centre. As per the state agriculture department’s estimate of a bumper crop, the state food department is making preparations to procure 132 lakh tonnes grain through the state’s five procurement agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI).

20-02-2021||World||Dozens protest in support of anti-migrant group in Paris||Dozens of people rallied in Paris Saturday to support the anti-migrant group Generation Identity, which is fighting for survival following a government order to dissolve it.An Associated Press reporter saw around 200 protesters, including journalists, at Saturday afternoon’s demonstrations, which were largely peaceful. A counter demonstration also took place in southern Paris against the controversial group.Generation Identity has scraped through several legal battles, but is up against Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who wants to disband the controversial group. Critics contend it is a militia espousing a racist cause.The Lyon-based group has influence throughout France and beyond. It contends its members are whistle-blowers on a mission to preserve French and European civilization, seen as undermined by newcomers, notably Muslims.Generation Identity was the backbone of a 2017 “Defend Europe” mission on the high seas with a chartered anti-migrant ship manned by European citizens.Darmanin announced earlier this month the start of proceedings to dissolve Generation Identity. The group was given 10 days to make its case. The Interior Ministry cited France’s security code forbidding “combat or private militia groups” and groups that “provoke discrimination, hate or (racial) violence,” according to the daily Liberation which saw a copy of the seven-page justification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-protest-in-support-of-anti-migrant-group-in-paris-101613842654033.html
20-02-2021||World||Warmer temps bring relief as cold-weary South starts cleanup||Warmer temperatures spread across the southern United States on Saturday, bringing some relief to a winter weary region that faces a challenging clean-up and expensive repairs from days of extreme cold and widespread power outages.In hard-hit Texas, where millions were warned to boil tap water before drinking it, the warm-up was expected to last for several days.President Joe Biden declared a major disaster in Texas on Friday, directing federal agencies to help in the recovery.The fallout included busted water pipes and shortages of clean drinking water, the closure of the Memphis airport and hospitals struggling to maintain sanitary conditions.At least 69 deaths have been blamed on the weather, including that of a man at an Abilene health care facility where the lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.Many people who perished were struggling to get warm. A Tennessee farmer died trying to save two calves that apparently wandered onto a frozen pond.About 260,000 homes and businesses in the Tennessee county that includes Memphis were told to boil water because of water main ruptures and pumping station problems. Restaurants that could not do so or did not have bottled water were ordered to close.Water pressure problems prompted Memphis International Airport to cancel all incoming and outgoing Friday flights, but the passenger terminal was expected to reopen by midafternoon Saturday.The storms left more than 300,000 still without power across the country by Saturday morning. About 60,000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm. Oregon’s governor ordered the National Guard to go door-to-door in the hardest-hit areas to ensure residents have enough food and water.In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.He said the city’s water mains are more than 100 years old and not built to handle the freezing weather that hit the city as multiple storms dumped record amounts of snow across the South.“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” said Lumumba.The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to pick it up, leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, has only enough heart medication to get him through Sunday because she hasn’t been able to go to the pharmacy.“People are in dire need here,” Thomas said.Paul Lee Davis got to the front of the line at a water station set up by city officials only to have the water run out. He was still waiting for it to be replenished three and a half hours after arriving.“We need water, the stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have,” Davis said.The water woes were the latest misery for people across the South who went without heat or electricity for days after the ice and snow storms earlier in the week forced rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.Texas electrical grid operators said electricity transmission had returned to normal for the first time since historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand that buckled the state’s power grid and causing the widespread blackouts.Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now can provide power throughout the system.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached breaking point.The rolling blackouts resulted in a lawsuit filed Friday in a Nueces County court at law in Corpus Christi, claiming ERCOT ignored repeated warnings of weaknesses in the state’s power infrastructure.A Dallas law firm alleged ERCOT and the American Electric Power utility caused property damage and business interruptions during the cold wave.Also, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued civil investigative demands to ERCOT and electric utility companies, vowing to get “to the bottom of this power failure.” The investigation will cover power outages, emergency plans, energy pricing and more related to the winter storm.“The large-scale failure of Texas power companies to withstand the winter storm left multiple millions of Texans without power and heat during lethal, record-low temperatures across the state,” Paxton’s office said in a statement.In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.As of Friday afternoon, more than 1,300 Texas public water systems and 159 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions affecting more than 14.9 million people, according to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokeswoman Tiffany Young.More than 1 million gallons (3.8 million liters) of water was being trucked Friday to the Texas capital. But Austin’s water director, Greg Maszaros, implored residents to minimize the use of home faucets because “there’s still a lot of unknowns as we pressurize the system.”In Dallas, David Lopez said the plumbing company he works for received more than 600 calls for service over the last week.“It’s pretty much first come, first served,” said Lopez, as he and a colleague manhandled a new water heater out of their van on Friday. “Everyone’s got emergencies.”Houston residents probably will have to boil tap water until Sunday or Monday, said Mayor Sylvester Turner.Water service was restored Friday to two Houston Methodist community hospitals, but officials still were bringing in drinking water and some elective surgeries were canceled, spokeswoman Gale Smith said.St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis said it was forced to switch to bottled drinking water and bagged ice and that staff and patients were washing with hand sanitizer and no-rinse bathing wipes. All non-urgent surgeries were postponed.Rhodes College in Memphis said Friday that about 700 residential students were being moved to hotels in the suburbs of Germantown and Collierville after school bathrooms stopped functioning because of low water pressure.Central Arkansas Water in the Little Rock area asked customers to conserve water to help protect its system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was “critically low” and also asked customers to conserve.A broken pipe at the Museum of Discovery in Little Rock flooded its building, causing extensive damage to theaters, galleries and offices and killing one display animal, a blue-tongued skink lizard.More than 192,000 Louisiana residents -- some still struggling to recover from last August’s Hurricane Laura -- had no water service Friday, according to the state health department. Tens of thousands more remained under boil-water advisories.Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned for the hardest-hit areas with a focus on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said, adding that he was hopeful that warmer weather expected during the weekend would speed up repairs.In the Louisiana community of Hackberry, Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn’t because he didn’t have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and sent her two daughters to stay at another home.“People are still just struggling over here,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warmer-temps-bring-relief-as-cold-weary-south-starts-cleanup-101613842404445.html

The hospital's website says visits are only allowed in “exceptional circumstances” because of the coronavirus pandemic.Philip, 99, was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday on the advice of his doctor in what Buckingham Palace described as “a precautionary measure.”The husband of Queen Elizabeth II is expected to remain through the weekend and into next week.Philip’s illness is not believed to be related to Covid-19. Both he and the queen, 94, received a first dose of a vaccine against the coronavirus in early January.Philip, who retired from public duties in 2017, rarely appears in public. His most recent public event was a military ceremony at Buckingham Palace in July.During England’s current coronavirus lockdown, Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, has been staying at Windsor Castle, west of London, with the queen, who has performed duties such as meetings with dignitaries remotely.The royal household is planning celebrations to mark Philip’s 100th birthday on June 10, lockdown restrictions permitting.Philip married the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and is the longest-serving royal consort in British history. He and the queen have four children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.The youngest great-grandchild, son of Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, was born Feb. 9 and has been named Augustus Philip Hawke Brooksbank, with one of his middle names a tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-charles-visits-99-year-old-prince-philip-in-hospital-101613842189659.html
20-02-2021||World||Covid-19 pandemic makes prostitution taboo in Nevada's legal brothels||Before the coronavirus pandemic, tourist-dependent Nevada had a notorious attraction: It was the only place in America where someone could legally pay for sex.These days, even in the state known for sin, the business is taboo.Legal brothels have been shuttered for nearly a year, leaving sex workers to offer less-lucrative alternatives like online dates or nonsexual escort services. Those in the industry say many of the licensed prostitutes, who work as independent contractors, have struggled to qualify for unemployment benefits since closures began last March and some have opted to take their work into the shadows, offering sex illegally.While the business of legal bordellos may seem incompatible with social distancing, sex workers and brothel owners say that’s not the case. Like other close-contact industries such as massage therapy and dental services, they contend brothels should be allowed to reopen with protective measures.“We could easily do work at arm’s length, just the same as they do within the massage parlors, which are open in the state of Nevada,” sex worker Alice Little said. “You can go to a dentist and have him put his hands in your mouth. You can go to a tattoo parlor and get your face tattooed right now. You can get piercings put in your face. You’re certainly not masked for any of those things."So far, Nevada officials haven't agreed.A state task force that makes recommendations on coronavirus restrictions hasn't responded to pleas from brothel owners seeking a way to reopen. And a lawsuit Little filed against Gov. Steve Sisolak last year fizzled.The Democratic governor recently said brothels, along with other adult entertainment like nightclubs and strip clubs, would stay closed at least through May 1. After that, the state may let counties decide whether to allow those businesses to open, as long as Covid-19 infections aren't surging.Nevada, like many states, saw a spike of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths around the winter holidays, but since mid-January, those numbers have been steadily declining.Prostitution is only legal in Nevada's estimated 20 licensed brothels, whose sex workers undergo regular tests for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS and obtain required work cards from local law enforcement after passing an FBI background check.A throwback to the state’s days as a Wild West mining territory, brothels were illegal but tolerated in some areas until Nevada legalized them in 1971.They’re only allowed to operate in counties with populations of less than 700,000 people. Brothels and prostitution are illegal in the counties that include Las Vegas and Reno, but some brothels are a half-hour to an hour away. Some offer free limo rides from the casino-heavy cities.Little, who was working at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch brothel in the capital of Carson City, says she has lost 95% of her income amid the closures. She said she’s been providing virtual dates, webcam experiences and creating X-rated content through subscriber site OnlyFans, among other ventures.“At this point, I am able to survive. I am able to pay my bills. I’m able to put food on the table, but I have had to dip into my savings," Little said.Other brothel workers who are not comfortable linking their faces to online sex work have had a harder time pivoting to virtual services, she said. Finding a job outside the stigmatized sex industry also can be tough, Little said, because background checks can reveal the work authorization cards prostitutes must have in brothels.Allissa Starr, who was working at Sheri’s Ranch brothel in Pahrump, about an hour outside Las Vegas, said some women she worked with are illegally offering sex for money despite virus concerns.“They’re just doing what they can,” she said.Starr, like Little, started offering virtual dates, where she might share a glass of wine, dinner and conversation with clients. Starr said she eventually got assistance under the federal pandemic unemployment program for gig workers, but it was about 10% of what she had been making and is set to run out soon.Starr said she's able to cover her bills but can no longer put thousands in savings. She moved to Pittsburgh to live closer to family and save on rent. She's starting a self-care business but said if Nevada’s brothels reopen, she’d come back to work one week a month.“It’s a way to easily provide money for me and my family, and it’s a way to provide security,” Starr said.Reopening the brothels, Starr said, is “a personal risk, just like traveling. If you wear your mask, if the girls got Covid tests before they came to the ranch, I think it could be done safely.”Mustang Ranch, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of Reno, appears to be the only brothel still offering some kind of companionship, taking advantage of an escort license it's had for about two decades. The license allows customers to hire women for nonsexual companionship.Owner Lance Gilman said temperatures are taken, masks are worn and customers must come to the ranch and say where they’ll go on a date, typically a restaurant or casino.Gilman said it’s a much-reduced operation — usually, about 30 women were available for hire 24/7. Only three or four women are working as escorts because many of them are uncomfortable leaving the security of the property for a date, he said.Mustang Ranch submitted a proposed plan to state officials that suggests reopening for contactless dates in private rooms, with masks and gloves worn by workers."In this industry, much, if not the majority, of the courtesan-customer interaction does not involve physical contact even during normal business operations,” the proposal says.State officials haven't approved the plan.Asked how the brothel could ensure sex workers and customers have no physical contact behind closed doors, Gilman said there’s no way to make such a guarantee: “All you can do is rely upon the credibility and the ethics of the commitments that are made.”“Human nature is human nature,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-makes-prostitution-taboo-in-nevada-s-legal-brothels-101613840468870.html

A Moscow City Court judge only reduced the sentence from two years and eight months to just over 2 1/2 years.The verdict came even as the country faced a top European rights court’s order to free Navalny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-court-fines-opposition-leader-navalny-for-defaming-wwii-veteran-101613840889545.html
20-02-2021||World||India, Maldives sign 5 deals, EAM hands over 1 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines||India and the Maldives on Saturday signed five agreements, including one for a $25-million line of credit for development of roads, as visiting external affairs minister S Jaishankar handed over 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the Indian Ocean archipelago.Jaishankar held talks with Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Shahid as he began a two-day visit to review bilateral ties and development cooperation. Jaishankar also offered a $40-million line of credit to support the development of sports infrastructure in Maldives, one of the biggest beneficiaries of Indian assistance in the neighbourhood.This is Jaishankar’s second foreign visit this year, and the trip will also take him to Mauritius on February 22. He visited Sri Lanka last month and will travel to Bangladesh in March to prepare the ground for a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“The ‘India First’ foreign policy of President [Ibrahim] Solih is reciprocated in full measure by Prime Minister Modi’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, in which the Maldives enjoys a central position,” Jaishankar said at a media interaction with Shahid.Speaking in Hindi, Shahid described the two countries as the wings of a bird. “A bird in flight stays true on course, with not one but two wings in synchronised motion. Our two countries are just like those wings. We work in harmony; we work together, with the same interests, aiming to reach the same destination.”Among the five agreements signed by the two sides was one to repurpose the balance of a $40-million line of credit provided by India in 2011 and use $25 million to develop roads across the Maldives. India’s EXIM Bank and local authorities signed a letter of intent on financing a housing project of 2,000 units at Hulhumale.The two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a grant of $500,000 for a fish processing plant at Kendhikulhudhoo in northern Maldives, a MoU between Prasar Bharati and Public State Media of the Maldives on capacity building and exchange of content and expertise, and a MoU on sustainable urban development.Jaishankar handed over 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, provided as a grant, to Shahid and health minister Ahmed Naseem. The Maldives had earlier received another 100,000 doses last month under India’s Vaccine Maitri initiative.The Maldives, Jaishankar noted, was the “first and largest recipient of India’s Covid-19 support, and had received Indian-made vaccines within 96 hours of the rollout of New Delhi’s vaccination programme. The Maldives has since become third best in the world in terms of daily doses administered for every 100 people, he said.Jaishankar and Shahid also reviewed the ongoing India-backed infrastructure projects under two lines of credit worth $1.2 billion. A contract for a key infrastructure project for building roads in Addu will be signed on Sunday. Jaishankar also noted that the Greater Malé Connectivity Project, the largest connectivity venture in the Maldives, is in tendering stage, while other projects, such as the Hanimadhoo airport expansion and development of Gulifalhu port, are progressing well.“Needless to say, these projects will conform to the hallmarks of Indian development cooperation, which are transparency, full participation and ownership of the host country and competitive pricing,” he said.Jaishankar also reiterated India’s support to the candidature of Shahid for the post of president of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in 2022. Jaishankar said that Shahid, with his diplomatic experience and leadership qualities, is “best equipped to preside over the General Assembly of 193 nations”.He added, “We will work together to make this a reality. We would really like to work with you during our membership of the UN Security Council for 2021-22.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-maldives-sign-5-deals-eam-hands-over-1-lakh-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-101613839151370.html
20-02-2021||World||Impeachment vote becomes defining moment for Republican senator||When Sen. Richard Burr stood and said “guilty,” there were hushed gasps in the Senate chamber. But the North Carolina Republican’s vote to convict former President Donald Trump should not have come as a shock.In a way, he had been telegraphing his willingness to hold Trump accountable for several years.Months before Trump would begin falsely claiming the election had been stolen, the Senate Intelligence Committee led by Burr warned that sitting public officials should use the “absolute greatest amount of restraint and caution if they are considering publicly calling the validity of an upcoming election into question.” Such grave allegations, the committee said in February 2020, can have “significant” consequences for national security.Explaining his vote to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Burr returned to that theme. He said Trump “promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to cast doubt on the integrity of a free and fair election.”There was no widespread fraud in the election, as Trump claimed falsely over several months and again to his supporters just before the riot, a fact confirmed by election officials across the country and even Trump's then-attorney general, William Barr.When the Capitol was attacked, Burr said in the statement, Trump “used his office to first inflame the situation instead of immediately calling for an end to the assault.”For Burr, it was an emphatic statement after years of careful commentary about Trump, much of it made as he investigated Trump's ties to Russia. The “guilty” vote placed him among a group of seven Republicans in the Senate -- and 10 Republicans in the House -- who made Trump’s second impeachment the most bipartisan in history.With Burr retiring at the end of his term in 2022, it’s a vote that could end up defining his career.It also came with price.The North Carolina Republican Party unanimously voted to censure Burr in the days after the Feb. 13 vote as Republicans in the state and across the country made clear their continued loyalty to Trump.“Wrong vote, Sen. Burr,” tweeted former Republican Rep. Mark Walker, who has already declared his Senate candidacy.Burr declined to be interviewed for this story. But many of his GOP colleagues praised him after the vote.North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican who voted to acquit Trump, said after the state censure vote that Burr is a “great friend and a great senator” who had voted his conscience. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, one of the seven Republicans who voted to convict and a member of the Intelligence Committee, said Burr "is a leader, not a motormouth" who distinguished himself with bipartisan work on the committee.A quirky, quiet politician known for his dry sense of humor, his distaste for wearing socks and for driving a 1970s-era convertible Volkswagen plastered with bumper stickers, Burr has served in Congress for almost three decades. A former Wake Forest football player and lawn equipment salesman, he was elected to the House during the Republican wave of 1994 and became close friends with Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, before Boehner became speaker.First elected to the Senate in 2004, Burr said after his 2016 reelection that his third term would be his last —- a preemptive retirement from politics that proved consequential.After Trump’s victory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wrestled with how to respond to allegations of Russia’s interference in the election. With Burr not seeking another term, he was an ideal candidate to lead the politically explosive investigation.Empowered as committee chairman, Burr gradually became a quiet check on Trump’s powers during the three-year investigation. He worked closely the top Democrat on the committee, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, as they sifted through highly classified information, some of it about Trump and his associates.Burr kept up the partnership even as Republicans turned sharply against the investigation and followed Trump’s lead in labeling it all a “hoax.”Warner said in an interview he thinks one of main things that guided Burr was to ensure that intelligence agencies got “the respect they deserve.” That meant pushing back on Trump, who criticized the agencies for investigating Russia and suggested they had conspired against him by undermining the 2016 election. Burr endorsed the agencies’ 2017 conclusion that Russia had interfered and favored Trump, even as Trump declined to do so.Burr has “shown time and again he’s going to do what he thinks is right,” Warner said.As the investigation dragged on, patience wore thin among Burr's GOP colleagues. More than two years into the investigation, in May 2019, Burr subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son who had met with a Russian lawyer during the campaign. The backlash from Burr's own party was swift.Exactly a year later, as the Russia investigation was wrapping up, Burr’s time leading the committee ended abruptly.Federal agents arrived at Burr’s Washington-area home and seized his cellphone. The Justice Department was investigating whether he had exploited advance information when he unloaded as much as $1.7 million in stocks in the days before the coronavirus outbreak caused markets to plummet. Burr denied trading on private information but stepped aside from his role on the committee.He wasn’t cleared until almost a year later — on Jan. 19, Trump’s last full day in office.As the impeachment process unfolded in January, Burr said very little. He sided with most Republicans in a vote to dismiss the trial, creating an expectation he’d also vote to acquit.So when Burr stood up to vote for Trump's conviction, many wondered if there would be other surprises. Could there be enough Republican “guilty” votes to make Trump the first president even convicted at an impeachment trial? Was Burr a bellwether?He wasn't. The 57-43 vote was 10 short of the needed two-thirds majority. Seven Republicans had voted to convict — but only Burr’s came with no warning.“I do not make this decision lightly,” Burr said in a statement after the vote, “but I believe it is necessary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-vote-becomes-defining-moment-for-republican-senator-101613837290554.html
20-02-2021||World||Nigerian Instagram star aided North Korea cyber crime, US Says||A Nigerian social-media celebrity helped North Korean hackers launder money stolen from a Maltese bank, US officials said.Ramon Olorunwa Abbas played a supporting role in cyber-scams perpetrated by three computer programmers accused of extorting more than $1.3 billion of cash and cryptocurrency, the Justice Department said on Feb. 17. Abbas, who is widely known as “Hushpuppi” and is in US custody while awaiting trial, has 2.5 million followers on Instagram, where he regularly posted photographs posing with luxury cars or boarding private jets.North Korean state operatives “are the world’s leading bank robbers,” John Demers, head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said, after unsealing the indictment of Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il and Park Jin Hyok. The trio and other unidentified North Koreans were involved in the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. in 2014 and the attempted theft of nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh’s central bank in 2016, according to the US government. More recently, the group has focused on stealing cryptocurrencies, according to prosecutors.The hackers allegedly turned to a network including Abbas “to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist” from an unidentified Maltese bank in February 2019. The Nigerian worked with a Canadian, Ghaleb Alaumary, who US officials accused of organising teams to launder millions of dollars stolen by hacking automated teller machines, including from BankIslami in Pakistan and a bank in India, according to the Justice Department.Alaumary, 37, began cooperating with US authorities in October 2019 and secretly signed a plea agreement last November, according to court papers unsealed in Los Angeles on Feb. 17.Abbas was extradited in July from Dubai to the US where he faces criminal charges of allegedly conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from “business email compromise” frauds and other scams.Gal Pissetzky, Abbas’s former lawyer, told Forbes magazine in July 2020 that he was “absolutely not guilty” of those charges and hadn’t taken part in in any fraud. Pissetzky and Abbas’s other lawyer both quit the defense in January.The Nigerian was part of a group that allegedly tricked a paralegal at a US law firm into wiring them almost $923,000 in October 2019, according to US authorities. He and a partner also are accused of plotting to steal 100 million pounds ($125 million) from an unnamed soccer club in the English Premier League.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigerian-instagram-star-aided-north-korea-cyber-crime-us-says-101613837266415.html
20-02-2021||World||New legislation would protect US drivers who hit protestors||When massive demonstrations against racial injustice erupted across the nation last summer, protesters used an increasingly common tactic to draw attention to their cause: swarming out onto major roads to temporarily paralyze traffic.This method sometimes resulted in searing images of drivers plowing through crowds, causing serious injuries and in some cases, deaths.Now, Republican politicians across the country are moving to stop the road-blocking maneuver, proposing increased penalties for demonstrators who run onto highways and legal immunity for drivers who hit them. The bills are among dozens introduced in Legislatures aimed at cracking down on demonstrations.“It’s not going to be a peaceful protest if you’re impeding the freedom of others,” said Rep. Kevin McDugle, the author of an Oklahoma bill granting criminal and civil immunity to people who drive into crowds on roads. “The driver of that truck had his family in there, and they were scared to death."He referred to an incident in July in which a pickup truck pulling a horse trailer drove through Black Lives Matter protesters on Interstate 244 in Tulsa. Three people were seriously injured, including a 33-year-old man who fell from an overpass and was left paralyzed from the waist down.Tumultuous demonstrations by left-leaning and right-leaning groups have stirred new debate about what tactics are acceptable free speech and which go too far. In addition to blocking roads, Black Lives Matter demonstrators have taken over parks and painted slogans on streets and structures, while right-wing groups have brandished firearms and stormed capitol buildings. Local authorities' responses have wavered as they try to avoid escalating conflicts.Now legislators in Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, Utah and about a dozen other states have introduced new counterprotest measures.The traffic-blocking tactic has attracted the most concern because of the obvious hazard.In one particularly chilling incident in Minneapolis, a large tanker truck drove at high speed through thousands of protesters gathered on a closed highway. Remarkably, no one was seriously hurt, though a criminal complaint says at least one protester suffered abrasions.Mark Faulk, a longtime Oklahoma activist who was arrested last year for blocking a roadway, said dramatic tactics are necessary to get people's attention.“The idea of escalating it to the point where you disrupt the convenience of the citizens and of the status quo, you have to do that sometimes to make a point," Faulk said.But Carmyn Taylor, 20, recalled the sight of a pickup truck bearing down on protesters spread across the six-lane I-244 in Tulsa.“The most vivid thing I remember is when I got pulled to the ground. I remember seeing both sets of wheels run over my legs, which was a little traumatizing," said Taylor, who suffered a broken leg and a sprained ankle. “For the first two weeks after the accident, I couldn't walk."In Seattle, Summer Taylor, 24, was killed and another person was seriously injured in July when a man drove his car into protestors on a closed Seattle freeway. A graphic video posted on social media showed the car swerving around several parked cars and slamming into the two protesters, sending them flying into the air.In an incident in St. Louis in May, a 29-year-old man was dragged to his death beneath a tractor-trailer that drove into a sign-carrying group on a road.Whether drivers face criminal charges in such incidents depends on the circumstances of each case, prosecutors say. The tractor-trailer driver in St. Louis has not been criminally charged, while the driver of the car in Seattle has pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular homicide, vehicular assault and reckless driving.District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler declined to file charges against the driver in Tulsa, saying several people in the crowd had attacked the vehicle with the driver’s children inside. But Kunzweiler stopped short of endorsing proposals for harsher penalties for protestors or blanket immunity for drivers.“There are any number of laws already in place that are readily available to be enforced,” he said.A bill granting drivers immunity for hitting protestors easily cleared an Oklahoma Senate committee recently on a 8-1 vote. Two others are pending in the state House.But critics say the proposals are only designed to intimidate people, not to solve a problem.“The biggest concern is that they chill speech and they chill folks gathering to protest,” said Nicole McAfee, policy director for the Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.About 50 people were arrested during several days of protests in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail, and rioting, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. At least two men accused of burning a sheriff's van were charged under the state's anti-terrorism law, a felony that carries a sentence of up to life in prison. Those cases are pending.Proposals in Oklahoma would increase the criminal penalties for blocking a roadway, including one making it a felony punishable by up to two years in prison, and making it more difficult for those arrested to be released from jail. Another bill would add participating in unlawful assemblies to the state's racketeering act aimed at organized crime.State Rep. Emily Virgin, the Democratic leader in the Oklahoma House, said she wishes her Republican colleagues would focus on the underlying issues of police brutality and systemic racism instead of seeking ways to punish protesters.“It seems that some of my colleagues took the wrong lesson from the demonstrations we saw this summer,” Virgin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-legislation-would-protect-us-drivers-who-hit-protestors-101613836817684.html
20-02-2021||World||Biden approves major disaster declaration for Texas: FEMA||President Joe Biden has approved a major disaster declaration for Texas which has suffered widespread power blackouts and water shortages during a deadly deep freeze, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday.Millions of residents in the United States' biggest oil and gas producer have dealt with power outages, and nearly half of Texas' residents on Friday had to endure disrupted water service. Nearly two dozen deaths have been attributed to the storm and a frigid snap.The action makes federal funding available to individuals across the state, including assistance for temporary housing and home repairs and low-cost loans.Biden is also weighing a trip to Texas to survey the federal response to the first new crisis to develop since he took office a month ago.

It previously said such manoeuvres were a response to "collusion" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's main international backer and weapons supplier, and to safeguard Chinese sovereignty.The Pratas Islands sit in the top part of the South China Sea and are also claimed by China.Lying roughly between southern Taiwan and Hong Kong, they are only lightly defended by Taiwan and are considered by some security experts as vulnerable to Chinese attack due to their distance - more than 400 km (250 miles) - from mainland Taiwan.Chinese aircraft fly in the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defence zone on an almost daily basis, though the last such large-scale activity was on Jan. 24 when 12 Chinese fighters were involved.Taiwan on Friday unveiled a reshuffle of senior security officials including the appointment of a new, US-trained defence minister, to help bolster military modernisation and intelligence efforts in the face of what it sees as a rising Chinese threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-scrambles-air-force-again-after-chinese-exercises-in-south-china-sea-101613834540643.html

All you need to know||US citizenship and immigration services (USCIS) earlier this week announced that it has received enough petitions needed to reach the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa master’s cap for the fiscal year 2021. USCIS said the sending of non-selection notifications to registrants’ online accounts has been completed and the status of those accounts will show “Not Selected: Not selected for this fiscal year.”Since the department of homeland security (DHS) has delayed the implementation of proposed changes to the H-1B registration system and selection process until December 31, 2021, the lottery system will continue to apply for the upcoming season. The delay is supposed to provide more time for the immigration agency to train its staff and give stakeholders time to adjust to the new rule.Meanwhile, USCIS will continue to accept and process petitions that are exempt from the FY 2021 cap, including the foreign workers who have been previously counted against the cap and those who still retain their cap number. The immigration agency will also continue to accept and process the petitions filed to extend the amount of time a current H-1B visa holder may remain in the United States.Read | Indian-American Congressman to remove country quota for work-based Green CardOther petitions that USCIS will continue to accept and process:The H-1B visa allows American companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise, of which the vast majority are from India and China.

Notably, around 45 per cent of Covid-19 vaccine shots have been given to people in the wealthy Group of Seven (G7) countries, which accounts for only 10 per cent of the global population, according to news agency AFP. The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly called for equitable access and distribution of vaccines and on Friday, G7 members pledged to share more vaccine doses to middle- and low-income countries.Here’s the list of countries/territories with the most number of Covid-19 vaccine shots administered:United States: Nearly 60 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the worst-hit nation, the highest in the world. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 78 million vaccine shots have been delivered and at least 42 million people have received on or both doses of the vaccine.China: It is second only to the US in terms of the absolute number of doses administered. As of February 9, China has administered more than 40 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.European Union: The 27-member bloc has administered more than 25 million Covid-19 vaccine shots amid a row over the contract with AstraZeneca. Germany, an EU and G7 member, on Friday announced to donate an additional 1.5 billion euros to boost the rollout of vaccines in the world's poorest countries.United Kingdom: The UK has administered more than 17 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, covering at least 26 per cent of the country’s population.India: After the Covid-19 vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, India has administered more than 10 million vaccine doses.

Another one died later with a bullet wound to the chest."Police were not available for comment.The protests against the coup that overthrew the government of veteran democracy campaigner Suu Kyi have shown no sign of dying down. Demonstrators are sceptical of the army's promise to hold a new election and hand power to the winner.A young woman protester died on Friday after being shot in the head last week as police dispersed a crowd in the capital, Naypyitaw, the first death among anti-coup demonstrators.The army says one policeman died of injuries sustained in a protest.On Saturday, young people in the main city of Yangon carried a wreath and laid flowers at a memorial ceremony for the woman, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, while a similar ceremony took place in Naypyitaw."The sadness from her death is one thing, but we've also got courage to continue for her sake," said student protester Khin Maw Maw Oo in Naypyitaw.The demonstrators are demanding the restoration of the elected government, the release of Suu Kyi and others and the scrapping of a 2008 constitution, drawn up under military supervision, that gives the army a major role in politics.The army seized back power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy swept, detaining her and others. The electoral commission had dismissed the fraud complaints.Suu Kyi faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Her next court appearance is on March 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-killed-in-myanmar-city-of-mandalay-in-another-day-of-protests-101613823677943.html

A lunar day and night each equal 14 days on Earth,” the report said.The rover is in good condition, and all scientific payloads are working normally, it said.The Chang'e-4 probe, launched on December 8, 2018, made the first-ever soft landing on the Von Karman Crater in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon on January 3, 2019.The rover Yutu-2 has far exceeded its three-month design lifespan, becoming the longest-working lunar rover on the moon, the report said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lander-and-rover-of-china-s-lunar-probe-switched-to-dormant-mode-report-101613821221802.html

Senior civil servants will also be based in Wolverhampton, ensuring this becomes a centre for policy development and decision making, MHCLG said.“As Communities Secretary, I am determined to spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of our nation. That is why I am delighted to be taking the historic step of moving significant numbers of senior roles out of Whitehall and creating the first ever ministerial office outside of Westminster in Wolverhampton – increasing the jobs in the Midlands to over 500,” said Robert Jenrick, the minister in charge at MHCLG.“With a dual headquarters in Wolverhampton my department will not only change where we work but how we work, signalling the end of the Whitehall knows best approach. All of us at the department are looking forward to having the opportunity to work there,” he said.The minister said the aim was to have more local voices at the heart of policy development and delivery, supporting communities more effectively, and to develop greater career options in government outside of London.“In choosing the city of Wolverhampton we are also backing our great smaller cities, some of which have been neglected for too long. We want to raise their stature, encourage civic pride and commercial success,” added Jenrick.This move, part of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s manifesto commitment to "level up" different parts of the country, signals a culture change in civil service. It marks a significant increase on the 300 roles currently in the region and is part of plans to have at least 800 roles outside of London by 2030 – including 50 per cent of the most senior positions.These moves will help provide an economic boost to these areas, bring a greater variety of voices and experiences into the civil service and provide improved career paths outside of Whitehall, MHCLG said.Recruitment is already underway, with 40 roles already relocated to the region in the last 12 months.MHCLG said it will be working in partnership with other government departments to improve collaborative working and develop greater career options outside London to retain talented civil servants based outside of London.The new building for the headquarters is expected to be unveiled in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-ministry-confirms-second-hq-outside-london-in-historic-move-101613819273419.html
20-02-2021||World||Italian doctors remember night that ushered in Europe's first Covid-19 lockdown||A year ago, Laura Ricevuti and Annalisa Malara, both doctors at Codogno hospital in Italy, had a hunch that something was different about a patient in the intensive care ward.Their decision to take matters into their own hands wound up triggering a national emergency - they had identified the first case of Covid-19 in the area that would become Europe's first lockdown zone.A previously healthy 38-year-old man, now known as Mattia, his first name, or "patient one", had gone to the hospital with a high fever, cough and shortness of breath on Feb. 18, 2020. He refused to be admitted so was given antibiotics and went home.He returned that evening in worse shape and was put on oxygen. Two days later, Mattia's wife told doctors that a few weeks earlier he had gone to dinner with a colleague who had been in China.But Mattia did not fit national criteria for mandatory coronavirus testing because he had not been in China personally."I had to explain many times why I wanted to perform it (a Covid swab) anyway," said Malara, 39."Doctor Malara and myself decided to break protocol," Ricevuti recalled. They performed the nasal swab and sent it to a lab in Milan.At 9:30 p.m. the phone rang. The test was positive."We couldn't believe it. We thought this was a far away problem that had to do with China, but it was already here with us, and not just from that February 20th but probably from much earlier," Ricevuti, 44, said.In the days that followed, Codogno, a town of 15,000 residents, became the "capital" of the first "red zone" in Europe to be locked down."In the beginning I hoped - we all hoped - that the virus would be limited to a few people," said Malara. "But after a few hours a lot of people came to the emergency room with the same symptoms and after a few days it was clear that it had spread into the population."Since then 95,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Italy, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world.Both women are still treating Covid-19 patients."This is our mission. We cannot really retreat," Ricevuti said. "Day-by-day we go forward, facing the difficulties and the changes that life presents us ... you need a lot of physical and mental strength."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-doctors-remember-night-that-ushered-in-europe-s-first-covid-19-lockdown-101613813799006.html

It was the first G7 meeting that included Suga, US President Joe Biden and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.On the coronavirus pandemic, Suga said he has had an unwavering resolve to protect the lives and livelihoods of the people since assuming his post in September.He said much has been learned from last year, and that he has implemented what he believes to be the best measures.Suga said vaccines will be the key to containing infections, adding that fair access in developing countries will be essential.He called on the G7 to speed up the distribution of vaccines and oppose a protectionist approach to health issues.He also pledged to increase Japan's contribution to a global framework for purchasing vaccines to 200 million dollars, reported NHK World.Suga also expressed his determination to hold the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer. He said he will work with the International Olympic Committee to realize a safe Game. He called on the other countries for support.Suga said the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics can serve as proof that mankind has overcome the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suga-expresses-concern-over-china-s-dominance-in-east-and-south-china-sea-at-g7-101613816195450.html

Iran insists that the United States must first lift former President Donald Trump’s sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.The White House said on Friday that the United States plans to take no additional actions in response to pressure from Iran before potential talks with Tehran and major powers about returning to the deal.However, government spokesman Ali Rabiei was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency on Saturday: “We predict with confidence that diplomatic initiatives will result in a favourable outcome despite the diplomatic wrangling, which are a natural prelude to the return of the parties to their commitments, including the lifting of all sanctions in the near future.”Under the deal with major powers, Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Washington reimposed sanctions after Trump quit the deal in 2018, and Iran responded by violating some of the deal’s nuclear limits.Adding to pressure for a resolution to the impasse, a law passed by the hardline parliament obliges Tehran on Feb. 23 to limit the sweeping access given to UN inspectors under the deal.The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, is due in Tehran this weekend to discuss ways to work with Iran in light of the possibility of scaling back cooperation.Rabiei said the law “does not go against our commitment” to the agreement, nor is it “an obstacle to our appropriate response to American actions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tehran-confident-about-lifting-of-us-sanctions-despite-wrangling-iran-spokesman-101613815946478.html
20-02-2021||World||Russian court rejects Kremlin critic Navalny's appeal against jail term||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny lost his appeal on Saturday against what he said was a politically-motivated decision to jail him for nearly three years, but had his prison term slightly shortened.Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed earlier this month for parole violations that he said were trumped up. Western countries have condemned the case and are discussing possible sanctions on Russia.A Moscow court swiftly rejected his appeal, while shortening his original jail term by six weeks. The original term was 3.5 years.But, with the amount of time he had already spent under house arrest taken into account, it amounted to around two years and eight months. His lawyer said on Saturday he would now spend a little over 2.5 years behind bars.Navalny responded sarcastically to the ruling. "They've reduced the sentence by 1.5 months. Great!" he said from a courtroom glass cage.The opposition politician had earlier told the judge he was not guilty of parole violations as a previous court had found. Navalny returned to Russia last month from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning in Siberia in August with what many Western nations said was a nerve agent.He said he had been unable to report to the Moscow prison service last year because he had been convalescing in Germany at the time."I don't want to show off a lot, but the whole world knew where I was," Navalny told the judge. "Once I'd recovered, I bought a plane ticket and came home."Navalny said he had no regrets about returning to Russia, that his belief in God helped sustain him, and that "strength was in truth.""Our country is built on injustice. But tens of millions of people want the truth. And sooner or later they'll get it."SLANDER CASENavalny is due to appear in court again later on Saturday for what is expected to be the culmination of a separate slander trial against him.In the slander case, Navalny is accused of defaming a World War Two veteran who took part in a promotional video backing constitutional reforms last year that let Putin run for two more terms in the Kremlin after 2024 if he wants.Navalny described the people in the video as traitors and corrupt lackeys. But he has said his comments were not specifically directed against the veteran, and that the authorities are using the charge to smear his reputation.State prosecutors have asked the court to fine Navalny 950,000 roubles ($12,800) for slander.Navalny's arrest and jailing sparked nationwide street protests in Russia, but his allies say they have now paused major demonstrations until the spring.Navalny accuses Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-court-rejects-kremlin-critic-navalny-s-appeal-against-jail-term-101613815032101.html
20-02-2021||World||Myanmar anti-coup protesters honour woman shot dead by police||Anti-coup protesters in Myanmar's two largest cities on Saturday paid tribute to the young woman who died a day earlier after being shot by police during a rally against the military takeover.An impromptu memorial created under an elevated roadway in Yangon attracted around 1,000 protesters. A wreath of bright yellow flowers was hung beneath a photograph of Mya Thwet Thwet Khine, who was shot in the capital Naypyitaw on Feb. 9, two days before her 20th birthday.Her death on Friday, announced by her family, was the first confirmed fatality among thousands of protesters who have faced off against security forces since the military took power on Feb 1.Protesters at the memorial chanted and held up signs that read “End the dictatorship in Myanmar" and “You will be remembered Mya Thwet Thwet Khine.” The supporters also laid roses and rose petals on images of the woman.Video from the day she was shot show her sheltering from water cannons and suddenly dropping to the ground after a bullet penetrated the motorcycle helmet she was wearing. She had been on life support in a hospital for more than a week with what doctors said was no chance of recovery.US State Department spokesman Ned Price offered his government's condolences Friday and reiterated calls on the military to refrain from violence against peaceful protestors.In Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, a protest led by medical university students drew more than 1,000 people, many of whom also carried flowers and images of Mya Thwet Thwet Khine.Others held signs saying “CDM,” referring to the nationwide civil disobedience movement that has encouraged doctors, engineers and others to protest the coup by refusing to work.Across the country protests showed no signs of slowing down on Saturday despite recent crackdowns by the military government — including a sixth consecutive night in which the internet was cut for many hours.Demonstrators also gathered elsewhere in Yangon, chanting and holding placards and images of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, whose democratically elected government was overthrown.Aerial images taken Friday showed streets in Yangon painted with the words “The military dictatorship must fall” in Burmese, and “We want democracy” and “Free our leaders" in English.Security forces have been relatively restrained so far in confronting protesters in Yangon, but appeared to be toughening their stance in areas where there is less media presence.Police used force for a second day Friday to arrest protesters in Myitkyina, the capital of the remote northern state of Kachin. The Kachin ethnic minority has long been in conflict with the central government, and there has been intermittent armed struggle against the army there for decades.The junta seized power after detaining Suu Kyi and preventing Parliament from convening, saying elections in November were tainted by voting irregularities. The election outcome, in which Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, was affirmed by an election commission that has since been replaced by the military. The junta says it will hold new elections in a year's time.The US, British and Canadian governments have imposed sanctions on the new military leaders, and they and other nations have called for Suu Kyi's administration to be restored.The coup was a major setback to Myanmar's transition to democracy after 50 years of army rule. Suu Kyi came to power after her National League for Democracy party won a 2015 election, but the generals retained substantial power under the constitution, which was adopted under a military regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-anti-coup-protesters-honour-woman-shot-dead-by-police-101613810976844.html
20-02-2021||World||Ted Cruz's trip tests memory of voters if he runs for White House again in 2024||Ted Cruz's political career already featured many surprise twists before a jaunt to Mexico this week brought him a new level of notoriety.The Texas senator was once the biggest threat to Donald Trump capturing the 2016 presidential nomination. During a particularly bitter stretch of that year's Republican primary, Cruz called Trump a “coward” and “pathological liar.” By last month, however, Cruz was one of Trump's staunchest allies and a leader in the former president's baseless attempt to overturn the November election.Such shifts are intended to keep Cruz in a strong position with the GOP base if he runs for the White House again in 2024. But they've also turned him into one of Washington's most villainized figures, someone willing to take any politically convenient position if it keeps his future ambitions alive.Cruz is under further attack for traveling to Cancun while his constituents suffered through a deadly winter storm that left hundreds of thousands without power and running water. His explanation — that his daughters pushed for the getaway because they were out of school — was particularly panned.The optics of the trip are hardly ideal. But the question is whether, three years before he faces voters again, the political fallout will last.“Ted Cruz is feeling the first post-Trump controversy,” said New Hampshire-based Republican strategist Mike Biundo. “I don’t think anybody knows exactly what will happen in this new reality that we’re living in.”Before Trump got to Washington, scandals, lies and sometimes even simple but major gaffes wrecked political careers.Despite later winning a congressional seat, former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford will forever be remembered for fabricating a trek along the Appalachian Trail, just as former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner was undone by repeated sexting scandals and ex-Texas Gov. Rick Perry couldn’t live down the debate stage moment of forgetting the third of three federal agencies he’d promised to eliminate.Once Trump was in the White House, his outlandish antics attracted so much attention that something that simply looked bad, like a senator's leaving on vacation while his state was suffering, wouldn't receive much notice.Cruz is now navigating how much damage control is needed in a post-Trump political landscape.He rushed home on Thursday and told reporters the trip was “obviously a mistake.” But he made no public appearances on Friday, and his office didn't answer questions about his schedule or what he was doing to help Texans cope with the storm. His office simply released a statement backing Gov. Greg Abbott's request for federal assistance.Still, Cruz is still the best-known leader in the country's largest red state, with a far higher national profile than Abbott, who has also been mentioned as a possible 2024 presidential contender, and Sen. John Cornyn, who coasted to reelection last year by a more comfortable margin than Cruz, who narrowly edged Democrat Beto O'Rourke in 2018.Alice Stewart, a GOP strategist and veteran of Cruz’s presidential campaign, noted that the senator has years before he'll have to run for reelection or president or both in 2024. That's a lot of time to put the Cancun trip "in the rearview mirror,” even if Cruz's political opponents will continue to trumpet it.“People have come to tolerate a lot more during and after the era of Trump," said Stewart, who noted that while social media often intensifies political scandals, it also tends to shorten their lifespans.Rick Tyler also worked for Cruz's 2016 campaign but has frequently criticized the senator for kowtowing to Trump since then. He said that “when Texas was down and out and embarrassed, frankly," Cruz's trip to the beach was unforgivable: "There's no way this is going to be forgotten.”“Cruz is very beatable,” Tyler said of the senator's reelection prospects, especially if he tries again for the White House the same year. “He's got to decide. By doing one or the other, you risk losing both.”Of course, Cruz has effectively used being one of Washington's most detested figures to his advantage in the past. He came to Congress as a conservative insurgent who infuriated both parties — even prompting fellow Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to once joke that no senator would convict one of their own for murdering Cruz in the chamber.In 2016, Cruz won the Iowa caucuses and proved to have a solid national base of support, setting up a tense primary fight that would last for months. At one point, Trump attacked the looks of Cruz's wife and baselessly suggested that his father had a hand in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Cruz lashed out at Trump in response and was later booed off the stage at that year's Republican National Convention for failing to endorse the New Yorker.But in the four years since, Cruz transformed into one of Trump's biggest champions in Congress.Among those close to Cruz, there is a sense that the senator hurt himself politically this week but that he remains well positioned for another White House bid should he opt to run again. His team believes Cruz is the most popular prospective 2024 candidate not named Trump among likely Republican primary voters.Cruz was a fundraising force for his Republican colleagues in the House and Senate leading up to November's election. And his own fundraising has surged in the months since — including after he stood against the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory in early January. His small-dollar donor base, in particular, which was large to begin with, has grown dramatically, aides say.Even amid calls for Cruz to resign for his role in helping encourage Trump supporters who staged a deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Republicans in San Antonio organized a rally celebrating him as “courageous.”Cruz is also planning to attend next week's influential Conservative Political Action Conference, where he can further ingratiate himself with the GOP's most fervent activists, who aren't likely to hold Cancun against him.Cruz allies note that the second-place finisher in the previous Republican primary often becomes the nominee in the next election. But moving forward, there is a sense internally that Cruz’s political strength is directly linked to his relationship with Trump, whose feelings are difficult to gauge.Regina Thomson, a former Cruz loyalist who fought Trump’s nomination at the 2016 GOP convention, has since warmed to Trump. She said that Cruz's Cancun trip didn't bother her, but that ultimately, she and other conservative activists would likely follow Trump’s lead.“If you would ask a lot of (Cruz’s former) grassroots supporters today, they’d say Trump did such a good job they’d like him to run again," Thomson said. “And if Trump doesn’t run, I think a lot of people will look to him to see who he’s supporting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ted-cruz-s-trip-tests-memory-of-voters-if-he-runs-for-white-house-again-in-2024-101613812317619.html

20-02-2021||World||Florida is a model for voting. The GOP wants change anyway||Florida was a model citizen when it came to elections in 2020. The state showed off its years of voting reforms. Even as Donald Trump railed against voting systems elsewhere, he praised Florida and urged his supporters to trust its vote-by-mail system. And, indeed, results were reported quickly and accurately. Turnout soared.It was all overseen by GOP officials. And Trump won, continuing Republicans' growing dominance in the state.Yet three months later, Florida Republicans have set out to overhaul the state's voting system anyway. GOP Governor Ron DeSantis on Friday proposed an array of voting changes, while state lawmakers have introduced legislation that makes it harder to vote by mail. To explain the efforts, Florida Republicans point not to evidence of problems but to the potential for voter fraud and suspicion about the process.“We want everyone to vote, but we don't want anyone to cheat," DeSantis said Friday.Florida Republicans' push to change voting laws shows how deep false claims about mass voter fraud spread by Trump have burrowed into Republicans' belief system. The party is now stampeding to solve a problem that most nonpartisan experts and courts say does not exist. Their efforts are threatening to dismantle years of bipartisan moves to boost voting in several states, including places where the GOP has thrived under the current system.And it would result in making it more difficult to vote.“We cannot comprehend where they're coming from,” said Anjenys Gonzalez-Eilert of Florida Common Cause, noting the GOP has long been a supporter and beneficiary of mail voting in the state.Similar efforts are being repeated across the country. State Republican lawmakers in Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania have introduced voting bills, many aimed at curbing mail voting.The legislation reflects Republicans' widespread belief that new rules making it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic largely benefited Democrats and caused “irregularities.” Although there were no signs of widespread irregularities, they often point to vote totals tilted in Democrat Joe Biden's favor as mail ballots were counted days after Election Day — a pattern that was new to many states but not a sign of fraud.But that was not an issue in Florida. It has long allowed its election offices to start the laborious process of preparing mail ballots for counting — removing them from their envelopes and verifying voters' signatures well before Election Day. While ballot counts in many states new to mail voting dragged on for days, Florida's count was quick and efficient.There was no evidence of fraud in Florida. Of the roughly 50 legal cases Trump and his allies brought challenging the election, none were filed in Florida. (Even in those states where Trump claimed there was fraud and tried to overturn the election, dozens of courts rejected his legal claims and no significant cases were proved.)Florida officials take pride in their recent record. Ever since the drama of the 2000 presidential election recount — when “hanging chads” turned the state into a national joke — the state has worked to shed its image as the exemplar for elections gone wrong.Election officers have worked to shore up trust in the state's election system — by changing how ballots are designed, modernizing vote-counting equipment and investing millions of dollars to protect against cyberthreats.Even DeSantis took credit for November's performance.“We did it right," he said Friday before supporters in West Palm Beach.Still, he argued for tightening voting laws. His proposal includes restricting the use of drop boxes where voters can deposit mail ballots and preventing other people from dropping off voters' ballots, a practice many label “ballot harvesting.”DeSantis also seemed to endorse the Republican bill that would make mail balloting harder by requiring voters to request a mail ballot every year, rather than allow them to make one request that stands for two years' worth of elections.The proposal is notable because for years Republicans dominated vote by mail in Florida, and it was embraced by the state's many older voters. It helped the GOP cement a durable statehouse majority and narrowly win state-wide races.But the Republicans in Florida lost that edge last year. Trump railed against mail voting, and GOP voters' trust in the system sank, according to polls.In Florida, his complaints alarmed state Republicans, and Trump sent out tweets stating that in Florida, where he voted by mail, the system was “Safe and Secure, Tried and True.”In the end, Democrats in the state outvoted Republicans by mail for the first time in years as a record 4.9 million Floridians voted by mail. Democrats cast 680,000 more mail ballots than Republicans did.The new bill would essentially wipe those new Democratic voters from the rolls ahead of 2022, when DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio lead the list of incumbent Republicans up for re-election."Republicans used to have the advantage, and now it's the Democrats who have the advantage. So now it's time to make a change," said campaign strategist Mac Stipanovich, a former Republican.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-is-a-model-for-voting-the-gop-wants-change-anyway-101613804368698.html
20-02-2021||World||France sends amphibious assault warships to South China Sea, expresses interest towards supporting Quad||Stepping up its presence in the South China Sea, France has planned two voyages through the disputed waters.According to South China Morning Post, the French Navy said an amphibious assault ship the Tonnere and the frigate Surcouf had left their home port Toulon on Thursday and would travel to the Pacific on a three-month mission.The website Naval News reported that the ships would cross the South China Sea twice and take part in a combined exercise with the Japanese and US militaries in May.Capt Arnaud Tranchant, commanding officer of the Tonnerre, told Naval News that the French navy would "work to strengthen" France's partnership with the US, Japan, India and Australia - Quad.When asked whether he was planning to transit the Taiwan Strait, he said he has "not yet traced our roads in this area".Similar missions in 2015 and 2017 also saw French navy vessels sailing through the South China Sea, but analysts said the latest exercise is a sign of France stepping up engagement in the Indo Pacific region.Last week, France deployed a nuclear attack submarine in the South China Sea, in line with US President Joe Biden's call to mount a multilateral challenge to China.In a tweet earlier this week, France's Defense Minister Florence Parly announced that the European power has deployed the nuclear attack submarine Emeraude along with naval support ship Seine to the maritime area to "affirm that international law is the only rule that is valid, whatever the sea where we sail."Other European powers such as the United Kingdom and Germany are also expected to deploy warships to the area in what increasingly looks like a concerted Western pushback against China's maritime ambitions.European powers' growing involvement in regional geopolitics is consistent with the strategic priorities of the Biden administration, which has underscored its commitment to "working with our allies and partners" based "on the international rules of the road".China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, something which is contested heavily by several countries in the region.China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.

20-02-2021||World||Texas reels from power outage: Impact in pics||Texas witnessed a severely hard week this month as a winter storm froze the power grid of the US state leaving millions in the dark and as many as 40 people died due to the freezing cold. Since the winter storm and dropping temperature froze power grids, almost 40 per cent of the generators went offline and as the people started turning up the thermostats for heat demanding more energy, power companies had to implement rolling blackouts that wreaked havoc.Also Read | Extreme weather testing Biden's disaster management skillsThe power outage left the people of the state shivering in cold without heat or water. The southern central state of the United States is the only state with its own independent power grid.Around 7,000 local water utilities were offline or unable to supply drinking water as of Friday afternoon, reported Bloomberg. As water pipes burst in the winter storm, people were left without drinking water or heat prompting emergency officials to airlift bottled water to areas where supply was disrupted. People queued up early in the morning to receive water and Houston converted a football stadium being used as Covid-19 vaccination centre as a water supply distribution centre.As power outage affected 14.4 million people across the state, many restaurants in the state were forced to throw food with shorter shelf life. Supermarkets across the state also went out of food and bottled water.While many people inspected the leakage in the water pipes that happened due to the extreme weather conditions, many others volunteered in supplying bottles of water and food to affected areas as the energy supply began restoring.Companies like Marathon Oil Corp and Devon Energy Corp have begun restoring the power supply, however, it is not yet clear how much time it will take for gas and oil supply to be back. A crucial part of the natural gas system, the compressor stations that keep the gas flowing through the pipeline, was disrupted due to the power outage. The fuel makes half the state's power source. Ironically, Texas is America's biggest gas producer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-reels-from-power-outage-impact-in-pics-101613798273329.html
20-02-2021||World||UK urges UN resolution for pause in conflicts for Covid-19 jabs||Britain circulated a draft resolution to the UN Security Council on Friday demanding that all warring parties immediately institute a “sustained humanitarian pause” to enable people in conflict areas to be vaccinated for Covid-19.The proposed resolution reiterates the council's demand last July 1 for “a general and immediate cessation of hostilities” in major conflicts from Syria and Yemen to Central African Republic, Mali and Sudan and Somalia.The appeal was first made by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on March 23, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.The draft “emphasizes the need for solidarity, equity, and efficacy and invites donation of vaccine doses from developed economies to low- and middle-income countries and other countries in need, including through the COVAX Facility,” an ambitious World Health Organisation project to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world's poorest people.The British draft stresses that “equitable access to affordable Covid-19 vaccines, certified as safe and efficacious, is essential to end the pandemic.”It would recognise “the role of extensive immunisation against Covid-19 as a global public good for health in preventing, containing, and stopping transmission, in order to bring the pandemic to an end.”The draft, obtained by The Associated Press, follows up on British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's appeal to the 15-member Security Council on Wednesday to adopt a resolution calling for local cease-fires in conflict zones to allow the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines.Britain says more than 160 million people are at risk of being excluded from coronavirus vaccinations because they live in countries engulfed in conflict and instability.“Cease-fires have been used to vaccinate the most vulnerable communities in the past,” Raab said.“There's no reason why we can't... We have seen it in the past to deliver polio vaccines to children in Afghanistan, just to take one example.”At Wednesday's council meeting, Guterres sharply criticized the “wildly uneven and unfair” distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, saying 10 countries have administered 75 per cent of all vaccinations and demanding a global effort to get all people in every nation vaccinated as soon as possible.The UN chief told the high-level council meeting that 130 countries have not received a single dose of vaccine and declared that “at this critical moment, vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community.”The coronavirus has infected more than 109 million people and killed at least 2.4 million of them. As manufacturers struggle to ramp up production of vaccines, many countries complain of being left out and even rich nations are facing shortages and domestic complaints.Guterres' appeal for cease-fires last March to deliver Covid-19 medical items received some initial support, but the cease-fires were almost always short-lived.While speed of developing vaccines has been impressive, COVAX has already missed its own goal of beginning coronavirus vaccinations in poor countries at the same time that shots were rolled out in rich countries late last year.WHO says COVAX needs USD 5 billion in 2021.The draft resolution calls for the Covid-19 vaccination plans of countries to include “those at a higher risk of developing severe Covid-19 symptoms and the most vulnerable, including frontline workers, older people, refugees, internally displaced people, stateless people, migrants, persons with disabilities, among others, as well as people living in areas under the control of any non-state armed group.”The proposed measure calls for increased scientific collaboration on new variants of Covid-19.It asks Guterres to report at least every 90 days on all impediments to the Covid-19 response, including vaccination programs, in countries where conflicts and humanitarian emergencies are occurring.It's not clear whether the resolution will be adopted.Britain's UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, said Wednesday that humanitarian organsations and UN agencies need the full backing of the council to be able to carry out their job.Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, objected to the council focusing on equitable access to vaccines, saying this went beyond its mandate to preserve international peace and security.He indicated Moscow was not interested in a new resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-urges-un-resolution-for-pause-in-conflicts-for-covid-19-jabs-101613810641232.html
20-02-2021||World||US Air Force orders new review into racial, ethnic disparities||The Air Force inspector general will do a second investigation into racial and ethnic disparities across the force, service leaders said Friday, expanding the review to include gender and additional racial categories such as Asian and American Indian.The latest review comes just two months after the IG released a report concluding that Black service members in the Air Force are far more likely to be investigated, arrested, face disciplinary actions and be discharged for misconduct. The December report found that “racial disparity exists” for Black service members but that the data did not explain why it happens.The new study also reflects broader campaigns within the Defense Department and the Biden administration to root out extremism and racism. President Joe Biden declared domestic extremism an urgent national security threat in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The crowd that breached the building as lawmakers were preparing to certify the election was overwhelmingly white and included members of far-right groups.Acting Air Force Secretary John Roth, who ordered the latest review, said the IG will go directly to Air Force and Space Force service members for input. A survey that will go out to the force soon will look at several different categories: Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino and gender.“The IG team has already begun to gather information contained in a wide array of previous reports, studies and various databases across the Department of the Air Force,” Roth said. “Although the data is helpful, the most important information will come directly from our Airmen and Guardians.” Guardians are members of the Space Force.The Pentagon is also grappling with a wider effort to expand diversity within the ranks, and a campaign to tackle racism and extremism. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, earlier this month, ordered military leaders to spend time talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks, after a number of former and current military members took part in the US Capitol assault.Austin said units must take a day during February or March for the so-called “stand down.”In addition, the Defense Department late last year endorsed a new slate of initiatives to more aggressively recruit, retain and promote a more racially and ethnically diverse force. And it called for a plan to crack down on participation in hate groups by service members and draft proposed changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The report by the Air Force inspector general that was released in December said Black members of the Air Force and Space Force are less likely to be promoted to higher enlisted and officer ranks, and one-third of them believe they don't get the same opportunities as their white peers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-air-force-orders-new-review-into-racial-ethnic-disparities-101613809836158.html
20-02-2021||World||Extreme weather testing Biden's disaster management skills||Add Mother Nature to the pile of crises on President Joe Biden's plate.A month into the job and focused on the coronavirus, Biden is seeing his disaster management skills tested after winter storms plunged Texas, Oklahoma and neighboring states into an unusual deep freeze that left millions shivering in homes that lost heat and power, and in many homes, water.At least 59 deaths across the US have been blamed on the blast of unseasonable weather.Biden came into office January 20 promising to tackle a series of brewing crises, starting with the coronavirus pandemic and its ripple effects on the economy. He tacked on systemic racism and climate change as top priorities. And now he's contending with storms that have not only imperilled Americans but also delayed the shipment and administration of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines.Biden said Friday that he hopes to travel to Texas next week but doesn't want his presence and the accompanying presidential entourage to distract from the recovery.“They're working like the devil to take care of their folks,” Biden said of Texas officials. He said he'd make a decision early next week about travel.Biden, who offered himself during the campaign as the experienced and empathetic candidate the nation needed at this moment in time, is working on several fronts to address the situation — and to avoid repeating the mistakes of predecessors who got tripped up by inadequate or insensitive responses in times of disaster.Part of the job of being president is responding to the destruction left behind by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters, or events like deadly mass shootings, or even acts of terrorism.Some have handled such situations better than others.George W. Bush earned praised for his leadership after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but stumbled during his administration’s halting response to the humanitarian disaster that unfolded in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast four years later.Barack Obama said he should have anticipated the blowback he got for going to the golf course right after he condemned the beheading of a kidnapped American journalist by Islamist militants in 2014. Obama was vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard at the time.Donald Trump was criticized for tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of people in Puerto Rico who had endured Hurricane Maria’s pummelling of the island in 2017. He defended tossing the towels, saying the people were “having fun.”Bill Clinton, who famously claimed during the 1992 presidential campaign that “I feel your pain,” was a natural at connecting with disaster victims.Just this week, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas showed how quickly one bad move during a crisis can become a public relations disaster for a politician.Cruz came under attack for traveling to Mexico while his constituents suffered without power, heat and running water. His explanation — that his daughters pushed for the getaway because they were out of school — was particularly panned. Cruz later said the trip was a mistake.Biden has tweeted about Texas and the other affected states, while the White House has issued numerous statements aimed at demonstrating that the federal government is in command of the situation.The president is getting regular updates from his staff and has declared states of emergency in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. He said Friday that he will soon declare a major disaster in the state of Texas and that he has asked federal agencies to identify additional resources to address the suffering.The Federal Emergency Management Agency also has shipped dozens of generators and supplies, including fuel, water, blankets and ready-to-eat meals, to the affected areas.Biden has spoken to the governors of the seven states most affected by the winter weather. He tweeted a photo of himself on the phone with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas.Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch supporter of Trump's, was quick to praise Biden for swift action on a disaster declaration.After speaking with Biden by telephone earlier this week, Stitt specifically thanked the president for “taking the time to reach out this afternoon and offer the federal government’s help for Oklahomans. We had a very productive call and I look forward to working together to find solutions as we recover from this historic storm.”Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, said Biden is “well-suited" to deal with the disaster because of his decades of service in the U.S. Senate and as a former vice president and because of “his genuine concern for people.”“He's got to show empathy right off the bat,” Perry said in an interview. “It's important for a president to go to a place that’s been battered, but be careful about the footprint. He doesn’t want to make things worse.”Biden, should he decide to visit Texas next week, could also use the trip to press his point that climate change is real and must not go unaddressed, and that the state could do things like winterize its power plants to be better prepared for future storms, Perry said.But he should take care to not do so in a scolding kind of way.“We know he cares about climate change, and this is a way to convince people,” Perry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extreme-weather-testing-biden-s-disaster-management-skills-101613803379996.html
20-02-2021||World||Kremlin critic Navalny back in court for jail appeal, possible fine||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny returned to court on Saturday to hear his lawyers appeal against what they say was a politically-motivated decision to jail him for nearly three years.Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed earlier this month for parole violations he said were trumped up. The West has condemned the case and is discussing possible sanctions on Russia.As proceedings got underway, a relaxed-looking Navalny said he had heard about a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights asking Russia to free him, a request that Moscow swiftly dismissed as unlawful.Speaking from a glass courtroom cage, wearing green trousers and a patterned shirt, Navalny told the presiding judge it would be good if the court would now let him go.Later on Saturday, he is due to appear in court again for what is expected to be the culmination of a separate slander trial against him.In the slander case, Navalny stands accused of defaming a World War Two veteran who took part in a promotional video backing constitutional reforms last year that let Putin run for two more terms in the Kremlin after 2024 if he wants.Navalny, who returned to Russia last month from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning with a military-grade nerve toxin in Siberia, described the people in the video as traitors and corrupt lackeys.He has said his comment was not specifically directed against the veteran however, and that the authorities are using the charge to smear his reputation.State prosecutors have asked the court to fine Navalny 950,000 roubles ($12,800) for slander.Navalny's arrest and jailing sparked nationwide street protests in Russia, but his allies say they have now paused serious demonstrations until the spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-navalny-back-in-court-for-jail-appeal-possible-fine-101613809032606.html
20-02-2021||World||Russia approves its third Covid-19 vaccine, says PM Mishustin||Russia on Saturday approved a third coronavirus vaccine for domestic use, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on state TV, though large-scale clinical trials of the shot, labelled CoviVac and produced by the Chumakov Centre, have yet to begin.Russia has already approved two Covid-19 vaccines, including the Sputnik V shot, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, following a similar approach of granting approval before seeing any late-stage trial results.The preemptive approvals had raised concerns among some scientists in the West, but inoculations with those first two shots began on a mass scale in Russia only after trials were concluded and showed success.Sputnik V was approved in August and late-stage trials began in September. Mass vaccination was launched in December, after preliminary trial results showed the vaccine to be 91.4% effective.Since then, more than two million Russians have been vaccinated with at least the first dose of Sputnik V, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Feb. 10.Rollout of a second vaccine, developed by the Vector Institute in Novosibirsk, is beginning.Also read| Joe Biden believes US will approach normalcy defeating Covid-19 by year end"Today, Russia is the only country to have already three vaccines against Covid-19," Prime Minister Mishustin said.The Chumakov Centre, founded in 1955 in St Petersburg by Mikhail Chumakov, is known for its work with U.S. scientist Albert Sabin at the height of the Cold War, which led to the production of the widely-used polio vaccine.Unlike the Sputnik V vaccine, which uses a modified harmless cold virus that tricks the body into producing antigens to help the immune system prepare for a coronavirus infection, the CoviVac vaccine is a "whole-virion" vaccine.This means it is made of a coronavirus that has been inactivated, or stripped of its ability to replicate."The vaccine we have developed... reflects the whole history of Russian, as well as global, vaccine science," the Chumakov Centre's director, Aidar Ishmukhametov, said on Saturday.The CoviVac shot is given in two doses, 14 days apart.

20-02-2021||World||Indian-origin man sentenced for fraudulently selling workout supplements in US||A 37-year-old Indian-origin former executive has been sentenced to 41 months in prison in the US for his role in fraudulently selling popular workout supplements by concealing their true ingredients.Sitesh Patel, the former vice-president of S K Laboratories, was sentenced on Friday by a federal court in Texas, announced Acting US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Prerak Shah and Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.According to documents filed in the case, Patel of Irvine, California, played a key role in developing and manufacturing the popular workout and weight loss supplements known as Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, which were distributed by Dallas-based USPlabs.In pleading guilty in 2019 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce, Patel and several of his co-defendants admitted that they imported substances with false and misleading labelling to avoid law enforcement and regulatory agency attention.US District Judge Sam A Lindsay sentenced Patel to 41 months’ imprisonment and one year of supervised release. The court previously ordered Patel’s former company, S K Laboratories, to forfeit USD 6 million in connection with the case.Patel also pleaded guilty to the introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce, the US Justice Department said in a statement.The misbranding charges relate in part to OxyElite Pro, which was recalled in 2013 in the wake of an investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) into whether the supplement caused liver injuries in consumers.An indictment returned by a Dallas federal grand jury in 2015 against Patel and four other individuals associated with USPlabs alleged that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use.“Dietary supplement manufacturers must not be allowed to mislead the public about untested ingredients mixed into their products,” said Acting US Attorney Prerak Shah.“We are proud to hold this defendant accountable for lying to the public about ingredients that had the potential to cause them harm," Shah said.“The defendant knowingly profited by deceiving American consumers, causing harm to them by concealing the true ingredients of a product intended to improve the very health it damaged,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Pearson of the IRS-Criminal Investigation, Dallas Field Office.The court previously sentenced Jacobo Geissler, 44, of University Park, Texas, the CEO of USPlabs, to 60 months’ imprisonment, and Jonathan Doyle, 41, of Dallas, the president of USPlabs, to 24 months’ imprisonment for their roles in the fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-man-sentenced-for-fraudulently-selling-workout-supplements-in-us-101613805650044.html
20-02-2021||World||Joe Biden believes US will approach normalcy defeating Covid-19 by year end||President Joe Biden has said that he believes the US will be approaching normalcy by the end of this year as the country races to deliver coronavirus vaccines to millions of Americans.Biden on Friday toured a manufacturing facility of Pfizer in Kalamazoo, Michigan, seeking to highlight efforts to mass produce a coronavirus vaccine as his administration looks for ways to increase supply and streamline distribution.“I believe we'll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year. And God willing, this Christmas will be different than the last,” Biden said responding to a question at the site in Michigan.At the same time, he refused to make any commitment.“I can't make that commitment to you. There are other strains of the virus. We don’t know what could happen in terms of production rates. Things can change. But we're doing everything the science has indicated we should do, and people are stepping up to get everything done that has to be done,” he said.Biden said that getting the vaccine and having it available is not the same as putting it in someone's arms. This is going to be a continuous rolling effort.Also read| Extreme weather testing Joe Biden's disaster management skills“We will have ordered, much of which will have been distributed, over 600 million doses by the end of July. July 29th is the expected date. That could change. Look at what's happening with the weather now, for example: It's slowing up the distribution right now,” he said.Severe winter weather has gripped much of the US this week and delayed the distribution of 6 million vaccine doses, the White House said on Friday."I can't give you a date when this crisis will end, but I can tell you we're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later," he said. This administration is going to be guided by science to save lives and to make lives better, he said.Biden said parenthetically it's not enough that we find cures for Americans. There needs to be a cure that the world is able to take part of, because you can't build a wall or a fence high enough to keep a pandemic out.“Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country. My predecessor -- as my mother would say, "God love him" -- failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilise the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office,” he said.Also read| US' re-entry into Paris Climate Agreement a 'day of hope', says UN chiefBiden touted that the country’s vaccination rate has increased to about 1.7 million shots a day, well above the pace for the president’s goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.Biden had said that in "the first 100 days,” before I was inaugurated, "that we'd administer 100 million shots in my first 100 days.”At the Pfizer factory in Michigan, where he met with lab workers and learned about the process behind creating one of the two Covid-19 vaccines that is being widely used across the country to inoculate Americans, the Hill reported.The US, which is the worst affected country from the pandemic, has reported 28,004,311 cases and over 495,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-believes-us-will-approach-normalcy-defeating-covid-19-by-year-end-101613802944535.html
20-02-2021||World||Jakarta faces severe monsoon floods, more than 1,000 forced to evacuate||Severe flooding across several areas in the Indonesian capital forced more than a thousand people to flee their homes on Saturday, with the country’s meteorology agency warning the conditions were set to continue for the next week.Some 1,380 Jakarta residents were evacuated from southern and eastern areas of the city, home to 10 million people, after floodwaters reached up to 1.8 meters high in some areas, said Sabdo Kurnianto, the acting head of Jakarta's disaster mitigation agency in a statement. He said no casualties had been reported.People posted photos on social media of residents wading through shoulder-high muddy waters, cars almost entirely submerged, and search teams evacuating elderly residents in rubber dinghies in the peak of the monsoon season."Two hundred neighbourhoods have been affected, according to the latest data," Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan told local television early on Saturday, adding that more than two dozen evacuation centres have been prepared across the city."The rain has stopped, but water from other areas is still affecting Jakarta. Hopefully it won’t hit the city centre and when the water recedes people can resume their activities."The floods come at a time when Indonesia is already grappling with the highest caseload and death tally from COVID-19 in Southeast Asia and an economic recession.Indonesia’s meteorology agency (BMKG) has warned the heaviest rain of the season may fall in and around the densely populated capital in the coming days, with extreme weather, including heavy rain, thunder and strong winds, expected throughout next week."These are critical times that we need to be aware of," said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of BMKG."Jakarta and its surrounding areas are still in the peak period of the rainy season, which is estimated to continue until the end of February or early March."The BMKG said Jakarta would be on alert for the next four days with data from the meteorology agency showing intense rainfall in the past 24 hours with the area of Pasar Minggu, in Jakarta’s south, recording 226 millimeters of rain since Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jakarta-faces-severe-monsoon-floods-more-than-1-000-forced-to-evacuate-101613802581277.html
20-02-2021||World||Extreme weather testing Joe Biden's disaster management skills||Add Mother Nature to the pile of crises on President Joe Biden's plate.A month into the job and focused on the coronavirus, Biden is seeing his disaster management skills tested after winter storms plunged Texas, Oklahoma and neighboring states into an unusual deep freeze that left millions shivering in homes that lost heat and power, and in many homes, water.At least 59 deaths across the US have been blamed on the blast of unseasonable weather.Biden came into office January 20 promising to tackle a series of brewing crises, starting with the coronavirus pandemic and its ripple effects on the economy. He tacked on systemic racism and climate change as top priorities. And now he's contending with storms that have not only imperiled Americans but also delayed the shipment and administration of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines.Biden said Friday that he hopes to travel to Texas next week but doesn't want his presence and the accompanying presidential entourage to distract from the recovery.“They're working like the devil to take care of their folks,” Biden said of Texas officials. He said he'd make a decision early next week about travel.Biden, who offered himself during the campaign as the experienced and empathetic candidate the nation needed at this moment in time, is working on several fronts to address the situation — and to avoid repeating the mistakes of predecessors who got tripped up by inadequate or insensitive responses in times of disaster.Part of the job of being president is responding to the destruction left behind by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters, or events like deadly mass shootings, or even acts of terrorism.Some have handled such situations better than others.George W. Bush earned praised for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but stumbled during his administration’s halting response to the humanitarian disaster that unfolded in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast four years later.Barack Obama said he should have anticipated the blowback he got for going to the golf course right after he condemned the beheading of a kidnapped American journalist by Islamist militants in 2014. Obama was vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard at the time.Donald Trump was criticized for tossing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of people in Puerto Rico who had endured Hurricane Maria’s pummeling of the island in 2017. He defended tossing the towels, saying the people were “having fun.”Bill Clinton, who famously claimed during the 1992 presidential campaign that “I feel your pain,” was a natural at connecting with disaster victims.Just this week, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas showed how quickly one bad move during a crisis can become a public relations disaster for a politician.Cruz came under attack for traveling to Mexico while his constituents suffered without power, heat and running water. His explanation — that his daughters pushed for the getaway because they were out of school — was particularly panned. Cruz later said the trip was a mistake.Biden has tweeted about Texas and the other affected states, while the White House has issued numerous statements aimed at demonstrating that the federal government is in command of the situation.The president is getting regular updates from his staff and has declared states of emergency in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. He said Friday that he will soon declare a major disaster in the state of Texas and that he has asked federal agencies to identify additional resources to address the suffering.The Federal Emergency Management Agency also has shipped dozens of generators and supplies, including fuel, water, blankets and ready-to-eat meals, to the affected areas.Biden has spoken to the governors of the seven states most affected by the winter weather. He tweeted a photo of himself on the phone with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas.Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch supporter of Trump's, was quick to praise Biden for swift action on a disaster declaration.After speaking with Biden by telephone earlier this week, Stitt specifically thanked the president for “taking the time to reach out this afternoon and offer the federal government’s help for Oklahomans. We had a very productive call and I look forward to working together to find solutions as we recover from this historic storm.”Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, said Biden is “well-suited" to deal with the disaster because of his decades of service in the U.S. Senate and as a former vice president and because of “his genuine concern for people.”“He's got to show empathy right off the bat,” Perry said in an interview. “It's important for a president to go to a place that’s been battered, but be careful about the footprint. He doesn’t want to make things worse.”Biden, should he decide to visit Texas next week, could also use the trip to press his point that climate change is real and must not go unaddressed, and that the state could do things like winterize its power plants to be better prepared for future storms, Perry said.But he should take care to not do so in a scolding kind of way.“We know he cares about climate change, and this is a way to convince people,” Perry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extreme-weather-testing-joe-biden-s-disaster-management-skills-101613802439425.html
20-02-2021||World||Australian PM warns of 'culture problem' after allegations of rape in parliament||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday he was "sickened" by allegations of sexual assault in Parliament House, adding that there was a "culture" problem at the government building.His comments followed reports that a second woman had said she had been assaulted by the same man whom a former media adviser to the government this week publicly accused of rape.Brittany Higgins said on Friday, in a statement reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC), that the man had raped her two years ago in parliament. Reuters has been unable to contact her.Morrison apologised to Higgins on Tuesday for the way her complaint was handled at that time, ordering a probe into the government's workplace culture."I think we've got a problem in the parliament and the workplace culture that exists there," Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Saturday. "We would be naive to think it's not a challenge that other workplaces face all around the country, but I agree the parliament should be setting the standard."Higgins told ABC she was raped by an unnamed colleague who also worked for Morrison's ruling Liberal party and that she would lodge a formal complaint to open a police investigation."These events truly do sicken me... as they should anyone," Morrison said. "That is why I'm seeking to try to address this as swiftly but as effectively as we possibly can."Media reports on Saturday said a second woman alleged she was sexually assaulted by the man in 2020, after he had been sacked following Higgins's allegations and while he was working in the private sector. The second alleged attack occurred at the woman's home after the two had been out for dinner, she was quoted as saying.Reuters was not able to reach the second woman or the man."I am telling my story because I want to support Brittany and I want to help shine a light on this awful culture," she said in anonymous comments reported by The Weekend Australian newspaper.A police media liaison officer in the capital Canberra said on Saturday there was an "open" investigation into the incident involving Higgins but that the case was not "active" because she had not filed a formal complaint.The accusation by the second woman had not been referred to police, the liaison officer said.Higgins told the ABC this week she had not been encouraged to make a police complaint at the time of her assault when she worked in parliament for Defence Minister Lynda Reynolds. Reynolds says Higgins was not pressured against making an official complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-warns-of-culture-problem-after-allegations-of-rape-in-parliament-101613802444512.html

He didn’t disclose financial details.The initial share sale will make it the first logistics company to list in Pakistan and lure investors to a business that’s crucial for the nation’s booming e-commerce industry, according to Topline Securities Pakistan Ltd., financial adviser for the IPO.“There is some crazy exponential growth that is being foreseen right now,” Baxamoosa said in a phone interview. “We have grown organically so far but now it’s about time that we get aggressive.”The courier company that started by handling cargo in 2005 entered the e-commerce business six years later by going door-to-door and convincing companies to start online sales. It even made websites, back-end software and set up a call center for its clients.It now has about 1,000 employees and over 350 vehicles. The company will use the proceeds to boost its network fourfold. It will also add servers and other IT equipment.The nation’s e-commerce industry is in its infancy but is growing rapidly as internet and smartphone penetration jump, according to Ruchir Desai, fund manager at Hong Kong-based Asia Frontier Capital Ltd. The pandemic could be a big trigger for the market, he said.The company handled 2.1 million shipments and 4.5 billion rupees in cash deliveries in the year ended June. It has grown annually by about 70% on average since 2012. The company forecasts revenue will rise more than three times to 4.3 billion rupees in fiscal 2023, according to Baxamoosa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unilevers-pakistan-delivery-partner-plans-ipo-to-expand-network-101613797064923.html

It agreed to strengthen the World Health Organization, a body that the previous US administration had chastized and left.“Drawing on our strengths and values as democratic, open economies and societies, we will work together and with others to make 2021 a turning point for multilateralism and to shape a recovery that promotes the health and prosperity of our people and planet,” leaders said in their communique. “We will intensify cooperation on the health response to covid-19.”Leaders are set to meet in person in Cornwall, south-west England, in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-leaders-pledge-to-protect-jobs-spur-recovery-101613802006104.html
20-02-2021||World||Google AI chief apologizes for researcher’s acrimonious exit||Google will start grading executives based on workforce diversity goals and increase human resources staffing, acknowledging fault in its acrimonious split with Timnit Gebru, a prominent former employee and one of the few Black women in the field of artificial intelligence.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer of parent company Alphabet Inc., described the changes in an email to employees, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information. The email included comments by Jeff Dean, the executive who leads the company’s artificial intelligence and research efforts, saying he was sorry for how he handled Gebru’s exit, according to a copy of the message reviewed by Bloomberg“I understand we could have and should have handled the situation with more sensitivity,” Dean wrote. “And for that, I am sorry.” Dean said Google’s behavior toward Gebru hurt some female and Black employees and led them to question whether they belonged at the company. He did not apologize directly to Gebru in the email to staff.Executives’ performance evaluations will now be partly tied to diversity, equity and inclusion goals, and Google will double the amount of human resources staff working on employee retention, according to the memo.A spokesman for Google declined to comment. The changes were reported earlier Friday by news website Axios.Several large companies have made diversity a factor in executive performance and compensation. They include McDonald’s Corp. and Microsoft Corp.At Google, the changes came after turmoil stemming from Gebru’s departure. She said she was fired in December after refusing to retract a research paper critical of a key Google technology or remove the Google authors from it, prompting outrage from some of her former colleagues internally and online. Google has said that Gebru, the former co-head of ethical AI, resigned.On Thursday, the company appointed Marian Croak as vice president of engineering, elevating an experienced Black woman to lead a new, centralized organization to develop AI responsibly. The further changes outlined Friday marked the conclusion of an internal investigation into the handling of Gebru’s departure.Dean also detailed a plan to clarify the process for approving research papers by Google authors for outside publication. The current process has too many intersecting parts, particularly for “sensitive” research, he said, and what’s considered sensitive isn’t always clear.“We’re building a more unified, start-to-finish process with clearer guidance along the way on what steps are needed, who is accountable at each step and Google’s research goals and priorities,” Dean wrote.Dean did not address the questions raised by the Gebru example as to whether Google’s AI ethics team will be allowed to critically examine the very technologies the search and advertising giant uses in its commercial products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-ai-chief-apologizes-for-researcher-s-acrimonious-exit-101613802250832.html

Gebru, a Black woman, said she was fired in a dispute over a research paper, while Google said it had accepted her resignation.Hundreds of Google employees have signed an online petition protested Gebru's departure. Mitchell, though, was even more outspoken in a January 19 tweet that insinuated that a meeting company CEO Sundar Pichai had scheduled with the leaders of historically Black colleges and universities was merely window dressing.Google said Mitchell was fired after an internal investigation concluded she had broken multiple company policies. The violations included the unauthorized removal of confidential company documents and other private information about its employees, according to Google's statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-fires-ai-manager-who-protested-her-peer-s-departure-101613790707857.html
20-02-2021||World||Britain’s next answer to Covid-19 is to prepare to live with it||Britain’s success at vaccinating faster than anywhere else in Europe is putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to figure out what comes next.While Israel is emerging as the global test case for a country’s ability to inoculate its way out of Covid, the UK is a pilot for whether nations can do enough to end damaging lockdowns and essentially learn to live with the disease. The key, Johnson believes, lies with mass testing in workplaces, schools, shopping centers and theaters to make sure that employees, pupils and customers are Covid-free. He’s expected to set out details in a statement to Parliament on Monday as part of a “road map” out of lockdown, and some companies in retail and hospitality are already gearing up. Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here Hundreds of thousands of tests could be sent out by post every day, including to secondary school pupils. The idea is to come down on outbreaks “like a ton of bricks,” according to foreign secretary Dominic Raab. It is these rapid tests, rather than “vaccination passports” being considered by other countries, that the government wants to be part of daily life. The UK has suffered the continent’s highest death toll and its economy sank by the most since the Great Frost of 1709, albeit with a rebound in the fourth quarter. But on the other extreme, Britain has injected more than a quarter of its population with at least one vaccine shot and is also a frontrunner in identifying potentially more dangerous mutations of the coronavirus.The question is not how to eradicate Covid, but to get to a point where people will never again be banished to their homes, schools closed and stores shuttered. Critics say previous testing failures contributed to the country’s death toll, while some epidemiologists say that potential route to a new normal is fraught with risk given the unreliability of so-called lateral flow tests compared with those that take longer to process.“If you just scatter tests around like fairy dust, it is not going to work,” said Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine. “They’re always looking for the silver bullet, the one thing that will sort it all out. Any public health doctor would tell you that doesn’t work.”Johnson is well aware he’s walking a tightrope. Many within his governing Conservative Party are calling for the reopening of the economy more quickly. Retail sales that are the economy’s lifeblood fell more than twice as fast as expected in January, a report on Friday showed. The concept of mass testing is nothing new for the UK In September, Johnson announced to great fanfare his “Operation Moonshot” plan for millions of tests a day. While that language appears to have been dropped, the plan was resurrected, with the prime minister declaring on Feb. 15 that rapid testing would allow the “toughest nuts to crack”—such as nightclubs and theaters—to open.A 22 billion-pound ($31 billion) testing program has ramped up UK capacity to rates that are among the highest in the world, with more than 760,000 tests carried out in one day earlier this month. That includes both lab-processed polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests that take a day or two, and the lateral flow tests that can give results within 30 minutes.Companies are keen to embrace the rapid tests. Kate Nicholls, chief executive officer of the UKHospitality group, said the industry stood ready to roll out mass testing to make sure nightclubs and events such as conferences and weddings could restart “as swiftly as possible.”Supermarkets are in talks with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on devising a workable solution for testing shop workers and want the focus to be on tests that can be taken at home or in the community, rather than in stores, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions. Workers in the warehouse depots of some supermarkets are already trialing lateral flow tests because that’s easier to manage than inside busy stores, one person said.More businesses need to be encouraged to use regular tests to ensure a safer working environment, the Confederation of British Industry said. “That’s where the business focus is right now, rather than clamoring for the introduction of a domestic vaccine passport,” a spokesperson said.Johnson has rejected the idea that venues will demand vaccination certificates before people can enter and the government is only looking into how it can give people proof of inoculation to travel overseas should other countries require evidence. Ministers have also said it’s up to businesses to decide if they want to require their employees to have the vaccine. Some companies are looking into potential “no jab, no job” contracts. Barchester Healthcare, which runs more than 200 care homes in the U.K., said it was considering whether “staff who refuse the vaccine on non-medical grounds will, by reason of their own decision, make themselves unavailable for work.”Health and social care workers already get regular tests, and businesses with more than 50 employees can order rapid tests via a government website.But there are concerns about false reassurances, and indeed how testing would work in practice for customers rather than workers.The UK Cinema Association told the Daily Mirror newspaper that asking a 250-strong audience to take a test and wait 30 minutes before seeing a two-hour film “seems impractical.” It is also unclear whether companies will—in the longer term—need to pay for the tests themselves rather than the state.Some scientists believe the real focus should be on incentivizing people to stay at home for the required 10 days of isolation to ensure they don’t pass on the virus regardless of any mass testing. Dido Harding, who runs the UK’s test-and-trace program, said this month that at least 20,000 people a day in England were failing to self-isolate properly.Government officials say that lateral flow devices are effective at detecting Covid-19, though anyone who tests negative should recognize that no test is 100% accurate.“If hundreds of thousands of people are tested per week with lateral flow tests, there will be many false results,” said Duncan Robertson, a disease modeler at Loughborough University in England.

20-02-2021||World||4 Taiwanese military intelligence officers held on espionage charges||Four retired Taiwanese military intelligence officers -- including a major general -- have been indicted for spying for China, prosecutors said Saturday.The quartet were charged with developing a spying network and collecting confidential information for Beijing, the Taipei district prosecutors' office said.The two sides have been spying on each other since the Nationalists fled to the island to set up a rival government in 1949, having lost a civil war on the mainland to the communists.China claims self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.Two Taiwanese former colonels were recruited by a Chinese national security official in the southern province of Guangdong, the government lawyers said, and had introduced several colleagues to the official since 2012.Among those allegedly introduced was the ex-major general, identified by his family name Yueh.Yueh received cash, gifts and free excursions during multiple trips to mainland China and Macau, and worked to recruit other officers to "develop an intelligence network" for Beijing, prosecutors said.The accused "were aware of the standoff between our country and the Chinese communists... but they coveted illegal gains such as the perks (offered by China) to do business there, the financial rewards and free trips," prosecutors said in a statement.They face charges under national security law and national intelligence work law.Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taipei since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, in part because she regards Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation.In October, a Taiwanese court sentenced a lieutenant colonel to four years in prison for spying for Beijing, as Chinese state media reported a crackdown on "hundreds" of espionage cases linked to Taiwan and arrested "a batch of Taiwanese spies and their accomplices".Chinese state broadcaster CCTV also aired four television "confessions" by Taiwanese nationals detained in China's opaque judicial system.Multiple Taiwanese nationals have disappeared into Chinese custody accused of various anti-state crimes in cases that have caused an outcry at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-taiwanese-military-intelligence-officers-held-on-espionage-charges-101613800875529.html
20-02-2021||World||US' re-entry into Paris Climate Agreement a 'day of hope', says UN chief||Describing the US' re-entry into the Paris Climate Agreement as a “day of hope” for the world, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said the absence of a “key player” for the past four years was a “missing link” that created a gap and weakened the historic accord.On Friday, the US officially returned to the Paris climate accord, 107 days after it left at the behest of former president Donald Trump.“Today is a day of hope, as the United States officially rejoins the Paris Agreement. This is good news for the United States — and for the world," the Secretary-General said."It is a pleasure to mark this occasion with you all, and particularly with Special Envoy John Kerry, whose own work is reflected in this historic agreement,” Guterres said on Friday during a virtual event to mark the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement.Trump had withdrawn the US from the historic Paris Agreement and Guterres had termed that decision as a “major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.”President Joe Biden had signed several key executive orders just hours after being sworn-in as the 46th President of the United States last month and Washington rejoining the Paris climate accord was among the first steps of the new presidency.Kerry was the US Secretary of State when the Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015. In a symbolic gesture, he had signed the treaty at the UN in April 2016 accompanied by his granddaughter.During the virtual ceremony, Guterres said that for the past four years, the “absence of a key player created a gap in the Paris Agreement; a missing link that weakened the whole.“So today, as we mark the United States re-entry into this treaty, we also recognise its restoration, in its entirety, as its creators intended. Welcome back.”Guterres said that while the Paris Agreement is a historic achievement, he warned that the commitments made so far are not enough and even those commitments made in Paris are not being met.“The warning signs are everywhere. The six years since 2015 have been the six hottest years on record. Carbon dioxide levels are at record highs. Fires, floods and other extreme weather events are getting worse, in every region,” he said.The UN chief cautioned that if nations don’t change course, “we could face a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees this century.” During a press conference on Thursday, Guterres said that the year 2021 is a “make-it-or-break-it year”.“We are not too late, but we need to make sure that we are able, not only to create the conditions for a drastic reduction of emissions in the horizon of the next decade, making it possible to achieve the limit of 1.5 degrees,” he said.The UN chief said a central objective for the United Nations this year is to create a truly global coalition for net-zero emissions by 2050.“In the past year, countries representing 70 per cent of the world economy and 65 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions committed to net zero,” he said.He expressed hope that the US will formally join this coalition very soon, as pledged by President Biden, and will present its concrete plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.“We rely on the United States to build on this with an ambitious and credible Nationally Determined Contribution for 2030, aligned with President Biden’s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions before 2050,” he said. Outlining the actions needed now by the international community, Guterres said the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic is an opportunity to rebuild a stronger and better world.“To do that, we must invest in a green economy that will help to heal the planet and its people, and create well-paying, stable jobs to ensure more equitable and sustainable prosperity,” he said.Now is the time to implement transformative change, by phasing out coal and supporting a just transition, with training and opportunities for people whose jobs will be impacted, he said.He also called on nations to stop investing in fossil fuel projects that ruin people’s health, destroy biodiversity and contribute to climate catastrophe.“The Paris Agreement is our pact with our descendants and the whole human family. This is the race of our lifetimes. We must go much faster, and much farther. It is within our power to build a future of renewable energy and green infrastructure that protects people and planet and ensures prosperity for all,” Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-re-entry-into-paris-climate-agreement-a-day-of-hope-says-un-chief-101613799699473.html
20-02-2021||World||Neera Tanden’s nomination as Joe Biden’s budget czar in jeopardy||Indian-American Neera Tanden’s nomination as US President Joe Biden’s budget czar is in peril after a Democratic senator announced his opposition to her confirmation on Friday.Tanden’s nomination as director of the office of management and budget had run into strong headwinds from the start. It has nothing to do with her qualifications for the job. She is widely seen as capable and had played a key role in shaping former president Barack Obama’s health care law. Instead, it was about the sharp language she has used while attacking Republicans over the years, mostly on Twitter. “I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the office of management and budget,” said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. “For this reason, I cannot support her nomination.”Manchin’s opposition has jeopardised Tanden’s nomination because she needs the support of all 50 Democrats to manage at least a tie in the evenly divided 100-member Senate. Vice-president Kamala Harris’s constitutionally provided tie-breaking vote would then take Tanden across the finish line.Biden is confident of getting her confirmed, though. He told reporters during a visit to a Pfizer facility in Michigan, where the company is manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines, that he’s not pulling her nomination. “I think we are going to find the votes and get her confirmed.”If confirmed, Tanden would become the first American of Indian descent to hold a regular federal cabinet position. Nikki Haley had held a cabinet-rank position as the US ambassador to the UN in the Trump administration. That post was downgraded after her exit. Biden has restored it to cabinet rank for his appointee, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.Anticipating opposition over her past remarks, Tanden had apologised several times at her confirmation hearing. “I do think the last several years have been very polarising and I apologise for my language that has contributed to that,” Tanden had said at a hearing on February 9. “I know it’s on me to demonstrate to this committee and to Republican members and Democratic members I can work with anyone.”Rob Portman, a Republican senator, had referred to her comments about other Republican senators at the hearing, saying, “You wrote that Susan Collins is, quote, ‘the worst’. That Tom Cotton is a fraud. That vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz. You called leader (Mitch) McConnell ‘Moscow Mitch’ and ‘Voldemort’.” In response, Tanden had apologised, saying, “For those concerned about my rhetoric and my language, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for any hurt that they’ve caused.”Tanden had been confronted by her non-Republican victims as well. “Your attacks were not just made against Republicans. There were vicious attacks made against progressives, people who I have worked with, me personally,” Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, had told her at another hearing. Tanden had apologised on that occasion, too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neera-tanden-s-nomination-as-joe-biden-s-budget-czar-in-jeopardy-101613799490252.html
20-02-2021||World||Thailand's prime minister survives no-confidence vote||Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha survived a no-confidence vote Saturday in parliament amid allegations that his government mismanaged the economy, bungled the provision of Covid-19 vaccines, abused human rights and fostered corruption.Nine other ministers also survived the vote.It marked the second no-confidence test Prayuth’s government has faced since taking office in July 2019, following a contested election after Prayuth seized power in a 2014 coup as the army chief. In February last year, Prayuth and five Cabinet ministers easily defeated a no-confidence vote in the lower house.In the latest motion, his government was also criticized for misusing its power to promote police officials and for establishing a cyber unit to attack government critics on social media, among other complaints.But a more serious allegation was that Prayuth has deepened divisions in society by using the monarchy as a shield against criticism of his government.A student-led protest movement has campaigned since last year for Prayuth and his government to step down. They want the constitution to be amended to make it more democratic, and for the monarchy to be reformed to make it more accountable.Also read| Thailand’s second locally-made vaccine set to enter human trials“The biggest fault of Prayuth is that he does not understand the principles of the constitutional monarchy,” said Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of the opposition Move Forward Party.“He used the monarchy to protect himself whenever he was criticized or opposed. This is an evil action, making him no longer qualified to be prime minister,” he said.His accusation refers to the enforcement of Article 112 in the criminal code, also known as the lese majeste law. Prayuth said in June last year that King Maha Vajiralongkorn had expressed his wish for the government not to use the law against defaming the monarchy to prosecute pro-democracy protesters.The legislation allows anyone to file a complaint with the police, with convictions carrying jail terms of up to 15 years per offense. According to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, at least 59 people including several minors were summoned under the law between November and February.The monarchy is widely considered an untouchable bedrock of Thai nationalism.Four well-known protesters including human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa, student leader Parit Chiwarak, and political activists Somyos Prueksakasemsuk and Patiwat Saraiyaem were prosecuted under the law and on sedition charges earlier this month. Their lawyer requested bail but the court denied it.Also read| Pfizer promises to double supply as Joe Biden quickens Covid-19 vaccine rolloutPrayuth said the debate in parliament was "a good opportunity for both sides to do something together for our country and people. And I am ready to clarify every allegation.”Of the 487 lawmakers, 277 are part of the ruling coalition and 210 are with the opposition. The censure motion would require a simple majority, or 244 votes, to pass. Prayuth received 272 votes with 206 voting no-confidence and three remaining silent.On Friday evening, hundreds of protesters held a mock censure motion against Prayuth and the other ministers on the street in front of the parliament building, calling out their alleged corruption and noting their failure to address rising financial inequality in Thailand.Protesters said another rally was planned on Saturday afternoon.Police said they would deploy more than 10,000 officers in Bangkok over the weekend to control the crowds and maintain law and order. Police vehicles, including water canon trucks, have been dispatched near the parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailands-prime-minister-survives-no-confidence-vote-101613796812999.html

President Joe Biden, who served as the Vice President during the Obama administration, issued orders to join the Paris Agreement on day one of his presidency.“… what steps will we take in the next 10 years? And the truth is that everybody has to do that. China, which is the largest emitter in the world needs to be part of the 2020 to 2030 effort.“India needs to be part of it. Russia needs to be part of it. So is Japan… the major emitters, 17 nations, need to really step up and begin to lower those emissions,” Kerry said.Also read| Texas governor's biggest donors: Energy industry that failedThis challenge, he asserted, means that all countries setting bold and achievable targets have to do so here at home and in the course of their declaration of their national determined contributions (NDCs).“We have to drive investment toward climate solutions and innovations and resilience. We need to get the entire world on a path towards net zero emissions, and we need to absolutely make certain that happens no later than 2050 and sooner if possible,” he said.“Ultimately keeping alive the possibility of limiting the planet's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is critical because we now know that anything more than that will have catastrophic implications around the globe,” Kerry said.The UN Climate Conference, COP 26 will take place in Glasgow in November.“I believe that Glasgow is our last, best hope to get the world to pony up, to deliver, to get us on a safer path. To determine that we will do the things necessary in the next decade to keep alive the prospect of limiting the earth's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees and we will keep alive--in fact create a better vision for what we can do by 2050 with net zero,” he said.In his remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said green economy is much more job creator than the brown economy of the past.Also read| US airlines plan to ask passengers for contact-tracing details“If we invest in renewable energy, if you invest in greening our transportation systems, if we invest in greening our agriculture, if we invest in greening all the areas of our economy, we will be creating lots of jobs,” he said.Most of those jobs will benefit young people who have access to new technologies and knowledges of the 21st century, he noted.“But we need at the same time to look into a just transition. We need to make sure that we look at those who will lose their jobs because their activities will phase out. As it is the case already for many other reasons namely because of technology evolution,” he added.The world, he asserted, needs the drastic reduction in emissions in the next decade.“We need to get to net zero in 2050. The scientific community has told us that if the two things are achieved we will be able to keep the temperature below 1.5 degrees of growth at the end of the century,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-emitters-need-to-step-up-says-kerry-after-us-rejoins-paris-agreement-101613793229907.html

20-02-2021||World||US sanctions over pipeline from Russia deemed lacking by GOP||The Biden administration on Friday added a layer of sanctions to a Russian vessel and the shipowner for their work on a new gas pipeline from Russia that is strongly opposed in the US and eastern Europe.But the move was immediately criticised as inadequate by senior Republican lawmakers who noted the administration had not penalized any additional companies or individuals for work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.They also said the new sanctions were redundant as they duplicate existing penalties that the Trump administration had imposed on the pipelaying ship Fortuna and its owner KVT-RUS in January.The sanctions were announced in a report submitted to Congress by the State Department late Friday night, three days after a Feb. 16 deadline for its delivery had passed. Congressional aides expressed surprise that the word “Russia” did not appear in the report except in its title and that it did not discuss in detail any consultations with U.S. partners and allies that would be affected.Like the Trump administration before it, the Biden administration is opposed to the pipeline because it believes it will harm European energy security, particularly for countries in eastern and central Europe like Ukraine and Poland, which the pipeline bypasses.US officials have long said they fear Russia will use the pipeline as a political tool against its neighbours.“We've been clear for some time that Nord Stream 2 is a bad deal and that companies risk sanctions if they are involved,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters just hours before the report was transmitted to Congress.“We'll continue to work with our allies and partners to ensure that Europe has a reliable, diversified energy supply network that doesn't undermine our collective security. Our goal in all of this is to reinforce European energy security and safeguard against predatory behavior,” he said.However, congressional Republicans were unimpressed and denounced the administration for failing to impose any sanctions on additional targets, notably people and firms in Germany, which is a strong Nord Stream 2 proponent. Administration officials have pointed to their relatively short time in office thus far and said they want to review all options before imposing new sanctions.Still, the top GOP members on the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees, Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Michael McCaul, demanded explanations as to what exactly the administration is doing to oppose the completion of the pipeline.“I am deeply troubled and disappointed by the State Department's report on Nord Stream 2 activities and their decision to forgo additional sanctions on other entities involved in its construction," Risch said. “Congress has passed multiple bipartisan laws regarding this project, and specifically broadened the mandatory sanctions to include the types of pipe-laying activities occurring right now. The administration's decision to ignore these activities demands an immediate explanation.”“Simply put, today's sanctions designations are wholly inadequate," said McCaul, who added that simply adding a layer of sanctions to previously penalized targets does not meet lawmakers' intent to stop the pipeline. “Allowing this pipeline to be completed would be nothing short of a victory for Vladimir Putin.”Republican concern about the administration's actions will likely be echoed by some Democrats. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire has co-sponsored legislation opposing the pipeline with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and has been outspoken in her criticism of Nord Stream 2.Opposition to the pipeline and its potential impact on Europe has increased since the poisoning and arrest of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny and the crackdown against demonstrators protesting in his support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-over-pipeline-from-russia-deemed-lacking-by-gop-101613795875948.html
20-02-2021||World||Indian-American Congressman to remove country quota for work-based Green Card||American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi hailed the legislative move to eliminate country quota for employment-based Green Card asserting that these reforms will help the US to retain top talent from across the world while growing the economy.“As an original cosponsor of the Fairness For High-Skilled Immigrants Act, I am proud to announce that this immigration package has incorporated our bill’s fundamental reforms, including the elimination of country-based discrimination for employment-based green cards and the increasing of per-country caps on family-based green cards,” Krishnamoorthi said on Friday.“These reforms will help our country continue to attract and retain top talent from across the world while growing our economy and creating more good-paying jobs here. Any comprehensive immigration bill must include these necessary fixes to end the green card backlog once and for all, and I will continue to fight for these provisions until they become law,” he said.Non-profit South Asian Americans Leading Together, in a statement, said the bill is a historic piece of legislation that proposes a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants, including more than 6,50,000 undocumented South Asians.The bill creates an earned roadmap to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants, providing dreamers, TPS holders, and some farmworkers with an expedited three-year path to citizenship, and giving all other undocumented immigrants an eight-year path.It reforms the family-based immigration system to keep families together by recapturing visas from previous years to clear backlogs, including spouses and children of green card holders as immediate family members, and increasing per-country caps for family-based immigration.The bill updates the employment-based immigration system, eliminating per-country caps, improving access to green cards for workers in lower-wage industries, giving dependents of H-1B holders work authorization, and preventing children of H-1B holders from aging out of the system.It also creates a pilot program to stimulate regional economic development, and incentivizes higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to prevent unfair competition with American workers.The bill also supports asylum seekers and other vulnerable populations by eliminating the one-year deadline for filing asylum claims, reducing asylum application backlogs, increasing protections for U visa, T visa, and VAWA applicants, including by raising the cap on U visas from 10,000 to 30,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-congressman-to-remove-country-quota-for-work-based-green-card-101613793180898.html
20-02-2021||World||Bolsonaro appoints army reserve general to head Petrobras||Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, appointed an army reserve general to lead state-owned energy giant Petrobras, after criticizing several successive increases in the price of fuel."The government decided to appoint Joaquim Silva e Luna to fulfil a new mission, as... president of Petrobras, after closing the cycle, exceeding two years, of the current president Roberto Castello Branco," said a brief note from the Ministry of Mines and Energy, published by the president on his Facebook account.Silva e Luna, formerly the defence minister under president Michel Temer, had been serving as general director of the Itaipu Binacional dam.His nomination will have to be confirmed by the Petrobras board of directors.Earlier Friday Bolsonaro had announced that there would be "changes" at Petrobras."We will never interfere in this great company, nor in its pricing policy, but people cannot be surprised with certain increases," Bolsonaro said during a morning event in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco. He did not give further details.His statements were followed by a sharp drop in the oil company's share prices. They closed down 7.92 percent Friday, with preferred shares down 6.63 percent.Petrobras has increased fuel prices four times so far in 2021, a cumulative rise of nearly 35 percent.The price of gas cylinders, widely used by poor families, has also increased considerably this year, a new blow to people already severely affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Bolsonaro's criticism of the increases, which he called "excessive", calls into question the liberal agenda of his economic minister Paulo Guedes, according to analyst Leandro Giabati.On Thursday, the president announced he would eliminate federal tariffs on diesel and gas for two months, while his government finds a solution to the price hikes.While the situation "is far from signaling that the minister will fall or resign," it "reveals that Guedes has been constantly adapting to the political demands of President Bolsonaro, to the detriment of ... the interests they both represent," Giabati said.Leftist former president Dilma Rousseff froze fuel prices several times in 2014 and 2015 despite the price of oil increasing at the time.But that state intervention into Petrobras prices ended when Rousseff was impeached in 2016 and removed from office.Now prices are fixed by the company according to market variations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-appoints-army-reserve-general-to-head-petrobras-101613790813310.html
20-02-2021||World||Texas governor's biggest donors: Energy industry that failed||As frozen Texas reels under one of the worst electricity outages in US history, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has blamed grid operators and iced-over wind turbines but gone easier on another culprit: an oil and gas industry that is the state's dominant business and his biggest political contributor.And as the toll deepened Saturday from a week of historic winter storms, which have killed more than 20 people in Texas, the dogpiling on a power grid that is proudly isolated from the rest of the country ignores warnings known by the state's GOP leaders for years.“It's almost like a murder suspect blaming their right hand for committing the crime," said Democratic state Rep. James Talarico. His suburban Austin home lost power for 40 hours and had no working faucets Thursday, when roughly one in four people in Texas woke up under instructions to boil water.Like most of the state's 30 million residents, Talarico's power is controlled by grid managers at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which Abbott again laid into Thursday after more than 4 million people at one point were enduring outages in subfreezing temperatures.But that is not where the responsibility ends, as power plants that feed the grid were knocked offline by the extreme cold, and natural gas producers didn't protect wellheads or lines from freezing. “ERCOT is a convenient whipping boy," Talarico said.The crisis has put the fossil fuel industry that lavishes the Texas Capitol with money in the crosshairs in ways that Abbott has not had to navigate when steering America's second-largest state through other disasters, including hurricanes and the ongoing pandemic. For the first time Thursday, Abbott called on Texas to mandate that power plants be winterized.Oil and gas built and enriched Texas, and with that its politicians, including those who became president. But none has reaped campaign contributions on the scale of Abbott, who in six years in office has raised more than $150 million from donors, more than any governor in U.S. history.Texas' energy interests are the biggest backers of his political rise, and he has not ruled out a White House run in 2024. More than $26 million of his contributions have come from the oil and gas industry, more than any other economic sector, according to an analysis by the National Institute on Money in Politics.As Texas' grid first began buckling early Monday, Abbott drew overnight backlash after going on Fox News and laying fault on solar and wind producers, at a time when natural gas, coal and nuclear energy systems were responsible for nearly twice as many outages.Pressed on those comments later, Abbott took a softer tone and acknowledged every source of power had been compromised. Frozen natural gas lines also left millions without power in Mexico.Abbott accused ERCOT of misleading the public with messages that the grid was ready for the storm.“It's especially unacceptable when you realize what ERCOT told the state of Texas," Abbott said.ERCOT is overseen by the Texas Public Utility Commission, whose three members are appointed by Abbott. While ERCOT manages most of Texas' power grid, the commission and the Texas Legislature made key policy decisions that have factored into the ongoing crisis.After the state's last major freeze, during the 2011 Super Bowl held in Arlington, Texas, a federal analysis found that energy producers' procedures for winterising their equipment “were either inadequate or were not adequately followed” in many cases. The report repeatedly cites another Texas freeze, in 1989, as a clear warning.Girding power generators against fierce winter weather is essential in colder climates. In Iowa, where wind farms supply 40% of the state's electricity, windmills have been turning all week despite temperatures that dropped to minus 17 degrees (minus 27 degrees Celsius) in Des Moines. In Texas, grid officials say they can't speak for why power generators here don't do the same.A decade ago, the report on the last Texas failure listed a number of ways to winterise an oil well or a natural gas device and the estimated costs: installing a cold-weather production unit ($23,000), collecting gas vented from an injection pump to supply a heater ($675), or building a fiberglass hut to enclose the production equipment ($1,500).Winterising 50,000 wells — just under a third of the number of total natural gas wells active in Texas — was estimated in 2011 to cost as much as $1.75 billion, a figure that would almost certainly be higher today due to inflation. By comparison, the Texas oil and natural gas industry paid $13.9 billion in taxes and royalties last year alone, according to figures from the Texas Oil & Gas Association.Republican Ryan Sitton, the former commissioner of the peculiarly named Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, said an issue with bolstering power plants is the cost passed on to electric customers. Of Abbott's focus on ERCOT, Sitton said: “Calling for an investigation is easy. Actually performing a good investigation and taking ownership of the results is where the rubber meets the road."He said oil and gas interests, which generously funded his own political campaigns, don't hold the sway that the public imagines.“They make donations, sure.

20-02-2021||World||US airlines plan to ask passengers for contact-tracing details||The US airline industry is pledging to expand the practice of asking passengers on flights to the United States for information that public health officials could use for contact tracing during the pandemic.An industry trade group said Saturday that the carriers would turn over the information to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which could use it to contact passengers who might be exposed to the virus that causes Covid-19.Delta and United have been doing that since December. On Friday, an industry trade group said that American, Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue and Hawaiian will also ask passengers to make their names, phone numbers, email and physical addresses available to the CDC.The airlines had long resisted government efforts to require them to gather passenger information and provide it to health agencies. They said they don't have the information on passengers who buy tickets from other sellers such as online travel agencies. They also argued that gathering the information and making it immediately available to the government would be time-consuming and require costly upgrades to computer systems.The CEO of trade group Airlines for America, Nicholas Calio, said carriers hope that their offer of voluntary information gathering, along with testing of passengers entering the US, will lead the government to lift restrictions on international travel.Although the requests are only voluntary, United Airlines said Friday that since December most of its international customers have provided contact details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-airlines-plan-to-ask-passengers-for-contact-tracing-details-101613788849286.html

We want to work through this issue.”The prime minister also welcomed a report that a Facebook executive had apologized for the company mistakenly shutting down pages operated by charities and others that covered public-health and safety announcements. Morrison described the actions as “completely indefensible.”Facebook on Thursday blocked news sharing on its platform in Australian in response to a legal standoff with the government, which is expected to pass laws next week aimed at compensating the local media industry for advertising revenue lost to digital platforms.Facebook’s dispute on news sharing in Australia is part of a broader battle against global regulation, with lawmakers in other countries watching the case closely.In contrast, Alphabet Inc.-owned Google -- which also opposes the legislation -- negotiated a string of deals in the past week with media Australian companies in a bid to avoid the arbitration process enforced by the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-says-facebook-back-at-the-table-after-blocking-pages-101613785366643.html
20-02-2021||World||Joe Biden declares 'America is back' in welcome words to allies||President Joe Biden used his first address before a global audience Saturday to declare that "America is back, the transatlantic alliance is back,” after four years of a Trump administration that flaunted its foreign policy through an “America First” lens.Speaking to the annual Munich Security Conference virtually, Biden ticked through a daunting to-do list — salvaging the Iran nuclear deal, meeting economic and security challenges posed by China and Russia and repairing the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic — that he said would require close cooperation between the US and its Western allies.Without mentioning Donald Trump's name once in his speech, Biden mixed talk of a reinvigorated democratic alliance with a rebuke of his predecessor's approach, a message warmly received by Western allies.'I know the past few years have strained and tested the transatlantic relationship,” Biden said. “The United States is determined to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership.”The president also participated Friday in a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, where leaders managed to work Biden's campaign theme into their closing joint statement, vowing to “work together to beat Covid-19 and build back better.”“Welcome back, America,” said European Council President Charles Michel, effectively summing up the mood of the Munich conference.But while such happy talk conveyed the palpable sense of relief among allies at Biden's full-throated commitment to mending frayed US-Europe relations, plenty has changed over the past four years in ways creating new challenges.China has cemented its place as a fierce economic competitor on the continent as the U.S. has reconsidered long-held national security and economic priorities embedded in the transatlantic alliance. Populism has grown through much of Europe. And other Western countries have, at moments, sought to fill the vacuum left as America stepped back from the world stage.German Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that some differences between the US and Europe remain “complicated.” Europe sees China's economic ambitions as less of an existential threat than the US does and has its own strategic and economic concerns that are not always in sync with Biden on Russia as well.Still, Merkel, who had a strained relationship with Trump, didn't hide her preference for an American foreign policy informed by Biden's world view.“Things are looking a great deal better for multilateralism this year than two years ago, and that has a lot to with Joe Biden having become the president of the United States of America,” Merkel said.“His speech just now, but also his administration's first announcements, have convinced us that this is not just talk but action.”Biden made his address to a global audience as his administration this week took steps to reverse key Trump administration policies.He said that the US stands ready to rejoin talks about reentering the 2015 multilateral Iran nuclear deal abandoned by the Trump administration. The Biden administration announced Thursday its desire to reengage Iran, and it took action at the United Nations aimed at restoring policy to what it was before Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018.Biden also spoke out about the two-decade war in Afghanistan, where he faces a May 1 deadline to remove the remaining 2,500 US troops under a Trump administration negotiated peace agreement with the Taliban. He also called for cooperation in addressing economic and national security challenges posed by Russia and China and identified cyberspace, artificial intelligence and biotechnology as areas of growing competition.“We must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with China,” Biden declared.His message was girded by an underlying argument that democracies -- not autocracies -- are models of governance that can best meet the challenges of the moment. The president urged fellow world leaders to show together that “democracies can still deliver.”At the G-7, administration officials said, Biden focused on what lies ahead for the international community as it tries to extinguish the public health and economic crises created by the coronavirus pandemic. He announced the US will soon begin releasing $4 billion for an international effort to bolster the purchase and distribution of vaccine to poor nations, a program that Trump refused to support.Biden's turn on the world stage came as the US officially rejoined the Paris climate agreement, the largest international effort to curb global warming. Trump announced in June 2017 that he was pulling the US out of the landmark accord, arguing that the pact would undermine the American economy.Biden announced the US intention of rejoining on the first day of his presidency, but he had to wait 30 days for the move to go into effect. He has said that he will bake considerations about climate change into every major domestic and foreign policy decision his administration faces."This is a global existential crisis," Biden said.Biden also encouraged G-7 partners to make good on their pledges to COVAX, an initiative by the World Health Organization to improve access to vaccines, even as he reopens the US spigot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-declares-america-is-back-in-welcome-words-to-allies-101613787930924.html

But he also said that any semblance of normalcy may still many months away."We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July. That doesn't mean it'll be in all Americans' arms, but enough vaccine will be available," Biden said in a warehouse filled with hundreds of ultra-cold freezers each holding 360,000 vaccine doses."I can't give you a date when this crisis will end," Biden said. But I can tell you: We're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later."Also read| Pfizer, BioNTech say Covid-19 vaccine can withstand warmer temperaturesLess than 15% of the US population has been vaccinated against the highly contagious illness that has claimed nearly 500,000 lives in the United States.Bourla said it is possible to increase supply because of improvements in the manufacturing processes at the plant, better lab testing methods and Biden's use of powers under the Defense Production Act to speed up manufacturing.During the visit to the Michigan plant, Biden challenged the company to deliver even earlier the 300 million doses of the vaccine it has agreed to supply by the end of July, and the company is looking for ways to speed production, Bourla said.To that end, Pfizer said that by the end of the year it will add manufacturing capacity in Michigan, raw material production capacity both in Michigan and Connecticut, and add production lines to put vaccine into vials in Kansas. It has also engaged two US contract manufacturers to help produce the shots.Biden also stressed vaccine production standards during the tour, as he encouraged Americans to get vaccinated. "I just toured where it is being made," he said. "It takes more time to do the check for safety than make that vaccine. That is how fastidious they are."Pfizer has said it will provide the US government with 100 million doses by the end of March and 100 million more by the end of May. The company has already provided 40 million doses to the US government, as of Feb. 17, Bourla said.Also read| Covid-19 mutations N440K, E484K, V911I: All you need to knowPfizer is one of the largest employers in the Kalamazoo County area Biden visited. Heavily industrialized Michigan was key to Biden's 2020 election victory over former President Donald Trump.The US drugmaker has not yet met all of its global commitments on vaccine supply. As of Wednesday, it had not yet delivered to the European Union about 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that were due in December, EU officials told Reuters.Pfizer developed the two-dose vaccine with Germany’s BioNTech SE.Moderna Inc, which is also producing Covid-19 vaccine domestically, has agreed to supply the United States with 300 million doses of its own similar two-shot vaccine by the end of July.Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's top medical adviser, said on Tuesday that demand still far outpaces supply at the moment.Jeff Williams, mayor of Arlington, Texas, who met with Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in recent weeks, said his city of 400,000 was ready to vaccinate 40,000 people a day but only had enough supply to administer 3,000 doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-promises-to-double-supply-as-joe-biden-quickens-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-101613781845149.html

He did not say who would replace González García as health minister.Gonzalez Garcia had not spoken publicly about the resignation request, but the official said he was no longer part of the government.The scandal erupted when journalist Horacio Verbitsky, whose stories and columns on a website and on the radio are seen as pro-government, said he called the minister to request a vaccination and González García summoned him to the Health Ministry where he received a Sputnik V vaccine shot Friday.Also read| India administers 10 million vaccine doses, second quickest drive in world“I decided to get vaccinated. I started to find out where to do it. I called my old friend Ginés González García, whom I have known long before he was a minister,” Verbitsky told a local radio station. “I went to the ministry and the team of vaccinators was there.”The case is not isolated in Argentina, where in recent days reports have emerged of mayors, legislators, activists and people close to political power receiving the vaccine despite not being in the priority group of doctors, health personnel and the elderly authorized to receive shots.Fernández's government has been harshly criticized for Argentina's slow vaccination operation. So far, the South American country has received about 1.5 million doses, mostly Sputnik V but also AstraZeneca, insufficient to immunize a population of 40 million.Argentina has had 2 million people infected by the coronavirus and 50,857 deaths from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentine-health-minister-verbitsky-resigns-amid-covid-19-vaccine-scandal-101613777892185.html

Cisco stated this in a 10-Q filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday (local time).The San Jose, California-based company said the investigation was focused on allegations of a "self-enrichment" scheme involving employees in China who have since left the company. Some of the employees are alleged to have made payments to various third parties, including employees of state-owned enterprises, said Cisco.The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law, prohibits US-linked companies from making payments to foreign public officials to obtain any business advantage. Under the law, public officials can include employees of state-owned enterprises, which are prevalent in China, The Wall Street Journal reported.The company takes such allegations seriously and expects employees to adhere to local and national laws and high ethical standards, said a Cisco spokesman in a statement on Wednesday (local time).He declined to comment further on the investigation but said Cisco didn't expect it to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position.Meanwhile, China's antitrust regulator this year approved a deal negotiated by Cisco to acquire Acacia Communications Inc., a Maynard, Massachusetts-based competitor. The regulator outlined several conditions to the deal, including ones that require Cisco to fulfil existing contracts with Chinese clients and keep commercial terms unchanged, The Wall Street Journal reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cisco-suspects-possible-embezzlement-scheme-in-its-china-operations-101613780455194.html

Standing behind a police cordon, they cheered his release.“I thank all those who have shown solidarity with us in Algeria and abroad, because of our combat as free and independent journalists and the fight of all imprisoned journalists and all prisoners of opinion. We will all be free when all the prisoners are free," Drareni said after his release.Drareni was imprisoned for “inciting an unarmed gathering” and “endangering national unity,” charges linked to his coverage of the protest movement. His arrest drew criticism outside Algeria as a threat to press freedom.Drareni founded the Casbah Tribune news site and worked for French TV channel TV5 Monde, among others, as well as for the international media watchdog Reporters Without Borders.Also read| Beijing on diplomatic charge amid pullback“I’m brought to tears, Khaled has just been freed!” said Mahrez Rabia, a friend and radio journalist.The Hirak movement helped push out Algeria’s long-serving former president in 2019 and inspire new efforts to fight corruption.

20-02-2021||World||New Mexico legislature moves to preserve abortion rights||A Democrat-led Legislature in New Mexico pushed forward Friday to ensure future access to abortions by voting to repeal a dormant ban on most abortion procedures, marking a defiant counterpoint to efforts in some conservative states.New Mexico lawmakers approved the repeal of the 1969 statute that has gone unenforced since the US Supreme Court upheld the right to an abortion. Left in place, the statute could go back into effect if the high court eventually overturns the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham previously said she would sign the proposal if approved by the Legislature.Abortion bans have been proposed in at least 10 states with Republican-led Legislatures that could test where the current US Supreme Court stands after the appointment of three conservative justices by former President Donald Trump.In South Carolina, a federal judge on Friday suspended a new law approved just two days earlier that would ban most abortions.New Mexico is a heavily Roman Catholic state where Democrats control every statewide office, the state Supreme Court and most congressional seats.Also read| Left in the dark, Texas slips on iceIts 52-year-old abortion statute allows medical termination of a pregnancy with permission of a specialized hospital board only in instances of incest, rape reported to police, grave medical risks to the woman and indications of grave medical defects in the fetus.The law has been dormant since 1973, when the nation’s highest court issued the Roe v. Wade decision, overriding state laws that banned or severely restricted access to abortion procedures.“With uncertainty at the federal level, New Mexico needs to be clear about women’s rights, women’s health care, women’s reproductive choices, abortion and abortion care,” Lujan Grisham said in a video conference with news media.Supporters of New Mexico's restrictions on abortions say a repeal would drive valued medical professionals from New Mexico who are conscientious objectors to abortion procedures.Also read| US extends travel restrictions at land borders with Canada, MexicoThe House deliberations Friday were dominated by pro-abortion rights comments from female legislators who make up a majority of the chamber and the Democratic caucus.“Should the protections of Roe v. Wade fall or be changed, we won’t go back to the days when I was a teenager and women had to take their chances with unsafe conditions and untrained abortion providers,” said Democratic state Rep. Joanne Ferrary of Las Cruces. “Many lost their lives or suffered permanent injury, such as infertility.”The state Senate approved the bill last week with a 27-15 vote. Two Democrats joined Republicans in opposition.Five Democratic state senators who joined Republicans to keep the abortion law in place in 2019 were ousted from office last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-mexico-legislature-moves-to-preserve-abortion-rights-101613777871049.html

20-02-2021||World||Beijing on diplomatic charge amid pullback||On a day when it finally admitted that it had suffered casualties at Galwan, China on Friday launched a renewed push to blame India both for tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the deadly clash last year, releasing several videos that sought to portray Indian troops as trespassers and aggressors.The move came after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Daily released details for the first time of four soldiers who were killed, and an officer who was injured in the clash at Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020. It is extremely rare for the Chinese military to publicly acknowledge casualties – for instance, it is yet to release official casualty figures for the war with Vietnam in 1979.China’s defence and foreign ministries issued statements that pinned the blame for the death of Chinese soldiers at Galwan Valley on India. Twenty Indian soldiers were also killed in that clash, when troops from both sides fought for hours with iron rods, clubs covered with barbed wire and rocks. These were the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975.Experts questioned the timing of the release of the official statements and videos portraying India as the aggressor, just hours ahead of the 10th round of talks between military commanders at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC on Saturday. The talks are meant to take forward the disengagement process following the drawdown of forces and armoured vehicles by both sides on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Lake. Some analysts also questioned the veracity of the Chinese numbers.China’s state media featured the videos and emotionally charged articles, urging citizens to remember the “martyrs” and recounting how four PLA soldiers sacrificed their lives while defending the western borders. The four soldiers and PLA regimental commander Qi Fabao, who was seriously injured in the clash, received military honours, the state media announced, citing the Central Military Commission (CMC).The title of “border-defending hero” was posthumously conferred on battalion commander Chen Hongjun, while Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran posthumously received a “first-class merit”. Qi Fabao received the title of “hero regiment commander for defending the border”.“They all died in a clash with trespassing foreign military personnel wielding steel tubes, cudgels and stones last June,” official Xinhua news agency reported, citing PLA Daily. The defence ministry said the families of all five soldiers would be well looked after.The videos, which purportedly portrayed the build-up to the Galwan Valley clash, identified the Indian soldiers only as “foreign” troops and the accompanying commentary painted them as trespassers – an allegation consistently denied by India.There were several versions of the videos, ranging in length from a little more than a minute to eight minutes, that were released by outlets such as national broadcaster CCTV’s English channel CGTN and the nationalistic tabloid Global Times. The videos, which appear to be edited, show troops from the two sides negotiating and jostling with each other. The background comprises ravines, a flowing river and steep cliffs. It is believed that China’s communication offensive may be aimed at shaping the narrative for its domestic constituency in the wake of the ongoing disengagement in Ladakh.There was no official response to China’s moves from Indian officials. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian side has opted to focus on the military commanders’ talks on Saturday instead of being sidetracked by controversial allegations.“Our focus is on the talks to take forward the disengagement process. Besides, the Indian side’s position on the situation has been amply conveyed by the Indian Army’s Northern Commander in recent interviews,” one of the people cited above said, referring to Lt Gen YK Joshi’s interaction with the Indian media.The people and experts also pointed out that the articles in the PLA Daily and Global Times were about Chinese soldiers who were decorated for the role in the Galwan Valley clash and didn’t amount to a full listing of Chinese casualties.Global Times editor Hu Xijin wrote that Wang Zhuoran, the youngest of the four dead soldiers, was only 19 years old, while Chen Xiangrong and Xiao Siyuan were both 24.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while blaming India for the clash, contended the PLA Daily’s report had put the truth out in the open. “The Galwan (Valley) incident is so sad and the responsibility, as the Indian side has acknowledged, is with the Indian side. But due to the irresponsible rumours spread by the Indian media, they have misled public opinion, so the unveiling of the true story will help people to better know the whole story,” Hua told a regular news briefing.“This will be a way to pay tribute to our heroes and martyrs and also will help the Indian side to draw lessons from it and better work with China to uphold peace and stability in the border region and properly resolve the border issue,” she said.Hua added: “We hope the border issue will be put in the proper place in our bilateral relations.”Asked why China took more than eight months to release casualty statistics, Hua said the “truth” was long awaited and it was “necessary for people to know the true story”. Noting that one of the dead soldiers would become a father four months after his death and another was getting ready for marriage, she said: “I think our peace today is hard to come by.”Defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang, in a statement published on China’s social media, also blamed India for the clash. Ren contended the Indian Army illegally crossed the LAC, took the lead in provocation, and attacked Chinese negotiators, deliberately creating conflict in Galwan Valley and causing casualties on both sides.Ren added China’s position on resolving the border problem has been clear, consistent, and sincere. China, he said, is committed to resolve disputes through dialogue and negotiation, and is always ready to maintain stability in relations between the two militaries.The commentary in the Chinese videos too alleged that “foreign troops” had trespassed into Chinese territory since April last year and built bridges and roads, while conducting reconnaissance missions. The commentary further alleges the foreign troops altered the status quo and escalated the dispute on the LAC.The videos alleged the “foreign troops” assaulted Chinese soldiers, who were outnumbered. The commentary also alleged the “foreign troops were utterly defeated”. India has consistently denied allegations of acting in a provocative manner since the standoff began in May last year and said the PLA trespassed across the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-on-diplomatic-charge-amid-pullback-101613765782579.html
20-02-2021||India||Goa CM Pramod Sawant pitches for resumption of iron ore mining at PM's meet||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant pitched for the resumption of iron ore mining in Goa through handling the case ‘separately’ as well as relief for smaller states which do not have much land available for ‘development’.In his pitch before the Prime Minister during the NITI Aayog meeting, Sawant sought ‘amendments’ for small states like Goa to enable them to also benefit from Central government projects.“We request you for relief on (the resumption of) mining activity. We would request the central government to bring reform and handle Goa's case separately. We got Liberation in 1961 and we did not get a second renewal. It has impacted the state economy and employment,” Sawant told the meeting.Mining in Goa is shut since 2018 when the Supreme Court decreed that all of Goa’s 88 mining leases were renewed illegally and that they should in fact have been granted as fresh leases and not renewals.“Our major export was mining. Since mining is banned, our exports are banned. In the pharma sector there is export (but) all exports of pharma products are carried out through JNPT,” Sawant said.“We had requested for a medical device park to enhance pharma exports. We need infrastructure at Mormugao Port to facilitate this which will bring us relief,” Sawant said.Despite promises to help restart mining, the ‘cure’ sought by the Goa government in the form of an ‘amendment’ to the Act has not been acceded to by the Central government.Sawant also said that Goa being a small state with much of the area as eco-sensitive was ‘missing out’ on Central government projects owing to the large nature of such projects.“Goa is the smallest state, which has an area of only 3702 sq. km which is Western Ghats on the eastern side and the Arabian Sea to the west. We have maintained 66 per cent forest cover, private forests, eco sensitive zones, wetland zones and CRZ activity. Only 30 per cent land is available for development activities. We seek relief for smaller states and UTs by way of (an) amendment,” Sawant said without elaborating on what amendments he was seeking.Sawant also pitched for amendments to the CRZ regulation to allow for mining of Goa’s riverbeds for sand to help meet the state’s sand demand besides also asking the Centre to sanction those central projects for the state that do not require much space.“Central projects need huge land. We are requesting vertical mobility for such projects. This will bring relief for small states, which cannot spare a lot of land for central government projects,” he said at the meeting.Sawant also raised the Mahadayi issue before the council saying that the state needed ‘help’ as it needed the water of the Mahadayi for drinking while raising fears that with Karnataka having diverted the river, the salinity in Goa was bound to increase inland.“The salinity testing for it had been carried out by the WRD minister. If Mahadayi water level reduces and it is diverted, then salinity may increase, which may again cause problems. This is a sensitive issue in the state,” Sawant said.Sawant while thanking the Prime Minister for the ₹300 crore bonanza also pledged to help the Centre complete projects like the Mopa International Airport, the state’s second airport, highway and railway expansion and other projects that have been met with resistance in Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-pramod-sawant-pitches-for-resumption-of-iron-ore-mining-at-pm-s-meet-101613844608050.html

During this period, the country's per capita income rose from ₹63,462 to ₹134,226, a growth of 111.51 per cent. The per capita income of Odisha in 2019-20 at current prices was higher than that of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.The survey found that the long-term increasing trend in per capita income was possible due to the adoption of new-age technology, implementation of new agricultural policy, boosting industrial investment and other such growth-promoting measures which led to higher GSDP growth in Odisha.Also read: India, Maldives sign 5 deals, EAM hands over 1 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccinesDue to the impact of Covid-19, the per-capita income of Odisha is expected to decline by 2.30 per cent as against the decline of 5.41 per cent at the national level."The Covid-19 surge took an unprecedented toll on the state’s economy by creating both supply and demand shocks. A contraction in economic activity and government measures to minimise the adverse impact stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, with frequent lockdowns, weak demand conditions and the temporary suspension of company operations led to the shutdown of business, industries and services," the survey said.However, Odisha’s real per capita income has consistently remained below the national average and the gap between the country's and state's per capita income has widened over the years. It swelled from ₹14,963 in 2011-12 to ₹29,660 in 2019-20.As per a World Bank study (2016), consumption inequality in the state is lower than the national average. The study confirmed that poverty reduction is faster in Odisha in comparison to many low-income states. As per the Planning Commission’s report, Odisha reduced the poverty rate by 24.61 per cent since 2004-05 which is the second-highest across all the states and far ahead of the national rate of 15.28 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odishas-per-capita-income-to-decline-by-over-2-due-to-covid19-101613843215225.html

They are currently on a 450-km padayatra which will culminate in the Bengaluru rally on February 21.People aware of the developments say that the BJP is trying to convince the seers leading the agitation to submit just a memorandum on 21 February but the other stakeholders, including from the opposition parties, want to keep the pressure on the government.Basavajaya Mrityunjaya Swami, an influential seer from the Koodalasangama Panchamasali Mahapeetha, had recently said that they would surround Vidhana Soudha, the seat of power in Karnataka, until their demands are met.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had earlier this month ordered for a detailed assessment and report on the socio-economic conditions of the Panchamasali Lingayats.The state government is facing demands for revision of the existing quota from various communities too, including the dominant Vokkaliga and Veerashaiva-Lingayat.Also making the demands are the backward Kuruba community which is seeking the Scheduled Tribe (ST) tag, and the Valmikis who want ST quota to be hiked from three per cent to 7.5 per cent.Yediyurappa belongs to the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community. Amid these demands, he had said that his government would do whatever was possible within the ambit of the law and the Constitution.Karnataka at present provides 15 per cent reservation for SCs, 3 per cent for STs and 32 per cent for the other backward classes (OBC), which adds up to 50 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quota-crisis-in-karnataka-panchamasalis-to-hold-rally-in-bengaluru-on-sunday-101613841594541.html

20-02-2021||India||All you need to know about H5N8 strain of avian flu||Russia on Saturday reported the world's first case of transmission of the H5N8 strain of avian flu from animals to humans. Seven workers of a poultry farm in southern Russia, were found to be infected where an outbreak was recorded among the birds in December.What is H5N8?The H5N8 is a sub-type of the Influenza A virus that causes flu-like symptoms in birds and mammals. Before Russia reported its first case of human transmission H5N8 was largely believed to be restricted to birds and poultry. The more widely known strain of avian influenza is the H1N1, which is responsible for all the major flu outbreaks, like 1918 Spanish flu, the 2009 Swine flu outbreak et al. Reuters reported that in recent months outbreaks of the H5N8 strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and North Africa but only ever in poultry till Saturday.Is it lethal for humans?The H5N8 strain of avian influenza is not lethal for humans, a fact that Anna Popova, head of Russian consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, attested to. The seven Russian poultry farm workers who had been infected are doing okay, according to Reuters. Recently, an H5N8 outbreak was reported in Beed district of Maharashtra, reported news agency ANI.Properly cooked meat or poultry and boiled eggs are considered to be safe for human consumption by the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying. "It is appealed to the citizens that they should not consume raw, half-cooked poultry meat or eggs. It is also urged not to spread misconceptions and rumors based on unscientific information about bird flu," said the ministry.During the budget season of the Parliament, minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey, told Lok Sabha that strains of H5N1, H5N8, and H5 have been detected in India so far. However, no laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza have been reported in the country. Reuters reported on February 3, in the midst of a similar outbreak in Germany, that risk to human beings is considered to be low and it mostly leads to massive culling of poultry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-h5n8-strain-of-avian-flu-101613840338836.html

"India's first and largest Covid-19 vaccine support was given to the Maldives. It is the first country where India-made vaccines landed," he said.He said India has looked beyond post-Covid economic recovery and India's air travel bubble with the Maldives contributed significantly in reviving the tourism sector."An extraordinarily deep partnership reaffirmed. Comprehensive talks with FM @abdulla_shahid. Deeply appreciate our close cooperation during Covid. Agreed to look beyond at post-pandemic economic recovery," Jaishankar tweeted after the talks with Shahid.After the talks, Shahid said they had a productive meeting and the two sides discussed several issues, including projects being carried out with Indian financial support, Covid-19 pandemic and recovery, consular matters and multilateral cooperation.Later, speaking at an event at Ekuveni Stadium here Jaishankar offered a USD 40 million Line of Credit to the Maldives in a bid to boost the sports infrastructure of the country.He said that India acknowledges the high priority accorded by President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih to sports… and India is privileged to be a partner in that effort. “I am happy to announce that in order to support the development of sports infrastructure to fulfil the interests and aspirations of the Maldivian people, India has offered a standalone Line of Credit of USD 40 million for sports infrastructure in the Maldives,” Jaishankar said.He said that the Maldivian people have tremendous sporting talent."India is a trusted and reliable partner," the minister said in his address.Jaishankar is visiting the Maldives at the invitation of Shahid. It is his second official visit to the Maldives, following his visit to attend the 5th Indian Ocean Conference in 2019.According to the Maldivian Foreign Ministry, Jaishankar, during his visit, will inaugurate some projects undertaken with Indian grant assistance and witness the exchange of several agreements and MoUs between the two countries.In the Maldives, Jaishankar will call on President Solih and have substantive discussions with the ministers for defence, finance, economic development and planning and infrastructure, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement in New Delhi earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timetested-relationship-with-maldives-poised-to-take-quantum-jump-jaishankar-101613840142255.html

The density of population in Assam at 397 per sq km is higher than the national average, he said. "We appeal for exemption so that the state can catch up with other states of the country for setting up mega projects". The chief minister also requested for the intervention of the ministry of power to explore possibilities of reduction in the tariff for NTPC's Bongaigaon unit for Assam. He said that NITI Aayog has given the states an empowered role as equal partners in national development. In a bid to contribute to the goal of making India a global manufacturing hub, the Assam government besides enacting Ease of Doing Business Act has introduced several investment friendly policies and created a single window agency which has enabled investors to apply online. Enumerating projects completed in Assam, Sonowal said it has set up industrial land bank and completed implementation and achieved compliance of District Business Reform Action Plan and the department for promotion of industry and internal trade. A multi model logistic park is being developed at Jogighopa in collaboration with the union ministry of road transport and highways. He said the state government now has new land policy and during the last four and half years it has distributed land pattas to over 3.35 lakh indigenous landless families. It has also taken exhaustive measures to boost organic farming. As a result the area under organic farming in Assam has increased from 6000 hectare in 2015-16 to 43,000 hectare now. The state government is also taking steps for facilitating ease of export, agri-marketing infrastructure, improving the infrastructure for post-harvest management, cold chain management, marketing inkages, PPCs etc. He said the state government has developed the air cargo terminal at Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport to promote export of agricultural products and is supporting innovative and startup agri business and food processing industries. Skill Development and Entrepreneurship are the focussed areas for 'Atmanirbhar Assam' and to meet the skilled manpower globally, North East Skill Centre is being established under the aegis of Assam Skill Development Mission in collaboration with ITE Education Services, Singapore, Sonowal said.

20-02-2021||India||Military commanders discuss further disengagement in eastern Ladakh||Senior military commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies on Saturday met in eastern Ladakh to discuss the roadmap for further disengagement of their troops at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), with the talks taking place after the completion of the first round of disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector, people tracking the developments said on the condition of anonymity.The corps commander-ranked officers met at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC for the 10th round of military dialogue to ease tensions in the Ladakh sector. The talks began at 10 am and were in progress when this report was filed.Outstanding problems with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra - friction points on the contested border - were on the agenda, said one of the persons cited above.“The proposals discussed during the talks to normalise the border situation will be put up by both sides before their higher authorities. The agreement on the next steps of disengagement will be finalised after that. We expect disengagement at the remaining friction points to proceed smoothly as it did in the main trouble area (Pangong Tso heights),” said a second person.Also read: Over 5,000 Covid-19 variants in India - Here are more transmissible onesThe India-China border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre along with advanced weaponry.The PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The Pangong disengagement took place on strategic heights on both banks of the lake. It saw the two armies pull back their frontline troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) and artillery guns under an agreement reached earlier this month. The disengagement began on February 10.“I think we should not expect very speedy results (in other areas). Depsang, in particular, is one area where discussions to arrive at a consensus could be protracted,” former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda said on the eve of the military talks.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points. The first round of disengagement at Pangong Tso involved the pulling back of troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline at heights of almost 18,000 feet as well as withdrawing soldiers holding positions on the Kailash range on the south bank.On the north bank, the PLA has retreated to its base east of Finger 8, while the Indian Army has moved back to its permanent position near Finger 3. Under the disengagement agreement, neither side will patrol the contested areas in between Fingers 4 and 8 until an agreement is reached through future talks.The Indian claim line extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4.India’s bold moves on the south bank of Pangong Tso last August boosted the army’s bargaining power during military talks and eventually led to an agreement on disengagement. The Indian Army occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the south bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29, 2020.The Indian Army followed this up by rushing its front-line tanks and ICVs to strategic heights held by its soldiers.Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi told media last week that India and China were on the brink of war after the actions on the south bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-commanders-discuss-further-disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh-101613837415070.html

20-02-2021||India||Over 5,000 Covid-19 variants prevalent in India, say scientists: Here are more transmissible ones||A group of scientists have said that more than 5,000 variants of the coronavirus are prevalent in India. The scientists, however, said that the novel variants that are worrying many countries globally have been identified with only a low prevalence in India so far.The study has been carried out by Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).Presenting the exhaustive list of the 5,000 variants, the scientists said that some of these variants - like E484K mutation and the N501Y mutation - have higher transmission rate."However, their apparent low prevalence might be simply because not enough sequencing has been done. More coronavirus genomes need to be sequenced across the country to accurately identify the emergence of these and other new variants," said Dr Rakesh Mishra, Director, CCMB and corresponding author on the study.These variants have been discovered after the sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. All these strains are of A2 type of coronavirus, which is common in India.One of these mutations - the N440K - was found in a sample collected from Yavatmal in Maharashtra and is more prevalent in South India. N440K was a very small number in September and October last year. But now it is getting a much bigger proportion."Closer surveillance is needed to understand the spread of N440K properly. Accurate and timely detection of new variants that may show greater infectivity or worse clinical symptoms, including immune escape, will be extremely important to preempt disastrous consequences," said Dr Mishra.In their research, the authors explain how different coronavirus variants gained prevalence in India during the last year."One of the variants called the A3i had mutations that were predicted to make its spread slower. The study confirms that it was overtaken by the globally prevalent A2a variant, carrying the D614G mutation, by June 2020. The A2a variant has remained in global dominance for the major part of the year 2020. The recently discovered variants in many countries have raised concerns because of their mutations in the Spike protein, that makes the coat of the virus and come in contact with the human cells," said the research.Dr Surabhi Srivastava, the lead author of the study, said that the success in development and administration of vaccines is promising but other non-therapeutic prevention measures, such as masks and physical distancing, will still prove to be the most effective in curbing further spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-5-000-covid-19-variants-prevalent-in-india-here-are-more-dangerous-ones-101613834000235.html

20-02-2021||India||Congress in Uttarakhand protests farm laws, soaring fuel prices||The opposition Congress on Saturday held state wide marches across Uttarakhand against the farm laws rising fuel prices and accusing the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state of doing nothing to give relief to the common man.The protests were held in the headquarters of all the 13 districts. In Dehradun, the march was attended by hundreds of party workers and was led by party state president Pritam Singh and leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh. The state unit’s vice president Suryakant Dhasmana, general secretary Vijay Saraswat, Dehradun city unit president Lal Chand Sharma and other leaders were also among the protesters.Addressing the protesters, Pritam Singh launched a scathing attack on the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state of "not fulfilling their promises to the public of bringing down prices.""Before coming to power in 2017, the BJP had said a double engine government would boost development in the state by curbing prices of essential commodities. But now with the common man suffering due to high fuel prices, the promise is nowhere to be seen," said Singh."Today due to high inflation, a common man cannot buy both vegetables and lentils. The petrol price has touched ₹100 per litre for the first time in history while the price of LPG cylinder has touched ₹900 from ₹400. The poor and farmers are suffering but the government is absolutely paying no heed."Leader of Opposition, Hridayesh too attacked the BJP government saying it is doing nothing for the welfare of people."The government doesn't even care for the sufferings of the people. All it cares about is to safeguard the interests of a handful of crony capitalists. The only way to give relief to the public is the ousting of BJP from the state in 2022 assembly elections," said Hridayesh.In Haldwani, the march was led by party district president Satish Nainwal."The Congress is protesting against the anti-people governments in the Centre and state by coming out on the road. This protest will continue as we are raising the voice of people," said Nainwal.The BJP tried to brush away the protests saying "it is desperate to find any ground in the political scenario in the state before 2022 elections.""The Congress has been rejected by the public long ago. Hence it is showing its desperation with such events which have no support of the public which will again rule it out in the 2022 elections by supporting the BJP for its development works," said BJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-in-uttarakhand-protests-farm-laws-soaring-fuel-prices-101613832271597.html

The aircraft was halted and all the 64 passengers disembarked. Everybody is safe and there are no injuries to anybody,” the spokesperson said.Nineteen of the passengers were Vijayawada-bound, while the remaining 45 were supposed to continue up to Tiruchirappalli. “They have been taken to the airport lounge and alternative arrangements are being made to ferry them to their destination,” the spokesperson said.Though it is a minor accident, the airport authorities have ordered an inquiry into the incident as per protocol. “Whether the aircraft’s wing hit the lamp-post due to improper marking on the taxiway or for any other reason will be known during the investigations,” he said.An official at the Vijayawada airport, who pleaded anonymity, said the lamp-post was uprooted due to the impact of the wing of the aircraft that hit it and there was some damage to the wing as well.“The passengers received a jolt as the aircraft was brought to a halt suddenly. Luckily, it was moving very slowly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-express-flight-hits-lamp-post-on-landing-at-vijayawada-s-gannavaram-airport-101613831506279.html

20-02-2021||India||Andhra govt won’t allow Vizag steel privatisation, says YSRC Rajya Sabha MP||In an attempt to wrest the political initiative from the opposition parties, YSR Congress party general secretary and Rajya Sabha member Vijay Sai Reddy on Saturday took out a 25-km long padayatra in protest against the proposed privatisation of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), better known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.Accompanied by a large number of YSRC leaders including ministers, MLAs and party activists, besides steel plant workers and other followers, Reddy began his padayatra at Mahatma Gandhi statue in the heart of Visakhapatnam city in the morning.It passed through the major streets of the port city and culminated in a public rally at Kurmannapalem gate of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant at Gajuwaka in the evening.Addressing the rally, Reddy said the YSRC government in the state would make all out efforts to see that the steel plant was not privatised. “It will remain a public sector undertaking under any circumstances. Though it is a central government undertaking, the state government will not allow the plant to go into the hands of the private sector,” he said.The MP called upon all political parties to come together and continue the fight against the privatisation of the steel plant. “We shall take the fight to Delhi and convince the Centre to drop the privatisation proposal,” he said.Reddy took pot shots at Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu for “politicising” the Visakhapatnam steel plant privatisation issue. “If Naidu was so much concerned about the steel plant, why didn’t he write a letter to the Centre condemning the privatisation?” he asked.The TDP, however, accused the YSRC leader of adopting double standards. Former minister and senior TDP leader from Visakhapatnam Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy said Sai Reddy' padayatra was an eyewash as the latter was playing a secret role in the efforts to sell the steel plant to South Korea’s POSCO.The TDP leader alleged that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had already entered into an understanding with POSCO. “The YSRC MP should swear in front of the public that he did not know about this shady deal. In fact, it was Reddy who had held consultations with the representatives of POSCO several times,” he charged.He said the TDP would continue to expose the misdeeds of the ruling party and its attempts to grab the public properties in the port city.The party launched a 'missed call' campaign on Thursday to record people's voices of support for the 'Save Visakha Steel' agitation on the mobile number 80999 81981. Till now, more than 20,000 missed calls were received so far, a statement from the TDP headquarters in Guntur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-won-t-allow-vizag-steel-privatisation-says-ysrc-rajya-sabha-mp-101613829201003.html
20-02-2021||India||Maharashtra records 6,281 Covid-19 cases; highest spike in Mumbai since December||For the second consecutive day, Maharashtra reported more than 6,000 new Coronavirus cases — after a gap of more than three months — indicating a worrying situation for the state. The state on Saturday reported 6,281 fresh Covid-19 cases, a little higher than Friday. Mumbai, on the other hand, recorded 897 new covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in infections since December.On Friday, the number of fresh cases in Maharashtra was 6,112. On Thursday, it was 5,427 and on Wednesday, the single-day spike was at 4,787. Wednesday's tally put the state on an alert as that figure was the highest in the last 70 days. On December 9, Maharashtra had registered 4,981 cases following which the single-day number of cases started to come down. But as the upward trend is continuing for days and the trajectory is only moving upwards, the rise can't be dismissed as a stray occurrence.BMC seals more than 1,300 buildings as Covid-19 cases continue to surge in MumbaiWith 6,281 new cases on Saturday, the caseload in the state rose to 2,093,913, while 40 fatalities took the death toll to 51,753.Mumbai on Friday reported 823 new Covid-19 cases, which was the highest single-day spike since December. But Saturday's number broke that record as the city reported near 900 fresh cases on Saturday. At the beginning of the week, Mumbai's daily Covid-19 count was below 500. Since Wednesday, the count crossed the 700-mark.The sudden spike in fresh infections in Maharashtra is being primarily attributed to two factors: the reopening, including that of the Mumbai local trains, and the mutant strain found in districts like Akola, Satara, Amravati etc. While a weekend lockdown has been imposed in Amravati and Akola, Yavatmal is under a 10-day lockdown, which started last Thursday.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had earlier ruled out any reimposition of restrictions in Mumbai, though the city has been brought under strong surveillance.The civic body on Saturday sealed 1,305 buildings from where 2,749 cases were reported in the last few days. Any buildings with more than five Covid-19 patients will be sealed, BMC said in its new guidelines.Though the resumption of Mumbai locals is being seen as a major contributor to the Covid-19 cases, the authorities have not yet taken any decision on whether to restrict its timing. Around 300 marshals have been deployed to keep an eye on the passengers.With the surge in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra is once again reporting the highest number of daily cases, surpassing Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-6-281-covid-19-cases-highest-spike-in-mumbai-since-december-101613828414452.html

In 2018, the state government had increased wages of tea garden workers by ₹30 taking it to ₹167.The cabinet also formed a one-member committee comprising principal secretary JB Ekka to look into ways in which a similar hike can be done in small tea gardens of the state.Saturday’s cabinet decision comes six days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi announced at a poll rally in Assam that if the party comes to power in the state it would hike the wages from ₹167 to ₹365 daily.Nearly 1.1 million workers are employed in around 800 tea gardens in the state especially in upper Assam. These workers and their families have a significant role in the outcome of nearly 40 of the total 126 seats in the state assembly.Saturday’s wage hike is just one of the many schemes the BJP-led government has announced for this section of voters since coming to power for the first time in the state in 2016.They include the promise of scheduled tribe status to the tea-tribe community and cash transfers of ₹2500/ ₹3000 to bank accounts of nearly 8 lakh tea garden workers at a cost of ₹220 crore to the state exchequer.Other benefits include free rice, cash benefits to pregnant women, reservation of seats in educational institutions, setting up schools in tea gardens as well as providing mobile phones, bicycles, money to meritorious students and funds to young men to set up small businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-polls-assam-cabinet-hikes-daily-wage-of-tea-garden-workers-101613826415865.html

The worst is not over and unless we follow all precautions, unless we follow due diligence we will not be able to get over the pandemic so easily,” Dr Mande said.He said that the world has so far been ‘lucky’ that the Sars-CoV2 virus was not as deadly as some of the previous world pandemics but nonetheless has come as a huge reality check for countries across the world.Dr Mande also said that the mutations in the virus which he said is the natural course for any such spreading virus have so far also been minimal which allows the vaccines to remain effective.“We have been priding ourselves over the last 30-40 years that our healthcare systems can deal with any kind of situation or emergency that arises. The current pandemic is a grim reminder that it is not the case. We have been found to be wanting in all respects. In fact the most advanced nations, the nations that prided themselves on having the most advanced healthcare systems have been worst affected,” he said.“That's a grim reminder that such kinds of pandemics will continue hitting us, will continue hitting humanity and we better be prepared for them. There are much more serious problems staring at us….Climate change has the potential to throw up way worse pandemics than Covid,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-spike-csir-chief-warns-against-complacency-says-worst-not-over-yet-101613827310203.html

20-02-2021||India||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh raises farm laws, Covid-19 vaccination, GST compensation in NITI Aayog meeting||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure urgent resolution to the ongoing farmers' "unrest", and an early release of the state's pending GST compensation.In his pre-recorded address for the sixth Governing Council virtual meeting of Niti Aayog, the Congress leader also proposed that states are consulted before deciding the priority list for Covid-19 vaccination.Singh, who could not attend the meeting as he was unwell, also expressed concerns over the threat to Punjab's agriculture sector as a result of the "disruptions caused by the three new farm laws", according to a state government release.Farmers have been protesting against the three new Central agricultural laws enacted in September last year, and demanding they be repealed.Singh also raised the issue of Covid-19 vaccine, urging the Centre to consult the state before fixing priorities for vaccination, as the exercise, he argued, involves the entire population.He also requested the Centre to release Punjab's pending GST compensation, amounting to ₹8,253 crore for the period between April 2020 and January 2021.Urging respect for the 'annadaata' (the farmer), the CM reiterated his government's stand that agriculture is a state subject it should be left to be legislated upon by states in the true spirit of "cooperative federalism" enshrined in the Constitution.He also pointed out that the state has already passed amendments to the Central legislations.The CM asserted in his speech that any reform in a sector affecting almost 60 per cent of the country's workforce must be brought only through a process of extensive consultation with all the stakeholders, of which Punjab is a key member being at the forefront of ensuring food security for the nation.He also raised the farmers' apprehension that the Minimum Support Price-based procurement through Food Corporation of India (or agencies on its behalf) may be discontinued in view of the Shanta Kumar Committee Report of 2015.The CM also stressed the need for the government of India to decisively dispel any such impression "to instil proper confidence in the farmers of the state".Singh also used the forum to once again reiterate the state government's demand for a bonus of ₹100 per quintal of paddy procured as straw management compensation.He requested the Centre to provide ₹5 crore per megawatt financial support for biomass power projects and ₹3.5 crore per MW for biomass solar hybrid projects to the state as Viability Gap Fund (VGF) to help alleviate the effects of paddy straw burning through ex-situ utilisation of available paddy straw with good returns to the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-raises-farm-laws-covid-19-vaccination-in-niti-aayog-meeting-101613823825434.html

Nearly two dozen flights operate to and from the Jammu airport daily.Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha had also taken up the matter with defence minister Rajnath Singh.On Wednesday Jammu and Kashmir chief secretary B V R Subrahmanyam had also written to the civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola requesting that resurfacing of the runway should be done in a phased manner to avoid disruption of civilian traffic.Subrahmanyam said in his letter that complete closure of the airport for 15 days would create huge administrative issues for Jammu and Kashmir.Following the IAF’s proposal, private airliners had stopped booking for the 15 day period from March 6 to 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flights-from-jammu-to-be-regulated-from-march-10-to-april-19-for-runway-work-101613824420360.html

In trains, the TTEs shall check the negative RT-PCR test report,” the circular said.The decision was taken after a surge in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra. The government had introduced similar travel restrictions on those arriving from Kerala after two Covid-19 clusters were reported in Bengaluru city earlier this week.“Mumbai has reported a near-doubling of the number of Covid-19 positive cases from around 350 per day to 645 per day within a week.

20-02-2021||India||Order on Disha Ravi's bail plea reserved, judge asks for evidence linking toolkit to R-Day violence||A Delhi court on Saturday reserved its order on the bail plea of Disha Ravi, the climate activist who has been accused by the police of creating a toolkit to help farmers protesting against Centre's farm laws. She was arersted on February 13.The court will now pronounce its order on Tuesday, the judge said. While the Delhi Police vehemently opposed Ravi's bail plea, her lawyer rubbished all the charges against the 22-year-old activist.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, representing Delhi Police, linked the toolkit with the violence in Delhi on Repblic Day. The judge then asked about any evidence linking the two.On Saturday, additional sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana asked, "Is there is any evidence or are we acting on the basis of surmises and conjectures?" To this, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju appearing on behalf of Delhi Police replied that the document will have to be read along with the hashtags and links it contained, which were meant to "instigate people asking them to come on streets thus resulting in public disorder".The police further said that they have arrested seven people and investigation is on."It is not a simple or innocent toolkit. This is not only one individual who have been involved and they are aware of the Khalistani movement," said ASG Raju.Swedish activist Greta Thunberg had briefly tweeted a link to the toolkit earlier this month that police are investigating before replacing it with an "updated" one."In garb of farmers' protest, they wanted to carry out anti-national activities. After the toolkit got leaked in the social media, a cover-up operation was done and many parts of the toolkit were deleted. They panicked. Had they not done anything wrong, they would not have destroyed the evidences," said the lawyer.He also pointed to the involvement of Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF), a Canada-based organisation headed by Mo Dhaliwal."Dhaliwal's object it to create a Khalistani state. He has stated on his social media about it. He was mobilising support for its creation. They wanted to take advantage of the farmer agitation and carry out their activities. They needed an Indian face. If they would have done it directly, then they would have been exposed," said Raju.Justice Rana then again asked him about incriminating material collected against Ravi. The lawyer replied that Ravi has been involved in evidence tampering. "Such persons cannot be enlarged on bail," the ASG said.Her lawyer Sidharth Agarwal denied the allegations and said that Ravi's cause is only environment and the farmers. He also said that Ravi's history has nothing to do with the Khalistan movement. "There is no disaffection being spread by the toolkit," said Agarwal.Rejecting the charge of incitement of violence, he further said, "The toolkit says that people should join the march of Republic Day. Police gave the permission for the march and if I call people to join the march, then can I be called seditious?"Ravi moved the bail please a day after she was sent to three-day judicial custody by a court in connection with the toolkit case. She was earlier sent to five-day police custody after the cops claimed that Ravi created the toolkit - a Google document - to help farmers protesting against government's three farm laws.The Delhi Police started investigation in the toolkit case after Thunberg's tweet in favour of farmers' protest.The farmers have been protesting near Delhi since late November, calling for the repeal of the three central laws. The government has held multiple rounds of talks with the protesters but the impasse continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-on-disha-ravi-s-bail-plea-reserved-judge-asks-for-evidence-linking-toolkit-to-r-day-violence-101613820688658.html

The number is not that large."Once you start the process to vaccinate 27 crore individuals, in that scenario we must have a robust programme in place where you have the list of people to be vaccinated," Guleria said.He further said: "We need to develop a mechanism where public and private sector actually start rolling out the vaccine at a large scale."Guleria noted that there is an urgency to roll out the vaccine to a large number of people as there were dosages available due to some level of hesitancy in the healthcare and frontline workers."I personally feel we have a window of opportunity available now because our cases are down, but this window can change anytime as we have seen in various parts of the world, specially with new variants coming up from different countries."So we should not lose this moment and try to vaccinate a large number of our citizens which will be able to provide some level of protection as far as Covid-19 is concerned," he said.He added that the country still doesn't have an effective anti viral drug so the only weapon that can be actually utilised is the vaccine."We have this small window before things may worsen and therefore we should take whatever vaccine we get and immunise ourselves so that we are able to decrease mortality and really have another spike in cases in the country," Guleria emphasised.He noted that there has been lot of learning from the pandemic and there should be more emphasis on becoming self-reliant in the healthcare sector."What we realised during the initial days of pandemic is that you have to do with stuff which is available in your own country. We had shortage of PPEs, N95 masks and even ventilators because they were not available in the country. Even diagnostics became a challenge. So we have to become self-reliant in many ways and we have to put health at the centrestage," he noted.Guleria said that health is an important factor as it affects all areas including economy and livelihood.Rather than looking it only as a service sector, "healthcare should be looked as the centre which could be easily used to push the economy", he said.He added that the country should not only aspire to become a medical research hub but also the patient care hub for the world."I think India has the capacity to do that," he said.Earlier, speaking the event, Apollo Hospitals vice chairperson Preetha Reddy lauded the government efforts in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.She said the country has shown the way to the entire world in dealing with the infectious disease.

20-02-2021||India||Disha Ravi’s bail plea hearing: Key points made in court||A Delhi court on Saturday reserved its order on the bail plea moved by Bengaluru-based climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested by the Delhi Police on February 13 in connection with the toolkit controversy related to the farmers’ agitation. Ravi was sent to a three-day judicial custody on Friday after her five-day police custody had expired.During the hearing, the Delhi Police opposed Ravi’s bail plea. Representing the Police, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju stated that the toolkit got leaked on social media platforms and several parts of the document got deleted. He also said that the toolkit - apart from giving details of the protest against the Centre’s three new farm laws - also had information that defamed the Indian Army.The lawyer added that there was an intention to make the agitation global as Ravi had been in contact with Mo Dhaliwal and Anita Lal. Dhaliwal is the founder of the Canada-based Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) and has been using the farmers’ movement to fuel the Khalistani movement in India, according to a police official.Here are some of the major points that were made during the hearing:1. The ASG told the court that after the toolkit got leaked in social media platforms, a cover-up operation had been executed and several parts of the document got deleted. He questioned as to why the evidence was deleted if there was no wrongdoing. Ravi was later charged with sections 201 and 204 of the Indian penal Code (IPC) - that deal with the disappearance and destruction of evidence.2. He also pointed out that the toolkit had a cheat sheet, which had details that ‘defame the Indian Army and had nothing to do with the protest against the farm laws.’ He added that Ravi was part of a global conspiracy to defame India and further create unrest in the garb of protests.3. The 22-year-old climate activist from Bengaluru prepared and shared the toolkit with those who were advocating Khalistani movement and it was not a ‘simple or innocent toolkit’, the lawyer told the court.4. With regard to the other two accused in the tool kit case - Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk - Raju said that Ravi was in touch with these people and since she and Nikita were women, Shantanu was sent to Delhi to check the execution of the toolkit.5. Reiterating on his previous point, Raju said that the purpose was to make the protest international, adding that Ravi, Shantanu and others had been in touch with Mo Dhaliwal and Anita Lal.6. Amid all these arguments, the judge questioned ASG Raju whether there was any evidence or statements were being made on the basis of conjectures.7. The judge further demanded what ‘incriminating material’ had the Police collected against Ravi to which Raju replied that the toolkit has emails, links which were removed and added that it was evident that she was aware about all this.8. The judge further sought evidence collected against Ravi in connection to the violence that broke out during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day in Delhi.9. Meanwhile, Ravi’s counsel Sidharth Aggarwal told the court that she did not have any prior links with Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) as it was founded only in 2020. He added that Ravi’s history and Geography was in no way connected to the Khalistani movement.10. Referring to the interim protection given to Shantanu, Aggarwal added that why should her client (Disha) be kept in custody and she could join the investigation as and when it is directed.(With inputs from Richa Banka)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-s-bail-plea-hearing-key-points-made-in-court-101613820872503.html

It is an anti-national speech; hate speech, which tried to create division among people of this country. Especially, he has talked about [ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's ideological fountainhead] RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh], which is one of the most patriotic organisations in the country," Bommai said.PFI general secretary Anis Ahmed appealed to the people not to donate money for the temple at the rally. “This is not Ram Mandir. It is RSS Mandir. Not one penny of Muslims should be used for a single brick to build the RSS temple,” he said.Bommai later told reporters that he has ordered the local police to “take cognisance” and “take action” against Ahmed.Police said they have filed the two cases against 13 people including under the Indian Penal Code's sections related to unlawful assembly, disobedience to order by a public servant, and promotion of enmity.Ahmed, who has not been named in the cases, said he has not received any information from the police about them.Police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said the PFI was given permission only for a stage programme, considering the prevailing pandemic and the law and situation. "However, they took out a procession.... with over 300 uniformed cadres of their party. "He said the cases have been registered for the violation of the pandemic guidelines and the speeches made during the event.A second PFI leader, who did not want to be named, said the police action came hours after the minister made the statement and is an attempt to harass anyone opposing the government. “What is the crime saying do not contribute towards the construction of a temple. Even they know it. That is why some vague charges have been slapped against us. We will take required legal measures as and when required."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/organisers-of-pfi-event-booked-after-minister-takes-offence-to-ram-mandir-remark-101613819794622.html
20-02-2021||India||Stalemate continues in Odisha Assembly over paddy procurement issues||Stalemate continued in the Odisha Assembly for the third consecutive day of the budget session on Saturday as the opposition BJP and the Congress created a ruckus in the House over alleged irregularities in the process of paddy procurement by the state government.As soon as the House assembled for the Question Hour, the opposition members rushed to the well, demanding an announcement from the government that all paddy bags would be procured from farmers in the next seven days.BJP MLAs shouted slogans against the state government, while a section of Congress legislators led by party chief whip Taraprasad Bahinipati attempted to climb the speaker's podium.Speaker S N Patro requested the opposition members to return to their seats and participate in the proceedings.Amid the agitation by the opposition legislators, the speaker asked Food Supplies, Consumer Welfare and Cooperation Minister R P Swain to make a statement on the procurement of paddy.The minister informed the House that the government will procure paddy till March 31, 2021.He also said 55.03 lakh MT of paddy has so far been procured, up by 21 per cent from 45.61 lakh MT lifted last year.The opposition members, however, continued their agitation despite the minister's announcement that the government will receive paddy from farmers till March 31.As Patro's request to members seeking their cooperation failed to yield any result, he adjourned the House twice, first during the pre-lunch session, and finally from 11.30 am to 4 pm.The BJP members expressed their displeasure over the minister's statement and sought a discussion through a motion in the House.Opposition chief whip and senior BJP leader Mohan Majhi said, "We had demanded suspension of all businesses in the House and a discussion on the farmers' issues. The state government is not ready for it."Congress member Bahinipati said the speaker has not accepted their notice for a discussion on the paddy procurement issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalemate-continues-in-odisha-assembly-over-paddy-procurement-issues-101613819993518.html
20-02-2021||India||'PM Modi visited so many countries, but has no time to wipe tears of farmers': Priyanka Gandhi Vadra||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday once again targeted the central government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over farm laws, saying the PM visited many countries across the world but didn't meet protesting farmers to "wipe their tears'."The farmers have been protesting near Delhi for 90 days. At least 215 farmers died during this period, the electricity and water supplies to them were cut, and they were assaulted. They were protesting peacefully, but Delhi's borders were turned into international borders," she said while addressing a Kisan Panchayat in Muzaffarnagar.The Congress general secretary said that farmers, who send their sons to defend our borders, were called terrorists."The Prime Minister ridiculed the farmers, calling them 'andolan jivi'. When farmer leader Rakesh Tikait cries, our Prime Minister thinks it's funny" said Vadra.Alleging that PM Modi's brand of politics if for his big corporate friends, the Congress leader tore away the three laws. "One of the three laws says that private mandis (marketplace) will be organised where no tax will have to be paid. This means, government mandis will be finished. The second law talks about contract farming. Your compaints won't be heard in courts, you won't be able to fight for your rights," Vadra said while addressing the farmers.She once again claimed that the three new laws will finish the minimum support system (MSP).Farmers have been camping on the outskirts of Delhi since late November, and calling for the repeal of new agriculture laws.The Centre has offered to hold the laws in abeyance and water down some the provisions.But the farmers want Modi government to repeal the laws altogether and provide legal backing for MSP for their produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-visited-so-many-countries-but-has-no-time-to-wipe-tears-of-farmers-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-101613819064690.html

Yadav also criticised Adityanath for a past comment on opposition parties possessing “division in their DNA” in the aftermath of the Hathras incident.Here are top quotes from the SP chief’s press conference:“In ancient Indian culture, there was no such thing as chanda (contribution), we have the culture of dakshina (offering). We are ready to give dakshina, will BJP accept?”“The kind of language he (Yogi Adityanath) uses, be it on stages or the House, a chief minister cannot speak like this. He says division is in some people’s DNA, if he can at least tell the full form of DNA we will know that he is the chief minister”“It'd benefit people more if the chief minister starts speaking on development. He talks of expressways that were actually done by Samajwadi Party. Speaking of Purvanchal Expressway, firstly he said it'd be ready by Diwali, then New Year, now April.. who knows when it will happen”“The BJP government to hide its failure on economic front has hiked petrol, diesel prices and put burden on people, farmers, youth, and it is sad and shameful that now the government is saying the price hike was for nation building”“The way the chief minister is lying in the assembly, the kind of language he is using in the assembly, and the way people are joining Samajwadi Party in droves; BJP will be swept out and the people will ‘deploy’ SP in the state in 2022.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-are-joining-samajwadi-party-in-droves-akhilesh-yadav-101613818086920.html

20-02-2021||India||At Disha Ravi's bail plea hearing, Delhi Police says a cover-up was carried out||A Delhi court is hearing a bail application moved by climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested on February 13 for allegedly creating an online "toolkit" intended to help farmers protesting against government's three farm laws.Twenty-two-year-old Ravi has been accused of sedition by the Delhi Police. She was sent to three-day judicial custody on Friday after the expiry of her police custody.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, appearing for the Delhi Police, opposed the bail plea saying that after the toolkit got leaked in the social media, a cover-up operation was carried out and many of its parts were deleted. After this, sections 201 and 204 of the Indian penal Code (IPC) - which deal with destruction of evidence - were added against the activist.The ASG also said that the toolkit had a cheatsheet which contained information which defames the Army and had nothing to do with farmers' protest."Ravi had the right to edit the toolkit and she later deleted everything. This is the working of a guilty mind," said the lawyer, adding that the toolkit was part of a "sinister design".Twenty two-year-old Ravi is part of an organisation founded by Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg.Police allege that Ravi was involved in creating and sharing an online document containing advice for protesters. Police say this document stoked the violence that took place on Republic Day last month.Late on Friday, Thunberg posted two tweets with a hashtag supporting Disha."Freedom of speech and the right to peaceful protest and assembly are non-negotiable human rights. These must be a fundamental part of any democracy. #StandWithDishaRavi," Thunberg said in one of her tweets.During the hearing on Friday, additional public prosecutor (APP) Irfan Ahmed told the court Ravi had been “evasive” during interrogation and shifted the blame onto the co-accused Nikita Jacob and Muluk. Ahmed also said the police want to question her again and bring her face-to-face with the co-accused in this case.Ravi's lawyer Siddharth Agarwal countered the public prosecutor, saying the case diary was not properly given.Meanwhile, the Delhi high court directed the media and the police to exercise restraint while giving out the details of the case. The order came on a Ravi's plea. The high court, however, said that there should be a balance between the right to privacy and freedom of speech of people, and sovereignty and integrity of the country.Thunberg had briefly tweeted a link to the toolkit - a Google document - earlier this month that police are investigating before replacing it with an "updated" one.The Delhi Police have sought to link the toolkit with the January 26 violence in the national capital, and to pro-Khalistani organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-opposing-disha-ravi-s-bail-say-toolkit-part-of-sinister-design-101613810903803.html

20-02-2021||India||No difference between Siddaramaiah, PFI: Karnataka minister Eshwarappa over Ram Mandir donation||The contribution over the donations to the fund dedicated towards the construction of the grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya took centre stage in Karnataka once again on Saturday as Karnataka minister KS Eshwarappa targeted the opposition likening veteran Congress leader Siddaramaiah to the Popular Front of India (PFI).“PFI tells people to not contribute (for Ram Temple) as it is on disputed land. Siddaramaiah says the same. They have the same opinion. There is no difference between Siddaramaiah and PFI. They are one,” Eshwarappa was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.PFI was launched in Kerala in 2006 after the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of Tamil Nadu merged. The three organisations were floated after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. Law enforcement agencies have claimed that the outfit has been radicalising Muslim youth following a growing vacuum in the community donning the role of a saviour.Eshwarappa also said even the poor are contributing towards the temple's construction and criticised the Congress leader’s attitude. “Even the poor are giving ₹10 each (for Ram temple) out of devotion. Siddaramaiah says that it's disputed land, so he won't contribute,” he said.Siddaramaiah on February 16 had said that he will not donate to the cause if volunteers approached him. “If they come to me for funds, then I will not give donations for the disputed Ram temple in Ayodhya. I will donate to the Ram temple being built somewhere else. Even though the matter has been settled, the dispute will always remain,” Siddaramaiah was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Karnataka minister also drew comparisons between Siddaramaiah, a former chief minister, and JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy, saying that both the leaders are destroying their parties. Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah had led the government in Karnataka until 2019 when several MLAs joined BJP and defeated the Congress-JD(S) in a floor test in the assembly.Kumaraswamy had compared the donation collection process to how Nazis used to target its dissidents of the Third Reich during the former German chancellor Adolf Hitler’s regime, who was responsible for the mass murder of several million Jews.“It appears that those collecting donations for the construction of Ram Mandir have been separately marking the houses of those who paid money and those who did not. This is similar to what Nazis did in Germany during the regime of Hitler when lakhs of people lost their lives,” Kumaraswamy had said on February 15.Shri Ramjanmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust’s general secretary, Champat Rai, had also criticised the former CM for his comments and said that the issue of construction of the Ram Temple should not be politicised.Shri Ramjanmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has been given the responsibility to oversee the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The Supreme Court in a unanimous verdict cleared the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the contested site at Ayodhya on November 9, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-difference-between-siddaramaiah-pfi-karnataka-minister-eshwarappa-101613811818264.html

And thus it is collecting chanda (contributions) in this time of calamity (Covid-19 pandemic),” he said at a press conference.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister who had attacked BJP by calling it 'chandajivi' in Parliament recently, reiterated that in ancient Indian culture, there was no such thing as chanda, “We have the culture of dakshina (offering). We are ready to give dakshina, if the BJP accepts it,” he said.He also attacked the Centre over spiraling fuel price. “To hide its failure on the economic front the BJP government hikes petrol and diesel prices and puts the burden on people, farmers and the youth. And it is sad and shameful that now the government is saying the price hike was for nation building.”He also attacked chief minister Adityanath and accused him of lying even in the legislature and warned that the BJP government’s days in the state are numbered.“The way CM is lying in the assembly… Those who lie in the legislature, who would punish them? People will punish them,” Akhilesh said“The way people are joining Samajwadi Party in droves; the BJP will be swept out and the people will ‘deploy’ SP in the 2022 UP Assembly polls to rescue the state.”Akhilesh also accused Adityanath of lying in the assembly on payment of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers.“CM lied in the assembly that MSP was given to farmers. All know that farmers did not get MSP for maize, or rice. He charged the SP government of selling sugar mills, if he is Yogi for real then he should tell which sugar mill was sold during the SP regime,” he said.The Samajwadi Party chief also alleged that the Adityanath government has no work of its own to showcase.“This government has completed four years and still has no work of its own to showcase. It continues to hijack SP government's work as shows-off as its own,” he said. “This CM is not from UP. He came from another state. If he became the CM here then he should have worked for the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-fundraising-bjp-s-version-of-creating-opportunity-out-of-pandemic-101613811221490.html

In a five-mark question, students were asked to write a letter to the editor of a daily newspaper condemning the Republic Day violence on Delhi in 100-120 words. Students were also asked to suggest a few measures to "thwart such violent maniacs who act under external instigation".This is a sample fm a Class X English paper of a popular Chennai school.

The question was part of the second revision exams, reports said.Republic Day violence was not due to intel failure, says police commissioner"The diabolical violence that broke out in the national capital on Republic Day filled the hearts of the citizens with condemnation and abhorrence after the farm law protesters went on a rampage destroying public property and attacking police personnel in broad daylight. Write a letter to the Editor of a daily newspaper in your city, condemning such terrible, violent acts of miscreants who fail to realise that country comes before personal needs and gains. Destroying public property, disgracing the national flag, and attacking police personnel are few of the various illegal offences committed, that can never be justified for any reason whatsoever.

We oppose the government's wrong policies affecting the common man,” Kharge was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Kharge had said after his appointment as the Leader of Opposition that the Congress party will continue to focus on the ongoing farmers’ protest and will look forward to cornering the government over issues raised by the farmers’ unions representatives. “The farmers have been agitating against the new farm laws for the past few months and demanding that they be withdrawn as it abolishes the MSP and the Mandi system. We are all supporting their demand. The government has failed to satisfy the farmers, the major stakeholders while bringing in these laws and should withdraw them,” the septuagenarian leader from Karnataka said on February 20.He also said that the tractor rally against the three farm laws, which went violent on January 26, was a conspiracy planned by the government with the aim to dent the spirit of the protesting farmers’ unions representatives who have been protesting against the farm laws for almost three months at Delhi’s borders demanding their total repeal.On Saturday, Kharge also said the government was using terms like 'Khalistanis' and 'Pakistanis' with a motive to divide the protesting farmers’ unions. He also highlighted that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had asked him to highlight the issues of the poor. “We raise the issues (in Parliament) not to become famous.

Government has to respect and give due representation to the private sector for economic progress," Modi said.He said that the positive response to the Union Budget 2021-22 indicates that the country wants to move forward on the path of development at greater speed.Modi said that the initiatives taken by the government would provide opportunity to everyone to participate in nation building to its full potential.Referring to the farm sector, the Prime Minister said that efforts should be made to produce agriculture items like edible oil and reduce their imports."This can be done by guiding farmers," he said, adding the money being spend on imports can go to the accounts of farmers.The Prime Minister also underlined the need for reducing compliance burden on people and asked the states to form committees to reduce regulations which are no longer relevant in the wake of technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-states-need-to-work-closely-to-boost-economic-growth-pm-101613802604064.html

On the other hand, the Congressmen are requesting us to keep the facility shut," an owner of a petrol pump told PTI."We are caught in the crosshairs," he said.State Congress chief Kamal Nath had on Friday urged the people to join in the 'bandh' in order to "wake up the government over the soaring prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas".Meanwhile, MP Petrol Pump Owners' Association secretary Nakul Sharma said that additive-mixed petrol of a leading oil marketing company is now priced at ₹102.26 per litre, while regular per litre petrol is being sold at ₹98.58 and diesel at ₹89.21 in Bhopal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-workers-detained-during-half-day-bandh-over-fuel-price-101613809289726.html

Farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders seeking a repeal of the legislation."The CM's [chief minister] meeting with the farmer leaders will take place over lunch at the Delhi Assembly on Sunday. The three farm laws and other related concerns will be discussed in the meeting," said the official on condition of anonymity.In December last, during a one-day session of the Delhi Assembly, CM Kejriwal tore copies of the three farm laws to mark his protest against the controversial legislation even as the assembly passed a resolution tabled by revenue minister Kailash Gahlot demanding that the Central government should repeal the laws immediately.The Centre has maintained the three laws have been passed for the reform of the agriculture sector. But the protesting farmers fear that the laws will do away with agricultural markets, favour industrialists, affect prices of crops and bring down their income further.The farmers unions and the Centre have had 11 rounds of talks so far. The Centre has even offered to put the laws on hold for 1.5 years, but the farmers are pushing for repeal of the new agricultural laws.Replying in Lok Sabha to the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly defended the laws and attacked the opposition for "misleading farmers". The PM again invited farmers for talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-meet-protesting-farmer-leaders-at-delhi-assembly-tomorrow-101613808479626.html

The institute will now hire the services of a private detective agency by March 15.“It is an open secret that some of our doctors are into private practice, which they are not supposed to. We want to put an end to this practice by taking stern action against those who indulge in it. This is a step in that direction. We need support from the government to enforce it so that the institute can develop as a medical centre of excellence in the state,” said Dr Nihar Ranjan Biswas, director of the IGIMS on deputation from AIIMS-Delhi since February 26, 2014.There are allegations that a majority of the 300-odd faculty members out of the nearly 550 doctors at the institute also practice privately, despite availing of non-practising allowance (NPA), which is 20% of their basic salary. Allegations have also been levelled against doctors of weaning away patients from the institute to private healthcare facilities.“We have assiduously built our reputation over the last few years and are now trying to consolidate it. We now have a choice, as we receive 10-20 applications against any position we advertise. The institute is not prepared to be blackmailed anymore. We will terminate the services of those indulging in private practice,” added Dr Biswas.Since its inception in November 1983, the IGIMS has not succeeded in penalising any such doctor.The institute last came close to penalising such offenders in 2014, when its flying squad caught six of its 29 doctors under scanner red handed. Despite assurance of stern action by the then principal secretary, health, the offenders managed to use their influence and were let off after a warning.Two senior professors at IGIMS — a urologist and gastroenterologist — took voluntary retirement in 2014 and 2017 after the IGIMS administration confronted them with evidence of their private practice.The Bihar government had banned private practice across its facilities and paid NPA to its doctors for a limited period of 11 months between March 1, 2000 and February 2001 before withdrawing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihars-igims-to-hire-detectives-to-check-private-practice-of-its-doctors-101613807137200.html

20-02-2021||India||UP Police: Small cars to replace SUVs to reduce 112 emergency response time||Smaller cars will soon replace some bigger SUVs used by Uttar Pradesh police's 112 emergency service to improve response time to distress calls and enable teams to access congested areas and narrow lanes faster, a senior official said.There are times police response vehicles lose precious time in traffic snarls because of their size and there are also occasions when they themselves cause jams, said Additional Director General of Police (112 service) Asim Arun.The UP Police's 112 service (formerly the 100 service) currently has around 4,500 vehicles of which nearly 3,000 are four-wheeler SUVs and the remaining two-wheeler motorcycles.Arun said currently 15,000 to 16,000 events across the state are attended daily by the emergency responders, while the number of distress calls is even more."Many a time the calls come from incident spots located in busy markets, congested areas, narrow lanes and all such places where SUVs lose precious time in traffic snarls because of their size. Sometimes the police vehicles themselves lead to traffic disruption while responding to emergencies," Arun told PTI.Also read| PM Modi at NITI Aayog meet: Centre-state ties, Aatmanirbhar Bharat in focus"We will soon be adding into our fleet cars which are smaller in size than our SUVs so that they can easily navigate such areas and the response time can be improved further," he said, adding specifics like car type and number of vehicles are yet to be worked out.Arun said currently the UP police's average response time in urban areas stands 7 to 8 minutes, while in rural areas it is 15 to 20 minutes.On the difference in response time in urban and rural areas, he said there are more events from urban areas where deployment of PRVs is also higher, while the relatively longer response time in rural areas is because distress calls are not frequent and locations of villages is also isolated."We have a world-class response time," Arun said and added that during the pandemic and lockdown, the UP police's emergency responders tended to an average 35,000 distress calls daily."During the lockdown, the 112 utilised the state capacity following directions from the chief minister. Our PRVs were providing dry ration, cooked meals, milk for newborns and infants and what not. On many occasions, PRV personnel spent money from their own pockets to help distressed callers while the world was yet to come to grips with the situation," he added.On further utilization of 112 in diverse roles like lodging of FIR, he said it was more of a "policy question" that could be answered by the government."But as far as capacity is concerned, we are technically equipped for it," Arun said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-police-small-cars-to-replace-suvs-to-reduce-112-emergency-response-time-101613804115091.html

Until then, I cannot divulge any information about the governing body meeting,” said Dr Singh.Saxena and Das possess postgraduate (PG) degrees in zoology, a non-medical subject, whereas the December 2011 faculty recruitment advertisement for AIIMS required a PG degree recognised by the Medical Council of India or equivalent in the subject concerned.Ranjan had the qualification, but did not have a Ph.D degree at the time of joining the AIIMS.All these appointments date back to 2012-13.People familiar with the development said two faculty members still do not possess the basic qualification required to occupy the position they do. The other faculty member, however, fulfilled the requisite criteria nine months after his joining the AIIMS on September 7, 2012 after he submitted his PhD degree from a university in the US.One of the faculty members facing termination was even promoted during the August-September 2017 assessment promotion scheme of the AIIMS, despite not possessing the basic qualification.Efforts to reach the three doctors concerned proved futile as they did not respond to phone calls or text messages on Friday. Some of the 19 doctors who were initially under the scanner, had earlier said that they should not be penalised after eight years for the selection committee’s fault. A few of them had moved the court against the disciplinary action initiated by the institute.The appointments were initially red-flagged in 2013 by Anil Kishore Yadav, an IPS, the then deputy director (administration) of AIIMS-Patna.The Vikas Arya committee, constituted by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) in 2014, also found the appointments faulty. Finally, a five-member high-powered committee, comprising the director of AIIMS-Bhubaneswar and AIIMS-Patna, also held the appointments of the three doctors were erroneous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unqualified-on-date-of-appointment-3-doctors-at-aiims-patna-face-termination-101613803858000.html

We should also try to bring competitive and cooperative federalism not only among states but districts as well, he added.Centre, states budgetsThe Centre began the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to encourage manufacturing. States should take advantage of the reduced corporate tax rate. The capital expenditure for the infrastructure sector will take the nation forward as it will create greater employment opportunities. Centre and states need to synchronise their budgets to better achieve the targets, PM Modi said.Aatmanirbhar Bharat visionAatmanirbhar Bharat is a mission not only for self-reliance but also to produce for the world. India is a young nation and to achieve its aspiration we need to encourage innovation, develop greater technology, provide greater education. Startups, MSMEs need to be made stronger, PM Modi said while recognizing the individual talents of different states and districts. A healthy competition of exports of different products between the states needs to be developed. This competition should be inculcated at districts and block levels too, PM Modi said.United front against Covid-19 pandemicWhen the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, the states and the centre worked together. This Governing council meeting becomes more significant as India heads towards completing its 75 years of independence, PM Modi said.Governing councilThe agendas have been set to get advice from all the states, give the states time to prepare and come up with resolutions. The governing council's agenda points are very specific this time, said PM Modi.Private sectorThe nation needs to develop, it does not want to waste time. The private sector is enthusiastically coming forward to aid the development of the nation. We need to give the private sector space in the Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision, said PM Modi.Bharat Net schemeFor internet connectivity, Bharat Net scheme is doing significant work to provide internet access to all. In all such schemes when centre and states will work together the country will develop more, said the Prime Minister.Rural housingSince 2014, 2.40 lakh crore houses have been built across the nation in all states and cities.

The work of providing houses to the poor is also going at a good speed, some states need to increase their pace, he added.Liberalisation of geospatial mappingYouth should be given space to reflect their talent. OSP regulations were reformed a few time back, which provided the youngsters to work remotely that mostly benefited the tech sector. We need to stop every such restriction. We liberalized geospatial data too. It is the talent of our people but products are not ours, PM Modi said citing people working for and developing global tech giants like Google.Also Read | PM Modi hails budget at NITI Aayog meet, says country wants to progress fastReduced compliancePM Modi said we export raw fish products, we can also export processed fish products. Our coastal states need to take a united initiative to take over the global market for which reforms are very important. Reforms have been to reduce government intervention and regulation for decreased compliance to aid ease of living.Agro-climatic regional planningPanchayat Raj should be made more responsible for the district development and come together with the states and the Centre for greater results. Even though we are an agrarian economy, still various other edibles are imported by the country. Our farmers can grow all this at home and export them too. For this, it is important that all states do agro-climatic regional planning to help farmers. A holistic approach was taken in farming, poultry and husbandry that reaped greater results, PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-at-niti-aayog-meet-centre-state-ties-aatmanirbhar-bharat-in-focus-101613798670816.html

The country has made up its mind. The country wants to move fast, the country does not want to waste time now,” he said at the meeting. Modi renewed his pitch for a self-reliant nation that not fulfils its own needs but also caters to the requirements of the people across the world. “Self-reliant India campaign is the way to build an India that produces not only for its needs but also for the world, and these products also meet the test of world superiority,” he said at the virtual meet attended by chief ministers of states and Union territories (UTs), Union ministers, vice chairperson Rajiv Kumar, member and CEO of NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant, and other senior government officials.Here are top quotes from the Prime Minister’s address:* We have seen during the “corona period” that when the state and the central government worked together, the country succeeded.* The private sector of the country is coming forward with more enthusiasm in the development journey of the country. As a government, we have to respect this enthusiasm, the energy of the private sector and give it equal opportunity in the self-reliant India campaign.* The central government has introduced production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for various sectors. This is an excellent opportunity to increase manufacturing in the country. States should also take full advantage of this scheme and attract maximum investment in themselves. * A holistic approach has been adopted over the years, from agriculture to animal husbandry and fisheries. As a result of this, in the era of corona, the country's agricultural exports have increased significantly. We have a lot of untapped potential in this sector. Wastage of our products should be as less as possible and we must thus concentrate on storage and processing.*For India's businesses, we must try and better ease of doing business. It will help us grab global opportunities. For India's citizens, we must try and better ease of living. It will help us in achieving the aspirations of Indians and make their lives better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-hailing-budget-to-aatmanirbhar-push-pm-modi-s-top-quotes-from-niti-aayog-address-101613800813811.html

20-02-2021||India||Khajuraho dance festival begins today on temple premises after 44 years||The six-day Khajuraho Dance Festival will begin on Saturday at the UNESCO World Heritage site in Madhya Pradesh, known for its ancient Hindu and Jain temples. It is being held on the temple premises after 44 years following the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) permission. The ASI has also waived the fee for conducting the festival this year.“The dance festival was introduced 46 years ago on the premises to promote heritage and tourism. But ASI cancelled the permission after the reports of destruction of monuments and defacement of idols. For the past 44 years, the state government has been organising the festival in an open garden developed near Western Group of Temples," said a state culture department official, who did not wish to be named.The ASI gave the go-ahead to the state government to conduct the festival indoors following Union culture and tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel's intervention.Patel said Khajuraho has been added to the list of 19 iconic world tourism sites and they want to make the festival more popular and attractive for national as well as international tourists. "Hence, the ASI granted permission to the state government.” He said the state government will ensure the safety and security of the monuments.Former ASI superintendent (Bhopal) Narayan Vyas said the permission for conducting the festival on the temple premises was cancelled to protect the monuments from thieves and anti-social elements as some idols were damaged during the event in 1976.“The performances are organised late at night and it is tough to keep a watch on spectators. There is a risk that idols at the monuments can be stolen or defaced by participants or spectators. To promote tourism at a popular site through dance festival is not a wise decision,” he said.Culture and tourism department principal secretary Sheo Shekhar Shukla said they will organise the festival for the promotion of heritage with utmost care. We will take care of both the safety and security of temples and idols,” he said. “We have designed the festival to attract tourists to boost the economy of the area. Khajuraho’s economy is mostly dependent upon international tourists. During Covid 19 pandemic, local guides, artisans and hoteliers are facing a tough time due to the decrease of the footfall of international and national tourists."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khajuraho-dance-festival-begins-today-on-temple-premises-after-44-years-101613799722365.html

The announcement comes just days after West Bengal minister of state for labour Jakir Hossain was injured in a bomb attack in Murshidabad district.

Doval and Wang had a video conference on June 7, 2020, and have kept in touch, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar holding the diplomatic end of conversations with Beijing.Although both Indian and Chinese military commanders have been showcasing their role during the 10-month stand-off, the governments on both sides are taking a step forward to normalise relations on a reciprocal basis.It is understood that the Indian side has made it clear that it will stand up to any use of force but is willing to discuss and build a positive atmosphere for sorting out all outstanding issues related to the LAC.“We have conveyed that the two sides can sit together and work their way towards resolving differences in perception over the LAC after China has created positivity by restoring status quo ante on Pangong Tso. There can be no dialogue if PLA uses force but if China can persuade that India is wrong or vice versa on border perception, then the two sides can mutually adjust to the perception line,” said a senior official in the know of the developments.Also Read | Beijing on diplomatic charge amid pullbackAccording to national security planners, it is for China to create a positive atmosphere for forward movement in bilateral ties as India will respond in kind and more. “The trajectory that India and China ties take from Pangong Tso disengagement depends on Beijing but the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) withdrawal has been taken in the right spirit in New Delhi,” said a former Indian Army chief.After the disengagement from Pangong Tso, the military commanders on Saturday are expected to work out the modalities of withdrawal of armour and artillery from friction points at Gogra-Hot Springs and work out the modalities for restoring full patrolling rights to the two sides in the Depsang Bulge area, south of Daulet Beg Oldi sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-representatives-talks-on-cards-india-china-to-restore-status-quo-ante-on-lac-101613795388393.html
20-02-2021||India||Joe Biden's Indian-American nominee Neera Tanden to lead budget faces challenge to confirmation||Indian-American Neera Tanden, US President Joe Biden's nominee for the position of Director of White House Office of Management and Budget, is facing a challenge to her confirmation after Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announced that he would vote against her for her "overtly partisan statements".Manchin's announcement means that unless a Republican senator comes forward to support her nomination, it is unlikely that Tanden, 50, will be confirmed for the job.Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, said: "I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget.""For this reason, I cannot support her nomination. As I have said before, we must take meaningful steps to end the political division and dysfunction that pervades our politics," he said.The 100-member Senate is evenly split between the Republicans and the Democrats. The vote of Vice-President Kamala Harris will tilt the balance in favour of the Democrats. As such the vote of Manchin gains significance, given that a majority of the Republicans are likely to oppose the nomination of Tanden.In the past, Tanden has referred to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as "Voldemort," and has battled Senator Bernie Sanders and his supporters online.President Biden on Friday said that he has enough votes to get her confirmation.“I think we are going to find the votes and get her confirmed,” Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews following a trip to the Pfizer vaccine manufacturing plant in Michigan.Despite Manchin's opposition, Biden said he will not pull the nomination. “No” he told reporters.“Neera Tanden is an accomplished policy expert who would be an excellent Budget Director and we look forward to the committee votes next week and to continuing to work toward her confirmation through engagement with both parties," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.Tanden apologised to senators during her confirmation hearings this month.“I deeply regret and apologise for my language, and some of my past language,” she said.Tanden reportedly deleted more than 1,000 tweets before her confirmation process started.According to The New York Times, the announcement by Manchin underscored the fragility of the ambitions of the new Democratic majority in the Senate and the outsize power that any one senator holds over the success of Biden’s administration and agenda.“The fate of the nomination is now in the hands of a party that Ms Tanden has frequently criticized in the past, particularly moderate Republicans she has previously scorned. Ms Tanden would need the support of at least one Republican senator in order to be confirmed, with the vote of Vice President Kamala Harris needed to break a tie,” the daily said.If she fails to garner enough support, Tanden would be the first Biden administration pick not to win Senate confirmation. No Republicans have said they would vote for her yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joe-biden-s-indian-american-nominee-neera-tanden-to-lead-budget-faces-challenge-to-confirmation-101613795010004.html

20-02-2021||India||Maharashtra’s daily Covid-19 cases surpass 6,000; govt steps up testing, tracking||Maharashtra recorded a jump of more than 6,000 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday taking the state’s infection tally to 2,087,632. A jump of 6,112 cases in the western state was the highest in 83 days and its capital city of Mumbai reported 823 new infections for the first time in 77 days. The resurgence of cases in the western state has led to a gradual upward shift in the country’s infection Covid-19 curve. The state government, however, has not yet called the fresh spike a second wave of the pandemic. While Mumbai continues to report the maximum number of daily cases, its neighbouring cities – Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli – have added 800, 663 and 748 new cases, respectively, in the same period. The rise in the number of cases in the city and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) is being attributed to the resumption of local trains for the general public since the beginning of February. The state health department and experts on the state-appointed panel have expressed confidence that the spread of the virus will be contained with stricter measures, higher testing and wider tracking.Also Read: India’s Covid-19 curve inches upwards amid fear of mutant strainsAs the state has been witnessing a steady spike for the past three days, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said he has instructed administrations in the state to take strict action against people who are found without masks in public. Pawar said district administrations have been authorised to assess the situation in their respective districts and impose a lockdown from 6am to 6pm, if the situation demands, according to news agency PTI. "I am going to chair a meeting on February 21 in Pune to discuss measures to contain the viral spread," he added. Meanwhile, in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has already re-imposed stringent measures to curb the spread of the viral disease. It has told contacts of high-risk patients to remain in home-quarantine or face imprisonment for up to six or a fine, or both. According to its fresh guidelines, BMC will also seal the buildings here five or more Covid-19 patients are found. Covid-19 war room officials will also telephone home-quarantined patients five to six times a day to check if they are at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtras-daily-covid-19-cases-surpass-6-000-govt-steps-up-testing-tracking-101613792185445.html

20-02-2021||India||India administers 10 million vaccine doses, second quickest drive in world||India has delivered more than 10 million doses of coronavirus vaccines, the government said on Friday, describing it as the second-quickest campaign in the world.India began inoculating people to fight the pandemic on January 16 and was administering doses at the fastest pace for weeks, before lingering hesitancy among some people and technical glitches meant the pace was overtaken by the United States. “India has administered over 1 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine to its health workers and frontline workers. It has been done in 34 days, which is the second fastest in the whole world,” said union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.As per the government’s provisional data, 10.44 million doses had been administered by Friday evening. But not all health workers who signed up having taken doses, prompting the government to renew appeals for them to come forward, a day before the window is meant to close for them. “Both the vaccines are safe and immunogenic. There have been no serious or sever acute events following immunisation in the whole country. No death has been attributed to the vaccination. I would like to appeal to the medical professionals to get the vaccine,” said Dr Harsh Vardhan.Twelve states and union territories have vaccinated over 75% of all the healthcare workers who had been registered on the government’s Co-WIN portal. Topping the list is Bihar with 84.7% coverage, followed by Tripura with 82.9%, and Odisha with 81.8%. The national capital, however, figures in the list of the seven states and union territories with less than 50% vaccine coverage. So far, only 46.5% of the registered healthcare workers in Delhi have received their first shots. The lowest coverage was reported in Puducherry where only 30.2% have been immunised, followed by Chandigarh where 34.3% have received the shot, and Punjab where 38.4% have received it.With 658,674 shot being administered, Thursday saw the highest ever vaccination in the country since the drive was rolled out on January 16.The vaccination drive aims to immunise 10 million healthcare workers, 20 million frontline workers, 260 million people above the age of 50, and 10 million people with severe co-morbidities. NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had on Thursday said that the Centre finalised the norms for identifying the 10 million people with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-administers-10-million-vaccine-doses-second-quickest-drive-in-world-101613780223276.html

His comments came a day after he announced that he was joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), months ahead of scheduled polls in the southern state.The 88-year-old man told reporters that his aim was to help the party come to power in Kerala and that he was open to the chief ministership. He also said the focus will be on developing infrastructure if the BJP won the assembly polls likely to be held in April-May this year.Responding to news channel NDTV on a question about “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing groups to describe relationships between Hindu women and Muslim men, Sreedharan said, “….Love Jihad, yes, I see what is happened in Kerala. How Hindus are being tricked in a marriage and how they suffer... not only Hindus, Muslim, the Christian girls are being tricked in a marriage.

20-02-2021||India||PM, Shah hail Tagore and Netaji’s legacies||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday focused on West Bengal’s rich heritage and its “lost glory” in back-to-back addresses in the poll-bound state, in an effort to counter chief minister Mamata Banerjee branding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership as “outsiders” in the state.Modi, while virtually addressing the convocation ceremony of Visva Bharati, the state’s only central university of which the Prime Minister is the chancellor, said its founder Rabindranath Tagore’s vision on education has contributed to the Centre’s new education policy.The Prime Minister spoke about Maratha warrior king Shivaji, whose birth anniversary was celebrated during the day, and recited in Bengali a few lines from Tagore’s poem Shivaji Utsav on the icon. “These lines draw inspiration from Shivaji and talk of fighting for one India. We must live the message Tagore sent. You are not part of a university but part of a living heritage. Tagore could have named this institution a global university but he chose to call it Visva Bharati. He wanted the students to see the world as Indians and uphold the nation’s heritage. This is what the nation expects of you,” said Modi.“Tagore wanted the education system to be free. Today, the nation’s new education policy gives you the freedom to choose your subjects, show your skills and develop entrepreneurship. It also focuses on gender equality in education… This will lead to an aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India),” Modi said.Union minister Shah, who was in Bengal on a two-day tour, attended a cultural event at Kolkata’s National Library as part of a programme on freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, and paid tributes to Bengal’s martyrs.“Subhas Chandra Bose is remembered by millions despite the efforts made to make people forget him. The Centre has formed a committee to pay homage to him on his 125th birth anniversary not only in India but abroad as well. He topped the Indian civil service, something today’s youths aspire for, but quit the job to serve India... We may not die for the nation like the freedom fighters, but we can live for it,” Shah said.Trinamool Congress’s Lok Sabha MP Saugata Roy alleged that Modi and Shah both fall short of the secular idealism that Tagore and Bose stood for. “They build the Ram temple and differentiate between high-caste and low-caste Hindus. They are mentally and ideologically unfit to talk about such icons,” Roy said.Countering Shah and Modi, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sujan Chakraborty said: “Do Modi and Shah live the spirit of universal brotherhood that Tagore and Bose uphold? The BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh represent an entirely different ideology. Tagore believed in freedom of thought and speech while Bose believed in a classless society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-shah-hail-tagore-and-netaji-s-legacies-101613778554186.html
20-02-2021||India||Rampant construction, Char Dham project may amplify ecological risk||The noise of stone crushers and earthmoving equipment mars the silence of the high Himalayas on the road from Rudraprayag to Joshimath at a height of over 1,000 metres, and then again, up from Joshimath, around 2,000 metres high.It’s the sound of hills being eaten into for the Char Dham road project; the rubble, including huge boulders from the blasted hill slopes are gathered all along the road, some perilously close to the edge. Geologists say this can’t be good for the high Himalayas.The Centre submitted to the Supreme Court on Wednesday there is no link between the February 7 glacier lake overflow flood that washed away two hydropower projects on the Rishi Ganga and possibly killed at least 150 people and the Char Dham project.But geologists and scientists say that together, the road construction and hydropower projects have increased the vulnerability of the region. They warn that many stretches of the Himalayas on the Char Dham route are now at risk of partial collapse.One of the contentious points in the road project is the width. The apex court on September 9 ruled that the road width shall not exceed the 5.5 metres specified in 2018 by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) for roads under construction in mountainous terrain. But a large part of the 900km project that promises to offer all-weather connectivity to four Hindu pilgrimage centres in Uttarakhand has already been constructed with 10 metre-width.Experts say it’s critical that the damage is stopped immediately owing to high seismic activity in the region and careless construction practices. “This road project is viable and there is a need for better connectivity and roads. But are ample precautions being taken to minimise damage? No. Have you conducted the study necessary to understand implications of this nature of construction?” said Navin Juyal, a retired geologist from the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad and member of the high-powered committee formed by the apex court to examine the environmental implications of the Char Dham project.“For Himalayan roads, three things are very important to consider: One is the slope. In Rishikesh for example there are lower slopes and as you go higher up, the slopes are steep which can be prone to erosion. The other important aspect is the nature of rocks. Are they inclined towards the road or the other side? The third is extent of vegetation and loose material on the hill being cut. One should never do a vertical scarp against the road.”“The government is saying it wants a 12-metre-wide two-lane road with paved shoulder. If you consider the right of way needed this means 24 metres. How will you get that much area in the high Himalayas? Then you have to cut the hills. No wonder over 50,000 trees had to be cut to make way for some of these stretches. But have we assessed what’s the collateral damage?” asked Juyal, giving the example of a 10km stretch, Totaghati, ahead of Rishikesh where rock composition in the hills change almost every 100 metres. The stretch includes limestone, quartzite and slate. “As you know some of them are very brittle while some just erode. These have to be studied very carefully but they weren’t.”Then there is the seismic risk.“Chamoli experienced a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in 1999 and Uttarkashi experienced a 6.6 magnitude earthquake in 1991. The main frontal thrust, main boundary thrust and the main central thrust (all geological faults in the Himalayas) are extremely active, which means they have the potential to generate a great earthquake. So, any construction in this region has to be carried out extremely carefully. The Himalayas are still evolving and hence seismologically active,” explained AP Pandey, a scientist at the National Center for Seismology.Even members of the 21-member majority panel of the SC’s high powered committee who supported double- laning of the Char Dham road project, in their report, say slopes are unstable in many areas.“Where there are hard rocks, hills have to be cut vertically. There is little option. But then slope stabilisation has to be carried out. Slopes are unstable in many places... Authorities have been asked to make a detailed project report of unstable slopes so that they can be stabilised,” said Vikram Gupta, scientist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.The minority committee report, authored by the chairman of the panel, Ravi Chopra, underlined that higher Himalayan rocks are subjected to high erosion primarily due to focused rainfall, progressively high relief (slopes), high concentration of earthquakes and weak rock types. Correspondence in the Current Science journal by MPS Bisht of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University and Piyoosh Rautela of Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre in 2010 highlighted that disaster looms over the Joshimath region.Situated in proximity of major tectonic discontinuities, Joshimath has been showing signs of distress due to burgeoning anthropogenic pressure, the paper said. “The Mishra Commission (1976) reported that Joshimath is situated on an old landslide zone and is sinking. The report recommended that heavy construction be banned in the area around Joshimath. Despite being fully aware of the geological/environmental vulnerability of the area, a number of hydroelectric schemes have been sanctioned around Joshimath and Tapovan,” it read. These warnings were not heeded to by the Char Dham project.“The problem is government doesn’t consult scientists when implementing a project. We are called to give our opinion and the matter ends there,” said senior geologist, professor YP Sundriyal of the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University.Bharat Singh, a resident of Raini village, which was devastated by the February flood, was among the first to notice a cloud of debris and ice flowing down and destroying Rishi Ganga and Tapovan projects. He said: “Our hills have been destroyed. Tunnels have been dug up on the river. I wonder if these disasters are because of such projects? Only gods can help us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rampant-construction-char-dham-project-may-amplify-ecological-risk-101613768661744.html

One of the passages he quoted read: “Hindusthan is the land of the Hindus and is the terra firma for the Hindu nation alone to flourish upon…” Tharoor added in his tweet: “GOI hails a man who disrespected India’s flag&Constitution!”Golwalkar, born on February 19, 1906, took over from the first RSS chief KB Hedgewar in 1939. He went to jail in 1949 as part of the government’s crackdown on the RSS after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination.The RSS was not indicted for the killing. Golwalkar’s writings in publications such as the Sangh’s own Organiser, however, have continued to divide opinion about his views.Alluding again to Golwalkar’s Bunch of Thoughts, activist Kavita Krishnan tweeted, “For Golwalkar, Hindu is equal to national. Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Dalit, OBC, feminist, Tamil, Kannada, Manipuri etc is equal to communal, separatist.’’The Centre ran into controversy last year when it decided to name a second campus for the Kerala-based Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology after Golwalkar.Rajya Sabha member of Parliament Rakesh Sinha, who is also associated with the Sangh, welcomed the ministry’s initiative to mark Golwalkar’s anniversary. “The ministry of culture has re-initiated an inclusive tradition to remember and to pay homage to all such great people of India who contributed in history, culture, society and the freedom movement,’’ he said, adding that some people were “groomed in Gandhi, Nehru-centric history which we must go beyond.”Gowalkar, he added, had been misunderstood. “They (critics) not only misquote Golwalkar but also do injustice to his philosophy. He represents an inclusive idea of India and advocated Indianisation of Islam and Christianity which is not the rejection of any religion or culture.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversy-after-govt-pays-tribute-to-msgolwalkar-101613768410833.html

One of them has been identified as Saqib, a local, and another FT (foreign terrorist), affiliated with LeT. Police have launched a manhunt to nab them.”Politicians from across party lines condemned the attack.“What makes this attack even more reprehensible is that SgCT Mohammad Yousuf of Zurhama and Ct Suhail Ahmad of Logripora were unarmed & shot in the back. Senseless & cowardly at the same time,” said former J&K chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah.People’s Democratic Party president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti condemned the attack, saying the “cycle of violence only begets misery”. Bharatiya Janata Party leader Altaf Thakur termed the attack an act of cowardice. “There is no place for such cowardly acts and the attackers must be brought to book,” he said.3 militants, one cop killed in separate encountersThree suspected militants and a policeman were killed in two separate encounters in south Kashmir’s Shopian and Central Kashmir’s Budgam districts on Thursday night and early Friday, the police said. The Shopian shoot-out started during a joint operation by the police and the CRPF in Badigam village on Thursday night, the police said.The other encounter took place early on Friday during a joint operation by the Budgam police and the CRPF in Zanigam Beerwah village on Friday.3 held for attack on restaurant owner’s sonMeanwhile, three men have been arrested for their alleged involvement in an attack on a restaurant owner’s son here two days ago, when a 24-member delegation of foreign envoys arrived on a two-day visit to J&K, the police said on Friday.Akash Mehra, son of the owner of Krishna Dhaba in Durganag area of the city, was shot at by unidentified men from a close range. “We have arrested three men, who were involved in the attack at Krishna Dhaba,” said IGP, Kashmir zone, Vijay Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-guns-down-2-policemen-in-valley-101613767445163.html
20-02-2021||India||Meet Indian-American Mohan who announced Mars landing||Eleven minutes after touchdown, American scientist of Indian origin Dr Swati Mohan announced to her colleagues that Nasa’s rover, Perseverance, had landed successfully on planet Mars.“Touchdown confirmed! Perseverance is safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life,” Mohan announced on Thursday as scientists in the mission control room of the US space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory erupted in cheers.By the time the Nasa scientist made the announcement at 02:29am IST (Friday), Perseverance was on the Martian surface for 11 minutes – the time it takes to receive a message from Mars to Earth. It was Mohan who was responsible for the descent and landing of the rover through the thin Martian atmosphere, described by Nasa scientists as “seven minutes of terror”. And it came through. The rover — which will for the next one Martian year (or 687 Earth days) look for proof of ancient microbial life -- successfully landed near the Jezero crater.Mohan, who was the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls (GN&C) Operations Lead for the mission, explained in a video from 2019: “If we didn’t have Terrain Relative Navigation, the probability of landing safely at Jezero Crater is about 80 to 85%. But with Mars 2020, we can actually bring that probability of success of landing safely at Jezero Crater all the way up to 99% safe every single time.”The Terrain Relative Navigation is a new technology used by the rover to photograph the Martian surface while descending through the atmosphere with a parachute and determining a safe landing site.Mohan has been working on the Mars mission for the last eight years. She has previously worked on Nasa’s Cassini mission to planet Saturn and the GRAIL mission to the moon.Mohan, born in Bengaluru, came to the US at the age of one and was raised in Northern Virginia and Washington DC. She studied mechanical engineering at Cornell University, and completed her masters and doctorate in aeronautics and astronautics from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But it wasn’t always her dream to explore space. Till the age of 16, she wanted to be a paediatrician. It took a physics teacher and her love for Star Trek that triggered her interest in discoveries of the universe.“Actually, I wanted to be a paediatrician until I was about 16 years old. I was always interested in space, but I didn’t really know about opportunities to turn that interest into a job. I remember watching the first episode of Star Trek at 9, and seeing the beautiful depictions of the new regions of the universe that they were exploring. I remember thinking I want to do that. I want to find new and beautiful places in the universe,” she was quoted as saying by Nasa profile of Mars2020 scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-indian-american-mohan-who-announced-mars-landing-101613767124340.html
20-02-2021||India||21-year-old man, teen aid held for poisoning Dalit girls in Unnao||Police on Friday arrested a 21-year-old man and his teenage associate for allegedly poisoning three Dalit girls and killing two of them in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao district, claiming that the duo tried to extract revenge from one of the girls after she rebuffed the man’s advances.The development came on a day the families laid to rest the two minor victims, aged 13 and 15, after resisting two attempts by the administration to bury the girls — a stand-off that brought back memories of the Hathras gang rape case last October where police and local administration forcibly cremated a Dalit victim.The three Dalit girls were found unconscious in a field near their home in Unnao district late on Wednesday by family members. Two of them died soon after, and the third, who is 16 years old, is in a critical condition in a Kanpur hospital.Inspector general of police Laxmi Singh said Vinay Kumar, a resident of a village neighbouring that of the victims’, and a 15-year-old boy were arrested on charges of murder and concealing evidence. They belong to the same caste as the victims, said local officials.“Vinay told the police he asked for her phone number, proposed to her but she always refused. He was angry with her and sought revenge for his insult…The accused gave some pesticide with water to the three girls,” said Singh. She said Kumar confessed to the crime.The victims’ families welcomed the arrests.”We have been telling the police right from the start that our daughters were murdered. We stand vindicated. The police must ensure that the investigation carries enough evidences against them and they are hanged,” said the father of one of the victims.Kishan Pal, Kumar’s father, said his son was being framed. “My son is not like this. He is being made a scapegoat under pressure,” he said.The father of the 15-year-old boy said his son was too young to commit such a crime. “How can a young boy of his age do something like this? This is beyond his capability,” he said.Police said Kumar was a farmer and owned a piece of land near the spot where girls were found on Wednesday night. According to police, Kumar said the girls used to go to the fields for fodder and became friends during the coronavirus lockdown, after which he started pursuing one of the girls but was rejected.“We used to play and eat together in the field…When I proposed her, she rejected. When I asked her this month to give me her phone number, she did not give due to which I was angry and decided to kill her,” Kumar was quoted as saying by UP Police.On Wednesday, Kumar allegedly mixed pesticide in a water bottle and met the girls in the field with the intention of poisoning them. “When they asked for water, I gave them the water bottle in which pesticide was mixed and they drank it,” Singh quoted Kumar as saying.It was not clear why Kumar tried to poison the other two girls and didn’t stop them when they were drinking from the same bottle. As the girls complained of vertigo and fainted, Kumar and his associate panicked, dragged them to their field from his and ran away, police added. “I left their bodies in the field,” the IG quoting Vinay’s alleged confession said.Police said they were told by other villagers that Kumar was present in his field at the time the girls were there.He was among six people picked up for questioning on Thursday noon.“Vinay broke down when his location was also found in the field at the time of the crime and a few eyewitnesses, who saw them running from one field to another field in a state of panic, came forward,” said a senior police official on condition of anonymity.Family members said the girls were close friends and left together to bring green fodder from a field around 1.5km from their house on Wednesday. They brought a packet of chips from a local shop around 3.30pm. It was the last anyone saw them. Their bodies were discovered by the families around 9.30pm.On Friday morning, bodies of the two minor girls were buried in their field in accordance with local customs, in the presence of scores of policemen and local officials. The bodies were kept in their respective houses, where they were shrouded and garlanded. According to local tradition, unmarried minor girls are not cremated.On Thursday, local administration had tried twice to bury the girls. In the morning, hundreds of angry local villagers confronted officials supervising the digging of graves in the field with earth moving machines and said they won’t let the administration bury the victims. In the evening, family members threw themselves before the machine in protest and said they would not allow the burial in the night because it violated local customs.But on Friday, the administration said the burials were conducted with the families’ consent. Unnao district magistrate Ravindra Kumar refuted reports of any pressure being exerted on the families and said the last rites were performed as per their wishes.Officials also announced ₹5 lakh each for the families of the two deceased girls. The family of the third girl, who is in a Kanpur hospital, was given ₹2 lakh and the government said it will bear the cost of her medical treatment.Specialists from Lucknow’s King George Medical University assisted the staff at the Kanpur hospital at the instruction of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, said officials. The hospital said the girl was responding to the treatment given by doctors and her condition was being monitored by specialists. “She could be taken off the ventilator,” the medical bulletin read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21yearold-man-teen-aid-held-for-poisoning-dalit-girls-in-unnao-101613766720051.html
20-02-2021||India||Three-day judicial custody for Disha, bail may be heard today||A Delhi court on Friday sent climate activist Disha Ravi to jail for three days at the request of Delhi Police which will seek her custody again next week to confront her with the co-accused.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) Akash Jain sent 22-year-old Ravi to three days’ judicial custody after she was produced in court at the end of five days of police custody.The activist was arrested from Bengaluru on February 13 by Delhi Police for allegedly creating and sharing a protest toolkit backing the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws.Delhi Police claimed on Monday that Ravi, along with Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob and Pune engineer Shantanu Muluk, created the toolkit and shared it with others “to tarnish India’s image”.The two have already been granted transit anticipatory bail by the Bombay high court earlier this week.On Friday, Ravi was brought to the Delhi court amid high security by the investigating agency which sought that she be sent to judicial custody for three days.Additional public prosecutor (APP) Irfan Ahmed during the hearing told the court that the police had issued a notice to co-accused Shantanu Muluk for February 22 for joining the investigation and that’s when they would again question Ravi.He claimed Ravi had been “evasive” during interrogation and shifted the blame onto the co-accused Nikita Jacob and Muluk. Ahmed also said the police want to question her again and bring her face-to-face with the co-accused in this case.“She has shifted the blame on the co-accused Nikita Jacob and Muluk. All of them need to be confronted with each other.”Ravi has also filed a bail application which is likely to be taken up on Saturday.Countering the submissions by the APP, Siddharth Agarwal, representing Ravi, said that the case diary was not properly given and also not in accordance with the law. He pointed out that it was not even paginated.A case diary is a record of daily investigations in a case.The court, after hearing the arguments, sent Ravi to jail till February 22.Earlier in the day, the Delhi high court directed the media and the police to exercise restraint while giving out details of the case, which dates back to earlier this month, when Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted out a toolkit detailing how to organise a campaign to support the ongoing farmers’ protest in India.Delhi Police have sought to link the toolkit with the violence of January 26 in Delhi, and to pro-Khalistani organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/threeday-judicial-custody-for-disha-bail-may-be-heard-today-101613766214991.html
20-02-2021||India||The lessons to be drawn from Chamoli disaster||Scientists have debated the exact cause of the flash floods that devastated Chamoli district of Uttarakhand on February 7. But there is little doubt that such disasters are likely to become more frequent. This could be because of long-term effects — such as the climate crisis — of human activity as well as more recent developments, such as the construction of dams to generate electricity in the fragile mountain terrain.The effects of the climate crisis on Uttarakhand’s weather patterns and their impact on the environment’s capacity to sustain damage being done by the construction of dams makes the state particularly vulnerable. These factors definitely pose a threat to Chamoli, according to data on its weather analysed by HT. Here’s how:1) Uttarakhand has experienced one of the highest increases in temperature this decadeA report assessing impact of the climate crisis over the Indian region published by the ministry of earth sciences last year said the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region has experienced a temperature rise of about 1.3 degrees Celsius from 1951 to 2014. India, as a whole, warmed by only 0.7 degrees from 1901 to 2018, the report said. An analysis of grid-level temperature data set of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows that almost all of Uttarakhand – and Chamoli in particular – has experienced the highest increase in both minimum and maximum temperatures. According to the Uttarakhand Action Plan on Climate Change (UAPCC) 2014, these trends in temperature are likely to continue in the future. In the Himalayan region, thermal discomfort to individuals – measured by a temperature-humidity index – is likely to increase in the 2030s. It is likely that this trend in temperatures in Uttarakhand has increased the speed of glaciers melting in the region. Scientists also agree that glaciers in the Himalayas have been retreating faster since the beginning of this century, HT reported on February 8. According to a report of the expert body constituted under the direction of the Supreme Court after the June 2013 Uttarakhand floods, receding glaciers leave behind unstable moraine (rock and sediment deposits left by a glacier at its extremities) dams. When such natural dams breach, they can discharge large volumes of water and debris suddenly, causing floods.2) Upper reaches of Uttarakhand have also seen the highest increase in high and extreme intensity rainfallIt is not just the rise in temperature that makes Uttarakhand vulnerable to floods. IMD’s gridded rainfall data set also shows that heavy and extreme precipitation (greater than 35.5 mm of rainfall in a day in a grid or box bound by two latitudes and longitudes of 0.25° each) has increased in the state, particularly in the higher regions of the state, including Chamoli. While rainfall of higher intensity itself increases the threat of a flood, in a hilly state such as Uttarakhand, it can be twice as bad as in a state in the plains. Rainwater being warmer than snow and ice can accelerate glacial melting and add to the volume of water flowing in rivers, increasing the threat of a flood. The expert body constituted after the 2013 floods, for example, had this to say about those floods. “The warm rainwater of severe intensity (even upto 30 mm in an hour) in early June caused accelerated snow melt that along with large overland basin runoff from intense rain caused unusual flood havoc in most rivers of Uttarakhand upto Haridwar on the Ganga.” Moreover, according to a research paper by Professor Robert Wasson and others who have analysed large floods in the Upper Ganga catchment, rainfall also triggers landslides in the region. These again lead to natural dams which, when they breach, can amplify the effects of rainfall. Such amplification will only get worse as rainfall gets more intense because of the climate crisis.3) Dams in the state don’t account for the unique environment of the stateHydropower projects are one of the cleanest forms of energy, as far as carbon dioxide emissions are concerned. Using them as a source of energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming and the effects of it discussed above. Still, developers of such projects in Uttarakhand need to take into account the unique environment of the state. According to Navin Juyal, a retired geologist from Ahmedabad’s Physical Research Laboratory, who is studying the Feb 7 glacier breach, policy makers should be extremely cautious about developing hydropower projects in Uttarakhand. This is because Himalayan rivers, being younger, carry many boulders and debris along in the event of a flood. “They are fed by glaciers from where debris flow into the rivers. Big boulders with sand and other debris often get mobilised and hydropower projects create an artificial obstruction in the flow of this material. When these boulders and sand are not able to flow freely, they also form dams holding water behind them. When hydrostatic pressure builds, these dams break and they cause floods,” Juyal said. So how much obstruction are we creating to the natural flow of rivers in Uttarakhand? According to a 2011 report prepared by the Alternate Hydro Energy Centre (AHEC) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, for the environment ministry, almost half of the length of rivers in the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda basins is either diverted or submerged because of allotted hydropower projects. This can only worsen any floods in the state.To be sure, there are contrarians. “Entire Rishikesh and Haridwar would have been washed away in the 2013 floods had the flood waters not got stored in Tehri dam after flowing down. I believe that hydroelectric projects are a victim and environmentalists take advantage of disasters to victimise them. There is nothing called higher reached of Himalayas. Hydroelectric projects can be located anywhere after the snowline. The two important factors needed for siting a hydropower project is height and volume of water. You will find height only in the Himalayas. Plus, water storage is extremely important for water security, so we need dams too,” said VK Kanjlia, former secretary of the Central Board of Irrigation & Power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-lessons-to-be-drawn-from-chamoli-disaster-101613765131618.html
20-02-2021||India||India’s Covid-19 curve inches upwards amid fear of mutant strains||India’s new Covid-19 curve continued to gradually inch upwards, driven largely by a resurgence of daily infections in Maharashtra, which for the second day in a row reported most infections in the country ahead of even Kerala where the first wave continues unabated.The seven-day average of new cases across the country has now gone up seven of the last eight days, highlighting the potential risk of a surge in cases amid fears of mutant strains gaining ground. HT reported on Friday that the Covid trajectory was rising again in four regions in the country – Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir – after the end of the first wave of the pandemic, an analysis by HT shows. Maharashtra and Kerala, meanwhile, were responsible for 75% of the 13,632 new cases recorded across the country on Friday.The increase in cases is being reported even as restrictions on several economic and social activities have eased across the country, and people and governments appear to be getting complacent, with almost no mask discipline, experts warned.This week, Maharashtra, India’s worst-hit state, has seen an increase of 73% in the number infections compared to the week before – the seven-day average of cases in the state currently stands at 4,437, against 2,564, last week. Kerala, meanwhile, continues to see an average of over 4,500 cases each day this week. It is the increase in the number of cases in Maharashtra has the experts worried.“There is a need to study the new infections that are being reported from Maharashtra, where a high proportion of people are likely to have been exposed already. We need to see whether the infections are happening in people who haven’t had it earlier or are these re-infections,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.He said there was a need for increased surveillance to see whether the new variants of the virus have taken root. “If the new variant of the virus is infecting the people but the antibodies from a previous infection still protects a significant number of people, then the increase would just be a blip... If not, then we are in for trouble,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-curve-inches-upwards-amid-fear-of-mutant-strains-101613764211272.html
20-02-2021||India||Dr Reddy’s applies for Sputnik authorisation||Dr Reddy’s on Friday applied for the emergency use approval of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, setting the ball rolling in what could lead to India getting access to a third shot to fight the pandemic.Sputnik V has shown an efficacy rate of 91.6% in preventing Covid-19 in Phase 3 trials. The vaccine uses a similar adenovirus vector as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, whose Indian variant is Covishield. Apart from Covishield, India uses the domestically developed Covaxin, and has inoculated over 10 million people since kicking off the drive on January 16.“The efficacy of Sputnik V was reported to be 91.6% by The Lancet, which is an impressive development in the fight against Covid-19. The initiation of the EUA process will be a critical step forward for us in ensuring speedy access to the Sputnik V vaccine in India,” Dr Reddy’s laboratories co-chairman and managing director GV Prasad said.As part of the review process for emergency authorisation, the company will submit safety data from the Indian Phase 2 trial and interim data from Phase 3 – a regulatory filing process similar to the one adopted by the Serum Institute of India (SII).Vaccines developed outside of the country will need to also undergo a bridging trial. Dr Reddy’s is conducting a Phase 3 bridging trial to establish immunogenicity of the vaccine in about 1,500 participants. The Phase 2 trial in India on 100 participants showed “no safety concerns,” according to the company.In the global trials, the vaccine also maintained a consistent efficacy at 91.8% among group of 2,144 volunteers over 60 years, the company said. The company said that it was one of the three vaccines that had shown such high efficacy; the other two being Moderna and Pfizer. The efficacy rate of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (whose data was used for Covshield’s approval) was 62%.In the case of Covaxin, efficacy data is awaited since Phase III trials have not progressed far enough. The vaccine had been approve by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in a “clinical trial mode”, where all those who are vaccinated will be followed-up on.The vaccine has been administered to more than two million people worldwide, the company said, listing Russia, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Palestine, UAE, Paraguay, Hungary, Armenia, Algeria, Bosnian Serb Republic, Venezuela and Iran as countries where it is in use.The application for any vaccination is sent to a subject expert committee, which if satisfied with the data, recommends a vaccine for approval to the Drug Controller General of India.“The journey from the virus to vaccine has been very exciting. In just twelve months, we not just have a basket of vaccines, we also have different vaccine platforms... This gives us a lot of confidence that India will be a global hub for Covid-19 vaccines as well,” said Dr Renu Swarup, secretary, department of biotechnology at a webinar on Thursday.Sputnik V was initially met with some controversy after being rolled out before the final trial data had been released. But scientists, while releasing the final Phase III data, said its benefit has now been demonstrated.In a comment published alongside the Lancet paper, professors Ian Jones and Polly Roy said: “The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency.“But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated, which means another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-reddy-s-applies-for-sputnik-authorisation-101613763833644.html
20-02-2021||India||200 farmers protesting against upcoming Goa airport arrested in fresh flare-up||More than 200 farmers who were protesting against the acquisition of their land for the construction of a link road between the upcoming International Airport at Mopa in North Goa were arrested after they disrupted government surveyors who had come to demarcate the land.The protesting farmers who included women blockaded the road leading to the site and refused to budge forcing the police, who had gathered in large numbers to bundle them into buses and place them under arrest.“The farmers had gone to oppose the survey being conducted for acquiring land for a eight kilometre long link road between the national highway and the upcoming airport. They have all been arrested,” Bharat Bagkar the convener of the Samiti formed to protect the farmers’ interests said.“How much more land should we part with? It is always we who have to pay the price of development. Is there no other area that you can choose to ‘develop’? Let other parts of Goa also see the benefits of ‘development’. It’s not like we are the only farmers,” he said.The proposed International Airport at Goa’s northern frontier is being built on 1-crore square metres of land that has been acquired after much opposition that lasted more than a decade and was challenged right up to the Supreme Court.Fresh protests erupted after the Goa government on December 31 published fresh acquisition notices this time for an eight kilometre long ‘link road’ that is to connect the airport with the national highway. The government proposes to acquire a width of 120 square metres to make way for the road.“Each farmer realised how much land he was going to lose. Prior to this they had no intimation and the notice came as a shocker -- one farmer is losing 36,000 square metres -- The people have already lost land for Sport City, Ayush Hospital, Cricket Stadium and the Tillari Canal,” Bagkar said.“We are not willing to part with our land. We are willing to fight till our last breath,” he added.Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, however, said the Goa government is going out of its way to compensate the farmers whose lands are being acquired and that they should cooperate.“I have already met them twice and listened to their demands. I have told them that the government is committed to go out of the way to ensure compensation for them for their land,” Sawant told reporters late on Friday, after the protestors were detained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200-farmers-protesting-against-upcoming-goa-airport-arrested-in-fresh-flareup-101613760614124.html
20-02-2021||India||Culture ministry to put draft bylaws on hold for 2 Bhubaneswar temples||Amid opposition from Biju Janata Dal and the priests of the Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar regarding the draft bylaws issued by the National Monuments Authority, Union culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel on Friday put the bylaws on hold.In a letter to Union minister of state for MSME, Pratap Sarangi, Patel wrote that he had asked the officials of the culture ministry to keep the proposal on hold. “The final decision on the same would be taken only after the matter is discussed and deliberated with all the stakeholders,” Patel wrote to Sarangi in reply to the latter's request urging the Centre to rethink the matter.Last month, the National Monument Authority under the Union culture ministry issued draft bylaws for the Jagannath Temple of Puri, and Ananta Basudeva and Brahmeswar Temples of Bhubaneswar under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. As per the draft bylaws, construction activities are prohibited within the first 100 metre radius of the monument and are regulated within the next 200 metres. Following protests by state government, the NMA had withdrawn the draft bylaw for Jagannath Temple on February 8.However, the NMA did not withdraw the draft bylaws for the 13th century Ananta Basudeva Temple and Brahmeswar Temple in Bhubaneswar. The draft bylaws for Ananta Basudeva Temple threatened to spoil the Odisha government’s plans of proposed beautification of the Lingaraj Temple as the latter came within the 100 metre radius, thereby ruling out any chances of new construction.Odisha chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra had written to the Union culture secretary demanding withdrawal of the draft bylaws of Ananta Basudeva Temple citing apprehensions of a widespread agitation leading to disturbance in religious rituals. “The kind of atmosphere in temples is bound to hurt the religious sentiments of lakhs of devotees. It is important to have a peaceful atmosphere for conducting the annual Maha Shivratri festival in which a large number of devotees from all over the state participate,” the chief secretary wrote.The priests of the 11th century Lingaraj Temple, backed by the BJD, claimed that the draft bylaw for the 13th century Ananta Basudeva Temple would hinder the Shivaratri festival at the Lingaraj temple.“The draft bylaws of the Ananta Basudeva Temple are an outcome of the difference of opinion between the BJP and the BJD. If the government doesn’t roll back the draft regulations with immediate effect, it may have an impact on the upcoming Shivaratri rituals. The political game over the matter is playing spoilsport in the development of the temple,” said Biranchi Pati, secretary of Brahmana Nijog, one of the most powerful bodies of priests of Lingaraj Temple.The draft bylaws triggered a fight between BJD and BJP with the Bhubaneswar MP and senior BJP leader Aparajita Sarangi saying the draft bylaws for Ananta Basudeva Temple were good. “Heritage areas must be developed. But the route to such development is not through withdrawal/abeyance of bylaws. Protest against the draft bylaw is politically motivated. As the AMSAR Act, 2010 still prevails, the Odisha government must seek permission from NMA/ASI before implementing projects in the prohibited/ regulated areas,” said Sarangi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/culture-ministry-to-put-draft-bylaws-on-hold-for-2-bhubaneswar-temples-101613758111479.html

Addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Kotkhawada area of Chaksu (Jaipur), Pilot pointed out how farmers have been agitating for months now. “This crisis should help everyone realise that the three farm laws by the Centre are not just anti-farmer but against the middle class, youth, and true patriots,” he said.In the mahapanchayat, attended by over a dozen Congress MLAs, a resolution was also passed which sought to ask the Centre to repeal the three new farm laws; a law for purchase on MSP; and reduction in fuel and LPG prices.Calling the public the biggest power in a democracy, Pilot said, “Through this mahapanchayat, we want to warn the government that the youth and farmers are standing united. The people of 36 communities have taken an oath that all will stand united against the steps taken against farmers.Also Read | Farmers ready to sacrifice one crop for protest, BKU ups ante“Farmers don’t need sympathy, they need support. They aren’t begging but asking for their rights. The government assured them double their income but has that happened? Such laws will make our children run from pillar to post. They are misleading– there is no one to listen to farmers in the Central government,” he said.“They talk of caste and religion. The one who produces grain or the one who protects the border doesn’t have a caste. They want to divide us in the name of caste and religion,” said the former deputy CM. He appealed to the farmers to ask the public for support.Earlier this month, Pilot had addressed a mahapanchayat in Dausa and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan, organised by MLAs who supported him during the political crisis in the state which had threatened to topple the government.In the mahapanchayat on Friday, organised by MLA Ved Prakash Solanki in Chaksu, over a dozen party MLAs were on the dais with Pilot. “An invite was sent to the CM and the state party chief but they chose not to attend. The presence of over a dozen MLAs is sending a clear political message that all’s still not well within the party,” said a senior party leader on the condition of anonymity.Reacting to the Congress mahapanchayat, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said farmers need to understand that the farm laws are in their interest. Majority of the farmers are in favour of the laws,e said. The protesting farmers should think about the government proposal, and call off the protest, he added. “The Congress leaders must stop misguiding the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-don-t-need-sympathy-they-need-support-sachin-pilot-101613734970595.html

The council is of the view that unregulated circulation of the foreign content is not desirable. Hence, it advises the media to publish foreign extracts in Indian newspapers with due verification as the reporter, publisher and editor of such newspaper shall be responsible for the contents irrespective of the source from which it is received.”An official aware of the details said that the advisory fixes legal responsibility.“There were concerns about who will be held responsible in case of content that is published from foreign sources or from foreign authors. The PCI received submissions about this from the readers as well as the government so it was decided that the legal responsibility of what is published will rest with the Indian publication that prints the content,” the person said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pci-asks-newspapers-to-publish-foriegn-content-after-due-verification/story-7ldfBeyxEYOQ0q2FESlSEN.html
