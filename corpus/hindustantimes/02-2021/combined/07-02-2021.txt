The eighth battalion is based at Govindpuram in Ghaziabad; more teams have been asked to remain on standby. A major relief and rescue effort is on in Chamoli where a flood was triggered in river Dhauliganga after the glacier burst. The NDRF’s officials from the eighth battalion said that one of their teams, comprising about 40 to 45 members and a dog squad, was initially rushed from their regional response centre in Dehradun, while the second team departed Sunday afternoon from Ghaziabad.“This team was sent by road in vehicles while three teams were airlifted from the Hindon airbase. In all, five teams were pressed into service and more teams, which include those from other NDRF battalions, have been asked to remain on standby, to be pressed into service as and when the need arises,” said PK Tiwary, commandant of the eighth battalion. Teams of NDRF are equipped with sophisticated equipment and teams of specialised canines which help in search and rescue.“The teams are equipped with about 310 sophisticated equipment which are used during floods, building collapses and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear emergencies. Since a flash flood has occurred, we will also be using our team of divers and equipment such as sonars and boats which will be used for detection and rescue. Our teams have also taken away relief material for people affected,” Tiwary added.The eighth battalion were also a part of search and rescue operations carried out during the 2013 flash floods that had hit Uttarakhand. Sunday’s disaster has endangered the lives of the thousands of people living along the riverbanks, besides causing massive destruction. An alert has also been sounded by authorities in Uttarakhand in several districts including Pauri, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Haridwar and Dehradun.Teams of the Indo Tibetan Border Police were also rushed to the site near Raini village. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath tweeted that the state government is standing with the Uttarakhand government for any help or assistance. “The situation of water level in areas along the river Ganga is being constantly monitored in the state. In case there is a rise in water levels, people near the banks will be shifted, as the situation demands. Directions have been issued for relief and rescue,” the office of the CM said in a tweet. The UP police tweeted, “We are in touch with our counterparts. Border districts of Uttarakhand have been alerted. NDRF, SDRF (State Disaster Response Force) & flood company of the PAC (Provincial Armed Constabulary) have been instructed to be on highest alert. Evacuation of people shall be done wherever required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/teams-of-ndrf-s-eighth-battalion-rushed-to-uttarakhand-for-search-and-rescue-101612721569207.html

The incident was captured in a CCTV camera, police said.The footage of the incident was shared widely on social media from where it came to the notice of Noida police. In the footage, two women are seen standing outside a residential society in Sector 75 when two persons on a motorcycle snatched a phone from one of them before fleeing the spot. Police have taken cognizance of the matter. “We saw the video after it was brought to our attention, but the victim has not come forward yet. No complaint has been filed in this regard. We are working on identifying the woman. The incident seems to have occurred in Sector 75,” said Sudheer Kumar, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.Residents in the area said that the spot is near another snatching point in Sector 77. “A snatching incident was reported from just outside our society gate a few days ago. That incident was also caught in the CCTV cameras. There is a probability that the same men were responsible for both the incidents,” said Amit Gupta, president, Apartment Owners Association, Prateek Wisteria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/womans-phone-snatched-outside-noida-highrise-101612721568674.html
07-02-2021||Noida||Schools, parents express concern over SOP clauses issued for resuming classes in UP||Ghaziabad: The basic education department of the Uttar Pradesh government has issued a set of standard operating procedures (SOP) for schools and parents to be followed for the reopening of schools in the state.The state government had last week directed for the opening of schools for classes 6 to 8 from February 10, and classes 1 to 5 from March 1.The SOPs have mentioned that parents’ consent is must for sending a child to school and that it will not be the responsibility of the school if the student contracts Covid-19.The list of SOPs have been issued by UP’s basic education directorate and will pave way for the opening of schools for classes 1 to 8 in a phased manner.District officials said the conditions of the SOP will be applicable to all schools, whether government or private.“All sets of schools are covered under the SOPs, irrespective of education board. These will be applicable for private as well as government schools and they will have to make arrangements for sanitisation, social distancing and other guidelines already defined under the appropriate Covid behaviour,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. The district has 455 government schools with the district basic department under the UP state education board, while 147 schools are affiliated to the CBSE board, apart from private schools. The SOPs add that if children wish to study from home, they should be allowed to do so. The consent form, which is to be signed by parents, however, has several conditions. It says that although schools are to ensure all safety procedures, the institutions cannot guarantee that no child can contract Covid-19 in the future.“Parents have to ensure that the child has no symptoms such as cough/cold, fever or respiratory issues and will not send the child if he/she portrays any such symptoms. The schools will not be held responsible in case the students or their family members or friends get Covid-19. In case parents hide details of any positive case, they shall be solely responsible,” the SOP stated. The schools’ association has, however, objected to the clause of “parents’ consent” which they say will hinder attendance.“While opening classes 9, to 12 (in October last year) they inserted the clause of consent and are continuing with it. In classes being operated currently, only 20% attendance is being seen, with 40% in case of pre-board examinations. If this clause continues with other classes (1 to 8), the attendance will remain very low as parents are still not willing to send their children to schools,” said Subhash Jain, president of Independent Schools Federation of India.The SOPs have also stated that schools should maintain a maximum capacity of 50% students on the first day while the rest of the students should attend classes the next day. Besides, on any of the days, student capacity should not be more than 50%. It added that schools having a high number of students in a single class must hold classes in two sessions in order to maintain the occupancy limit and to ensure social distancing norms.Further, it has detailed that classes 1, 5 and 6 will be held on Mondays and Thursdays while class 2, 4 and 7 must be held on Tuesdays and Fridays. It added that class 3 and 8 should be held on Wednesdays and Saturdays.“It will be quite cumbersome for schools to operate in such a manner and they will have to rope in additional staff and also prepare separate study materials for online and regular classes and examinations as well. There are issues for schools as many parents have not paid the fee for the past 11 months and may continue to do so in case the consent clause remains,” Jain added. Members of parents’ associations said that the opening of schools should be deferred till the start of the next session. “We think that they are allowing opening of schools just to make parents pay up the fees of the entire year, whereas the majority of the sessions have been held online. Instead, they must promote students of classes 1 to 8 to the next class,” said Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson of the Ghaziabad Parents’ Association. He added that still the pandemic has not gone. “The coverage of the Covid-vaccination is still very low. Further, neither the government nor the schools will take responsibility in case the child contracts Covid-19. Instead, they are asking parents to sign the consent letter in which the entire onus is on parents. So, they will still not take the risk of sending children to school,” he added.The Noida parents’ association echoed similar views. “The state government has taken the decision in a haste. Despite tall claims, the implementation of the standard Covid-19 protocols could never be ensured in rural areas by the state government. Imagine what would happen in areas where schools lack safe portable water and furniture? How will the government ensure adequate availability of sanitisers and masks there? The state government must ask teachers of government schools, particularly in rural areas, not to compel children to attend classes. As per a survey done by the Noida Parents’ Association recently, almost 90% of the parents were unwilling to send their children back to schools for regular classes,” said Yatendra Kasana, president, Noida Parents’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/schools-parents-express-concern-over-sop-clauses-issued-for-resuming-classes-in-up-101612721508697.html
07-02-2021||Noida||Recovery certificates against defaulting builders: Only 13% of ₹296 crore realised in Gautam Budh Nagar||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has so far been able to retrieve only about 13% of its target for the current fiscal from builders against whom recovery certificates had been issued by the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP Rera).According to district magistrate Suhas LY, all tehsildars have been asked to speed up the process, so that the money can be returned to buyers. “A recovery notice is issued after an individual or firm refuses to pay the default amount. We have received recovery certificates from the regulatory authority to the tune of ₹296.68 crore. We want to ensure maximum recovery so that buyers who have invested their hard-earned money and approached the court with hopes can be given some relief,” he said.Vandita Srivastava, the additional district magistrate (finance and recovery) said that for the 2020-2021 fiscal, the district administration has so far recovered nearly ₹39.55 crore from builders declared defaulters by the Rera. “The recovered amount will soon be credited to the UP Rera’s accounts,” she said.She added that it is not an easy task to recover money from defaulters. “Recovery certificates are orders issued by the regulatory authority asking builders to clear buyers’ dues if the builders have failed to deliver projects within deadline. We have already started recovery operations against defaulters in all tehsils. We’ll soon intensify the crackdown so that relief can be provided to the harassed lot of buyers and their faith in the judiciary remains intact,” she said. When contacted, Rajive Kumar, the UP Rera’s chairman, said that once the amount is credited in UP Rera’s accounts with details of defaulters, the authority will begin the process of reimbursing buyers. “It is not a time-consuming exercise. There are simple formalities for buyers such as submitting affidavits and bank account numbers. After that, the money is credited to their accounts,” he said. The Allahabad high court had recently asked the Gautam Budh Nagar administration to ensure that recovery certificates issued by UP Rera are honoured by defaulters “preferably within three months”. In a reply to an RTI query, it was revealed that the UP Rera, since its inception in May 2016, has so far disposed of 74% of the total cases in the state, but only 16% of the recovery certificates issued by it have been realised so far. Since its inception, recovery certificates to the tune of around ₹1,000 crore have been issued by the regulatory authority against different builders in the Gautam Budh Nagar district so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/recovery-certificates-against-defaulting-builders-only-13-of-296-crore-realised-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101612721448638.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Very few PhD students in top Indian institutes from SC, ST category: Data||The representation of students belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Other Backwards Classes (OBC) categories in the PhD programmes of premier science institutions remains poor, according to data released by the ministry of education (MoE) in Rajya Sabha, on Thursday.At the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru, only 2.1% of candidates admitted to the PhD programmes between 2016 and 2020 were from ST category, 9% from SC and 8% from OBC categories. In the integrated PhD programmes at IISc, 9% of the total admitted candidates were from SC, 1.2% from ST and 5% from OBC categories. In the 17 Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), barely 1.7% of total PhD candidates were from ST category, 9% from SC category and 27.4% from OBC categories. The representation is equally skewed against reserved category PhD candidates between 2017 and 2020 at the 31 National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and seven Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs). This is against a 27% reservation of all seats in government institutes for OBC candidates, 15% for SC category and 7.5% for ST category.The alarming under-representation of reserved category candidates in PhD programmes of these institutes was revealed on Thursday in Rajya Sabha by Ramesh Pokhriyal, Union minister of education. The admission figures were provided in response to the questions raised by two members of the upper house Elamaram Kareem and Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.In November 2020, HT had reported a similar trend of under-representation in the PhD programmes at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), despite receiving applications from SC, ST and OBC category candidates. Between 2015 and 2019, only 1.6% of all PhD candidates at IIT-B were from ST category, 7.5% from SC category and 19.2% from OBC category. Pokhriyal’s responses on Thursday also included data on dropouts from PhD programmes in these institutes. Of all the institutes, seven IISERs had the worst record with 13.3% of all dropouts from the ST category. Following the revelation in Rajya Sabha, the central executive committee of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI), a national student body, issued a statement: “The persistent violation of reservation norms in the nation’s premier technical institutions has contributed to the underrepresentation of teaching faculty from the marginalised and backward groups at the same institutions. This has proven to be a major hindrance in achieving an inclusive learning atmosphere.” “We demand immediate intervention from the President of India on the issue. SFI also appeals to all members in the parliament to take up this alarming issue in the ongoing parliament session and also join with the democratic sections in the fight for social justice,” said VP Sanu, president, SFI. Pokhriyal has informed the Upper house that several measures were being taken to address the under-representation of SC, ST and OBC category students in PhD programmes. However, experts said that while access to quality education at primary and secondary school levels was poorer for reserved category students, institutional prejudice against reservations cannot be ruled out. “One cannot rule out the bias of caste and class in the admission processes of institutes. The reservation policies have been resisted by higher education institutes, particularly in the science and technology streams, on the basis of the argument that reservations will bring down merit,” said Avatthi Ramaiah, chairperson of Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai. Meanwhile, the reduction in the overall intake capacity of PhD candidates across institutes has further reduced the representation of reserved category candidates, Ramaiah added. On July 5, 2016, University Grants Commission (UGC) issued a notification stating that a research supervisor/co-supervisor, who is a Professor, cannot guide more than eight PhD scholars. An associate professor as research supervisor can guide up to a maximum of six PhD scholars and an assistant professor can guide up to a maximum of four PhD scholars. “The government does not want an intellectual class that can raise a voice against its policies. The reduction in intake capacity of PhD programmes is a clear indication of this,” said Ramaiah.“Initially, the number of applicants from reserved categories in higher education institutes were few. However, the situation has improved now with more applications coming in. While the lack of representation has to be understood in the context of the number of applications, the lack of representation at IIT-B is concerning, irrespective of the reasons behind it.” Sukhadeo Thorat, former chairperson of UGC and author of Blocked by Caste: Economic Discrimination and Social Exclusion in Modern India, said that higher education institutions must have a sympathetic attitude towards reserved category students while admitting PhD candidates. “Institutes must practice relaxation of criteria to ensure proper representation of students, even within the limited intake capacity,” said Thorat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/very-few-phd-students-in-top-indian-institutes-from-sc-st-category-data-101612721331846.html
07-02-2021||Noida||GB Nagar aims to inoculate left out health workers on Feb 15||NOIDA: Concerned over the lukewarm response to all six sessions of phase 1 of the Covid-19 vaccination, the Gautam Budh Nagar district health department has decided to launch a mop up round on February 15 to cover remaining 10,510 health workers who could not get the vaccine shots. The GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, said that the health workers, who missed the jabs in the first phase, will be included in the list of beneficiaries for the mop up round. “As per the instructions issued by the state government, directions have been given to all the centres to open the Co-Win portal for 50 hours (from 10 am on February 8 to 12 pm on February 10), to upload names of the left out health-care workers, so that they could be vaccinated in the mop up round,” he said. Ohri further said that the failure of potential beneficiaries to get vaccinated in the mop up round will automatically push them to age-appropriate vaccination category. “The second dose of the vaccine is also scheduled to start from February 13 for people who were vaccinated on January 16 in the first phase,” he said. It may be noted that after the six sessions for first phase of Covid-19 vaccination that ended on February 5, the overall turnout for the phase in GB Nagar district was nearly 57% as 13,943 health workers took the jabs out of enlisted 24,453 beneficiaries. After the first phase, GB Nagar district has been ranked 68th, out of 75 districts, in the state in terms of the turnout.When asked about the reasons behind the lukewarm response to the vaccination drive, the CMO said that while some of the beneficiaries remained sceptical about the efficacy of the vaccine, others claimed that they do not need it as their bodies have developed immunity against the virus. “Many clerical and hospital administration staff, besides some medical students, were reported to give the vaccination a miss deliberately as they claimed that since they were never on active Covid-19 duty, they didn’t want to get vaccinated,” he said. Ohri said that the health department officials are informing the beneficiaries, two days ahead of their stipulated date of vaccination. “We have also informed the departments concerned of the beneficiaries about their presence or absence during the vaccination. We are also trying to improve turnout in coming sessions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-aims-to-inoculate-left-out-health-workers-on-feb-15-101612721329894.html

He stated that his elder brother, Deependra, was addicted to liquor for some months. “In September 2020, I contacted the de-addiction centre in Greater Noida who promised to cure my brother in four months.

07-02-2021||Mumbai||Call research, final-year students for physical class; online class for rest: Mumbai univ||Days after the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that state universities and colleges can reopen starting February 15 with not more than 50% attendance on campus at any given time, the University of Mumbai (MU), on Friday, released a circular along with guidelines to be followed. The colleges have been asked to give first preference to PhD and research candidates and final year students to attend physical lectures while continuing online lectures for the rest of the batches.Following the standard operating procedures (SOPs) made public by the University Grants Commission (UGC), MU has shared a host of general and specific guidelines with affiliated colleges. “Institutes should plan to open the campuses in phases and ensure that not more than 50% of the total students are present. All research and postgraduate students in the science and technology programs, as well as final year students, may be allowed to join for academic and placement purposes,” states the guidelines. Other than these batches, online classes will have to remain functional for the other batches, states the circular. It further states that online teaching-learning arrangements must also continue for international students who cannot join classes physically due to travel and visa restrictions. “Residential students should follow the mandatory 14-day quarantine and self-evaluate their health regularly before being allowed to attend physical classes. Students and staff residing in containment zones should not be allowed on campus.”Other basic safety measures include ensuring that everyone wears masks at all times on campus and maintains a six-feet distance between each other. Screening of staff and students at the time of entry to the college as well as queue management inside and outside the premises have been suggested. “There should be mandatory and regular disinfection of frequently touched surfaces in all classrooms, laboratories and other common areas before the beginning of the classes and at the end of the day. At least one seat should be left vacant between two seats,” highlights the safety measures. The guidelines also mention collection and proposer disposal of face masks, gloves, tissues etc. “Following the state government order for reopening of colleges, and keeping in mind guidelines prescribed by the state as well as UGC in November 2020, colleges are requested to follow all the guidelines to ensure the safety of staff and students,” said the circular. Colleges, however, are still worried that conducting physical as well as online classes every day might become stressful for the teachers. “Also how are we supposed to keep the washrooms sanitised through the day? The government specifically asked us not to charge library and laboratory fees from students this year and is now asking us to open all for all students. Sanitisation through the day will be a financial burden for many colleges,” said the vice-principal of a suburban college on condition of anonymity.BOX:Guidelines for before reopening of campuses—*Only university/colleges outside containment zones to be allowed to open*Students and staff living in containment zones should not be allowed to attend classes*Self-monitoring of health by all staff and students and ensuring that any illness is reported in advance*Faculty and students be encouraged to download and update Arogya Setu appSpecific measures to be taken—*Reopen colleges in phases with not more than 50% present at the college at any given time*Research and PhD candidates as well as final year students be given first preference to start physical classes, while online classes be continued for the rest of the batches*Students may visit their respective departments in small batches after seeking prior appointment for faculty consultations*Online learning arrangements should be made for international students unable to attend class due to travel and visa restrictionsSafety measures to be followed—*Crowding must be avoided at entry/exit points.

Dolly’s three children -- twin girls, Gauri and Minakshi aged nine years, and son Rudra aged five years -- suffered severe injuries, but survived, police said. The three children are admitted to a private hospital, police said, adding that condition of one of them is critical. Police have arrested two suspects in the case -- Uma Singh, a resident of Lal Quarter area of Ghaziabad, and her male friend Mohammad Sonu who allegedly shot dead Dolly and Anshu.“The suspect had brought a .32 calibre pistol with him and he shot dead the woman and the teenaged girl. Later, when he tried to open fire at the three children, the pistol got jammed. He then inflicted severe injuries to the three children with a knife and grinding stone kept in the kitchen. Assuming that all were dead, he fled the house with his woman accomplice,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).After the incident Sonu left Uma at her house and picked up another .315 calibre pistol and fled the house, police said, adding that it was with the second pistol that the suspect opened fire at the police near Dasna on late Saturday night and sustained a gunshot to his leg as a result of retaliatory firing by the police. “They (suspects) inflicted severe injuries to the throat of my three children and also hit them with a grinding stone. We rushed the children to a hospital for treatment,” said Mahesh Thakur, Dolly’s husband. “One of my daughters told me that ‘Amma’ who stays at Lal Quarter locality had come to the house on the night of the incident. My children are still in hospital and one of my daughters is on ventilator support while two are stable,” he added. The doctors at Yashoda Hospital in Nehru Nagar where the children are admitted said that Minakshi was on ventilator support. “Her condition is critical, and we have put her on ventilator support. She has injuries to her throat and head,” said Dr Sangita Garg, chief medical superintendent of the hospital. Police said that they initially suspected a carpenter who had visited the house on Saturday evening. “One of the two injured girls (Gauri) told us that it was their relative from Lal Quarter locality who came to the house with a man and introduced him as a tailor. Once the child gave us clues, we conducted a raid at the house and the woman was arrested and her accomplice was later nabbed from near Dasna,” SP said. “Dolly was granddaughter of my mother-in-law and her children called me ‘Amma’. We had been planning the robbery for long. Saturday night we went to Dolly’s house and also had tea there. Sonu later locked them in a room and he first shot dead the teenaged girl and then Dolly.

The MC has also deployed 99 vehicles for villages and some commercial areas of the city. However, even after a month and a half, residents complain of a plethora of problems with the civic body’s attempt.Also, the MC had invited informal garbage collectors to register with it and join the vehicles as helpers. However, a section is still opposing the MC takeover and staging protest outside its office for the past more than a month.Rajesh Kalia, who is a former mayor and chairs the MC sanitation committee, said: “More than 80% garbage collectors have agreed to join MC vehicles. In a couple of days we will even start signing of memorandums of understanding with individual garbage collectors.”Kalia said the garbage collectors will be share the total number of houses covered by them at present, based upon which the share of user charges collected from residents will be directly deposited into their bank accounts.All’s not well with MC takeoverWhile in some areas, the MC has been able to smoothen the operations, residents in most sectors complain that the situation is yet to improve.Supriya Goyal, treasurer, resident welfare association, Sector 28A, said: “Currently, most people in our locality are giving garbage to cart-driven waste lifters, as the MC vehicle does come, but it has no fixed time.”In most sectors, residents say MC vehicles and cart-based collectors come to pick the garbage and it is creating confusion as to who should be paid user charges. The MC has issued public notices declaring that it would add user charges in the water bills.“Whoever comes first takes away the garbage. We don’t know whom to pay the charges. As the informal garbage collectors are working, they can’t be denied their dues,” said Surender Sharma, president, RWA, Sector 15.Kuldip Singh Gill, president, Bright RWA, Sector 21B, said: “Nowadays, MC vehicles are parked at a central location in the sector. Informal garbage collectors lift the waste from houses and then dump it in the MC vehicle. When the MC is not picking garbage directly from houses, then why should it demand user charges?”Residents also complain that even though the MC promised garbage collection from houses, particularly on the first and second floor, yet it is not being properly implemented. Working couples and elderly people are at the receiving end.“The MC is not yet ready to implement the project all over the city. It is struggling to implement it effectively even in Sectors 1 to 30, where the population density is low. With only around 450 vehicles for the entire city, the civic body would struggle,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation.The mayor said all the issues of residents and protesting garbage collectors will be resolved soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/segregated-waste-collection-across-chandigarh-in-a-week-101612721030139.html
07-02-2021||Noida||Woman, 16-yr-old girl shot dead during robbery in Ghaziabad; two suspects arrested||Ghaziabad: A 32-year-old woman was shot dead and her three minor children were seriously injured during a robbery incident at their house in the Saraswati Vihar locality on Saturday night. The children’s tutor, a 16-year-old girl, was also killed by the suspects, police said. Hours after the incident, the Ghaziabad police arrested a 35-year-old woman and her 25-year-old male friend for the double murder and robbery, senior officials said, adding that cash and jewellery were recovered from the two suspects. Police have also recovered the pistol that was allegedly used in the crime.The deceased were identified as Dolly Thakur and Anshu Kumari, who was also Dolly’s former tenant, police said. The suspects have been identified as Uma Singh, a resident of Lal Quarter area of Ghaziabad, and her friend Mohammad Sonu, a native of Badaun who stayed in the same locality. Police said that the female suspect is a distant relative of the deceased woman and she, along with her friend, hatched a conspiracy to rob the victims. Police said that Uma and Sonu visited Dolly’s house at Saraswati Vihar, which comes under the Masuri police station area, around 8.30pm on Saturday. Dolly was in the house with her three minor children while Anshu, a resident of the same locality, was teaching the children. Police said that Anshu was a student of class 9 at a private school in Ghaziabad. “The two suspects entered the house of the victim (Dolly Thakur) where they had tea and then overpowered those present in a room at gunpoint. Sonu shot Dolly in the abdomen and the tutor in the head. Thereafter, he inflicted severe injuries to Dolly’s three minor children with a knife and grinding stone. Leaving them for dead, both fled the house,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). Dolly’s three children -- twin girls, Gauri and Minakshi aged nine years, and son Rudra aged five years -- suffered severe injuries, but survived, police said. The incident came to fore when Dolly’s husband, Mahesh Thakur, and her father-in-law returned from their work around 9.30pm on Saturday. They run an eatery joint at Chopla Market in Ghaziabad and had shifted to their current residence at Saraswati Vihar during Diwali last year. “The suspect woman had estranged relations with her husband who now stays in Aligarh. She had come to know that Thakurs were planning to sell their house and received some initial amount while their business was also doing well. So, she planned the robbery with her friend,” said a police officer investigating the case. Mahesh Thakur, Dolly’s husband, said, “The suspect woman is in our relation. We had no enmity with her, and she was trying to get money with the help of her friend. She had come two days ago to our shop and also enquired about the shop’s opening/closing timings. She knew that we will be at the shop during that time. They took away about ₹5 lakh in cash and some jewellery items from our house.” Police deployed five teams to trace the suspects after Dolly’s family lodged a complaint against unidentified persons for murder, attempt to murder and robbery. “The most important clue was given by one of the two girls who told that ‘Amma’ had visited the house. The children used to call the suspect woman with this name. When we visited her house, she was present and revealed the plot to us,” the SP said. “Meanwhile, her friend (suspect Sonu) was trying to flee the city and was spotted near Dasna by one of the police teams. He opened fire at police personnel and sustained an injury to his leg in a retaliatory firing by police,” Raja said, adding that the case will be fast tracked in court and testimony of children will be of prime importance against the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/woman-16-yr-old-girl-shot-dead-during-robbery-in-ghaziabad-two-suspects-arrested-101612721028653.html

Mumbai recorded an overall air quality index (AQI) of 173 on Sunday, which was in the moderate category. Over the past two weeks, the air quality had persisted in the poor category. On Saturday the AQI was 210. The AQI of Mumbai is calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. “Rising temperatures and breeze from the sea have cleared up the air in and around Mumbai. It is likely to remain in the moderate category for two to three days,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR. Of the 10 locations, Mazgaon had the worst air quality with an AQI of 303, followed by Andheri with an AQI of 269 and Malad with AQI of 249. Meanwhile, the city woke up to a warm morning. On Sunday, the Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 22 degrees Celsius, 4.5 degrees above normal. At Colaba, the minimum temperature rose from 19.8 degrees Celsius on Saturday to 22.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday, 2.7 degrees above normal. Maximum temperatures, too, remained on the higher side on Sunday, with Santacruz recording 34.6 degrees Celsius, 3.5 degrees above normal. At Colaba, the maximum temperature was 33.6 degrees Celsius, 3.7 degrees above normal. “The minimum and maximum temperatures remained high on Sunday owing to warm easterly winds and the delayed setting of sea breeze. As the sea breeze set in late on Saturday, minimum temperatures also remained high as the air couldn’t cool off well enough,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-air-quality-improves-on-sunday-as-temperatures-rise-101612720729331.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||50-year-old man arrested by Mumbai Police for robbing mother’s gold||Mulund police arrested a man for allegedly threatening and robbing his 70-year-old mother of her gold ornaments and then advising her to file a fake police complaint claiming that two persons hypnotised her and stole her jewellery when she went out shopping. The offence came to light when the mother registered a complaint with the police but could not offer a sold story during the investigation. She then revealed the truth and police registered a case of robbery against her son and arrested him.According to police, the arrested accused, Hitendra Rathod, 51, lives in Thakurli, Kalyan, while his mother and his two younger brothers live in Sarvodaya Nagar, Mulund. Rathod used to come to visit his mother often, and as per her complaint, he allegedly took money from his mother on several occasions.Last month, when Rathod demanded more money from his mother, she refused to give him any, stating that he had taken all her savings. Rathod allegedly threatened his mother and snatched her 25gm gold ornaments worth ₹1 lakh, said a police officer. Later, he realised that if his two other brothers found out about the theft they would create an issue. Hence, he decided to cook up a fake theft, added the officer.Rathod asked his mother to make up a false story and file a police complaint. “His mother then approached the Mulund police station on January 23 and submitted a false story alleging that two people stopped her when she was out shopping and after hypnotising her, they took her gold ornaments,” said Santosh Kamble, assistant inspector, Mulund police station.The mother could not hide the truth for long, and she later revealed the facts. “As per her statement, we registered a case on charges of robbery and arrested Rathod on January 3. He is currently in police custody,” said Kamble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/50yearold-man-arrested-by-mumbai-police-for-robbing-mother-s-gold-101612720669318.html
07-02-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand flood: Raini villagers had raised alarm before HC around 2 years ago||Nearly two years ago, residents of Raini villagers told Uttarkhand High Court that the construction of the Rishi Ganga hydel project could cause huge damage to them. On Sunday, their worst fears came true.The entire hydel project, just a few meters from their homes, was washed away in the sudden flash flood triggered by a glacial lake burst. The incident claimed about seven lives while another 170 are feared missing.The huge pile of muck which was not disposed upstream of the project, as per environmental norms, came gushing down with water creating havoc in the region. “The only bridge connecting the village separated by the river has also been washed away,” said Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. Four other bridges in the area are also gone.In the summer of 2019, the villagers had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Uttarakhand High Court which directed the state government to check what was going on in Raini village of Chamoli concerning the construction of the hydel project.Also read: Night ops to continue in Uttarakhand, says ITBP; alert in UPThe High Court had directed the district magistrate of Chamoli and member secretary state pollution control board to constitute a joint team to inspect the Rishi Ganga Hydroelectric Project site in the district concerning the allegations levelled in the PIL and the impact on the environment and the locals due to the blasting and the stone crushing activity. The court had also stayed the blasting in the project area till further orders.The project site in Raini village area falls under Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, just a few kilometres from Nanda Devi National Park. The protagonist of the Chipko movement, legendary Gaura Devi hails from Raini village and it was in this area where she had started the Chipko movement in March 1973.The PIL was filed by one Kundan Singh on behalf of the scheduled tribe villagers from the village. The PIL alleged that stone crushing and blasting activities in the terrain there caused wild animals to flee and enter Raini village.The Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project (RGHEP) is a run-of-river hydroelectric project proposed for the development on the Rishiganga river, a tributary of the Alaknanda River in the Chamoli district. The project site is located close to the Raini village, approximately 27 kilometres from Joshimath.River Alaknanda and its tributaries, which flow through Chamoli, Rudraprayag, and Pauri Garhwal districts, have been dammed at many points. Some of the main hydel power projects (HEP) on Alaknanda and its tributaries include Rishiganga HEP, Vishnuprayag HEP (400 MW) near Joshimath, Peepal Koti HEP (444 MW) near Peepal Koti, Srinagar HEP (330 MW) and Tapovan Vishnuprayag HEP (520 MW).Several environmentalists, such as Bharat Jhunjunwala and Ravi Chopra of People’s Science Institute, had objected to back-to-back dams in Uttarakhand saying it was killing river Ganga and the local ecology. “Anyone can come and blast the hills here for building a hydel project in name of development. Nobody cares for ecology and impact of its devastation on the locals,” Chopra said, adding that several Supreme Court orders have highlighted the devastation being caused. “Today’s incident is just another example of what we have done to our hill ecology,” he said.Abhijay Negi, counsel of Raini village, said the project proponents of Rishi Ganga project since 2005 started practising environmentally hazardous activities such as stone crushing on the river bed and undertook blasting in the terrain there that forced wild animals to flee from the adjoining Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve and enter Raini village.In 2019, he said, the matter of muck removal near Raini village also came up in the hearing. “The deputy advocate general appearing for the state requested that the matter be taken up on August 1, 2019, to enable him to ascertain whether any action has been initiated against the respondent no.6 (Rishiganga Power project) for their failure to clear the muck stored near the barrage and powerhouse,” the July 2019 order stated.Negi said that villagers of Raini village had raised an alarm much in advance, warning that things were not fine in their area. Even the court issued two orders, but nothing much was done by the government. “I got a call from my petitioner in Raini village telling me that what we had been worried has finally come true and Nature has replied to the apathy of the government,” he said.Officials said it was too early to estimate the damage caused to hydel projects at Raini village and Tapovan where the NTPC is building 530 MW project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-flood-raini-villagers-had-raised-alarm-before-hc-around-2-years-ago-101612720348122.html

Delhi’s EV Policy especially focuses on incentivizing the purchase of two wheelers, which comprise two-third of all vehicles in Delhi and cause maximum pollution. Incentives up to ₹30,000 can be availed upon the purchase of two-wheelers listed under the policy along with scrapping incentives,” said Gahlot in a statement.He further said, “Under Delhi’s EV policy, 23 two-wheeler models are available and eligible for purchase and scrapping incentives across seven manufacturers. By switching to electric two-wheelers which have very low operating costs, an individual can make annual saving of approximately ₹22,000 as compared to using petrol scooter and ₹20,000 as compared to a petrol bike. An average electric two-wheeler provides a life time savings of 1.98 tonnes of carbon emissions as compared to an average petrol two wheelers, which is equivalent to planting 11 trees.”‘Switch Delhi’ will be an eight-week campaign to sensitise Delhi residents about the benefits of switching to electric vehicle, Gahlot added.While launching the campaign on Thursday, Kejriwal had said that his government will, in the next six months, change its policy to lease only electric cars as part of an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric cars in the city. On Friday, Delhi’s power minister Satyendar announced that the government floated a tender to set up 500 EV charging points across 100 locations in the city in the next one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-focuses-on-two-wheeler-evs-in-first-week-of-switch-delhi-campaign-101612720489775.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||68-year-old alleges police harassment, seeks Bombay HC intervention in ‘false’ drug case||A senior citizen from Sion Koliwada has approached the Bombay high court (HC) seeking constitution of a special team to investigate “false” allegations against her after she and her daughter were arrested by Pune’s Bhosari police under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The woman was charged for allegedly being in possession of 320gm of brown sugar (poor quality heroin). The senior citizen has submitted that while the police allow notorious drug suppliers to operate, people like her are harassed, and are not given a hearing. The HC has asked the state to respond to the petition. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing a petition filed by Kala Rani Perisami Devendra, was informed by her advocate Anand Jondhale that the petitioner was a senior citizen residing and operating a small tobacco shop at Sion Koliwada. The petition was filed after Devendra was falsely implicated by Bhosari police station, Pune, on March 23, 2019, for possession of narcotics substances. The petition claimed that Devendra’s daughter, who was also taken into custody when the senior citizen was picked up, was let off the next day after she paid a large sum to the police team to not be implicated in the case. In light of these allegations, and the fact that police failed to take action against bigwigs like those involved in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, the petitioner sought an investigation into the alleged crime by a special investigation team (SIT) of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers, so that the facts of the case are unearthed and informed to the court. After the court was informed by the state that the petition had not been served on them, HC directed Jondhale to serve the same with tangible proof of service. The petition is expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/68yearold-alleges-police-harassment-seeks-bombay-hc-intervention-in-false-drug-case-101612720489293.html

07-02-2021||Other||A Delhi village that celebrates Subhas Chandra Bose like no other||New Delhi: It is a balmy afternoon and Ran Singh is sitting in the courtyard of his house. The octogenarian’s eyes sparkle as one mentions Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. “ I was in class 3rd when Netaji delivered an impassioned speech in our village, his fist clenched, his hand pushed forward like this,” he says, standing up and striking a pose similar to that of many Netaji statues. “You will not get azadi until you make supreme sacrifices,” he told the villagers. Ask Singh about the year Bose came to the village and he goes silent for a while, trying to dredge up his memory, his eyes closed, and then says, “ I think it was 1944.” Singh is not the only one with a Netaji story in Tikri Kalan, a village on the western fringes of the city, which celebrates Subhas Chandra Bose like no other. Locals believe that Netaji delivered his last known speech in India in their village, though no one seems to know the year when he did so. While some say that Netaji visited the village in 1941 when he travelled to Berlin incognito via Peshawar; others claim that Netaji addressed INA (Indian National Army) soldiers in 1944 in their village—both the possibilities not supported by historical facts. “This is local folklore which cannot be historically substantiated. The only INA soldiers who came back to India in 1945 were the PoWs (prisoners of war) taken by the Allied Forces largely in Burma (now Mynamar). By then the real story of the INA, founded originally by Captain Mohan Singh and later revived by Bose, was over,” says Anirudh Deshpande, a historian who has authored many books on Indian military history. He adds that Netaji making a stopover in the village in 1941, when he escaped from his home in Kolkata to Berlin via Peshawar, too is highly improbable. “Because Bose escaped house arrest incognito and travelled straight to Peshawar from where he crossed into Afghanistan prior to his escape with the help of Italians. He would not have risked getting off at Delhi to address a village.” But the lack of historical evidence has not come in the way of Tikri village flaunting its ‘historical relationship’ with Netaji. The village organises a gala full-day event on his birth anniversary on January 23 that includes rousing speeches, cultural events and blood donation camps inspired by Netaji’s iconic slogan tum mujhe khoon do, main tumhe azadi doonga, his pictures adorn houses and shops, elderly women in the village sing folk songs in Haryanvi hailing Netaji and make and distribute sweets. The village prefers to call itself ‘Azad Hind Gram’, also the name of a six-acre complex in the village that houses a museum to INA and a memorial to Subhas Chandra Bose, built by the Delhi government. “We love Netaji like no other national leader and live by his ideals and that is what has earned us the sobriquet of Azad Hind Gram,” says Balwan Singh, a para Asian Games medalist, pointing to a small bronze statue of Netaji on his desk. Every year, he organises Netaji Subhas cross country race in the village. The walls of this mostly urbanised village — though dozens of families here are still engaged in agriculture -- are plastered with posters of the recent 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Bose at Azad Hind Gram. The Netaji memorial, the villagers say, is built on the spot where Netaji had delivered his speech under a tree. Before the memorial was built in 2000, the locals had been organising a ‘havan’ on the spot every year on January 23 , Bose’s birth anniversary. This year too, the villagers organised a mega full-day programme to celebrate mark his birthday. “Funded by the villagers, it is one of the biggest programmes organised anywhere in the country to celebrate Netaji’s birthday,” says Jaipal Drall, who heads a village committee which organises the annual event. “We revere all national leaders, but Netaji holds a special place in our hearts as our elders told us he had visited our village and gave a speech here.” Like most villagers, Yashpal Drall, president of village RWA, was quite amused by the recent controversy where people tweeted a picture of a portrait of Bose unveiled in the Rashtrapati Bhawan claiming it showed actor Prosenjit Chatterjee from a film in which he played the national leader, and not Netaji. “Netaji is the most recognisable national leader here; not even a child can fail to recognise him,” he says. He too has his own Netaji story, which again defies history. “Many village women had donated their jewellery for the INA.” He proudly adds that the village is home to many families whose members had served in the INA. One of them is the family of late Sube Singh. The wall of the house has ‘freedom fighter Sube Singh INS Veteran’, scrawled in big bold letters. Sunita Devi, the daughter of Sube Singh, brings out a sheaf of documents, including certificates of service issued by All India INA Enquiry And Relief Committee set up by the Congress, confirming his date of joining the INA in 1941. “We would not have got freedom without Netaji,” she says, then breaks into a song in Haryanvi in praise of Bose. Sunita Devi, has, in fact, learnt by heart several songs hailing the leader. On his birth anniversary, she makes and distributes kheer . “This has been a tradition in our house for almost seven decades now; earlier my mother used to do it, and now I do so.” Not far away from her house lives another INA veteran, late Sarup Singh’s family. Like most elderly villagers, her 103- year- old wife recounts the story of the Netaji’s visit to the village, adding that her husband served in INA in Singapore. “I had been married only for a couple of years when he left and villagers said that he would not return. But thankfully, he did come back after six years, ” says the centenarian sitting on a charpoy in the open courtyard of her house surrounded by her family, including great-grandchildren. Age may have shriveled her figure but has failed to dampen her enthusiasm for Bose stories. Like Sunita Devi, she too has a whole repertoire of Netaji songs. What villagers regret most is the pathetic state of Azad Hind Gram, built, they say, on their demand by the government to honour Netaji and as a symbol of their relationship with him. It boasts a domed Dilli Chalo Museum to the Indian National Army. The musty hall’s discoloured walls are hung with pictures of related historical events such as INA trials, INA’s March to Delhi, women’s role in INA and a provisional government of Azad Hind. The sprawling complex, painted in peach, also has a Netaji memorial in another hall, where rusting iron gate has almost come off its hinges. Inside, the walls have relief sculptures in black telling the story of different episodes in Bose’s life. None of the exhibits, though, has any mention of Netaji’s visit to the village. “The place hardly has any visitors and has been financially unviable. This location was chosen because locals believe that Netaji had delivered a speech in the village. We are trying to get a grant from the government for the renovation of the complex. Hopefully, we will be able to do so during the Bose’s 125 birth anniversary celebrations,” says Sanjay Goel, managing director and CEO, Delhi Tourism. It is evening, and Yashpal is in the Azad Hind Gram complex, offering to give us a guided tour. “ This is where Netaji had stood on a platform under a tree to deliver his speech,” he says, pointing to a corner. “We all bow before the Netaji statue in the complex every time we pass||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-delhi-village-that-celebrates-subhas-chandra-bose-like-no-other-101612720248784.html

The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and hit back, accusing AAP leaders of going on foreign trips on government’s expense.While the AAP is in power in the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three MCDs.“Several BJP councillors including Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, mayors and officials have taken several trips inside and outside India on MCD’s expense. On one hand, employees of the BJP-ruled MCDs are starving because they have not been paid salaries and on the other hand BJP leaders are using MCD funds for their trips,” said Pathak in a press conference at the party’s head office in central Delhi.He said, “The AAP demands that the BJP-ruled MCD must publish a white paper declaring all such trips taken by the BJP councillors or mayors within 48 hours and set up a probe into the matter.”Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the allegations were baseless. He said it was an attempt by the AAP to malign the image of BJP-ruled MCDs.In a statement issued later, the BJP said, “Trips by ministers of Delhi government or mayors of MCDs to other cities is a normal protocol affair. The fact of the matter is that the Delhi government is bearing expenses of many political tours of AAP ministers including Manish Sisodia to several states like Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand under the garb of study tours of schools in those states. MCDs are in deep financial crunch due to Arvind Kejriwal government’s withholding funds since 2020.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said two trips taken in 2018 and 2019 by former MCD mayors were marked as “disputed”. “Here, it is pertinent to mention that in 2018-19, the then-mayor got the permission and financial clearance to attend a conference in London which he himself cancelled in view of hefty expenses… Mr Pathak is misleading people with his claims that there are several such unpaid trips in the last financial year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-bjp-accused-lock-horns-over-tours-by-party-leaders-101612720189111.html

While no person was injured, firefighters said at least six animals were killed in the fire. A truck parked nearby was also gutted in the blaze. The Delhi Fire Services (DFS) said the cause of the blaze is yet to be established.The fire broke out around 2.30am, when the DFS received a distress call reporting the incident. Senior officials said seven fire tenders were initially rushed to the spot to contain the fire, but as the blaze was in a cluster, 19 more were used to prevent it from spreading and to douse it completely.DFS director Atul Garg said firefighters who reached the spot found that a truck parked nearby had been burnt. “The blaze was controlled after two hours, but the cooling operation continued till morning. While no person was injured, six animals were found dead in the fire,” Garg said.He said the cause of fire is not yet established, but is believed to have sparked from a stove or a brazier lit inside one of the slum clusters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/40-slum-clusters-gutted-after-blaze-in-sanjay-colony-none-hurt-101612720188569.html

Senior officers who declined to be named identified the man as Sukhdev Singh, “a prominent face” among those who were involved in the violence and vandalism at the fort. Last week, the police announced ₹50,000 for any info leading to Singh’s arrest. Singh, 59, a resident of Karnal in Haryana, was arrested in connection with the first case registered on January 27, after the violent clashes between the farmer groups and police at the Red Fort on Republic Day. He has been charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including attempt to murder, rioting, dacoity, theft and under Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act and under Arms Act for illegal possession of weapon.Investigators said they have identified various people involved in the violence through pictures, video footage from the local residents and the media; and CCTV camera recordings from the fort and nearby areas.“Singh was one of them. He has been identified as a farmer leader. He was seen leading a group of violent protesters inside the Red Fort premises. He was identified as one of the prominent faces behind the violence after which search for him was initiated and a cash reward was announced on information that may lead to his arrest. From the evidence gathered, it was also established that he had spent ample time inside the Red Fort on January 26,” the investigator said.The police are awaiting response from Google after they had written to the technology firm on Friday seeking assistance in identifying the author/creator of a “toolkit” or document, which allegedly detailed an action plan for online and offline protests associated with the ongoing farmers’ agitation. The investigators said any concrete progress in the probe is only possible when Google helps with the IP addresses and details of the two e-mail accounts, through which the toolkit was created. The police are also trying to get details of the Instagram account mentioned on the original toolkit, through which a live session was screened, they said. The Delhi Police have also issued notices to nine people from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh to join investigation into the violence at the fort. The notices were issued under 12 different sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act.The notices were issued in cases registered at eas Delhi’s Pandav Nagar police station and Seemapuri police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-from-chandigarh-arrested-for-violence-at-red-fort-on-republic-day-101612720129669.html

Food vans will be approved for places where space is available and footfall is abundant. A proposal for allowing food trucks had been passed by the north civic body last month.Officials of north civic body said that other than increasing revenue of the municipality, the initiative will also create jobs for a lot of unemployed youths. A senior official of the north corporation said that modalities of the scheme are yet to be worked out. The official, however, said that other than issuing licences to existing food carts, people belonging to economically weaker sections would be given preference and discount in setting up their food business in empty lands of the municipality. Mayor of north corporation, Jai Prakash, said that there are a number of eateries already functioning at different locations in north Delhi but the civic body does not get any revenue from such establishments. “This scheme will pave a way to legalise such food carts after paying a licence fee, which will be decided later. Other than this, we will also promote setting up food vans in empty lands of the civic body at various locations in north Delhi. We will allocate these food vans to those people whose annual family income is less than ₹25,000. We will provide them special discounts to set up movable eateries in empty lands and at places where footfall is high,” Prakash said. He said that officials have been given instructions to start a survey to identify empty lands and places where such food vans can be set up in the jurisdiction of north corporation. “Though the fee for the licence is yet to be decided but it is likely to be kept dynamic, which means that those who wish to set up their food vans in busy markets or at prime locations, will have to pay slightly higher prices for a licence. People belonging to EWS category with less than ₹25,000 annual income are likely to get a nearly 25% discount,” the mayor said. A senior official of the north corporation also said that applicants will have to produce a no-objection-certificate from the traffic police as well as from the road owning authority if they wish to set up food carts on any road side. “Initially, we are planning to allow one to two food vans per ward. But this number can be increased later if required. This move will create employment for weaker section and they will not have to pay illegally to any other agency or local authorities. This initiative will also help the civic body in augmenting its revenue collection and make it financially stable,” the official said. A similar move was passed by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in the beginning of this year. In its proposal the south civic body had proposed that it would provide licences to five smart food eateries, including food trucks, vans, e-carts in each municipal ward in its jurisdiction.KS Mehra, former commissioner of the unified MCD, said that the initiative will help in boosting revenue of the corporations.“It is a very good move and such efforts are required to be taken by the authorities to augment revenue collection, especially when it is undergoing a huge financial crisis. This initiative will bring additional funds to the corporation as illegally running food vans will be brought under the tax net of the MCD,” Mehra said.He added that the civic body should ensure that all areas are tapped under the scheme for maximum revenue realisation. However, the National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) said they were against the proposal. Arbind Singh, national coordinator NASVI, criticised the move and termed it “anti-street vendors”.Singh said that the civic body was yet to implement Street Vendors Act 2014, which speaks about regulation and welfare of the street vendors.“It is an effort to snatch livelihood from the street food vendors. Through allocation of e-food carts and other such special type of eateries, the municipality only wants backdoor entry of capitalists. They should first regulate the existing street food vendors who set up roadside stalls . They should implement Street Vendors Act 2014,” he said. Singh added that the clause of giving priority and discount to EWS people “merely seems to be a lip service”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/north-civic-body-to-give-permanent-licences-to-food-vans-e-food-carts-101612720129109.html

In the second phase, an estimated two million frontline workers were to be vaccinated, and that also began at many places in the country on February 2. After completion of the first and second phase, the third phase will begin wherein everyone above 50 will be vaccinated. It may not be possible to provide an exact date, but it is likely that the process will begin anytime in the second, third or fourth week of March,” said Harsh Vardhan. In Delhi, around 240,000 health workers and 450,000 front line workers have so far registered for the vaccination programme. Of these, 109,478 have so far received their first doses of the coronavirus vaccines, according to government records.“The protocols and deadlines have seen several changes since the vaccination drive was launched on January 16. We are now capable of vaccinating multiple priority groups at the same time, as against the earlier plan in which specific windows were charted out for each group one after another. The provision to allow out-of-turn shots to registered beneficiaries is helping increasing turnout across the country,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.The official added, “Considering all these factors, at this stage, we expect to start with the vaccination of the third category by mid-March. The Centre’s approval will be required for this. The matter was taken up in few meetings over the last two weeks. Registrations for eligible beneficiaries in third category are likely to be open on the CoWin app from March 1.”The government has so far estimated that 4.2 million in Delhi are aged over 50, a number arrived at largely through the use of electoral rolls. Government officials are still ascertaining the number of people with comorbidities through survey findings, departmental data and hospital records.Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department, Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination task force for India, said: “The more people across different categories get vaccinated in the early stages, the better it is. Covid management will become much easier for potential spikes in futures and mutant strains. Also, there will be less burden on the health care infrastructure system. At this stage, several states are preparing to start with vaccination of the elderly and those with comorbidities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-vaccine-jabs-for-people-aged-above-50-likely-from-midmarch-101612720128578.html
07-02-2021||Other||No net, no problem: How farmers at Delhi borders worked their way around internet shutdowns||New Delhi: A day after farmers organised a nationwide “chakka jam” for three hours on national highways demanding the repeal of the three new farm laws and protesting the arrests of farmers, frequent internet shutdowns and barricading at the agitation spots, farmers at Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur said network connectivity had improved on Sunday. However, the Internet blackouts made it difficult for protesters to access and disseminate information, and stay in touch with their families across Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh, forcing agitators to devise workarounds to ensure information flowed unrestricted.Internet services at Delhi’s borders were suspended following the violence that ensued during the tractor parade on January 26. Following this, internet connectivity at agitation spots remained poor. Another set of orders were passed to snap the services between 11pm on January 29 (when a group of persons claiming to be locals had entered the protest area and clashed with locals) till February 2. Another ban was imposed on February 6, when farmers undertook their chakka jam, but Internet services were restored at midnight that day.Gurjant Singh (36), a resident of Bari village in Mohali, who returned to the Singhu protest site on Sunday after spending three days in his village said his family was relieved after he shared messages on WhatsApp with them.“Following the Republic Day violence, it became difficult to stay in touch with my family, who want to know what is happening here. There are so many rumours floating around but we can’t counter them because we don’t even have Internet access. We tried to get a WiFi connection, but internet service providers told us that the authorities were not allowing new connections at Singhu,” he said.In the absence of mobile internet, the only source of current information was around 5,000 copies of regional newspapers, which were paid for by the organisers. Even the press conferences by farmer groups that were broadcast live on social media platforms, had to be first recorded and then uploaded later using WiFi hot spots set up by some farmer groups nearly a month ago. Several volunteers at the protest site travelled a few kilometres away from the protest spot to get connectivity and access news of the day using social media.Sukhwinder Singh, 28, a farmer from Roopnagar district in Punjab who volunteers at the library-cum-cultural centre at Singhu border, said, “Some of us have motorcycles, so we travelled to an area where we could get network and access news on the protests. There are a few areas at the protest spot where we could access WiFi that locals residents had opened up for us to use.”“After collecting the information, we passed the messages on verbally during our evening dialogue sessions, when farmers from various trolleys would gather at our centre,” he added.Volunteers from their team are also visiting various districts of Punjab, including Bhatinda, Patiala, Roopnagar, and Anantpur Sahib to get inputs from the villages, and to provide them verified information related to the protests.Sukhwinder also said that the farmers largely relied on social media platforms for verified information after several instances of alleged “biased coverage by media outlets” during the past two months.“Social media has been the only way for these families to get correct information. The more the government tries to suppress us, the more ways we will find to keep the movement alive,” he said.Jatinder Pal Singh, 27, a resident of Mohali who is a security volunteer at Singhu, said, “We have arranged for tractors and other vehicles with loudspeakers that share information with the other protesters towards the end of the day as not all farmers come to the stage area daily.Showing his notebook which carried names of international celebrities who recently led support to the farmers’ movement on social media, Singh said, “We had to devise alternative techniques to raise awareness, spread information, and quell rumours in the absence of the internet, which had so far empowered farmers to stay updated on their own.”Navkiran Natt, 29, a student-activist at Tikri border and also one of the editors of Trolley Times (a bi-weekly newspaper started by activists to share information on farmers’ protests) said the mobile internet ban had affected their work as well.“Since most of the volunteers stay at the protest sites, it was difficult to coordinate, and our edition was delayed because of the Internet shutdowns. In the absence of other platforms, we too used open-jeeps to circulate information among protesters to counter panic as well.”While the situation remained peaceful at the three borders on Sunday, heavy security deployment continued at the agitation spots. “We are continuing our protest peacefully. No untoward incident was witnessed here today. Our fight against the three black farm laws will continue as more people from Punjab and Haryana are expected to join us from tomorrow (Monday),” said Darshan Singh, a farmer leader from Punjab who has been camped at Tikri border.The crowd at Ghazipur, however, was thinner in comparison to the previous days, as several protesters had accompanied farmer leader Rakesh Tikait who was in Charkhi Dadri for a mahapanchayat along with farmer leaders Darshan Pal and Balbir Singh Rajewal.Thousands had gathered at the mahapanchayat where farmer leaders passed five resolutions including demands of repealing the three farm laws, a legal guarantee of MSP, and releasing farmers arrested following January 26 violence and vehicles seized after the incident.(With inputs from Ashish Mishra and Anvit Srivastava)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-net-no-problem-how-farmers-at-delhi-borders-worked-their-way-around-internet-shutdowns-101612720069688.html

The agitation descended into chaos as farmers broke barriers while deviating from the approved routes, clashed with the police and vandalised property at Red Fort. The notices were issued in cases registered at eas Delhi’s Pandav Nagar police station and Seemapuri police station. Among those who were issued notices are Desh khap’s thambedar (local chief) Chaudhary Brijpal Singh, Baljor Singh Arya of Malakpur village, Vishwas Chaudhary, who runs a school in Baraut, former Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) MLA Veerpal Rathi, councillor Ashutosh Tomar, and Vinod of Khera village, said officials who declined to be named. Arya said that the police may be targeting those who were leading the protest but were not actively involved in the violence. “If they want to do an investigation, then they should come here to verify facts,” said Arya. “I will not go there and send a reply to them,” he said.Chaudhary Brijpal Singh said that he was at a dharna in Baghpat district on January 26 and flagged off tractors with instructions to reach either the Ghazipur border or the Singhu border. “I don’t know on what basis they have sent me the notice,” he said.Vishwas Chaudhary said he has filed the response to the notice through his lawyer. He also said that the thambedar was with him on January 26 and it seems that notices were issued to those who were active in the Baraut dharna which started on December 17 and dispersed by the police on January 26 night.“It seems the list was provided to the police without verification,” said Chaudhary.Farmers, who were staging an indefinite dharna along the Delhi-Saharanpur highway in Baraut since December 17, were allegedly lathicharged by the police on January 26 night to disperse them from the protest site.Later, during a mahapanchayat convened by the Desh khap in Baraut on January 31 in protest against the lathicharge, additional district magistrate (Baghpat) Amit Kumar Singh and additional superintendent of police Manish Mishra regretted if anyone had been injured in the police act of removing protesters.

The assaulters blackened the face of the victim, Shirish Katekar, and paraded him on the streets.The police said they tried to stop the parade but were unsuccessful in their attempt.Justifying the attack, Sena leader from Solapur Purshottam Barde blamed Katekar for provoking Shiv Sainiks. “It was Katekar who used objectionable words against our chief. For Sena workers, Uddhavji is a revered figure and we will not tolerate anything said against him. We take responsibility for this attack and are ready to go to jail for our action,” said Barde.Katekar had, in his speech, said that Thackeray was unfit to rule the state. He also said that Thackeray had earlier claimed that he would make an ordinary Sena worker the CM, but later decided to assume power himself. The BJP called the incident a classic example of “jungle raj”. “No one is safe in this Sena rule. Anyone who criticises them has to face music as Sena workers have become arrogant and bash up their opponents even in the presence of police personnel.

The party sought the investigation to find out if the celebrities were pressure by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to take to social media in support of the Central government. State Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant is set to meet state home minister Anil Deshmukh with the demand of the probe. Sawant said he would hold a virtual meeting with Deshmukh on Monday demanding a thorough probe. “There is a similar pattern behind these tweets by the celebrities including Akshay Kumar, Sunil Sheety, sportspersons Sachin Tendulkar, Saina Nehwal. The contents of the tweets by Nehwal and Kumar are same while Shetty had tagged a BJP leader. This shows that there was a communication between the celebrities and the ruling party leaders. It needs to be investigated if there was any pressure from the BJP on these national heroes for such advocacy on the social media. If so, these celebrities need to be given more protection,” he said. Celebrities including Tendulkar, playback singer Lata Mangeshkar and hosts of Bollywood actors took to Twitter on February 3 after international personalities such as Rihanna and climate change activist Greta Thunberg expressed support for the farmers’ protest in Delhi. The tweets from the celebrities came with hashtags #IndiaAgainstPropaganda and #IndiaTogether, whih are framed by the ministry of external affairs. Maharashtra BJP’s media head Vishwas Pathak said, “These are dignitaries and have their independent views over international affairs.

He also had three mobile phones, one of which was exclusively used for stocks and shares transaction. His family members were unaware of the third phone. Dube had also taken ₹9 lakh as loan from his in-laws to invest, said Dattatray Shinde, superintendent of police (SP), Palghar on Sunday. “We still do not know the motive behind the murder. We have formed 10 teams to probe the matter,” he said.The colleague, who gave Dube the money, was allegedly asking him to return the money, following which Dube said he would pay back the amount through a cheque or online transaction. Dube, who was on leave, was allegedly went to Chennai on January 31 where he was kidnapped. He was then allegedly held captive for three days, following which he was brought to Gholwad in Palghar by three unidentified men. The three accused then poured petrol on him and set him on fire in Vaiji-Vejalpada jungle for refusing to give ₹10 lakh ransom. Locals found him in a burnt state, and admitted to a hospital. He died on Friday night while undergoing treatment at INS Aswini of the Indian Navy.His father Mithilesh, however, has claimed that did not receive any calls for ransom. In addition, bank account details of the victim revealed that he had only ₹392 in his two bank accounts. The money from the accounts were transferred to a share trading firm, said Shinde. Sources said that Dube had received 13 calls from a certain number asking him when he will fly to Chennai. He had also withdrawn ₹5,000 from an ATM in Chennai, and we are examining the CCTV footage from the spot to get some clues, said Shinde. Dube left Ranchi and reached Hyderabad by a night flight and then took another late night flight to reach Chennai airport from where he was kidnapped and eventually burnt alive in Gholwad jungles on Friday.According to Shinde, the victim was burnt alive atop a hill in the jungle. After suffering 90% burns, Dube climbed down the hill and sat on the roadside when he was spotted by locals in a charred state. Dube joined the Indian Navy in 2013 and was first posted at INS Chilika, Orissa and then transferred to Mumbai, and since 2019 was posted at INS Agrani, Coimbatore.“We are investigating all possible angles including whether the victim had self-staged the kidnapping and sought ₹10 lakh ransom so as to clear the financial mess and creditors,” said Shinde.“We have registered case under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 364 (kidnapping for ransom), 392 (robbery) of Indian Penal Code and Arms Act against unknown persons and are investigating further. The body has been sent for post mortem,” said a police officer, adding that they were also probing as to why the victim was brought to Gholwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/naval-sailor-who-was-burnt-alive-in-palghar-forest-had-taken-loans-say-cops-101612719049143.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Fungal infection on rise among those who recovered from Covid-19: Docs||Mumbai Among the complications emerging in individuals who have recovered from Covid-19 is a rare black fungal infection – mucormycosis – which causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and even death, if not treated in time, according to doctors, who are seeing a gradual surge in such cases across the city.A case in point could be Shaila Sonar, a resident of Dhule, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 on August 1. After fighting the virus for 15 days, she successfully recovered from the infection. But soon, she complained of pain in her mouth and developed a swelling. She dismissed it as cold and took treatment from a local doctor. When her condition deteriorated, in December, the family travelled to Mumbai in an ambulance and got her admitted to Global Hospital, Parel, on December 1. She was diagnosed to have sinonasal mucormycosis and surgery was the only option to save her. “The fungal infection had spread inside her mouth which infected her palate. To stop the spread of the infection, we had to partially remove the palate. Otherwise, it could have reached her brain and proved to be fatal,” said Dr Milind Navalakhe, senior consultant ENT surgeon at the hospital. However, it has her face disfigured and she will now require a plastic surgery after a few years. “We never thought that a fungal infection could cause such harm to my mother. Although she has recovered completely, she still has problems talking. Her pronunciation isn’t clear,” said her 20-year-old daughter Sakshi? Mahale. Sonar’s case is not an isolated one. Dr Amol Patil, senior consultant, ENT, at Nanavati Hospital had to remove the eye of a 30-year-old patient to clear the fungus that had infected his sinus – the small air pockets located behind forehead, nose, cheekbones, and in between the eyes. Later, doctors implanted the eye back. Patients who already have underlying conditions, like diabetes, are more susceptible to the infection. Dr Navalakhe said, “Mucormycosis is a fungal disease that usually occurs in patients with a compromised immune status. Within the past three months, around 50 Covid-19 recovered patients with low immunity and conditions such as diabetes or on steroids have been detected with the fungal infection.” It does not cause significantly different symptoms than a cold or nasal block. Initially, blackish discoloration on the inside of the nose and palate is seen. Hence, it goes unnoticed to an advanced stage. By the time patients seek medical attention, it is already in the advanced stage called sinonasal mucormycosis. For early diagnosis, the Global Hospital has recently launched Mumbai’s first Mucormycosis clinic. “Most patients came to us with sinus infection, but in advanced cases, we observed eye involvement causing vision loss and spread of the infection to the brain, with life threatening sequelae (after-effects of a disease),” said Dr Patil who has treated five Covid-19 recovered patients with mucormycosis in three months. According to the doctor, the infection kills tissues causing necrosis (death of a tissue). Treatment requires the removal of dead tissues and even the tissues surrounding it to curb the spread. Dr Ravikiran Vernekar, senior ENT surgeon at LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, said, “The most common presentation is a sinus infection that is accompanied by nasal congestion, nasal discharge and sinus pain.” “It is also necessary to get diabetes under control to reduce chances of infection,” said Dr Vasant Nagvekar, head of the department, infectious diseases, Global Hospital, Parel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fungal-infection-on-rise-among-those-who-recovered-from-covid-19-docs-101612718809060.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Soon, Mumbai civic body to inspect 13 shortlisted hospitals||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will start inspection of the 13 shortlisted private hospitals before granting final approval to innoculate the public with Covid-19 vaccines, on their premises in the third phase of the mass immunisation programme.Last month, the Association of Hospitals (AOH), a forum of private hospitals approached the civic body seeking permission to allow them to inoculate the public in their hospital premises. Following which a questionnaire seeking information about the infrastructural capacity required to run the mass vaccination programme was sent to private hospitals.As HT reported earlier, around 100 private hospitals filled up the online form showing interest to be part of the immunisation process of which 13 have been shortlisted. The list includes the major private hospitals like Bombay, Lilavati, Hinduja hospitals, among others.“In the form, we had asked them to submit details of their immunisation department. Depending on it, we have shortlisted 13 of them. Now, we will have to inspect the hospitals to cross-check if they have the adequate infrastructure to run the immunisation programme,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. “Only if they fulfil the criteria, approval will be granted.”However, hospitals haven’t been officially informed about the planned inspections. “We have got to know about it through the media, but we haven’t received any official confirmation from the civic body,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital who had initially approached BMC with the proposal.In the third phase, BMC will immunise the elderly above the age of 50 years. As per an initial estimation, over 30 lakh people are residing in Mumbai who falls into the category.“To make vaccination centres more accessible to the public, private hospitals will pay a key role,” said Dr Bhansali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/soon-mumbai-civic-body-to-inspect-13-shortlisted-hospitals-101612718329062.html
07-02-2021||Gurugram||HSVP to carry out large-scale drive against encroachments||Taking a cue from the department of town and country planning(DTCP), which has carried out large-scale demolition drives against illegal colonies in recent times, officials of Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) said that it will also start a similar concerted drive against illegal encroachments on its own land as well as against violations carried out by plot owners. As a part of this campaign, HSVP on Thursday removed encroachments from a vacant plot in Sector 52. The department also said that it has been able to make 1,000 plots free from litigation in sectors 52 to 57 and added that it will be removing encroachments from these plots as well. The authority has also asked allottees to take possession of their plots at the earliest. Vivek Kalia, estate officer 2, HSVP, said that a detailed survey was carried out last one month in which plots, green belts and sites owned by authority that have been encroached upon or illegally occupied were identified. “We have decided that properties owned by HSVP would be cleared from such encroachments on a priority basis. This week, we carried out anti-encroachment drives at two spots and will carry out more such drives in the coming weeks,” said Kalia. The authority has also asked the sector residents to share information regarding encroachments in their areas so that action can be taken against such violations. “The encroachments along the roads and on the green spaces would also be removed,” said Kalia.As part of this anti-encroachment drive, the enforcement team of HSVP removed illegal encroachments on its land in Sector 52, where a house was being constructed illegally, said officials. An enforcement team on Thursday stopped the construction work being carried out on the plot of land and sealed all the walls and gate of the plot. HSVP officials said that around 400 square yards of land adjacent to the plot was lying vacant but it was being encroached upon and a house was being constructed on it. Kalia said that the matter came to light when the owner of the adjacent plot constructed a house and applied for occupancy certificate. “The property has been sealed and detailed probe is being conducted into the registry and other documentation. We are probing this matter so that such incidents are not repeated,” he said. SK Rana, sub-divisional officer, HSVP, said that the site has been sealed as the structure was being built on HSVP property. The enforcement team of the authority also cleared a plot of land in Sector 46, on which a cow shelter was being operated illegally. Officials said that illegal shops had also been constructed at the site. HSVP official said that around 2,000 square yards plot was encroached upon for the last several years and the site was cleared from encroachments with the help of a large police team. Before taking action, the cows present at the shelter were shifted. The shops constructed on the site were also demolished along with other illegal structures, said officials. Officials added that they have also asked the police department to keep a close watch on the authority’s properties so that these plots are not encroached upon illegally. “We will work closely with residents’ welfare associations and the police department to identify and remove encroachments,” said Kalia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-to-carry-out-large-scale-drive-against-encroachments-101612717910406.html

He was later thrown out on an isolated stretch in Rewari, the police said.Robberies of passengers on the pretext of offering lifts have been a cause of concern for the police, especially at Iffco Chowk, Shankar Chowk and Rajiv Chowk, located along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, with more than a dozen people being arrested last year. However, the gangs seem to have resurfaced, the police said.The victim in the Wednesday’s incident, Ved Prakash, lives at a rented accommodation in Delhi’s Dwarka and works at a five-star hotel near Dronacharya Metro station. The police said that after completing his shift, Prakash left the hotel and flagged down a private car at Iffco Chowk around 1am on Feb 4. He asked the driver to drop him in Delhi, near the Dwarka crossing.“When he boarded a white car, four people, including the driver, were already inside. After driving a few kilometres, one of the passengers in the rear seat asked Prakash to sit in between, claiming that he was feeling suffocated and nauseated,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime).Prakash told the police that after a few kilometres, when the car reached the Rajokri underpass, the two men, seated to his left and right, held his hand and asked to hand over his belongings.“One of them took out my wallet from my rear pocket and snatched my mobile phone. All this happened while the driver ignored him and kept driving towards Rajasthan,” Prakash said in his complaint.The police said that the suspects took his debit and credit cards, assaulted him to make him reveal the PINs and also took ₹3,000 that was in his wallet.Sangwan said the victim could not resist the attempt as he couldn’t understand what was happening. “It all happened within a few minutes and I could not even retaliate,” Prakash wrote in his complaint.The accused then drove the car towards Rewari and pushed him out of car, after which he took public transport and reached home in Delhi. Prakash said he narrated his ordeal to his family members, following which he filed a case at the Sector 17/18 police station. He is still in trauma, said police.The police have lodged an FIR against four unidentified people under Section 379A (snatching) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/35yrold-executive-of-five-star-hotel-robbed-in-car-on-pretext-of-lift-101612717909738.html
07-02-2021||Gurugram||Over 15,000 turn up for mahapanchayat at Sunehra||Highlighting the need for communal harmony and amity among farmers agitating against the farm laws, farmer leaders from different states on Sunday addressed a crowd of over 15,000 people during a “mahapanchyat” at Sunehra, near the Haryana-Rajasthan border. The call for the mahapanchayat was given by the Meo community of Rajasthan and Haryana that has been protesting against the farm laws under a common banner since last December.Mahapanchayats or village gatherings are being held in various parts of the country against the backdrop of a call given by Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) Rakesh Tikait to strengthen the ongoing farmers’ agitation. Farmers across the country are protesting against the three farm laws that were passed in September last year. Farmers fear that the new laws will put an end to the maximum support price (MSP) for important crops and leave them open to exploitation by corporate interests.Sunday’s mahapanchayat was addressed by a host of farmer leaders and Congress MLAs from Nuh. These included BKU’s Gurnam Charuni, BKU general secretary Yudhvir Singh, farmer-leader Ghulam Mohammad Jola, Rakesh Tikait’s nephew, Gaurav Tikait, AIKSC’s Amra Ram and Bhim Army’s Chandrashekhar Azad, among others.Greeting the impressive crowd with “assalamualaikum” and “namaskar”, Charuni said the overwhelming turnout of people indicated that the farmers’ agitation would grow substantially in the coming days. He said that the government had unintentionally brought people from different communities together in the fight against the laws. “Today, Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs are standing together under a common banner of farmers,” he said.Calling the agitation against the three farm laws a fight for survival, he said, “The fight today is for livelihood. Our people will die if these laws are implemented. The government will take money from your pockets and give it to corporates. We need to defeat these law s together since hunger doesn’t see religion or caste.”Emphasizing the danger posed by the three laws, Charuni said that the laws will benefit corporates, whereas small shopkeepers will suffer. “Corporates are benefitting while the poor people are suffering,” said Charuni. Exhorting people to join the agitation, he said that the fight against the laws was a long one but needed to be seen to the end.Ghulam Mohammad Jola, a farmer leader from Muzaffarnagar, said that Mewat, a land of revolutionaries, was playing a crucial role in strengthening the farmers’ agitation. Jola, who quit BKU in the aftermath of 2013 Muzaffarnagar communal riots, recalled his recent meeting with Rakesh Tikait and said that the two communities have set aside their differences. “They invited us to the panchayat and now, we have set aside our differences. Muslims will make sacrifices and ensure that the three laws are defeated,” he said.Siddique Ahmed Meo, a social activist from Nuh, said that the mahapanchayat had been called to demonstrate that the people of Mewat stood in solidarity with the protesting farmers. He said while farmers from the Mewat region in Rajasthan and Haryana had been participating in a sit-in protest since the last month, Sunday’s mahapanchayat was the biggest gathering against the three laws in the region. “People from Mewat have been participating in various protests, including an indefinite sit-in protest. Today’s gathering will give a momentum to the protests. Farmers’ leaders from different states also appreciated the role being played by Meos in this historic movement,” said Meo.The mahapanchayat saw the participation of men and women from Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Maulana Arshad Meel, of Bharatpur in Rajasthan who had started the protest at the Haryana Rajasthan border and had given the call for the gathering, said, “The mahapanchayat today decided that our protests will continue till the three laws are rolled back. We will continue the ongoing protest at the Haryana-Rajasthan border.” Gaurav Tikait, the nephew of Rakesh Tikat, said that the farmers’ agitation would only end with the repeal of the three laws and implementation of the MS Swaminathan Committee report. Referring to the events that transpired on January 26, he said that genuine farmers would never disrespect the tricolour. “We can give our lives for the honour of the country. The government should go after those who hoisted the religious flag on the Red Fort and not all farmers,” said Tikait. He also emphasised on the importance of defeating the government’s alleged divisive agendas. “When the government tries to divide you on the basis of caste and religion, you should identify yourself only as farmers,” said Tikait. Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Haryana spokesperson, Jawahar Yadav, said that the crowds at mahapanchayats would have no bearing on the farm laws. “We have always maintained that this is a political movement, and many people are working behind the scenes. These things will become clearer with time and people will start weaning away from the protests. Genuine farmers will start breaking away from these protests as they understand the politics taking place in the garb of the farmer’s movement,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-15-000-turn-up-for-mahapanchayat-at-sunehra-101612717909099.html
07-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG to be audited over irregularities in contract works over last two years||A special audit of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram has been sanctioned by the Urban Local Bodies (ULB) minister, Anil Vij, to check for irregularities in the agency’s operations, officials said on Sunday.Officials said that Vij was apprised of the irregularities on Thursday, when he turned up without warning to the MCG’s House meeting, in which agendas approved last year were being discussed. Vij, who is also the state health minister, was in the city on Thursday for the start of the second phase of Covid-19 vaccinations.Following conversations with the councillors — who apprised him about several instances wherein the MCG officials had paid total project cost to contractors but failed to ensure the start of work on the ground or where work was in initial stages — Vij announced that an audit of the municipal body would be carried out.“The ULB minister was present at the review meeting for a short duration. He lent his support to the concept of reviewing House meeting agendas and later, also announced that a special audit would be carried out for both the MCG and the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) by the auditor general,” said Madhu Azad, mayor, MCG.A special audit is one which only looks into the specific, selective workings of a public body and does not provide comprehensive coverage. For instance, in the special audit ordered by Vij, only irregularities in sanctioning funds to contractors would be looked into, rather than all civic dealings.There were several major cases last year wherein the MCG’s engineering wing officials had flouted norms and paid money to the contractors. As per MCG councillors, they brought the matter to Vij’s notice which prompted him to announce for a special audit.“There have been several cases in the MCG last year where irregularities were highlighted on part of MCG officials, who seemed to have colluded with contractors and paid them the entire project cost or a significant sum even though work on-ground was yet to start or still at an early stage. We had a brief discussion with the ULB minister on this, where he informed us about this audit,” said a councillor, who had attended the meeting held at the PWD rest house.In December last year, the charge of an MCG executive engineer (XEN) was withdrawn over alleged irregularities. In November 2020, the MCG had floated tenders to fix potholes and re-carpet roads in Ward 34, at an estimated cost of around ₹47.50 lakh. The XEN had allegedly paid the entire project cost even though work had not started on the ground.In September last year, a contractor was paid ₹50 lakh, nearly a quarter of the total project cost of ₹2 crore, for laying pavement tiles in Ward 25. However, after it emerged that only 10% of work had been executed on the ground, an investigation was initiated into the matter.In February 2020, a local politician had alerted the MCG that ₹1.67 crore — the total project cost for building a two-kilometre road in Ward 1 — had been paid to a contractor even before construction had started. It resulted in a vigilance probe.In December 2019, the MCG’s engineering wing had paid ₹35 lakh to a contractor for constructing a 1.7-kilometre track between Khushboo Chowk and Bristol Chowk along the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road despite work having been done on only 600 metres, totalling to ₹11 lakh. The contractor was later blacklisted by the MCG.In July last year, Vij had made a similar announcement and an order for a special audit of both MCG and MCF was also issued by the Haryana government. However, officials privy to the matter said that the special audit could not be conducted due to government officials being caught up with the coronavirus outbreak.Despite repeated attempts, the commissioner of MCG could not be contacted for comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-be-audited-over-irregularities-in-contract-works-over-last-two-years-101612717908441.html

According to the police, the thieves smashed the rear window of the car parked near a roadside medical shop on Friday evening, and fled with the laptop bag kept on the rear seat. After preliminary investigation, a case of theft was registered at the Sadar police station on Saturday, the police said on Sunday. Kuldeep Sharma, a resident of Sector 38 who works in an automobile company, told the police that while he was returning from office, he stopped near Eldeco Mansion on Fazilpur Road and went inside a medial shop to buy medicines. “When I returned, I found the window glass of my rear seat broken. The laptop, which was kept on the rear seat, was also missing. My debit and credit cards, along with my wife’s driving licence, were inside the laptop bag, which was missing,” he said. Sharma said he informed police control room regarding the theft. He received a call from a taxi driver from South City 2 who informed him that his documents were lying on the road near the main gate. “The driver worked with a local taxi service agency. He found all the documents and cards, but the bag and laptop were missing,” said Sharma. A case under section 379 (theft) was registered at Sadar police station on Saturday. This is the second such incident this year. Last year, more than 35 similar cases were reported and six gangs members were arrested, said police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that a new gang is presently operating across the city and is targeting parked cars, which are left unattended. “We are scanning the CCTV footage of all suspected locations and have formed teams to keep a watch on various stretches across the city,” he said. The police said they are conducting an investigation and have not got any leads in the case yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/laptop-documents-stolen-from-executive-s-car-case-filed-101612717848442.html
07-02-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand disaster: Locals feared Kedarnath-like tragedy||By Ankur SharmaForty-two-year-old Rakesh Dhimri, a resident of Raini village, was sipping his tea of Sunday morning when he suddenly got up on his chair to enquire about a loud sound of water gushing down.On coming out of his house, he saw a huge amount of muck flowing towards the under-construction Rishi Ganga hydel power project, enough to remind him of the memories of 2013 Kedarnath tragedy which killed thousands of people.Like Dhimri, many other residents of the small village of Raini near the dam got out of their houses staring down at the river in shock and fear, breaching the dam where at least 40 workers are missing."The first thing that came to my mind after seeing the swollen river was the Kedarnath tragedy which swallowed thousands of lives. My family and I were just praying to God to protect us from similar possible tragedy. Fortunately, we were saved but the workers on the dam site were not so lucky," said Dhimri.Also read: Night ops to continue in Uttarakhand, says ITBP; alert in UPMahendra Prakash Semwal, a resident of Chamoli town, about 24 kilometres from Rishi Ganga project said, "We were informed by the authorities about the dam breach and just are praying to God while many of us are shifting to safe places from the riverside.""We were just holding our breaths with all our eyes on the Alaknanda river in which the water level was increased due to the glacier burst. We continued in the same state till the water level receded in the river and gave us a sigh of relief," said Semwal. "We would, however, not sleep tonight out of panic and fearing a much bigger disaster at night like Kedarnath," he added.There was panic all around as the news of the disaster spread in the thinly populated mountainous region, close to China-Nepal border. Many people living close to the river could be seen running out of their homes with whatever belongings they could take. Fortunately, there was not much water in the river to reach their homes.The massive disaster had claimed seven lives till Sunday evening. Twelve had been rescued and about 190 were still missing after damage to two dams, Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga. Many residents of Chamoli questioned the government on setting up the two projects there despite resistance by locals and environmentalists."The disaster had caused huge loss of life and property in the area. The government should have assessed all the aspects, including scientific, before setting up the projects in the area which probably destroyed the Rishi Ganga valley completely," said Pradeep Farswan, a resident of Chamoli.He added, "The government should help to provide the basic needs to the affected people including the labourers working in the Dhauli Ganga project as some of them, who were not present at the time of the incident, are wandering restlessly like the lockdown times."State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel were among the first to respond to the tragedy by initiating a rescue operation."Initially, the people of the area were in panic. They feared that Kedarnath-like tragedy may happen again," said an SDRF personnel who was rushed for relief work at Rishi Ganga hydel project.NK Joshi, Chamoli district disaster management officer said, "As the disaster was considerably big, the residents of the area were in panic. However, we tried to handle that by making announcements in the area, urging people to stay away from the river and get to safety.""We also took to social media platforms actively urging them not to pay heed to any rumours about the incidents including some old unrelated videos. Despite that, many were still in panic which subsided only after the water level in the river went down to normal," said Joshi.Informing about the casualties and other loss in the disaster, he said, "So far, the rescue agencies have recovered seven bodies and saved 12 workers from a tunnel in Dhauli Ganga project. Efforts are on to rescue others who are stuck in another 250 metres-long tunnel which is completely filled with muck.""God has saved me," said a worker as he came out from a make-shift trench dug inside the river muck. "I cannot believe I am alive. Inside the tunnel, we were working at some distance and got no time to respond to the water. I was saved as I hooked myself into a corner," an unidentified worker who was rescued by SDRF personnel at Tapovan hydel project said.On the number of total missing people, Joshi said that the exact figure could not be ascertained. Other officials, however, claimed that about 190 workers are missing who were working in the two dams at the time of the incident."Luckily it was a Sunday due to which many workers didn't come. Had it been a working day, the feared loss of life would have been much bigger," said Joshi.Earlier in the day, as soon as the incident was reported, state leadership, including chief minister and state chief secretary, got into action mode to monitor the situation with CM Trivendra Singh Rawat later flying off to Tapovan to assess the situation and monitor rescue operation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah also spoke to him on the situation while assuring every possible help in the rescue work.The rescue operation is still on with personnel from the SDRF, the NDRF, the ITBP and the Army involved along with choppers. It will continue on Monday as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-disaster-locals-feared-kedarnath-like-tragedy-101612717085318.html
07-02-2021||Gurugram||Constable arrested in connection with ₹57-lakh graft case||The Haryana State Vigilance Bureau arrested one more constable of Gurugram Police in connection with ₹57-lakh graft case and the illegal detention of a Delhi-based call centre owner. The former station house officer (SHO) of Kherki Daula police station and a head constable had already been arrested in this case, said the police.A senior vigilance officer confirmed the arrest of the constable and said he was produced before the court on Thursday and was taken in two days police remand. “He is likely to become an approver and more arrests are underway,” he said on condition of anonymity.The constable has been identified as Jagbir Singh. He was posted at Kherki Daula police station and was allegedly involved in kidnapping and extortion of the call centre owner. Singh, along with head constable Amit, had allegedly kidnapped Delh-based businessman Naveen Bhutani from a restaurant on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway in and took him to Kherki Daula police station. Later he was taken to a farmhouse in the Pataudi area.The owner of the farmhouse Krishan Yadav was arrested on January 7 and former SHO inspector Vishal Kumar had surrendered before a local court on January 12. The head constable Amit was arrested by the vigilance bureau allegedly on December 29 while accepting a bribe of ₹5 lakh from Bhutani, following which a case was registered against cops.The police said Bhutan was held hostage, kidnapped by the SHO and his team in the last week of December, who then demanded ₹ 3 crore, but later settled for ₹1 crore before setting him free after collecting ₹57 lakh.Mayank Raghav, counsel for Naveen Bhutani, said the vigilance bureau has arrested one more personnel who was part of the crime. “Amit and Jagbir had picked up Bhutani from the restaurant. Amit was arrested in December and Jagbir was arrested on Thursday and was remanded two days of police custody,” said Raghav adding many more arrests are expected in the case.According to the vigilance department, Bhutani, who runs a call centre and sells religious products in the UK and Australia, had approached the senior officers of the department with a complaint against two officials of the Kherki Daula police station for allegedly extorting ₹57 lakh from him and demanding ₹10 lakh more.Bhutani said that SHO Vishal Kumar assaulted him in his office and got his laptop data scanned for information on his business. He allegedly asked for ₹1 crore for his release but agreed on ₹57 lakh after negotiation.Later Bhutani approached senior vigilance officials and narrated his ordeal, following which a case under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and sections 384 (extortion), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the police officials.Later Bhutani approached senior vigilance officials and narrated his ordeal, following which a case under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and sections 384 (extortion ), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the police officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/constable-arrested-in-connection-with-57-lakh-graft-case-101612715988327.html
07-02-2021||Kolkata||PM Modi’s 'match-fixing' remark draws criticism from TMC, Left and Congress||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday drew criticism from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Left and the Congress for accusing the three parties of getting into a “match-fixing” arrangement to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the assembly polls due in April-May in West Bengal.“Our fight in Bengal is with the TMC but also with their hidden friends. You must have heard of match-fixing in sports. The TMC is also into a match-fixing with the Left and the Congress. They meet secretly behind closed doors in Delhi and make plans. In Kerala, the Left and the Congress come to power for every alternate five years. They say to each other ‘You loot for five years and we will loot in the next five.’ We have to be careful about this. We have to warn everyone,” PM Modi said at a BJP rally in Haldia in Bengal’s East Midnapore district.The Prime Minister came to Bengal for three-and-a-half hours to inaugurate some important road and gas projects. He made the remarks at a BJP rally that he addressed before heading for the government programme.PM Modi also held the three parties responsible for the woes of the people and lack of development in Bengal.“The Congress regime in Bengal was marked by corruption and the Left added atrocity to this when it came to power. Violence and corruption reached a peak during the Left regime. At that moment, Mamata Banerjee raised a cry, seeking a change in the regime. This drew the attention of the nation and gave birth to hope among people. But the state became a victim of her politics. The very first year of her regime proved that there was no change. It was a rebirth of the violent regime. It was an attack on democracy. Hence, poverty increased, old industries shut down and new projects never came up,” said PM Modi.Also read: U'khand flood live updates - ITBP says 30 people trapped in tunnel being rescuedTMC’s senior Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy dismissed the allegation of “match-fixing.”“What Modi said is baseless and impossible. On the contrary, I have proof that the BJP had a secret arrangement with the Left in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Some CPI(M) leaders took the money and transferred their votes to the BJP,” said Roy, referring to the BJP’s win in 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, marking a record, and the CPI(M)’s vote share going down to 6.34 per cent.CPI(M) legislator and leader of the Left parties in the Bengal assembly, Sujan Chakraborty dismissed all the allegations, saying PM Modi’s comment at a political rally proved that the BJP is scared of the Left-Congress alliance.“The Left parties are supposed to have been reduced to a nothing according to the BJP. Why in that case is the Prime Minister talking about the Left and the Congress? Is it a proof of the BJP’s fear? Is the BJP scared of the Left-Congress alliance? We are aware of the secret arrangement the BJP has with the TMC. It is TMC that helped the BJP rise in Bengal in exchange for favours,” said Chakraborty.Congress legislator and leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Abdul Mannan also accused the BJP of having a pact with the TMC.“It was I who moved the Supreme Court in 2014, seeking CBI probe into various chit fund scams in which many TMC leaders are accused. Why didn’t the BJP government at the Centre take action against them in seven years? This is the real proof of the arrangement the two parties have,” said Mannan.Political commentator and columnist Suvashsis Maitra said, "By putting the TMC, Left and BJP in one bracket Modi tried to project the BJP as the only party against which all are united. It is also a way of showing the BJP as the sole force fighting for Hindutva."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/pm-modi-s-match-fixing-remark-draws-criticism-from-tmc-left-and-congress-101612714175271.html
07-02-2021||Dehradun||'Cause of Chamoli glacier tragedy to be studied by experts': Uttarakhand CM||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said the cause of the tragedy in Chamoli will be studied by experts. The chief minister said that at present the state government is focussed on saving the lives of people. A glacier burst in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district caused a massive flooding in the Dhauli Ganga river.“When I was going to attend a function in the morning around 11.20 am, I came to know through social media that a tragedy had struck in Chamoli,” Rawat said.“I immediately called the district administration to confirm. I came to know that due to glacier breaking, a tragedy had struck. There are two parts of Raini village, one on this side of the river and the other on another,” he added.Rawat said the Rishiganga dam project is located near this village which was commissioned in 2020 with 35 workers engaged there and four cops posted for security. “Two were on leave and two were there and are now missing. Around 30 workers working on the project are also missing”.Also read: No threat to other Uttarakhand villages, says Centre; alert in UPCM Rawat said around 5 kilometres downstream at the NTPC’s under-construction hydel power project at Tapovan, around 176 workers were working. “There are two tunnels there. Around 15 people were deployed on one tunnel while around 30 to 35 workers were working on the other. 35 to 45 came back and were rescued, one is injured. The rescue work is being carried out with much difficulty with ropes and digging of the muck that has filled the tunnels. No contact could be made with the trapped workers inside the tunnel. Seven bodies have been recovered so far,” he added.Rawat said he conducted the aerial survey of the area and later visited Raini village by road to take stock of the situation. “One main bridge and 4 small other bridges were damaged, cutting off the right side of the Raini village and 11 other villages”.He said Army’s three helicopters and one of Indian Airforce have reached the affected areas. “Our choppers are also engaged and ready for rescue and relief operations," he said.The chief minister said PM Modi called him and assured him of all possible help. He said the Centre will provide all possible help to the state. “Home minister Amit Shah and President of India also called and expressed concern and spoke about all possible cooperation,” he said.Rawat also announced compensation of ₹4 lakh each to the kin of those who lost their lived in the tragedy.“We have made all arrangements for rescue and relief operations and providing healthcare facilities to the affected people,” he said.Rawat said water has cleaned up close to Chamoli town and the situation concerning water level has almost stabilised. “We had removed water from Srinagar Dam so that there is no risk. The railway project was stopped and an alert was sounded all along the river downstream. River rafting has been stopped up to Haridwar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/cause-of-chamoli-tragedy-to-be-studied-by-experts-uttarakhand-cm-101612709734139.html

07-02-2021||Mumbai||Amit Shah calls Maharashtra's MVA govt a 'three-wheel autorickshaw'||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday termed the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra as a "three-wheel auto-rickshaw" and accused it of failing on all fronts.Speaking after inaugurating a private medical college at Kankavli in Maharashtra's Sindhudurg district, Shah said all wheels of this auto-rickshaw were moving in different directions."This is a unholy alliance made by betraying the people's mandate which was for a BJP-Shiv Sena government led by Devendra Fadnavis," he said.He alleged the alliance was made for the lust of power, and asserted that no promise was made before the 2019 Assembly polls about sharing of the chief minister's post in the state by the then allies BJP and Shiv Sena.The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena parted ways with the BJP after the Assembly polls in 2019 over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post in the state, and later forged an alliance with the NCP and Congress to come to power.Thackeray had claimed that Shah, who was then BJP president, assured in 'Matoshree' (Thackeray's home in Mumbai's Bandra area) that the CM's post would be shared by the two parties, but the BJP later went back on the promise.However, Shah on Sunday reiterated that no promise was made to the Shiv Sena on sharing of the chief ministers post."I don't make promises in closed rooms. Whatever I do, I do it openly...I don't do politics in closed rooms," the Union minister said.It is being alleged the BJP broke the promise, Shah said and stressed that his party honours its promises."We don't speak white lies. We are the ones who honour commitments. In Bihar, we said if the NDA gets more seats, Nitish Kumar will continue to be CM," he said.The BJP got more seats than the JD(U) and Nitish Kumar said the BJP should have its chief minister, he noted."But, we said the BJP has already given its word that he (Nitish Kumar) will remain the CM," Shah said.Hitting out at Thackeray, Shah said the Sena president addressed rallies with him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the Maharashtra Assembly elections.In the posters of Shiv Sena candidates, PM Modi's pictures were bigger than Thackeray's, he said."We sought votes for the BJP-Sena led by Fadnavis, why didn't you speak out that time? You just took votes in the name of Modiji," Shah said.The BJP made "no promise" to the Shiv Sena on sharing of the CM's post, he asserted."For the lust of power, all (late Sena founder) Balasaheb's ideals were dumped in the Tapi river," he said, and accused the MVA government of failing on all fronts.Shah also said the Ram temple will be constructed at Ayodhya in Uttar Padesh in two years.He said the "BJP is in politics for its ideals, and not for politics like the Shiv Sena".He said during a cyclone in the state (last year), Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray did not visit the affected Konkan region while Fadnavis visited the area thrice.He claimed that sugar cooperatives held by BJP leaders are being victimised by the state government."If we would have followed your path, your party would have lost its relevance," he said.Shah praised BJP Rajya Sabha member Narayan Rane's efforts for the construction of the medical college which was inaugurated on Sunday at Kankavli, the political turf of Rane.The Union minister further said under the leadership of PM Modi, India effectively tackled the COVID-19 pandemic which the world considers as a "model".Everyone wondered how the country with a huge population and weak health infrastructure would control the pandemic but "effective steps were taken at the right time", he said."Efforts were made, like janta curfew, lockdown, boosting morale of health workers, starting testing labs, manufacture of ventilators, masks and PPE kits," he said.India's line of treatment during the pandemic is being followed by 170-odd countries, Shah said.The big difference was that in India, the central government, state governments, doctors, health workers and 130 crore people together handled the situation, he said."Our COVID-19 death rate is low, our recovery rate is the best," he said.Through the janta curfew, PM Modi prepared people for the lockdown, he said, and also referred to initiatives like clapping, beating of 'thalis' and lighting lamps to encourage doctors and health workers.Shah said during the pandemic, the health infrastructure was boosted at a rocket-speed.He said the world's largest vaccination programme was recently launched in India."We have rolled out two vaccines...four more are in the pipeline," he said, adding that India is set to supply 70 per cent of world's vaccine needs.The vaccines are being exported to 14 countries, the Union minister informed.In the last six-and-a-half years, the Centre has invested heavily in health infrastructure, he added.

He also said that several locals with their livestocks also disappeared in the incident. He said, “Experts can tell the reason behind the glacier outburst but our government is right now focused on saving the lives of people. Five locals including shepherds with their 180 sheep and goats swept away in the flash flood. We are assuming that around 125 people are missing. The number can be higher.”Several teams of the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force are present at the site. Earlier on Sunday, a glacier broke in the Tapovan-Reni region which caused a flash flood causing at least 150 casualties. Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) on Sunday rescued 16 people trapped in a tunnel near the Tapovan area in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. 9 bodies have been recovered so far at the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) site in the Tapovan area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-flood-state-govt-to-provide-rs-4-lakh-financial-assistance-101612707828806.html

Raut said police will have to rethink whether to allow Elgar Parishad in the future while deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has hit out at the organisers of the event for not stopping the speech of Usmani. Pawar said those present at Elgar Parishad should have immediately stopped Usmani’s speech. Raut, while speaking after inaugurating Shiv Sena’s medical cell centre of Nashik said AMU student leader came to Maharashtra from Uttar Pradesh where he could have been stopped. “But there is time to decide whether to give permission or not to Elgar Parishad in the future. The police will have to take a stand on this,” Raut said. Earlier this week, Pune police booked Usmani, a student leader from Aligarh Muslim University, under section 153(a) of the Indian Penal Code for an allegedly derogatory comment on Hindu society. Reacting to the speech and police action, Pawar while interacting with reporters said, “It was not at all correct, police are investigating it.

07-02-2021||Mumbai||Disquiet in Maha ruling coalition over Patole’s resignation as House speaker||The Congress’s decision to replace state unit chief Balasaheb Thorat with Nana Patole and the latter’s resignation as Maharashtra Assembly Speaker has triggered disquiet in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition. Appearing to disfavour its ally’s decision, the Shiv Sena on Saturday said re-election of such constitutional post should have been avoided.While the Congress party said the post of Assembly Speaker will remain with the party even though Patole has resigned, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said on Saturday that the three parties will decide the next Speaker after discussion. “It is pretty clear that the position is with the Congress party but in a situation when those working at the position of Speaker or the chief minister has to be changed, then going by the procedure, names of the contenders should be discussed with the ruling partners before a decision,” the NCP chief said.Echoing Pawar’s opinion, Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, “Like Sharad Pawar saheb said, there will be discussion on the [Speaker post] again.”The Shiv Sena cautioned the Congress through an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana that it should ensure that the new state president must not become “excessively” aggressive.“After Nana (Patole) was relieved of the Speaker post [by the party] and given the responsibility of the party, it meant that Maharashtra Congress needed an aggressive face. Certainly the Congress must have thought that this aggression should not turn excessive,” the editorial said in a cautionary tone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/disquiet-in-maha-ruling-coalition-over-patole-s-resignation-as-house-speaker-101612644747860.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar advises Sachin Tendulkar to exercise caution||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday advised Bharat Ratna awardee and former international cricketer Sachin Tendulkar to be cautious while commenting on issues outside his field. He also said that the common people have fiercely reacted to the stance adopted by Indian celebrities to counter tweets from foreign celebrities on the farmers’ agitation. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) also took on the Centre for dragging Bharat Ratna awardees Lata Mangeshkar and Tendulkar into its campaign to counter tweets from celebrities such as singer Rihanna. He slammed the Centre, saying that the issue was with the government’s policy and not a national issue to use legends to garner support. “They (Indian celebrities) have taken a stand but the common people have fiercely reacted to the position taken by them. I would also advise Tendulkar to exercise caution while speaking about any other field,” Pawar said.Thackeray, who was speaking to reporters, said that the union government should have not exposed Mangeshkar and Tendulkar to social media trolling. “The government should not have asked Sachin Tendulkar and Lata Mangeshkar to tweet and put their reputation at stake. This is an issue of the government’s policy and not of the country’s like some threat from China or Pakistan. Now they have to face the wrath of social media trolling.”“The government should have limited its use of celebrities in its campaign to actors such as Akshay Kumar,” he remarked.He further said, “They (Tendulkar and Mangeshkar) are legends in their fields, and they are very simple people. They should not have been asked to tweet with the same hashtag. They tweeted what the government asked them to tweet, and now they are at the receiving end.”Thackeray also slammed the Centre for issuing clarification to Rihanna’s tweet supporting the farmers’ stir.Reacting to comments from foreign celebrities on farmers’ protest, the former union agriculture minister also said that farmers are protesting despite all the odds since the last over two months and people were sympathetic towards them in the country. “Now, similar views are expressed abroad for the farmers, which is not good for the country. The government must take them seriously,” he suggested. Linking these reactions over farmers’ protests with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support to the candidature of Donald Trump as Presidential candidate for the second term, he said, “I remember when the Prime Minister was on a US tour, he declared that Trump will be elected for a second term and a few sections have appreciated him. Today, people from abroad are also reacting the same way because of the same reason,” he said, blaming Modi for interfering in the internal matter of the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-advises-sachin-tendulkar-to-exercise-caution-101612644827626.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s eateries, bars can remain open till 1am||Within 24 hours of restricting restaurants and bars from operating beyond 11.30pm, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday rolled back its decision. It has now allowed them to remain open till 1am, owing to requests from owners, who said the 11.30pm deadline had “no logic”.The BMC had earlier in December 2020 imposed a night curfew in the city, wherein restaurant and bar owners were allowed to operate till 11.30pm, in view of New Year celebrations. However, the state government, while extending the lockdown till February 28 last week, allowed restaurants and bars to remain open till 1am as part of its “Mission Begin Again” — a staggered plan to lift coronavirus-enforced curbs. But the BMC on Friday evening restricted the timing to 11.30pm. Restaurant and bar owners across the city complained that there was a lot of confusion post the BMC move on Friday, despite the state allowing operations till 1am. In a statement issued on Saturday, the Hotel and Restaurant Association Western India (HRAWI) said, “Many restaurants expressed discontent over the last-minute notification issued by the BMC, which caused chaos and disruption of last evening’s [Friday] business as well as a lot of confusion. Quite a few restaurants did not receive any official notification, while others complained about having received the notification over WhatsApp and were unsure of its legitimacy. Based on information received from its restaurant members, the HRAWI sought clarification from the BMC and requested for withdrawing the notification with immediate effect.”Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, HRAWI spokesperson said, “We immediately appealed against the notice and presented the facts, and thankfully the notification has been withdrawn with immediate effect as per a fresh circular issued this morning. We hope the implementing agencies have been also adequately informed. We thank the BMC and excise departments for understanding our predicament and for immediately acting on it and taking back an order, which would’ve hurt an already ailing industry even further.”A restaurant owner, not wishing to be named, said, “There was no logic in the notification issued by the BMC on Friday. It is difficult to understand the logic of making changes in the timings for service of liquor or food. How is that going to help control numbers? Are we saying that coronavirus gets activated between 11.30pm and 1.30am?”Meanwhile, as per the notification issued by the BMC on Saturday, restaurant, bar, banquet halls and food courts can remain open in the city between 7am and 1am, followed by other shops and establishments that can remain open between 7am and 11pm. Lastly, shops selling liquor in the city have been allowed to remain open between 10am and 10.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-eateries-bars-can-remain-open-till-1am-101612644522690.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Special CBI court closes attempt to murder case against Chhota Rajan||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Saturday accepted closure report in a case registered against gangster Chhota Rajan for conspiring to kill senior journalist Baljeet Parmar in 1997. CBI had sought closure of the case for want of adequate evidence to prosecute the gangster.It is alleged that on June 12, 1997, two unknown persons riding a motorcycle came and fired four shots from a revolver at Parmar with intention to kill him. A case was registered with Antop Hill police station and was later transferred to Ghatkopar police.Police had arrested Mahendra Rajaram Shelar, Wilson Charli George, Akhtar Mohammad Khan Mahadik alias Chiknya and Sajeed Mohammad Rafiq Shaikh alias Sikandar in connection with the case.They were later convicted by the session’s court in April 2000. However, Rajan, the key conspirator who had allegedly ordered to carry out the attack and another accused Rohit Varma alias Dharmendra Ramkripal Pandey, were wanted in the case.CBI last year filed a closure report against Rajan claiming that during further investigation no additional evidence has emerged against accused Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje alias Chhota Rajan.Further, the court was informed that another wanted accused Varma dead in Bangkok in 2000.The court in its order further noted that, “IO (Investigating officer) of CBI, did not find any link to connect the accused with guilt. The IO is unable to collect the vital evidences like CDRs, CAFs, etc. This court has made an attempt to call the informant - Baljeet Shersingh Parmar, but he is not traceable on the given address.”It added, “Accordingly, CBI submitted unserved report. Even otherwise, there is no sufficient material to proceed against the accused - Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje alias Chhota Rajan and others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/special-cbi-court-closes-attempt-to-murder-case-against-chhota-rajan-101612642902183.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Ulhasnagar hamlet students now have a roof over them||Thirty students from Ulhasnagar’s Ashele pada hamlet who were attending their daily classes in an open space have now found a new place to study with a roof above them.This, after a social worker from Ulhasnagar, Prafful Kedare decided to provide them his room for the class. Sunil Ahire, 39, another social worker, from Ulhasnagar had started classes for these under-privileged children during the lockdown, though the classes were held in the open.However the number of students are increasing and there is a need for bigger space in the coming days, claimed Ahire. This room, donated by Kedare, is named as ‘binghantichi boruchi shala’ (school without bell) and was inaugurated on the day of Savitribai Phule Jayanthi on January 3. Kedare is associated with a social group that takes personality development courses for students and professionals including doctors and advocates.These students were deprived of education during the lockdown as classes went online and they did not have digital access. Ahire had taken up the task of teaching these children. “There was always a requirement of a class for the students. Kedare asked to take his room for conducting the classes, which is a big help for us,” said Ahire, who has completed his master in sociology. These students, from Class 1 to 7 of semi-English and Marathi-medium schools, were left with no option but to skip their daily classes during the lockdown as they were conducted online. This new classroom is around 5-10 minutes away from the earlier open space. Ahire said that more parents and children were approaching him to take classes for them. But he felt that one classroom would not be enough if the count of students increases.“The students were likely to increase to 45-50, and in that case I’d require more classrooms. It will be good if someone voluntarily helped us with rooms. I am eagerly willing to take classes for more students. Also, it will be good if someone voluntarily takes lectures for the students. Otherwise, we will again have to go to an open space for the daily lectures if the students’ count increases,” said Ahire. Kedare said that the room which was given to the students is the one where personality development classes were held. “I came to know about Ahire and his students, and decided to provide a roof to them,” said Kedare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ulhasnagar-hamlet-students-now-have-a-roof-over-them-101612641401621.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Complaints by men against spouses rise during lockdown||Thirty per cent of the total complaints received by the women redressal cell of the Navi Mumbai police department in 2020 was filed by men against their spouses. The most common among these were that the wife does not cook on time, the wife is busy on social media and doesn’t pay attention to the family or is having an extra-marital affair.The cell usually receives complaints from women who are abused, subjected to domestic violence or in marital discord with their spouses. The police claimed that the complaints by men increased with most people working from home.The lockdown last year had forced everyone to be at home, stuck with social media and other little means of entertainment. While some couples managed to sail through the tough times, some others ended up reaching the police stations and courts.Senior police inspector Meera Bansode of the women’s cell said, “In 2020, we received a total of 633 applications. While it is commonly believed that a women’s cell is for women, around 30 per cent of the total cases that came to the cell were from men against women. Of the 633 applications, around 180 complaints were from men who had issues against wives and were facing problems.”Another officer from the cell added, “Most of the complaints from men were about fights over wife not doing household chores, not cooking on time, spending too much time on social media or having an extra-marital affair.”The main aim of the cell is to solve the domestic disputes and help the couple to be back on amicable terms. Bansode added, “We do not justify or take sides. We only counsel for their better future. The maximum cases that came up during the lockdown had issues which were driven by social media. Either the husband was spending too much time on social media or the wife was glued to it.”During the lockdown period, people were mostly busy with WhatsApp, Facebook and other apps. On other days, the spouses were away from home and hence they do not know what was happening in each other’s life, she added.In 2020, of the total 633 cases, 625 were resolved by various means. While 169 were successfully counselled, 81 of them went to police stations and 383 approached court. “When the counselling does not make any difference, the couple either goes to the police station, where again an effort is made to solve the differences or else a case is registered. Otherwise, they approach court for a divorce,” Bansode added.Meanwhile, in 2019, a total of 721 applications had been received at the women’s cell, of which all were resolved via various means. While 308 ended in successful counselling, 134 approached police stations and 477 approached court.The women’s cell is headed by Bansode and has a total of six staff that includes five females and one male. This, Bansode felt, was understaffed for the number of applications they receive daily.Of breakfast at noon and ‘touch me not’**A Nerul-based businessman filed a complaint that his wife did not cook food on time. The woman, a homemaker, as per her husband’s complaint made breakfast at 12 noon, lunch at 4pm and dinner past midnight. An officer said, “The husband often ordered food as their kids aged 12 and 15 were hungry in the morning after waking up. He also frequently visited his aunt’s house for meals, which his wife never liked. After a few sittings of counselling, they mutually agreed to adjust,” the official added.**A professional driver in his thirties from Ghansoli made his wife do his B Ed after their marriage and also helped her get a teacher’s job. While studying B Ed, she met her senior and started having an affair. Slowly, she started avoiding her husband, told him she was in a relationship and hence he should not touch her but should look after her and her child, and that she would also continue to stay in his house. “We counselled the couple but the wife did not cooperate. She approached court for divorce,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-complaints-by-men-against-spouses-rise-during-lockdown-101612640981240.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Koparkhairane is first ward in Navi Mumbai to be garbage bin-free||Koparkhairane has now become the first civic ward in Navi Mumbai to be free of any public garbage bin. NMMC is aiming at making Navi Mumbai a garbage bin-free city in its attempt to rank atop in the country in Swachh Survekshan 2021.Navi Mumbai civic chief Abhijit Bangar has started ward-wise review of work being undertaken for Swachh Survekshan 2021.Bangar said, “There is no garbage bin at any public place in Koparkhairane anymore. It is an important milestone in making our city garbage bin-free. However, we need to ensure that the residents do not throw any garbage in the areas from which the bins have been removed or where beautification has been undertaken. I have issued strict instructions to our officials on the issue.”He added that instructions have been given to other wards to follow Koparkhairane’s example.Bangar said, “Steps are taken to ensure segregation of dry and wet garbage at the household level itself. Just as it is being done in housing societies, the segregation should happen in slums and gaothan areas as well. Garbage collection vans will make regular trips and ensure the mandatory segregation and collection of garbage. Local residents are being informed about the timings while red colour garbage boxes have been placed in gaothans and slums for garbage collection.”NMMC has asked the residents to make use of a compost basket for scientific disposal of garbage. The natural fertilizer can be used in flower pots in the house.Bangar added, “I have asked my officials to ensure that housing societies generating over 50kg of garbage have a composting project within their premises. It is very important that the residents actively participate in the cleanliness drive. It will ensure Navi Mumbai gets the first rank in Swachh Survey 2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/koparkhairane-is-first-ward-in-navi-mumbai-to-be-garbage-binfree-101612640621170.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Pipeline work to discharge effluents into Kalyan creek to be ready by May 2022||Work on the 17.5km-long pipeline, which will carry treated effluents from the factories to be released in the creek, will be completed by May 2022, assured the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) officials.The pipeline will curb the rampant pollution in Waldhuni and Ulhas rivers as most effluents, which are now released in rivers and drains, will be released in Kalyan creek through this closed pipeline.The work, carried out by the Ambernath MIDC, on around 6km stretch from Forest Naka in Ambernath to Vadolgaon has been completed but the remaining section from Vadalgaon to Kalyan Creek is in progress.This project was planned in 2018 following complaints of pollution in Waldhuni and Ulhas rivers caused by the discharge of untreated effluents. Effluents are now discharged into nullahs within the city limits, thus polluting rivers as these drains meet the Waldhuni and Ulhas river.An officer from Ambernath MIDC requesting anonymity said, “This is a major project taken up after we received directions from the pollution board to end the practice of discharging effluents directly in the nullahs. The new pipeline will be used to carry treated effluents into the creek. This will eliminate chances of air and water pollution. The work is being conducted on time without delay, we will complete it by May 2022.”As per the officials, a total of 4km stretch on shore and 2km offshore (under water) is completed.As per a report submitted by Kalyan MPCB to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2014, there are four MIDC areas in Badlapur and Ambernath city — all of them have around 400 effluent-generating units. The pipeline will help in carrying the effluents released by these units.There are four Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP) in the areas — three in Ambernath and one at Badlapur. Effluents treated at these CETP are discharged into the nearby drains and nullahs that connect Waldhuni and Ulhas river.Environmentalists alleged that despite having their own treatment plants, industrial units fail to treat effluents efficiently and discharge partially-treated chemicals into nullahs.“The residents have complained of foul smell thrice in the last two months. This will keep on increasing until there are proper measures taken. This pipeline will resolve the problem to some extent,” said Shashikant Dayma, founder of Waldhuni Biradari NGO.The MIDC also has plans to keep a tab on the effluents released from the CETPs to the pipeline in order to ensure the effluents are treated before they are released. This will make sure the creek in which the effluents are discharged altogether is not polluted too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pipeline-work-to-discharge-effluents-into-kalyan-creek-to-be-ready-by-may-2022-101612640501499.html

The police have recovered 11 two-wheelers that the siblings had planned to sell to a garage owner to modify them.The duo, identified as Yogesh Bhanushali and Mukesh Bhanushali, residents of Netivali village, Kalyan, confessed to committing more vehicle thefts in the past.According to a police officer, the accused did odd jobs and started stealing bikes over the last few months. They had worked in garages and hence knew how to unlock bikes parked on the roads.An officer said, “In the last one week, we have received three complaints of bike theft from a few societies. We formed a team and studied CCTV footage of several roads. We got an image of the accused with a stolen bike. We followed their trail and on Friday arrested them in Kalyan. The recovered two-wheelers are worth ₹4 lakh. We are looking for one more accused involved with these two. The three have stolen bikes from Nashik, Kalyan, Dombivli and Thane.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dombivli-police-nab-brothers-for-stealing-2wheelers-101612640321553.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||PM Modi should make phone call to resolve deadlock: Raj Thackeray||Amid speculations that Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray is moving closer to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Thackeray on Saturday attacked the BJP over the ongoing farmer’s protest. He said that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi should make a ‘phone call’ to resolve the farmer’s stir. He also indirectly slammed PM Modi saying that if the Centre does not want non-Indians to give out opinion on issues of India, then he should not have campaigned for former United States president Donald Trump.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, the MNS chief spoke on varied issues including the Maharashtra government’s U turn on giving relief to consumers for inflated bills. He also targeted the BJP and Shiv Sena for playing politics over renaming Aurangabad to Sambhaji Nagar. He asked why the BJP did not rename the city when it was in power at the Centre and in Maharashtra between 2014 and 2019.In a bid to revive his party’s political future, the MNS has adopted the hard-line Hindutva stand — the space that fell vacant as the Sena no longer advocates stringent Hindutva lines after forming alliance with the Congress and NCP. Thackeray said he will visit the Ram temple in Ayodhya soon. The date, however, is not decided, he said.Political observers said Thackeray cozy-ing up to the BJP could be early signs of an alliance in the offing ahead of Mumbai civic election. The BJP would need the MNS to cut into the Marathi votes of the Sena.Thackeray said that if Union ministers are unable to break the deadlock in discussions with the farmers then PM Modi should intervene to resolve it. He, however, backed the Centre’s law and said there could be some shortcoming which must be rectified.He said the issue has stretched on for too long. “I have not seen such security at China or Pakistan border. There was no need for such arrangement for farmers,” he said. Referring to PM Modi’s statement in all-party meeting where he said he is a “phone call away”, Thackeray added, “I think that if PM has said he is a phone call away then he should pick up the phone and put an end to this. If his agriculture minister or any other minister cannot find a solution in talks, then the PM should pay attention to this issue.”The MNS chief further attacked PM Modi and said there was no need to for the Centre to issue clarification after pop singer Rihanna tweeted on the farmer’s agitation. “They say that outsiders should not get involved in matters of the country. Then by that same logic there was no need to hold rallies saying abki bar, Trump Sarkar; it was that country’s internal matter,” he said in an indirect reference to PM Modi’s Howdy Modi event in Houston.Meanwhile, taking on the Maharashtra government over on not providing relief to power consumers, Thackeray alleged that the “U turn” happened after a meeting between NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Adani. He alleged there would have been some “give and take” between power companies and the government.“First the minister said they would give relief to consumers. Governor asked me to meet Sharad Pawar. After I met him, he asked me to give letters in the name of the power companies like Adani, MSEB, etc. Then after five-six days, I got to know that Adani met Pawar at his home. I do not know what they discussed but after the meeting, the government said that there will not be any relief given to consumers,” Thackeray said.The MNS chief further slammed former allies — the BJP and Sena — on the issue of renaming Aurangabad. He said it is merely politics ahead of the civic elections in the city. “Why was the name not changed when the BJP and Sena were in power? Why are you politicising it now? The BJP and Sena must answer this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm-modi-should-make-phone-call-to-resolve-deadlock-raj-thackeray-101612639169150.html

He was then brought to Vaiji-Vejalpada jungle in Gholwad, Palghar by three unidentified men who burnt him alive, after he refused to pay them ₹10 lakh. The locals found the victim Surajkumar Mithilesh Dube, lying, and reported to the Gholwad police. He was admitted at Sion hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, on Friday night. Indian Navy in its statement has confirmed that Suraj Kumar Dubey, L/S, age 26 years of INS Agrani, Coimbatore,Tamil Nadu was on leave from the unit and was found with 90% burns in Palghar on 5th February. He was brought to INHS Asvini and declared dead on arrival. A case has been registered at Palghar police station and the SP, Palghar is investigating the matter.Sarjerao Kumbhar, the assistant police inspector said, “The victim was called to Chennai on January 31, and then held captive for three days and later brought to the Gholwad jungle.

07-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Intervention by PM Modi may resolve farm bills issues, says Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday said that the highest level intervention from the Central government may help in resolving the deadlock between the Centre and farmers organisation over contentious farm bills which has resulted in over 70-day long protest, by the agrarian community. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the defence minister Rajnath Singh should intervene and resolve the impasse.He also slammed the Centre for failing to handle the farmers’ agitation properly and taking extreme steps against the protestors, which have never happened in the country post-independence.“In my opinion, the central government should take an initiative and a senior-level minister should intervene. I don’t want to disrespect Narendra Singh Tomar (Union agriculture minister) but the Prime Minister or defence minister should intervene then the issue may be resolved. If it happens then those leading the protest should also look for a resolution,” Pawar told reporters.“To stop protestors, roads were cemented with nails. It has never happened in the country since independence. The government took extreme measures which also shows their attitude. Whenever farmers come out on streets like this then the government is expected to show some consonance,” he said.Pawar alleged the BJP is defaming the ongoing agitation of farmers by calling them “Khalistanis” or “terrorists”. “The ruling party has taken a stand to defame farmers by calling Khalistanis and terrorists. These agitators are farmers who have made the country self-sufficient in food production. Calling them with names is not a quality of civilized culture,” the veteran leader said. Meanwhile, thousands of farmers, peasants, along with social activists and political leaders participated in the nationwide chakka jam called by Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Saturday in Maharashtra. Farmers in many parts of the state blocked national highways and state highways to show their opposition to the three laws passed by the Centre.Except for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), prominent parties including Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party, Congress, Swabhimani Sanghatna, Left parties and its affiliated bodies All India Kisan Sabha and All India Centre for Trade Unions (AICTU) participated in the agitation across the state. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the protests are not political, but the party stands for the demands of the farmers’.Reacting to comments from foreign celebrities, Pawar said that farmers are protesting despite all the odds since the last over two months and people were sympathetic towards them in the country. “Now, similar views are expressed abroad for the farmers which are not good for the country. The government must take them seriously,” he suggested.Linking these reactions over farmers’ protests with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support to the candidature of Donald Trump as Presidential candidate for the second term, he said, “I remember when the Prime Minister was on a US tour, he declared that Trump will be elected for a second term and a few sections appreciated him. Today, people from abroad are also reacting the same way because of the same reason,” he said, blaming Modi for interfering in the internal matter of the United States.Swabhimani Sanghatna leader Raju Shetti led a protest in Kolhapur. Shetti slammed the Centre for making celebrities tweet in support of the farm laws. He said that the government has forgotten that “crores of common people” have brought them to power, but once they dump them no celebrities will ask them.Kishore Tiwari, president of Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission, led a protest in Yavatmal district blocking the national highway. Tiwari, who is associated with the Shiv Sean and holds MoS rank, was detained by the district police.In Mumbai, Samajwadi Party, NCP, Left parties protested in Kurla. NCP spokesperson and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik participated in a protest near Kurla station. Malik, who is the party’s Mumbai unit chief, said that the three laws are an attempt to get industrialists in the agriculture sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-intervention-by-pm-modi-may-resolve-farm-bills-issues-says-pawar-101612637980056.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||A unified body is need of the hour, say Mumbai civic body chief||Against the backdrop of the war of words between the alliance partners of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition over the proposal to make the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) the city’s single planning authority, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told Hindustan Times said this proposal was aimed at integrated development for Mumbai, rather than expanding the civic chief’s powers. What is the idea behind the move to make BMC the single planning authority for Mumbai? The plan to make BMC the entire city of Mumbai’s single planning authority is for integrated planning and development of the city in the immediate future. Today, BMC does not know what is happening in Cuffe Parade, Bandra Kurla Complex or other areas like Mumbai Port Trust land, where it has no power to be the planning authority. There are multiple agencies today in the city — like Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), Mumbai Port Trust, and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) — planning development and infrastructure independently. It should ideally be done by a single body. Is the current arrangement not working? There are multiple agencies in the city making their own plans. For example, a citizen residing in MHADA wants a garden in their area. They approach their corporator… Now, the corporator despite wanting to spend money from the corporators fund cannot build a garden as Mhada is the special planning authority in the area. So, technically, the corporator becomes helpless and citizens have to approach multiple agencies. A unified body is the need of the hour, which means BMC can plan in a better way. Within the MVA government, there is strong opposition to the idea of BMC being the single planning authority. What I am proposing for Mumbai is for its betterment. Mumbai has to have a single planning authority if it wants to become a world-class city in the coming years. There are issues like where a school has to come up, where to construct hospitals, where to build a road. All this all has to be integrated… look at cities like Paris, Los Angeles and Barcelona, London. How do you respond to the allegation that Shiv Sena-ruled BMC wants more power by being the single planning authority? It is not about power. It is not that the BMC commissioner wants more power. It is not like BMC does not have work. We have tremendous workload here, but a city like Mumbai should have one authority to plan its growth and future development. Different agencies play different roles. By concentrating these powers, does BMC want to take on the work of building infrastructure like MMRDA or mass housing like Mhada? My proposal does not mean other agencies’ work …. be taken over by the BMC. These agencies can do their own work. What I meant is that the BMC should have the powers for planning and execution can be done by the.same agencies as per the current arrangement. Also, I have just proposed it to the state government, and not implemented the same yet. If the state government doesn’t think my proposal is good, it will reject the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/a-unified-body-is-need-of-the-hour-say-mumbai-civic-body-chief-101612637499924.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||No premium on FSI-free areas on rehab units of Mhada colonies: Bombay HC||Holding that no premium is payable on floor space index (FSI)-free areas like staircase lobby, lift lobby of rehabilitation components in the redevelopment of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) colonies for economically weaker sections (EWS), low-income group (LIG) and middle-income group (MIG) categories, the Bombay high court on Friday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to refund ₹27 crore accepted by the civic body from a city developer towards premium.The division bench of justices RD Dhanuka and Madhav Jamdar passed the order on a petition filed by the developer, SD Corporation, which is redeveloping Samta Nagar colony at Kandivli (East) that is spread over 2,13,867 square meters area and comprises 165 buildings of 65 cooperative housing societies.The developer had moved HC in 2016 after the deputy chief engineer of BMC’s building’s proposal department rejected their plea for exemption from payment of premium on certain FSI-free areas in terms of Regulation 33(10) and some other provisions of the development control regulations (DCR) for Mumbai.The deputy chief engineer had rejected the plea in April 2016 on the ground that there was no provision in the DCR which exempted reconstruction from payment of premium towards FSI-free areas.On October 12, 2017, HC admitted the petition for final hearing and by way of interim order directed BMC to grant occupation certificate to four wings of a rehabilitation building, whose construction was completed by then, subject to the developer submitting an undertaking that they will pay the premium if their petition failed.BMC had then carried the matter to the Supreme Court and under the orders of the Apex Court, the developer had to deposit amount of ₹27 crore, which was later allowed by the Court to be withdrawn by BMC.As regards the exemption from paying a premium, it was submitted on behalf of the developer that under Clause 6 of Regulation 33(5), all the relaxations, exemptions or benefits enumerated under Regulation 33(10) of the DCR in respect of slum rehabilitation projects were also available to the redevelopment of Mhada colonies, under Regulation 33(5) of the DCR.HC accepted the argument and held that the developer was not liable to pay the premium. “Clause 6 of Regulation 33(5) begins with a non-obstante clause which makes it clear that notwithstanding anything contained in DCR, the relaxation incorporated in Regulation 33(10) shall apply to the housing schemes under Regulation 33(5) for construction of tenements under EWS or LIG and MIG categories,” said the bench.The bench added that the rejection of the developer’s application for exemption from payment of premium was “ex-facie untenable and contrary to the plain reading of Clause 6 of Regulation 33(5) read with other regulations of the DCR.“Unless a specific provision for levy of premium under any provision of the Development Control Regulations is made, the respondent no.1 (BMC) could not have demanded any such premium from the petitioners without the authority of law and in violation of Article 265 of the Constitution of India,” said the bench. “On the other hand, since there was a specificprovision for relaxation in payment of premium, the respondent no.1 could not have refused the said relaxation by interpreting the said provision differently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-premium-on-fsi-free-areas-on-rehab-units-of-mhada-colonies-bombay-hc-101612637323100.html

The woman jumped off a Panvel-bound train near the Vashi creek around 10.30pm, with the bag that contained her son’s body. According to police, the woman is suspected to have killed her son at her parent’s house in Pune and returned to Mumbai on Thursday. She was staying with her parents in December. A GRP officer said, “Around 2pm on Thursday, her mother went out for some work leaving her with the baby boy at home. When she returned at 3.30pm, she found that the door was latched from outside and that her daughter and her son were missing. A CCTV footage from the nearby area showed the woman coming out with the bag in which we found the baby’s body. Since the child was not in her lap, we suspect that she may have killed the child inside her parents’ house by slitting its throat. She later put the body in the bag, and then came to Mumbai.” “Her husband and her parents have confirmed that she suffered from depression and was undergoing treatment for the same for the past four years,” he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vashi-suicide-woman-may-have-killed-son-say-cops-101612637140374.html
07-02-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccine achievement rate on decline in Chandigarh||Belying the expectations that Covid vaccine hesitancy will decrease with time, figures show that fewer people are turning up to take the shot in Chandigarh as the drive enters the fourth week. The vaccine was rolled out across the nation on January 16, with healthcare workers being covered in the first phase. It has been extended to frontline workers from other departments, and Chandigarh operationalised more vaccination sites this week.However, in the past three weeks, the percentage of people who got the jab against the number targeted has been on the decline from 52% (January 16-22) to 43.5% (January 23-30) and then to 42% (January 31-February 6). Meanwhile, Chandigarh vaccination coverage stands at just 27.7% and it is among five states and UTs faring the poorest, according to figures released by the Centre on Saturday.“Most people who were enthusiastic about taking the shot have come forward voluntarily. Now, others have to be counselled and motivated, which takes time,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health department.Kang said that based on inputs received from the Centre, all department heads have been told to personally interact with each health worker and form support groups of the vaccinated population to motivate and counsel the remaining ones.“We are increasing counselling material through internal social groups in institutes and also through local TV and FM radio stations. We will also take up the issue in the state task force meeting in the coming days,” she said.On Saturday, the target achievement rate saw a jump to 62%, as 253 of the 411 identified beneficiaries were inoculated across 10 sites in the city. PGIMER director Jagat Ram, who along with his wife Asha Kumari, was among those vaccinated encouraged people to go for it as it is “safe, with minimal or no side effects”.“Mild reaction after vaccination is a good sign, because it means the immune system of the body is reacting to the vaccine and creating antibodies,” he said, adding that mild fever, body ache or joint pains could occur for a day or two, which will subside automatically, and people are free to contact the medical experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccine-achievement-rate-on-decline-in-chandigarh-101612636599596.html
07-02-2021||Delhi||Markets unaffected by chakka jam, but turnout low||Market associations said all shops remained open across Delhi on Saturday despite a three-hour long chakka jam -- a blockade of state and national highways -- announced by farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws. However, traders said the turnout was lower than usual. Members of the New Delhi Traders’ Association (NDTA) in Connaught Place (CP) said all shops were open throughout the day.“But, traders in the commercial and shopping hub of CP did say that the footfall declined by 50-60% compared to last Saturday. Clearly, there were fewer visitors as many people preferred to stay home to avoid any traffic inconvenience as was seen during the tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day,” said NDTA president Atul Bhargava.Sanjeev Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders association, said all shops operated as usual in the upscale market.Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarva Vyapar Mandal, said only around 25% of the usual business happened on Saturday.“There were much fewer shoppers and visitors as many are still apprehensive about coming to the area after the chaos and violence that happened in Red Fort on Republic Day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/markets-unaffected-by-chakka-jam-but-turnout-low-101612634179666.html
07-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chakka jam brings traffic to a halt on highways around Chandigarh||Long queues of vehicles was a common site on highways around the tricity as farmer unions blocked them during a three-hour chakka jam against the contentious agriculture laws on Saturday. The protests largely remained peaceful, and successful as the farmers did not allow movement of vehicles in Mohali district, leaving many people with no option but to walk back to their destination holding their luggage. Buses, trucks and private vehicles lined up on the Chandigarh-Delhi and Chandigarh-Patiala highway, as farmers had blocked the traffic using tractors, two-wheelers and other vehicles at the Dappar toll plaza and Banur toll plaza besides McDonald’s Chowk and Chhat light point in Zirakpur. Hundreds of farmers also gathered at the Chandimandir toll plaza and Barwala toll plaza in Panchkula, bringing to a halt vehicles moving from and towards Shimla and Yamunanagar. The chakka jam that started at 12 noon was finally lifted at 3pm, with farmers blowing horns of their vehicles for a minute, signalling the clearing of national and state highways. Chandigarh borders sealedChandigarh Police had barricaded all entry points. Traffic moved within the city without much disruptions, though protests were held by resident groups at the Hallomajra light point, Matka chowk and other intersections. “I had to go to the PGIMER, but no vehicle was allowed beyond the Mullanpur barrier. I had to walk for about five kilometers as no local transport was available.Some farmers protesting at the site did offer to help me cross the barrier,” said Sikander Sharma, a resident of Nalagarh who was on his way to the PGIMER to see a relative. “I had a job interview and was returning home. The bus was stopped at the McDonald’s light point (in Zirakpur), so I decided to walk home,” said Rudraksh, a resident of Sector 21, Panchkula. “We allowed ambulances to pass, but no other vehicle movement was allowed for three hours,” said Jasbir Singh, a resident of Rani Majra village in Mullanpur, who was among the protesters at the Mullanpur barrier. After the chakka jam was lifted and commuters rushed to their destinations, massive traffic snarls were witnessed at both the Zirapur-Chandigarh barrier and Mullanpur barrier. It took about another hour for traffic flow to smoothen.Satish Kumar, assistant commissioner of police, traffic, Panchkula, said: “Around 300 farmers had blocked the two toll plazas in the district. Additional manpower was stationed to divert the traffic to alternative routes. We also had additional force in case of any emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chakka-jam-brings-traffic-to-a-halt-on-highways-around-chandigarh-101612636479956.html
07-02-2021||Gurugram||Interview with Munish Sharma, commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Manesar||In a major administrative reshuffle, the Haryana government on Thursday night transferred 24 bureaucrats across the state. Munish Sharma, 2014-batch IAS officer, was appointed as the new commissioner of the recently formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM).Sharma, who is the additional labour commissioner, will be holding the charge of MCM, along with his existing duties. The role of a municipal corporation is not unfamiliar to Sharma, who has earlier served as the additional commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) from November 2018 till December 2019. However, this is the first time that he is leading a civic body.In an interviewwith Hindustan Times, Sharma said that he has several new ideas for the civic body. The need for constructing zero-energy government buildings, laying focus on utilising civic body’s resources towards health and education, working in close coordination with MCG, and using past experience to do course correction are some of the key areas that the new civic body will work on.Excerpts from the interview:Unlike other parts of Haryana, Gurugram and Manesar are the only cities in the state where two municipal corporations share a border with each other. Would MCM work like MCG or have its own style of functioning?MCM is a brand new institution, while Gurugram, on the other hand, has really come up in a big way in the last 20 years. It now provides a major share of the state’s revenue. So, creating a separate corporation for Manesar is a major opportunity for the city. There are many cities in the world that are governed by different bodies and yet they have their own distinct flavour and sense of identity. I want MCM and MCG to work in a continuum of sorts — similar to the way the cities of Panchkula, Chandigarh and Mohali operate. If you look at cities like Ajmer and Pushkar in Rajasthan or for that matter Kyoto and Osaka in Japan, they’re not very far apart but they each have something different and unique to offer.What is the one feature you want MCM to stand out for?Globally, there is a lot of focus on sustainability and lean development. Citizens are also aware of the challenges posed by changing environmental patterns and global warming. So whatever development we do now, we’ll have to plan it in such a way that it takes care of the environment. When MCM is constructing new buildings, we can look at adopting the green building concept, such as the one used for the Indira Parvyavaran Bhawan in Delhi. A lot of architecture in our country has historically been smart and genius. Recently, Jaisalmer’s Rajkumari Ratnavati School was in the news for being an AD 100 award-winning sustainable building. Diana Kellogg, the New York-based architect, who completed the project, has addressed the unique needs posed by the geography and culture of Jaisalmer. Within the country, we have a lot of home-grown talent with international exposure who can create similar marvels.What civic areas do you want MCM to focus upon? Are there any first-hand experience from your time in MCG that you want to replicate in MCM?Corporations are meant to provide civic amenities like water, roads, sewage, etc. Corporations in Delhi do a lot of work in terms of health and education as well. While I was at MCG, my predecessors had started focussing on the health sector — something which I want to carry on in Manesar as well. Besides offering dispensaries from where people can get medicines, work on preventive healthcare will also be looked into. We can focus on helping people stay fit by connecting them to the traditional ways of eating and using open-air gyms and parks. As far as education is concerned, I want to identify volunteers looking for opportunities to get associated with government schools and offer assistance. Another feature I want to incorporate in Manesar is the outlines of the Haryana Vision Zero road safety program so that corrective measures can be taken to bring down road collisions at accident-prone stretches in Manesar. This will also ensure equal allocation of road space to all users.Almost all the staff deputed in MCM so far are MCG officials who have been given additional charges. Would this be a disadvantage, especially since officials would have to look into the affairs of two big corporations?We are a new civic body, and we need a lot of hand-holding in the initial stages. A lot of work needs to be done across various departments. We, therefore, need people with proven experience so that they can share vital inputs such as the type of technologies needed for getting certain works done or the ways certain challenges need to be tackled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/interview-with-munish-sharma-commissioner-municipal-corporation-of-manesar-101612633538331.html
07-02-2021||Mumbai||BMS student from St Xavier’s College, Mumbai bags ₹30L annual package||In a first-of-its-kind placement season, which was conducted online across city colleges, a final-year Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) student from St Xavier’s College has bagged a job offering a remuneration of ₹30 lakh per annum.City colleges affiliated with the University of Mumbai (MU) have attracted a mix bag of jobs in the on-going placement season. While in some colleges the annual packages have not matched last year’s numbers, several colleges did much better than the previous year.“Several big companies have not changed their recruitment programme, though smaller companies were affected by the lockdown and the strain of the economic slowdown. However, companies from sectors such as the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and consultancy have managed to offer maximum number of jobs this year,” said Soni George, head of the management studies department and placement convenor of St Xavier’s Autonomous College.At RA Podar College in Matunga, a final-year undergraduate student was offered an annual package of ₹11 lakh in the first phase of placements. Officials from the placement team told HT that while students were content with the salary package offered this year, most were expecting a better variety of job profiles. Some regular recruiters also were a no-show this year.“There has been an increase in the number of finance profiles and a dip in the marketing profiles offered, unlike previous years, for no specific reason. Many of our regular companies either denied hiring for the entire year or displayed uncertainty and delay when it came to recruitment plans,” said a spokesperson for the institute. Last year, the highest package received by a student of the institute stood at ₹13 lakh per annum.At Jai Hind College in Churchgate where the placement process is still underway, the highest salary package received is similar to last year and the institute witnessed a growing trend of more Edu-Tech and Fin-Tech companies offering jobs to their students. Like every year, students have also opted for jobs which not only offer a good profile and package but also allow them the flexibility of applying for further studies along with their job.“More than one hundred registered final-year students of our institute have already been placed in the first phase of placements this year. Along with the regular finance, marketing and HR companies offering jobs, there has been a rising trend of job offers coming from education as well as social sciences sectors,” said Nainesh Koli, placements coordinator for NM College and Mithibai College. He added that the highest salary offered to a student of the institute stands at ₹11 lakh this year. Last year also this figure stood at ₹11 lakh.While many companies are still waiting for the lockdown to end before bringing new employees on-board, in some cases, the companies have already welcomed students with a virtual orientation programme.“Good job profile and remuneration package have been acceptable and as per the students’ demands this year, but the best part has been the decision of some companies to on-board students virtually and letting them absorb the experience while they still can,” said Navin Punjabi, vice-principal of HR College, Churchgate. He added that the highest package received by a student from the college stands at ₹11 lakh this year, similar to last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bms-student-from-st-xavier-s-college-mumbai-bags-30l-annual-package-101612551990133.html

During the call, the two diplomats sparred on democracy and human rights issues.Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the US, said tough talks are “not the right way of doing diplomacy,” when asked about the Blinken-Yang phone call in a CNN interview aired on Sunday.“You don’t have effective foreign policy just by talking tough, or playing tough,” he said on “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” “I think there’s a clear need for a good sense of mutual respect.”Biden has so far signaled a desire to continue international pressure on China over its human rights practices, while China has repeatedly said the two countries should look for areas for cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-hasn-t-called-xi-jinping-yet-says-haven-t-had-occasion-to-talk-101612720262050.html

China and Pakistan consider each other close allies while Beijing’s ties with Phnom Penh are possibly the strongest among southeast Asian countries.China and Pakistan share close military ties, with a senior Chinese general once remarking that it’s the “backbone” of the overall bilateral relations. The Chinese defence ministry on Sunday released separate statements on delivering the vaccines, saying the Pakistani military was the first to receive “vaccine assistance” from their Chinese counterparts.“The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Sunday delivered a batch of Covid-19 vaccines to the Pakistani military at the latter’s request and with the approval of the Central Military Commission,” China’s defence ministry said.“The Pakistani military is the first foreign military to receive the Covid-19 vaccine assistance from the Chinese military.” A video on the handover released by the defence ministry showed the vaccines to be from the state-run Chinese pharmaceutical company, Sinopharm.The PLA will continue to make positive contributions to the building of a community of common health for mankind, the statement said. It did not share details about the number of vaccine doses that were given to the Pakistan army. The defence ministry issued a similar statement on delivering vaccines to the Cambodian military, saying the “Cambodian military is one of the first foreign militaries to receive the Covid-19 vaccine assistance from the Chinese military”.Last week, the first batch of 500,000 Chinese Covid-19 vaccines were sent to Pakistan, days after foreign minister Wang Yi promised Islamabad that Beijing would assist Pakistan with vaccines and accelerate vaccines exports to the country, Chinese state media reported.Besides Pakistan, China is also providing vaccine aid to 13 developing countries, including Brunei, Nepal, the Philippines, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Palestine, Belarus, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, and Equatorial Guinea, with 38 more developing countries in need slated to receive China’s vaccine aid at a later stage, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said last week.“China has supported its companies in conducting joint research and production of vaccines with foreign partners and already exported Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines to countries including the UAE, Morocco, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, and Chile,” Wang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-delivers-covid-vaccines-to-pakistani-military-101612717009167.html

07-02-2021||World||Iran to start Covid-19 vaccinations using Russia’s Sputnik jab||Iran will start its first coronavirus vaccinations this week using Russia’s Sputnik V shot to inoculate health care workers at the epicenter of the Middle East’s worst outbreak.The shots will be given to medical personnel tending to serious cases of the disease in intensive care units from Feb. 9, Iran’s Health Minister Saeed Namaki said on Sunday, without giving more details, according to state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.Some 1.3 million of the most vulnerable people will also receive their first shots by March 20, or the end of the current Iranian calendar year, according to a statement on the government’s official website, dolat.ir. Ali Raisi, spokesman for the government’s coronavirus task force, said in the statement that the vaccines will be free of charge.Iran has reported more than 1.4 million cases and almost 60,000 deaths so far. Officials have blamed US sanctions for hampering their ability to both contain the disease and ward off economic collapse.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s decision to ban British and US-made shots as untrustworthy could further complicate efforts to stabilize the outbreak and begin recovery, though Iran has secured some 4.2 million doses of the UK-based AstraZeneca-Oxford University shot through the global vaccine procurement system backed by the World Health Organization.Sputnik V dealIran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, said the countries would soon finalize an agreement for Iran to produce Sputnik V by April, according to state TV.On Sunday, while the country reported 7,065 new infections overnight, the number of daily deaths from the virus dropped to 57, the lowest figure since May 2020.Iran also unveiled its second locally developed vaccine for the disease, called Razi Cov Pars, a recombinant protein-based vaccine that’s been developed by state-owned Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, state TV reported.The first clinical trial phase of COVIRAN, the country’s other homemade vaccine, was completed last week with 56 volunteers and is expected to be approved for use by the general population by the summer, officials have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-to-start-covid-19-vaccinations-using-russia-s-sputnik-jab-101612713199369.html

The woman recorded Casanova dancing in jail and posted it on Instagram, the newspaper reported.Westchester County Correction Commissioner Joseph Spano said correction officials have revoked Casanova's video visitation privileges because recording videos and taking pictures during a virtual visit is prohibited.“I’m happy to say we don’t have a lot of issues with video visits because inmates know it’s a privilege, not a right,” Spano said.Casanova faces another charge for not wearing a mask, authorities said.An email seeking comment was sent to Casanova's attorney on Sunday.Casanova was among 18 alleged members of the Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation gang charged in a federal indictment in December with a host of crimes in New York City and elsewhere in New York state. Casanova has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit racketeering, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and firearms possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-rapper-casanova-disciplined-for-tiktok-video-dance-challenge-101612711855396.html

07-02-2021||World||‘Will be available for autumn’: Oxford researcher on new version of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||A new version of AstraZeneca’s vaccine to provide immunity against the coronavirus variant first detected in South Africa “will be available for the autumn”, a lead researcher of the vaccine development programme at the University of Oxford said on Sunday. Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at Oxford, told BBC that the researchers have already started working on the first part of the manufacturing process in the university and the new version will be ready to use in the autumn.“It looks very much like (the new vaccine) will be available for the autumn. We’re already working on the first part of the manufacturing process in Oxford, that will be passed on to other members of the manufacturing supply chain as we go through the Spring, and it looks very much like that we can have a new version ready to use in the autumn,” said Gilbert.The vaccinologist commented on the availability of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine after the biopharmaceutical company admitted that the current version, AZD1222, had significantly reduced efficacy against the South African variant called B.1.351. A spokesperson of AstraZeneca reportedly said that the early data from small phase I/II trial has shown limited efficacy against mild disease primarily due to B.1.351.Read | Explained: Why South African Covid-19 variant remains a concern amid vaccinationGilbert said the researchers expect to show this year that the new version of the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) “will generate antibodies that recognise the new variant.” “And then it will be very much like working on flu vaccines, so people will be familiar with the idea that we have to have new components, new strains in the flu vaccine every year to keep up with the new strains that are circulating,” she added.While Oxford researchers continue to work on the new version of their Covid-19 vaccine, US biotechnology company Moderna Inc, known for its messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, announced last month that its Covid-19 vaccine will be effective against the new variants of coronavirus identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa. Moderna said in a statement that the two-dose regimen of its Covid-19 vaccine at the 100 microgram dose is expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-be-available-for-autumn-researcher-on-astrazeneca-s-new-vaccine-version-101612705225170.html

In the travel sector, vaccine passports - a documents carrying the proof of vaccination of a person - will be the much talked about thing.In this digital era, users will be able to access their passports on mobile phones as an app or as part of a digital wallet.The Technical Group of Global Tourism Crisis Committee - a United Nations body - aims to take innovative actions to ensure safe cross border travel and restore international mobility.The committee was created by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) to chalk out a coordinated plan of action for recovering the hard hit tourism industry. The cross sector body includes various UN key agencies. It met for the first time in Madrid in January 2021 to plan the restart of tourism.Support for the standardization, digitalization and interoperability of testing protocols and certification systems, based on commonly agreed evidence and risk-assessment indicators for origin and destination country/territory is one of the key agenda that the committee had called for.Based on these developments, here is the status of vaccine passports around the world:Sweden plans to launch a digital coronavirus "vaccine passport" by summer, assuming there is an international standard in place for the document by then, the government said last Thursday.Iceland is the first Schengen country to issue digital Covid-19 vaccine certificates. Certificates meeting the Chief Epidemiologist of Iceland’s guidelines given by an EFA/EFTA state will be considered valid at the border of the country. Travellers with the certificate need not undergo screening and are also exempted from official border restrictions.The government of Denmark had also planned to roll out vaccine certification but thousands of people have taken to streets protesting against the digital vaccination certificates as they claim the passport implies the obligation to be inoculated.Britain has rejected the introduction of vaccine passports but people can seek proof from doctors' to travel, news agency Reuters quoted vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi as saying.Also Read | You may need vaccine passport for travel next year: All you need to know about itSingapore firms have also developed digital vaccine passports to verify travellers' Covid-19 test results as the borders reopen. These digital health passports allows hospitals and clinics to share healthcare data across borders using the blockchain technology, as reported by Channel News Asia.Hungary is planning to launch an 'immunity passport' that can act as evidence that the traveller had been earlier infected by the coronavirus and thus has antibodies against the disease, CNN reported.Thailand has also proposed to launch vaccine passports to avoid quarantines for the travellers who have been vaccinated, as per media reports. Thailand will also campaign for adoption of same system for easier travel within bloc without the need to quarantine.Israel has unveiled a Green Booklet that will allow people who have been inoculated against the virus to travel and access public spaces/large social gatherings. The passport is available on mobile application and can also be printed out.

Pakistan on Monday received the first batch of 500,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine from China, as the country was gearing up to kick start its immunisation drive.The move comes as the number of Covid-19 cases in Pakistan reached 554,474. With 53 new deaths, the number of fatalities has gone up to 11,967, according to the Ministry of National Health Services.China has granted conditional approval for its second Covid-19 vaccine, ahead of the expected emergency approval from the WHO for two of its jabs that would enable the country to step-up global supplies of the shots.Sinovac Biotech announced on Saturday that CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine candidate against Covid-19, received authorisation from the National Medical Products Administration for conditional mass use in China.It is the second locally made vaccine to be given conditional approval. Beijing authorised the state-owned Sinopharm's vaccine in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-pla-provides-covid-19-vaccines-to-pakistan-army-101612704520510.html

The sessions are part of a broader effort to negotiate a political solution to the nearly six-year conflict pitting Iran-allied Houthi rebels against Yemeni government forces supported by a Saudi-led military coalition.The trip comes just days after President Joe Biden announced that the US will end its support, including some arms sales, of the Saudi-led coalition’s war against the Houthis. The long-awaited move refocused a spotlight on the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and was welcomed by many Yemenis and aid groups that hope the policy change might add to momentum for peace talks.Griffiths’ “immediate priority” in Tehran is to push a nationwide ceasefire, urgent humanitarian measures and the resumption of the political process, his office added. Those goals repeatedly have proved elusive over years of ruinous war that have left the country deeply divided. The visit was planned long before Biden’s announcement, Griffiths’ spokeswoman Ismini Palla said.The Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north in 2014. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and other countries, launched a bombing campaign to expel the Houthis and restore the internationally recognized government months later.Iran, seeing an opportunity to aid a war of attrition against rival Saudi Arabia, has provided the Houthis with military and political support, according to Arab countries, the West and United Nations experts. Tehran long has denied the allegations, despite evidence to the contrary.The war has killed some 130,000 people, including over 13,000 civilians slain in targeted attacks, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Project, and pushed millions to the brink of famine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-yemen-envoy-makes-first-visit-to-iran-to-push-for-peace-101612702428445.html
07-02-2021||World||China issues new anti-monopoly rules targeting its tech giants||China's market regulator released new anti-monopoly guidelines on Sunday that target internet platforms, tightening existing restrictions faced by the country's tech giants.The new rules formalise an earlier anti-monopoly draft law released in November, and clarify a series of monopolistic practices that regulators plan to crack down on. The guidelines are expected to put new pressure on the country's leading internet services, including e-commerce sites such as Alibaba Group's Taobao and Tmall marketplaces or JD.com. They will also cover payment services like Ant Group's Alipay or Tencent Holding's WeChat Pay.The rules, issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on its website, bar companies from a range of behaviour, including forcing merchants to choose between the country's top internet players, a long-time practice in the market.SAMR said the latest guidelines would "stop monopolistic behaviours in the platform economy and protect fair competition in the market."The notice also said it will stop companies from price fixing, restricting technologies and using data and algorithms to manipulate the market.In a Q&A accompanying the notice, SAMR said reports of internet-related anti-monopoly behaviour had been increasing, and that it was facing challenges regulating the industry."The behaviour is more concealed, the use of data, algorithms, platform rules and so on make it more difficult to discover and determine what are monopoly agreements," it said.China has in recent months started to tighten scrutiny of its tech giants, reversing a once laissez-faire approach.In December, regulators launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba Group following the dramatic suspension of the $37 billion initial public offering plan of its payment affiliate, Ant Group. At the time, regulators warned the company over practices including forcing merchants to sign exclusive cooperation pacts at the expense of other internet platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-issues-new-anti-monopoly-rules-targeting-its-tech-giants-101612701244537.html

All you need to know||Which Covid-19 tests are required for international travel?It depends on where you're going.In an effort to limit the spread of new coronavirus variants, many countries are requiring incoming travelers to show a recent negative test.The US, for example, will accept results from either a test that detects the genetic material of the virus — considered the most sensitive type of test — or a rapid test that looks for viral proteins called antigens. The tests must have been taken no more than three days before departing for the US.Health professionals usually give more sensitive lab tests via a nasal swab that take a day or more to yield results. Rapid tests have a turnaround time of about 15 to 30 minutes and are increasingly used to screen people at testing sites, offices, schools and nursing homes. For some rapid tests, users can swab themselves at home.With either test, the US requires electronic or printed proof of the negative result from a medical laboratory. That means that even if you plan to get the faster test you’ll likely need to see a health care provider who can provide documentation.England has a similar setup, accepting results from both types of tests. But health authorities there are imposing extra requirements, including that the tests meet certain thresholds for accuracy. Travelers are told to check to make sure their test meets the standards.After countries instituted varying requirements, officials in the European Union agreed to standardize requirements across the 27-nation bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-covid-19-tests-are-required-for-international-travel-all-you-need-to-know-101612698841702.html

Some other appointments will also be available for other population segments, it added.The move came as daily infections tripled in around six weeks to hit a record 3,977 on Feb. 3 in the UAE. The Gulf state has not given a breakdown for each emirate.A vaccine developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) had been made available to all adults in the Gulf state.Dubai has also made the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines available to citizens and residents of the emirate, with priority given to the eldery, those with chronic diseases and frontline workers.The healthy ministry reported 3,093 new cases on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-temporarily-restricts-covid-19-vaccine-to-elderly-those-with-101612698806480.html
07-02-2021||World||Explained: Why South African Covid-19 variant remains a concern amid vaccination||While governments around the world are rolling out vaccines to provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the South African variant continues to be the Achilles’ heel for authorities. The variant, known as B.1.351, was first detected in South Africa in samples dating back to the beginning of October 2020 and was driving the surge in infections in the country. The strain was later detected in the UK as the country reported two cases on December 23.On February 2, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that B.1.351 has been reported from 10 additional countries in the past week, taking the total to 41 countries. Though the modes of transmission have not changed, the UN health agency cautioned that the variants of concern may be more transmissible.The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has had several mutations during the ongoing pandemic but the South African variant has remained a concern due to the efficacy of vaccines against the strain.Why the South African variant remains a concern?Last month, US biotechnology company Moderna Inc announced that its Covid-19 vaccine will be effective against the variants identified in the UK and South Africa. But the storage requirement and effective cost have made it a less attractive choice in middle- and low-income countries.On the other hand, AstraZeneca, which has signed multiple deals with such countries to provide Covid-19 vaccine, has revealed that the vaccine developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford has shown limited efficacy against mild disease occurring due to the South African variant.According to a Financial Times report, a study conducted by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford University showed that the AstraZeneca vaccine had significantly reduced efficacy against the virus variant B.1.351. After the report was published, AstraZeneca spokesperson responded to it, saying, “In this small phase I/II trial, early data has shown limited efficacy against mild disease primarily due to the B.1.351 South African variant.” The spokesperson, however, clarified that the company has not been able to properly ascertain the effect against severe disease and hospitalisation since the subjects of the study were “predominantly young healthy adults”.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-south-african-covid-19-variant-remains-a-concern-amid-vaccination-101612695515057.html

A search is on and let's pray for their safe return home,” Haideri told The Associated Press.On Saturday, choppers flew to a height of 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) to try to locate the missing mountaineers with no success.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement saying Iceland's foreign minister, Gudlaugur Thór Thórdarson, spoke to his Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, by telephone. Qureshi assured him that Pakistan will spare no effort in the search for the missing mountaineers.Sadpara and his team left their base camp on Feb. 3, a month after their first attempt to scale the mountain failed because of weather conditions.Haideri said Sadpara’s son, Sajid, had returned to the base camp safely after his oxygen regulator malfunctioned at 8,000 meters.Haideri noted Sadpara's experience as a mountaineer who has climbed the world's eight highest mountains, including the highest, Mount Everest, and was attempting to climb K2 in winter.K2 is the most prominent peak on the Pakistani side of the Himalayan range and the world’s second tallest after Mount Everest. Winter winds on K2 can blow at more than 200 kph (125 mph) and temperatures drop to minus 60 degrees Celsius (minus 76 Fahrenheit).A team of 10 Nepalese climbers made history on Jan. 16 by scaling the K2 for the first time in winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-underway-for-3-climbers-on-k2-mountain-in-pakistan-101612683471564.html

The surge forced Dubai to reintroduce curbs on hotels and air travel, and the emirate replaced its top health official last month.Last week, an official from Dubai’s tourism department criticized the lack of compliance that’s driven cases up but said the city is confident about growth prospects.While cases have jumped in recent months, the country has also rolled out an aggressive inoculation program. It has administered 4.2 million vaccine doses in a population of about 10 million, one of the highest rates of vaccinations per 100 people globally.“The current approach for the country is we make available for the people whatever vaccines have been going through the clinical trials, and at the same time partner with different entities to enhance this industry,” Sharif said.The UAE has approved shots developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, as well as China’s Sinopharm. It has also given Russia’s Sputnik vaccine authorization for emergency use, while Dubai last week received the first shipment of AstraZeneca Plc-Oxford University vaccine from India.For the UAE, the priority now lies in striking a balance. “We need to make sure we strike a balance between the numbers of cases but also the social well being and economic well being of our people,” Sharif said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-aims-to-vaccinate-all-eligible-adults-by-end-of-year-101612682522552.html
07-02-2021||World||Erdogan rivals see hidden agenda in new pledge to overhaul laws||Having accrued broad executive power through a 2017 rewrite of Turkey’s constitution, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is promising to have another swing at the country’s basic laws.Just like four years ago, the pledge has kicked off a political storm -- but this time, opposition politicians say, that’s exactly what Erdogan intended.The president’s vowing to take aim at the remains of a charter first adopted by a military junta in 1982, a move that might appear to strengthen democracy. Turkey’s opposition parties instead see an attempt to divert attention from a stumbling economy mismanaged by an authoritarian Erdogan and his increasingly unpopular party.“This is about preventing our citizens from seeing the real problems,” in Turkey, said Ali Babacan, a former economy minister under Erdogan and now chairman of the opposition DEVA Party. “We should never fall victim to efforts to deflect the public’s agenda.”No MajorityThe motives alleged by Babacan and other party leaders tally with parliamentary arithmetic: Erdogan’s coalition of Islamist-rooted conservatives and Turkish nationalists is 23 seats short of the majority needed to enact major legal changes.What’s more, officials accept the reform proposal hasn’t progressed much beyond presidential musings; and there’s no expectation Erdogan plans to hand powers he wields back to the national assembly, a demand made by leading rivals.Any overhaul would cement the role of the new political system in remaking Turkey in Erdogan’s vision, according to a person with direct knowledge of constitutional plans who asked not to be identified.Popularity HitWhen criticizing the current constitution, Erdogan frequently mentions an organization created by the military to keep a close eye on the country’s universities. Yet his oversight has gone even further -- presidential powers to pick loyal university chiefs were expanded, and in recent weeks scores of students in Istanbul who protested just such an appointment have been arrested.Erdogan’s popularity has suffered as the economy and currency were weakened by tussles with the U.S. and Europe, and in the last 12 months by pandemic restrictions. Unemployment and prices have risen, while the president’s AK Party lost local elections in both the business hub of Istanbul and Ankara, the capital.Turkey’s $750 billion economy has rebounded from the Covid-19 slump faster than most of its peers, but the recovery came at a cost.Reserves BingeErdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak, who resigned as economy czar in November, is estimated by Wall Street banks to have spent more than $100 billion of Turkey’s foreign reserves supporting the currency while he engineered a credit explosion.Mortgages and consumer loans at negative real rates kept the economy humming but also maintained inflation in double digits, widened the deficit in Turkey’s current-account and eventually derailed the lira.After replacing Albayrak and the central bank governor, Erdogan said the nation had to swallow “bitter-pill policies” of higher interest rates. Stabilizing the economy will require a slowdown in credit, which will eventually mean a slower pace of job creation.The challenging economic outlook gives the president reason to shift the focus.For much of the past week, Erdogan has attacked the students protesting in Istanbul, claiming the trouble was stirred up by a LGBT community that has no place in Turkish culture.The governing party portrayed the rallies as an example of Turkish elites bent on undermining Erdogan. Its opponents see things differently.“They have thrown a ball of yarn in front of the people,” opposition IYI Party leader Meral Aksener said on Thursday, using a Turkish saying for an attempt to distract attention.“This is about suppressing the voice of mothers who can’t feed their babies, industrialists who can’t produce, and shopkeepers who lost their businesses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-rivals-see-hidden-agenda-in-new-pledge-to-overhaul-laws-101612675921583.html

The central bank has been particularly concerned about a case where it said foreign banks helped grains companies engage in currency speculation through deliverable forwards, affecting the stability of Taiwan's foreign exchange market.Sources told Reuters on Friday that the central bank had sent letters outlining punishments to Deutsche Bank, CitigroupInc, ING and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) for their involvement.Apart from the punishment for Deutsche Bank's Taipei branch, the central bank said in statement that ING and ANZ's Taipei offices would not be allowed to trade Taiwan dollar deliverable and non-deliverable forwards for nine months.Citi's Taipei office would be suspended from trading Taiwan dollar deliverable forwards for two months, it added.Citi declined to comment. Representatives for the other three banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The punishments will come into effect on Monday, the central bank added.The central bank announced its probe into the case last month, which it said involved eight grain-trading companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-punishes-deutsche-bank-others-in-currency-speculation-case-101612677894589.html

Otherwise, the letter stated, the 2022 Games will go down in history as ‘The Games of Shame’ just as the 1936 edition provided a propaganda platform to Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime.The letter was signed by MPs across party, including those from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party, as well as the opposition Conservatives, Bloc Quebecois, New Democratic Party and the Green Party.The letter referenced the House of Commons Subcommittee on International Human Rights statement released in October last year, which accused China of committing “genocide” against it Uighur and other Turkic Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.“We have a unique opportunity to come together with all the world’s humanitarians and democrats and take action by refusing to participate in this global sports festival, on the grounds that doing so would amount to taking part in a sinister, self-aggrandising spectacle staged for the benefit of a regime that is perpetrating the worst possible crimes against humanity against its own people,” the letter stressed.Unlike previous calls for boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, the MPs wanted them to continue but at another venue selected by the IOC. “We are not asking our athletes to give up their Olympic dream, because we know full well how much effort will have gone into pursuing it.However, we believe that there is still time to demand that the International Olympic Committee move the Games to another country if the Chinese government continues its genocidal campaign,” they said.It also added that some may argue that sports and politics do not mix, but in this instance, “We would respond that when genocide is happening, it is no longer a matter of politics, but of human rights and crimes against humanity. We cannot accept the current status quo.”All five of Canada’s main federal parties were represented among the signatories to the letter, which was started by Bloc Québécois MP Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-lawmakers-seek-shifting-of-winter-olympics-from-china-over-uighur-genocide-101612679807207.html
07-02-2021||World||Biggest protests in Myanmar since 2007 draw tens of thousands||Tens of thousands of people marched for a second day in Myanmar’s biggest city on Sunday, and thousands more assembled across the country to protest against the military junta's coup and detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi last week.The protests, which took place despite an internet blackout and restrictions on phone lines, were the biggest demonstrations in the country since the 2007 Buddhist monk-led Saffron Revolution.Crowds in Yangon, the commercial capital, carried red balloons, the colour representing Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy Party (NLD), and chanted, “We don’t want military dictatorship! We want democracy!”Myanmar's military seized power in the early hours of Monday, bringing the Southeast Asian nation's troubled democratic transition to a sudden halt and drawing international outrage.On Saturday, tens of thousands took to the streets in the first mass protests since the coup.On Sunday morning, massive crowds from all corners of Yangon converged on Hledan township, some walking through stalled traffic, and marched under bright sunshine in the middle of the road.They waved NLD flags and gestured with the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of protest against the coup. Drivers honked their horns and passengers held up photos of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi.The scenes broadcast on Facebook were some of the few that have come out of the country since the junta shut down the internet and restricted phone lines on Saturday. Speaking as he filmed the streets, the broadcaster said getting information out might help keep the protesters safe.There was no comment from the junta in the capital Naypyitaw, more than 350 km (220 miles) north of Yangon."They already started shutting down the internet - if they rule more they will repress even more on education, business, and health," said Thu Thu, a 57-year-old who was arrested by a previous junta during pro-democracy protests in the late 1980s. "This is why we have to do this," he said."We cannot accept the coup," said a 22-year-old who came with 10 friends, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. "This is for our future. We have to come out."By mid-morning about 100 people had taken to the streets on motorbikes in the coastal town of Mawlamyine in the southeast, and students and doctors were gathering in the city of Mandalay in central Myanmar.Another crowd of hundreds spent the night outside a police station in the town of Payathonzu in Karen state in the southeast, where local NLD lawmakers were believed to have been arrested. They remained outside in the morning, singing pro-democracy songs.With no internet and official information scarce, rumours swirled about the fate of Suu Kyi and her cabinet. A story that she had been released, which drew huge crowds onto the streets to celebrate overnight on Saturday, was quickly quashed by her lawyer.More than 160 people have been arrested since the military seized power, said Thomas Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar."The generals are now attempting to paralyse the citizen movement of resistance - and keep the outside world in the dark - by cutting virtually all internet access," Andrews said in a statement on Sunday."We must all stand with the people of Myanmar in their hour of danger and need. They deserve nothing less."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biggest-protests-in-myanmar-since-2007-draw-tens-of-thousands-101612679521756.html
07-02-2021||World||China likely to retaliate against UK's citizenship offer for Hong Kong : Report||China is expected to step up retaliation in March against the UK's scheme to offer citizenship to millions of Hong Kong people through British National (Overseas) (BNO) passport, reported Asia Times.Hong Kong residents will now be required to declare if they hold British citizenship under the BNO passport scheme, according to Asia Times.Since last July, analysts suggested that Beijing may strip the Chinese citizenship and Hong Kong permanent residency of BNO passport holders.On January 29, China said that it will de-recognise BNO as a travel and identity document for Hong Kong people from January 31 and reserved the right to take further measures against the UK citizenship scheme.The UK offered a pathway to eventual citizenship for Hong Kong residents. London unveiled its plan in July last year to take eligible Hong Kongers after Beijing's imposition of the draconian National Security Law.Also read| Quad countries to arrange first meeting, amid China's growing influenceTian Feilong, an associate professor at Beijing's Beihang University Law School and director of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said in an interview with TVB on Wednesday that the standing committee would interpret China's Nationality Law for the second time in March if necessary."If the number of BNO visa applicants reaches 20,000 to 30,000 this month, I think it touches an alarming level," said Tian."After BNO status holders are granted British citizenship, their permanent residency, voting rights and social benefits in Hong Kong should be stripped. The Hong Kong government would have to amend its local election and social benefit rules after the reinterpretation of the Nationality Law," he said.In May 1996, the standing committee gave an explanation about China's Nationality Law's implementation in Hong Kong. From July 1, 1997, Hong Kong people were able to keep using British Dependent Territories Citizens or BNO passports as travel documents, but they would not be entitled to British consular protection in Hong Kong and mainland China.It is widely believed that by reinterpreting the Nationality Law, Beijing can easily strip the Chinese nationality of those who are granted British citizenship under the BNO citizenship scheme, reported Asia Times.Also read| Myanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expandHowever, the newspaper said it is more complicated to strip a Hong Kong person's permanent residency as such a move may violate Article 24 of the Basic Law, which states clearly the definition of the city's permanent residents.Moreover, Tian suggested last year that the National People's Congress (NPC) standing committee should interpret Article 24 of the Basic Law. He said, after the interpretation, BNO status holders given British citizenship would lose their rights to vote and to stand for election. These rights are stated in Article 26 of the Basic Law.Many Hong Kong netizens have pointed out that the Hong Kong government won't be able to distinguish whether a Hong Kong person is given British citizenship under the BNO scheme or other schemes, which include the British Nationality Selection Scheme launched in 1990 for 50,000 Hong Kong families, reported Asia Times.However, Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Hong Kong residents would be required to declare to the government if they were given British citizenship under the BNO scheme.Also read| Where Did Covid-19 Come From? Investigator Foreshadows Fresh Clues"People given British citizenship under the BNO scheme would enjoy fewer job opportunities in Hong Kong because they would face more challenges when applying for a visa to enter mainland China. These people would then have to return to the United Kingdom as 'second-class citizens' due to their gloomy prospects in Hong Kong," Lau said.Asia Times said these "punishments" do not seem to be immediate for those who have decided to leave, Beijing's move to stop recognising the BNO as a travel and identity document has hit hundreds of innocent people."Minorities from India, Pakistan and Nepal will have to face the brunt, who only hold BNO passports. They cannot apply for Hong Kong SAR passports and Mainland Travel Permits. These people used to apply for China visas with their BNO passports but they could not do so now," said Mohan Chugani, the former president of the India Association Hong Kong.According to Asia Times, there were about 36,000 Indians, 18,000 Pakistanis and 25,000 Nepals in Hong Kong, according to the last census in 2016. Many of these people hold foreign or Hong Kong SAR passports.14,645 non-Chinese people applied for Chinese nationality in Hong Kong between 2009 and 2018, according to Immigration Department data. Among the people who applied, only 75 per cent succeeded. The rest were rejected or withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-likely-to-retaliate-against-uk-s-citizenship-offer-for-hong-kong-report-101612675434229.html

Two water cannon trucks were parked nearby.The protesters held placards calling for freedom for Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, who were put under house arrest and charged with minor offenses, seen by many as providing a legal veneer for their detention.Also read| Quad countries to arrange first meeting, amid China's growing influenceOn Saturday, new military authorities cut most access to the internet, making Twitter and Instagram inaccessible.

It is speculated that China may react with displeasure to the meeting.The Japan Times reported that for the first time under the Quad framework, the foreign ministers of the four countries met in New York in 2019. The four countries held another meeting last year in Tokyo during the Covid-19 pandemic.During the October meeting, then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has reprimanded the dragon (China) for using its economic power to increase its hegemony over the neighbouring countries in South Asia.Pompeo brought to the forum a denunciation of China's "exploitation, corruption, and coercion" of neighbouring countries. He said, "This is for the soul of the world. This is about whether this will be a world that operates in this sense that we're on a rules-based international order system or one that's dominated by a coercive totalitarian regime like the one in China."The Quad initiative is expected to put an end to the economic coercion tactics of China and cooperation with Japan and other allies will checkmate Chinese development assistance and its hegemony in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-countries-to-arrange-first-meeting-amid-china-s-growing-influence-101612661682842.html

The move may put the country at risk of getting delayed vaccines at higher prices.Under the program, Thailand would be charged extra for booking and it would have limitations on the producers and delivery period. Covax also requires a minimum purchase of 10% of a country’s population for a fast order with conditions and costs, Nakorn Premsri, director of Thailand’s National Vaccine Institute, said in a statement late Saturday.“Acquiring the vaccines directly from the producers will be more flexible because we can decide how much we will buy and also negotiate pricing, which may lead to a cheaper price for large orders,” Nakorn said. Still, negotiations are continuing. With acceptable conditions, Thailand might procure the vaccine through the Covax program in the future.Thailand reported 490 new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, increasing the nation’s total to 23,134. Of those, 18,897 infections have been reported since mid-December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-reluctant-to-join-covax-program-on-strict-conditions-101612662768127.html
07-02-2021||World||Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala first woman, African national to head World Trade Organisation||Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was poised to become the first African and first woman to lead the embattled World Trade Organization, after a South Korean rival withdrew on Friday and the United States reversed its previous opposition.The government of President Joe Biden expressed its strong support for Okonjo-Iweala in a statement late Friday, lauding her experience at the World Bank and leading Nigeria's finance ministry, and pledging to work with her on needed reforms.The twin developments ended months of uncertainty over the leadership of the global trade body, and cleared the way for WTO members to conclude a consensus-based process and confirm Okonjo-Iweala as the next WTO director-general.The US administration of former President Donald Trump had blocked Okonjo-Iweala's candidacy after a WTO selection panel recommended her as chief in October. The decision required consensus.Okonjo-Iweala said she was looking forward to the conclusion of the race and moving forward with needed reforms."There is vital work ahead to do together," the former World Bank executive said in a statement.The US Trade Representative's office said it was ready to get work with Okonjo-Iweala, noting she was "widely respected for her effective leadership and ... proven experience managing a large international organization with a diverse membership.""The Biden Administration looks forward to working with a new WTO Director General to find paths forward to achieve necessary substantive and procedural reform of the WTO," it said. Last week it also pledged a commitment to "positive, constructive and active engagement" on reforms.The Geneva-based watchdog has gone without a director-general since Brazil's Roberto Azevedo quit a year early in August and his replacement must contend with a Covid-induced recession, US-China tensions and rising protectionism.South Korea's trade minister Yoo Myung-hee, a finalist selected from among eight candidates, on Friday withdrew her name after months of diplomatic pressure to bow out."In order to promote the functions of WTO and in consideration of various factors, I have decided to withdraw my candidacy," Yoo said in a statement. She said her decision was made after consulting with allies including the United States.Waiting for WashingtonObservers say the leaderless WTO is facing the deepest crisis in its 25-year history. It has not clinched a major multilateral trade deal in years and failed to hit a 2020 deadline on ending subsidies for overfishing.Many hope the change in US administration will lead to meaningful reforms of the WTO. Some of its functions are paralyzed after the Trump administration blocked judge appointments to its top appeals body.Okonjo-Iweala has previously stressed the need for the WTO to play a role in helping poorer countries with Covid-19 drugs and vaccines -- an issue on which members have failed to agree in ongoing negotiations.The WTO could in theory call a meeting of its 164 members to confirm the next chief at short notice.However, some delegates saw that as unlikely given that Biden's choice of trade representative, Katherine Tai, has not yet been sworn in. Nor has a Geneva-based deputy been selected.The International Chamber of Commerce's John Denton urged WTO members to act quickly."With geopolitical tensions high, the global economy in recession and 'vaccine nationalism' threatening an equitable recovery, there is now no reason for further delay in filling this critical role with the well-qualified candidate at the ready," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigerias-ngozi-okonjo-iweala-first-woman-african-national-to-head-world-trade-organisation-101612666594298.html

07-02-2021||World||Myanmar junta blocks internet access as coup protests expand||Myanmar’s new military authorities appeared to have cut most access to the internet on Saturday as they faced a rising tide of protest over their coup that toppled Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government.Numerous internet users noted a slow disappearance of data services, especially from mobile service providers, that accelerated sharply late Saturday morning. Broadband connection also later failed, while there were mixed reports on whether landline telephone service and mobile voice connections were still working.Netblocks, a London-based service that tracks internet disruptions, said Saturday afternoon that “a near-total internet shutdown is now in effect" in Myanmar, with connectivity falling to just 16% of normal levels.The broad outage followed Friday's military order to block Twitter and Instagram because some people were trying to use the platforms to spread what authorities deemed fake news. Facebook had already been blocked earlier in the week — though not completely effectively.The communication blackout is a stark reminder of the progress Myanmar is in danger of losing after Monday's coup plunged the nation back under direct military rule after a nearly decade-long move toward greater openness and democracy. During Myanmar's previous five decades of military rule, the country was internationally isolated and communication with the outside world strictly controlled.Suu Kyi’s five years as leader since 2015 had been Myanmar's most democratic period despite the military retaining broad powers over the government, the continued use of repressive colonial-era laws and the persecution of minority Rohingya Muslims.The blockages are also adding greater urgency to efforts to resist the coup. In one of the largest protests so far, about 1,000 people — factory workers and students prominent among them — marched down a main street in Yangon, the country’s biggest city, and were met by more than 100 police in riot gear.They shouted “down with dictatorship” and other slogans, marched with their hands in the air and flashed three-fingered salutes, a symbol of defiance adopted from protesters in neighboring Thailand. There was no violence reported.Similar-sized demonstrations took place in at least two other areas of the city. At Yangon’s City Hall, protesters presented flowers to police, some of whom carried assault rifles.Other reports that slipped through the communications blockade said protests were held in other cities, including Mandalay, the second largest.Telenor Myanmar, a major mobile operator, confirmed it had received Friday's order to block Twitter and Instagram. In a statement, Twitter said it was “deeply concerned” about the order and vowed to “advocate to end destructive government-led shutdowns.”“It undermines the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard,” its spokesperson said.Since the coup, social media platforms have been major sources of independent news as well as organizing tools for protests.Amnesty International called the shutdown “a heinous and reckless decision” at a time when Myanmar was coping with the coup, years of civil conflict and the COVID-19 crisis.Those opposed to the coup and the arrests of activists and politicians have also been gathering at night at windows and on balconies around Yangon, banging on pots and pans.On Friday, nearly 300 elected lawmakers from Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party who met in an online meeting declared themselves as the sole legitimate representatives of the people and asked for international recognition as the country’s government.They were supposed to have taken their seats Monday in a new session of Parliament following November elections when the military announced it was taking power for a year.The military accused Suu Kyi and her party of failing to act on its complaints that last November’s election was marred by fraud, though the election commission said it had no found no evidence to support the claims.Suu Kyi and President Win Myint are also under house arrest and have been charged with minor offenses, seen by many as merely providing a legal veneer for their detention.In addition to the 134 officials and lawmakers who were detained in the coup, some 18 independent activists were also held, said the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners in Myanmar. Some have been since released.The office of Australia's foreign minister said in a statement Saturday that the government was “deeply concerned about reports of Australian and other foreign nationals being detained arbitrarily in Myanmar.”The statement said the government was concerned in particular about one Australian who was detained at a police station. The statement did not provide details on the identities of those being held or the reasons for their detention.In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pledged Friday that the United Nations will do everything it can to unite the international community and create conditions for the military coup in Myanmar to be reversed.Guterres said Christine Schraner Burgener, the U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, had a first contact with the military since the coup and expressed the U.N.’s strong opposition to the takeover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-blocks-internet-access-as-coup-protests-expand-101612661679184.html
07-02-2021||World||Roberta Kaplan, the lawyer taking on Donald Trump and the far-right||"I don't really like a bully," says Roberta Kaplan, explaining what drove her to become a lawyer - and is what is driving her now to sue Donald Trump and figures on the American far-right, even though it has led to multiple threats against her.The 54-year-old rose to fame in 2013 with victory in the Supreme Court in the Edie Windsor case, in which it declared unconstitutional a federal law limiting marriage to a union between a man and a woman.The ruling paved the way for legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States in 2015.Armed with this fame and multiple professional distinctions, the Harvard and Columbia graduate, whose wife is a Democratic activist, is now at the forefront of several legal battles against Trump.Co-founder of the Time's Up movement that provides legal aid to victims of sexual assault, Kaplan has sued Trump for defamation on behalf of former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.Carroll has said she was raped by Trump in a New York department store in the mid-1990s.Trump denied the accusation, saying "she's not my type" and calling Carroll a liar, which prompted the defamation suit.Two friends that Carroll confided in at the time are expected to testify and Kaplan is confident her client will win.Kaplan, a commercial litigation specialist, represents a group of plaintiffs who invested in a marketing company called "ACN" that they accuse Trump and his children of fraudulently promoting.Kaplan also represents Trump's niece Mary Trump, who accuses the former president and his brother and sister of depriving her of part of the family inheritance."In all these cases, Trump has acted like a terrible bully, quite frankly," Kaplan told AFP in an interview over Zoom.She says it will take "a lot of patience and stubbornness" to defeat the former president, adding "he's willing and ready to use literally every trick in the book to stall and delay and play games."Beyond Trump, Kaplan is also leading the only civil action against the main neo-Nazis and white supremacists involved in the Charlottesville violence in August 2017.The trial is scheduled to begin in October."I really wish that I had been wrong about seeing Charlottesville as I did -- as a very scary and ominous warning of what was happening in this country and what was yet to come," said Kaplan.- Anti-Semitic attacks -The January 6 assault on the US Capitol proved that the right-wing forces at work in Charlottesville "have continued to grow" and now represent "the single most significant threat to the security of our country," she added.They are a threat to her personal security too, with a private company providing her with daily reports on threats circulating against her on social networks."I'm an open lesbian, I'm a New Yorker. I'm a woman. I'm head of Time's Up.

After a moment, he leaped out and rushed toward the officer. Several shots were fired and the man collapsed in the street.A local judge ordered the officer, who was not identified, held for investigation for two days.The video angered some in the country, which has seen repeated controversies over allegations of police brutality against protesters in recent years. The National Human Rights Institute says that more than 450 people suffered eye damage from supposedly non-lethal projectiles fired by police during street protests that erupted in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-shooting-sets-off-fiery-protests-in-southern-chile-101612661604371.html
07-02-2021||World||Where Did Covid-19 Come From? Investigator Foreshadows Fresh Clues||Scientists probing the origins of the coronavirus are wrapping up a lengthy investigation in China and have found “important clues” about a Wuhan seafood market’s role in the outbreak.Peter Daszak, a New York-based zoologist assisting the World Health Organization-sponsored mission, said he anticipates the main findings will be released before his planned February 10 departure. Speaking from the central city of Wuhan, where Covid-19 mushroomed in December 2019, Daszak said the 14-member group worked with experts in China and visited key hot spots and research centers to uncover “some real clues about what happened.”Investigators want to know how the SARS-CoV-2 virus -whose closest known relative came from bats 1,000 miles away -- spread explosively in Wuhan before causing the worst contagion in more than a century. Daszak said the investigation heralds a turning point in pandemic mitigation.“It’s the beginning of hopefully a really deep understanding of what happened so we can stop the next one,” he said over Zoom late Friday. “That’s what this is all about -- trying to understand why these things emerge so we don’t continually have global economic crashes and horrific mortality while we wait for vaccines. It’s just not a tenable future.”Read more: What We Don’t Know About Coronavirus Origins Might Kill UsWorldwide, Covid-19 has caused more than 105.7 million infections and 2.3 million deaths.The WHO was asked in May to help “identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts.”Lab TheoryThe lack of a clear pathway from bats to humans has stoked speculation - refuted by Daszak and many other scientists - that the virus might have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a maximum bio-containment laboratory studying bat-borne coronaviruses.Read more: Creature from 'Black Lagoon’: CDC warns of fungal infectionScientists visited the lab and asked Shi Zhengli, who has collected and analyzed these viruses for more than a decade, about the research and the earliest known coronavirus cases.‘Whole Gamut’“We really have to cover the whole gamut of key lines of investigation,” Daszak said. “To be fair to our hosts here in China, they’ve been doing the same for the last few months. They’ve been working behind the scenes, digging up the information, looking at it and getting it ready.”The work has been “collaborative,” with Chinese counterparts helping mission investigators dig deeper for clues, he said.“We sat down with them every single day and went through information, new data, and then said we want to go to the key places,” the British scientist said. “They asked for a list. We suggested where we should go and the people we should meet. We went to every place on that list and they were really forthcoming with that.”Daszak is one of 10 independent experts assisting the WHO mission. The agency also has five staff members participating, and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health have two each.Joining ThreadsMission delegates worked in three groups that focused on the potential involvement of animals, the epidemiology or spread of the disease, and the findings from environmental sampling. Genetic sequencing data are helping investigators identify threads linking the information across patients and wildlife, Daszak said.“My feeling is we will be able to say something of some value at the end of this trip -- quite a lot of value, but I don’t want to get into what that’s going to be or which way it points,” he said, adding that the group’s findings are confidential until they are released publicly.Daszak, who was focused on the animal side, said his trip to the Huanan fresh produce market in central Wuhan was especially useful.The so-called wet market sold mostly seafood, as well as meat that included freshly prepared wildlife. It was a focus early in the outbreak, when cases occurred among workers and shoppers, suggesting it might have been where the virus jumped from animals to humans.‘Important Clues’Subsequent research found earlier cases among people not linked to the market, undermining that theory. Investigators looked further and found “important clues” about the market’s role, Daszak said, declining to elaborate.“Right now, we’re trying to tease everything together,” he said. “We’ve looked at these three strands separately. Now we’re going to bring it together and see what everything tells us.”While the food market was shuttered and cleaned almost immediately after cases were recognized, “it’s still pretty intact,” Daszak said. “People left in a hurry and they left equipment, they left utensils, they left evidence of what was going on, and that’s what we looked at.”Scientists in China who took environmental samples inside the market identified sites where traces of SARS-CoV-2 were detected, he said. Investigators also benefited from greater understanding of Covid-19.“We know now what we didn’t know then -- that for every sick case, there were others that were asymptomatic or difficult to distinguish from a cold or cough,” Daszak said. “And so it’s not unexpected that there would have been other cases other than ones that got into hospital. But how many others, when did this start? That’s the sort of thing we’re still working on.”Viruses are passed along “convoluted rivers of emergence” and tracing that journey is complicated and will take “a really long time,” Daszak said. “What I have seen already tells me that there are some real clues about what happened, and I hope that we’ll be able to make a solid explanation of that by the end of this trip.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-did-covid-19-come-from-investigator-foreshadows-fresh-clues-101612659393973.html

"The urgency of that also cannot be overstated."When asked about recent hacks by Chinese and Russian groups of U.S. government computer systems, Majorkas said the administration was working with Congress to see what additional funding could be provided to enhance the security of federal infrastructure and information systems, as well as through public-private partnerships.(Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Daniel Wallis)Also read: Ex-Homeland security official Alejandro Mayorkas returns under Joe Biden||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-homeland-security-czar-vows-to-fight-domestic-terrorism-101612658159050.html

The United States will build on our strong relationships and support these governments' efforts to address forced displacement without placing undue burden on them, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our approach will continue to provide support for their national action plans under the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework through international humanitarian partners," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-moves-to-reverse-trump-s-migration-agreements-101612658562621.html

We are ready to talks to Borrell, the US is also ready for talks with him", added the Iranian Foreign Minister.Earlier this week, Washington said that it was engaged in active consultations with major European countries on the issue of the Iran nuclear programme and expected a unified front to deal with the matter, Sputnik reported.Biden has repeatedly vowed to return the United States to the 2015 agreement, abandoned by his predecessor Donald Trump in 2018. The US President has also called for negotiating a broader agreement with Iran. Tehran, in turn, has rejected the possibility of expanding the nuclear deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-fm-says-biden-admin-doesn-t-have-much-time-to-rejoin-nuclear-deal-report-101612658788110.html

Both of Biden’s small fractures have completely healed, he said.The president’s motorcade stopped at Delaware Orthopaedic Specialists on Saturday afternoon for what O’Connor called a “regularly scheduled 10-week post-injury weight-bearing X-ray.”Biden, 78, injured his right foot while playing with one of his German Shepherds, Major, over the Thanksgiving weekend.O’Connor said Biden had been “adhering to a strict physical therapy regimen” since the injury.“Sprains of the foot can sometimes be a more significant injury than the bony fractures which accompany them,” he said. Saturday’s X-rays were “to check to assure that he has achieved good ligamentous stability.”Major and Biden’s other dog, Champ, will make an appearance during the Puppy Bowl on Animal Planet on Sunday.The dogs and first lady Jill Biden were filmed for a public service announcement focused on the importance of wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic that will air during the Puppy Bowl, a preamble to the Super Bowl.The annual event is focused on raising awareness about pet adoption.

Fifty-three years later, the 91-year-old has the wallet back along with mementos of his 13-month assignment as a US Navy meteorologist on Antarctica in the 1960s.“I was just blown away,” Grisham said told San Diego Union-Tribune after the wallet was handed over to him on January 30.At their home in the San Carlos neighbourhood of San Diego, California, Grisham and his wife Carole Salazar look at the items that were inside when he lost the wallet back in 1968 – his Navy ID card and an “Atomic, Biological, and Chemical Warfare Pocket Reference” card among others.Grisham, who joined the Navy in 1948, was sent to Antarctica as part of Operation Deep Freeze, which supported scientists. He lost the brown leather wallet sometime in 1968 and forgot about it later. In 2014, it was found behind a locker during the demolition of a building at McMurdo station on Ross Island.It took a team of amateur detectives -- Stephen Decato and his daughter Sarah Lindbergh, from US’s New Hampshire, and Bruce McKee of the NGO Indiana Spirit of ’45 -- to track down Grisham. The three have previously worked to return a stolen bracelet to a Navy veteran, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune report.Decato had, in the past, worked for an agency that does research in Antarctica and was sent the wallet by his former boss, George Blaisdell. Decato’s daughter eventually tracked down Grisham through the Naval Weather Service Association, so he could receive 53 years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wallet-lost-in-antarctica-found-53-years-later-101612646955503.html
07-02-2021||India||Only 188 names under consideration for 419 HC judge vacancies||New Delhi: There are currently 188 names in contemplation for appointment as high court judges as against a staggering vacancy of 419 judges -- more than a third of the total positions. Of the 188 names being considered, a majority of the names (112) are pending with the central government with the oldest recommendations for appointment going back to July 2019, HT has learnt through people familiar with the development.As on date, the government has a total of 40 names to clear as judges after the Supreme Court collegium recommended them while another 72 other names forwarded by various high courts are also pending with the union ministry of law and justice.Out of these 72 names sent by the high courts, the law ministry has been sitting on 50 names for more than six months without forwarding them to the Supreme Court collegium for finalisation, compounding the crisis.The law ministry did not respond to queries by the time of going to press.The procedure requires high courts to send the names first to the government for Intelligence Bureau (IB) inputs, following which they are to be sent by the government to the SC collegium. After finalising these names, the SC collegium sends them back to the government for making the appointments. However, under the memorandum of procedure (MoP) on judicial appointments, there is no timeframe for the government to act on a collegium decision.Meanwhile, the SC collegium, which comprises the Chief Justice of India and the two most senior judges of the apex court in matters of appointment of high court judges, has 53 new names for consideration whereas there are 23 other names that are awaiting a final decision by the collegium. Out of these 23 names, some are pending for more than 20 months without the collegium being able to make up its mind, according to the people cited in the first instance who spoke on condition of anonymity.The fresh proposals of 53 names received by the SC collegium include 33 names for the Allahabad high court, which has a shortage of 64 judges out of the total 160; and 22 names for the Bombay high court where 30 vacancies are to be filled up out of the total strength of 94 judges.Notably, even as 188 names are in contemplation, there are 231 vacancies that are going to require the chief justices of the high courts to send the proposals for appointments in order to alleviate the situation.Currently, there are 661 working judges in the 24 high courts, against a sanctioned strength of 1,079. This translates to a vacancy of around 39% in high courts.Recently, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, urged the central government to set a fixed timeline for clearing appointments of judges to the high courts and the apex court after receiving the recommendations of the collegium.Hearing a petition on a related issue on January 27, the bench, which also included justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant, called it a “matter of great concern” that the collegium had not heard from the government for months together after making some recommendations. According to the bench, a proposal would get stuck without knowing the reason whether the government had any objection to a certain name or there were other issues.Justice Kaul had also prepared a chart to highlight the stages where the names were getting stuck, as the judge implored attorney general KK Venugopal, who represented the government, to consider laying down a timeline for the executive to clear appointments in the higher judiciary, with every stage of appointment marked by a definite time period. The A-G had then taken time to study the chart and come back with a response. The next hearing in expected on February 16.After this hearing, the SC collegium has sent 24 names for appointments to the high court, in addition to 16 others that were already pending. Out of these 24 names, the people cited above said the maximum names – 11, are for the Allahabad high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-188-names-under-consideration-for-419-hc-judge-vacancies-101612722348715.html
07-02-2021||India||Heavy damage to two hydel projects at the epicentre||Dehradun/New DelhiMassive floods caused by a glacier breach in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli on Sunday washed away the under-construction Rishiganga hydro project and caused heavy damage to the 530MW Dhauliganga hydel project, officials aware of the developments said.The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), under the chairmanship of cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, met on Sunday to review the Chamoli flooding disaster likely caused by a glacial lake outburst. The incident led to the rising of water levels in river Rishiganga, washing away the Rishiganga small hydro project of 13.2MW, according to a note shared by NCMC.The floods also affected the downstream hydro project of NTPC at Tapovan on the river Dhauliganga, which is a tributary of River Alaknanda, according to people aware of the developments. The force of the water and boulders rolling down from the upper reaches near Raini village completely washed away the under-construction Rishiganga and the debris from there gushed into the Dhauli Ganga river, causing heavy damage to the 530 MW Dhauliganga hydel project, just 10km away.“The river was flowing 10-15 metres above its normal level and took everything along. Only a few concrete structures on the banks remain of the Rishi Ganga hydel project,” said Dhan Singh Rawat, who rushed out of his house in Raini village after hearing a huge explosion.Uttarkhand disaster relief force spokesperson Alok Raven said that the rescue teams initially recovered two bodies from the Dhauliganga hydel power project. Vivek Pandey, a spokesperson for the paramilitary Indo Tibetan Border Police, confirmed that while the Rishiganga hydropower plant was destroyed, the Dhauliganga hydropower plant was damaged.He said at least 42 workers got trapped inside two tunnels at the Dhauliganga plant. While 12 workers trapped inside one tunnel were rescued, at least 30 others were still stuck inside the other tunnel, he added. Another 170 workers at the two plants were missing, Pandey said. About two years ago, residents of Raini village told the Uttarakhand high court that the construction of Rishiganga hydel project could cause damage to those living in the area. In the summer of 2019, villagers filed a public interest litigation in the court, which directed the district magistrate Chamoli and member secretary state pollution control board to constitute a joint team to inspect the Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project site with regard to allegations about the impact on the environment and local people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-damage-to-two-hydel-projects-at-the-epicentre-101612722288717.html
07-02-2021||India||No ‘ghar wapsi’ till farm laws are repealed: Tikait||Bhiwani: Firm on the demand for repeal of three controversial agricultural laws, farmers’ leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday warned the Narendra Modi government that there will be “no ghar wapsi” of protesters camping on Delhi’s borders till their demands were met and those arrested for violence in the national capital on Republic Day released. The leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)-Tikait faction was addressing a rally of a kisan mahapanchayat in Haryana’s Jat land of Bhiwani. “The government still has time to release our protesters. The protesters were taken to Red Fort by fraud… we will not tolerate you (government). We need our youth back. The government said that the protesters had been arrested in sedition. We are telling you (government), release our people from Tihar jail and send them to their villages…,” he said. A tractor parade on January 26 turned violent after several protesters broke barricades to enter New Delhi and clashed with police in several parts. The protestors also entered the iconic Mughal Era monument Red Fort and unfurled their flags from its ramparts. At least 127 people have been arrested so far.Tikait also said that the turban (referring to the farmers) will not bow down before anyone and that the government will have to repeal the three laws that have triggered protests among the farmers since November last year. Veteran BKU leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, meanwhile, directed farmers to convince MLAs to withdraw their support to the bills. “We had mounted pressure on Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) over farm laws and Union minister Harshimrat Kaur had to resign from the Modi government. You should mount social pressure on Dushyant Chautala and other MLAs supporting the government to withdraw their support. The Modi government will bend before you,” he said. Rajewal also called the government a “liar”, saying that the farm leaders have held clause-by-clause discussions with the government officials and ministers but the latter still insisted on more discussions. Last year, SAD had pulled out of the NDA coalition at the Centre. However, independent MLA Balraj Kundu said the BJP government will not fall in Haryana under any circumstance because they are enjoying the support of six independents. “Abhay Chautala had resigned from the Haryana assembly with the consent of BJP to make the farmers’ happy. People should not indulge in such politics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-ghar-wapsi-till-farm-laws-are-repealed-tikait-101612722228685.html
07-02-2021||India||Congressional India Caucus takes up farm protests with Indian envoy||New Delhi The leadership Congressional India Caucus, a group of US lawmakers striving for better ties with India, has called on the Indian leadership to maintain democratic norms and allow peaceful protests. The matter was raised by the leadership of the India Caucus during a virtual meeting with Indian ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu on Saturday to discuss the farmers’ protest, Brad Sherman, the Democratic co-chair of the caucus, said on Twitter.Sherman tweeted that he convened a meeting of the leadership of the India Caucus, including Republican co-chair Steve Chabot and vice chair Ro Khanna, to speak with Sandhu “regarding the farmers’ demonstrations”.“I urged the Indian government to make sure that the norms of democracy are maintained, that protesters are allowed to protest peaceably and to have access to the Internet, and to journalists,” Sherman said.“All friends of India hope that the parties can reach an agreement,” he added.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Sherman’s comments.Sandhu said on Twitter that he had detailed discussions “on varied issues with the leadership of the House Caucus on India and Indian Americans”. He didn’t specifically refer to the farmers’ protest.“Look forward to working closely with them to further strengthening India-US ties,” Sandhu said.The caucus on India and Indian Americans, which is the largest country-specific caucus in the US House of Representatives, has joined organisations, lawmakers and celebrities in the US, the UK and other countries in taking up the farmers’ protest with the Indian side.The US state department on Thursday called for dialogue to address the farmers’ protest and backed peaceful demonstrations and freedom of expression. It also described peaceful protests and unhindered access to information and the internet as indicators of a “thriving democracy”, while offering support for reforms that improve and open up India’s markets to attract private investments.The Indian government has maintained that the farmers’ protest is an internal matter that should be seen in the context of the country’s democratic ethos and the several rounds of talks held by the government with farmers’ unions opposed to three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congressional-india-caucus-takes-up-farm-protests-with-indian-envoy-101612722229226.html
07-02-2021||India||Spotlight falls on risks posed by power projects||New Delhi: Although the Supreme Court took suo moto (on its own motion) cognizance of the 2013 Kedarnath cloudburst and flooding that killed over 5,000 people and an expert committee warned as early as in 2014 that hydroelectric projects could pose a disaster risk to the state, Uttarakhand is still pursuing the construction of hydroelectric projects and dams.This is obvious from an affidavit filed in the SC by the Uttarakhand government on August 28, 2020 in response to an appeal by developers of a hydroelectric project on the Alaknanda river to resume operations following a stay imposed on all hydroelectric projects in the state.The affidavit, seen by HT, says: “It may be respectfully reiterated…that the Uttarakhand government has been facing acute power shortage in recent times and has been forced to purchase electricity amounting to ₹1,000 crore annually, casting an additional burden on the finances of the hilly state...”The Uttarakhand government and the Union environment ministry still don’t have a policy on hydroelectric projects and dams in the state.The SC, in its August 13, 2013 order, ruled that no new hydroelectrical power projects should be set up in the state. In all, 69 projects were envisaged in the region, and 24 were granted environmental clearance. SC sought a detailed and scientific assessment of the cumulative impact of hydropower plants in the state.Following the SC order, a committee headed by Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute, submitted a detailed report which warned that a glacial retreat in the state, coupled with structures built for hydroelectricity generation and dams, could lead to large-scale disasters downstream.The Union environment ministry, in its December 17, 2014 affidavit, also took note of the findings of the Chopra committee report. The affidavit, seen by HT, acknowledged that upper reaches of the state above 2,200 metres were extremely prone to landslides and were located in seismic zones. The ministry sought to study the seismological vulnerability, cloudbursts caused by climate change and advise on the location, size and design of future hydroelectric projects.“We had said in our report that the region above 2,000 metres in Uttarakhand in the valleys is not suited for hydroelectric projects. ...when glaciers recede, there can be a lot of debris and moraines that flow down. Huge boulders also come along. There appears to have been an avalanche and a glacial lake outburst in the Rishi Ganga valley and, as expected, debris and huge boulders smashed into the Tapovan dam,” Chopra said on Sunday after the massive inundation in Uttarakhand’s Rishi Ganga valley caused by a suspected glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) But the environment ministry did not take on board the Chopra committee’s recommendations om their entirety. After six of 24 hydroelectric projects were impleaded in the matter of revoking a stay on hydroelectric plants, the SC suggests setting up another panel to consider the case of the projects. A committee headed by Vinod Tare of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur was set up to review these six projects; the panel submitted a report that the six projects shouldn’t be allowed. The environment ministry recommended setting up another committee to look into the issue, this time headed by BP Das, who used to be a member of an expert appraisal committee (EAC) that had cleared some of the six projects in his tenure. The panel recommended certain hydropower projects with design modifications.“The Ravi Chopra committee report has been in limbo since then because the environment ministry kept forming committees to ensure the six hydropower projects get to resume work. Not just dams and hydroelectric projects, now extensive slope cutting and deforestation have added to extreme vulnerability of Uttarakhand to climate change impacts,” said Mallika Bhanot of Ganga Ahvaan.“To say that today’s Rishi Ganga disaster is a natural disaster or God’s act is the biggest lie. The state and Centre have brought this disaster on the people. In 2014, our report had clearly highlighted that dams and hydropower projects are not suited for this terrain and after that SC stayed 24 projects. If not for that stay, today there would have been lakhs of deaths because most of those projects are located upstream and downstream of the Rishi Ganga valley. The government has no decision on cancelling hydropower projects completely. They have also felled lakhs of trees in the char dham ghati (region), cut hill slopes which has made locals even more vulnerable,” said Hemant Dhyani, an environmentalist and member of the Ravi Chopra Committee.The environment ministry recommended environmental clearance to Lakhwar dam in Tehri Garhwal district with certain riders on December 2, 2020.“The fact that the Union environment ministry has granted environmental clearance to Lakhwar dam on Yamuna shows they want to build more dams. So expecting a policy on cancelling all dams and hydropower projects is futile. The SC, following the 2013 disaster (in Kedarnath) had stopped all dams in Uttarakhand, then they reduced the scope of the stay to Ganga while projects were allowed on the Yamuna, Kali etc. Despite the Ravi Chopra committee’s’ clear-cut findings, we didn’t learn a lesson. How many wake-up calls do we need? I can tell you if the Lakhwar dam breaks, Delhi has had it. Its entire population will be impacted. No dams or other structures should be allowed in the Himalayas now,” said Manoj Mishra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan.HT tried reaching RP Gupta, secretary of the environment ministry, for a comment on the policy on dams and hydropower in Uttarakhand, but was unable to contact him until late on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spotlight-falls-on-risks-posed-by-power-projects-101612722168684.html
07-02-2021||India||Experts cite impact of climate crisis||New Delhi: Massive inundation in Uttarakhand’s Rishi Ganga valley caused by a suspected glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) on a clear winter’s day has unnerved scientists. GLOFs and resulting disasters downstream during extreme rainfall events in glacial regions are commonly forecast by scientists. But this time scientists have seen it happen in winter, when such events are least expected.The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation i stills investigating the matter and has not been able to zero in on the exact reason for the flooding as yet. “Our team is there. We do not suspect an avalanche. There may be glacial lake formations, but we cannot say with certainty now. We are investigating the entire region,” said Jimmy Kansal, joint director at SASE.The flood caused large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas, with 50-100 labourers working on the Rishi Ganga power project missing.Homes along the way were also swept away as the waters rushed down the mountainsides in a raging torrentIt is difficult to say exactly what happened,said D P Dobhal, a former glaciologist at Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.“Locals have told me that water and debris were flowing at great speed for about 15 to 20 minutes this morning and then the flow reduced gradually. This indicates a lake outburst. It’s possible that water and debris accumulated in a lake in the glacial region of Rishi Ganga valley breached due to an avalanche. Its also possible that the avalanche took place earlier, like yesterday or very early in the morning today. The water filled up in the lake and breached. It may be very similar to what happened in 2013 with the Chorabari lake during the Kedarnath disaster. Only difference is that this time it’s in winter and that was during monsoons,” said DobhalIn the early hours of June 17, 2013 a flash flood came down upon the overflowing banks of the Chorabari lake in Uttarakhand. Carrying huge amounts of silt and rocks, it killed at least 5,700 people, and left unprecedented damage and destruction.Dobhal added that GLOFs will increase because of climate change. “Lakes have always formed in glaciers and some glaciers have retreated while some advanced. These are stages. But due to global warming, more glaciers are melting or retreating and there is less snow. This is very apparent in Nepal and Sikkim and not so much in Uttarakhand,” Dobhal added.Prof Anil Kulkarni of Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, also suspected that the flooding may be linked to a GLOF. “When glaciers retreat, glacial lakes are formed. These lakes are formed in the area vacated by the glacier. Several lakes have formed in the Rishi Ganga valley. We don’t know which one may have burst. In winter, the top layer of these lakes is frozen. During an ice avalanche or a landslide this top layer is breached and water can flow downstream, toppling the earthen dam. This is a common problem seen in glaciated terrain. We have seen this in Nepal but not in Uttarakhand so far. This is a classic case of climate change impact on the glacier. We have again and again highlighted that such disasters will become exceedingly common due to climate change as more and more glaciers retreat,” explained Kulkarni, a glaciologist and scientist at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change, IISc.Kulkarni’s team has studied various aspects of such glacial lake discharge events. For example, last year the team modelled the impact of a GLOF on a hydroelectric project downstream of Satopanth glacial lake and found that a GLOF, combined with an extreme flood event, can cause extensive damage to the project. The study recommended regular monitoring of the Satopanth lake, especially during post-monsoon season, due to the potential risk it poses to the downstream region when combined with high-intensity rain events.A large number of hydroelectric power plants (HEP) were damaged in the 2013 cloudburst and GLOF inKedarnath. The 400 MW Jaypee (JP) Vishnuprayag hydro-electric project (HEP), located 28 km downstream of the Satopanth lake, was one of the projects damaged by the 2013 cloudburst.“Due to the fact that a number of glacial lakes exist within the limits of the Vishnuprayag HEP catchment, GLOF risk assessment for this hydropower station becomes very vital,” a study by Kulkarni’s team said.Kulkarni’s team, in its science brief on GLOF, recommended long-term strategies to prevent GLOF disasters including identifying locations vulnerable to such events using computer simulations, monitoring lake expansion, determining structural strength of the moraine dam, maintaining safe water level in the lake through siphoning, and determining future glacier lake sites using remote sensing techniques.On Sunday, there was an avalanche in Rishi Ganga valley 50 to 100 metres upstream of its confluence with Dhauliganga West. A small hydroelectric project of about 11 MW in the Rishi Ganga valley was totally destroyed. The barrage of the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project has also been damaged and water entered the intake tunnels. Around 50 workers were working at the plant at that time out of them 30 to 35 are feared to have been washed away. Around 10 villagers who were out with cattle on the mountain slopes may have also been washed away, according to initial reports received by Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute and chairman of the Supreme Ccourt-constituted high powered committee monitoring the Char Dham road project in Uttarakhand.“We cannot comment on this specific event because the ministry of earth sciences doesn’t monitor avalanches. We know that the 2013 Uttarakhand disaster was related to a glacial lake. However, from the climate change perspective we can definitely say that the glaciers to the western side of the Himalayas are retreating while many of those in the eastern side have also recorded advancement of glaciers. So glacial lake disasters are expected,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-cite-impact-of-climate-crisis-101612722108713.html
07-02-2021||India||Ahead of VK Sasikala's return, Tamil Nadu govt confiscates properties of her kin||On the eve of VK Sasikala’s return to Chennai, the Tamil Nadu government on Sunday took ownership of six properties belonging to Sasikala's relatives and co-accused in the disproportionate assets, J Ilavarasi and VN Sudhakaran.In a press statement, the Chennai district collectorate informed that the properties were brought under its revenue department's limits keeping in line with a 2017 Supreme Court order in the case. The top court in its judgement had directed the state to confiscate more than 100 properties of the convicts in the case following which the state had directed six district collectors to do so.Sasikala completed her four-year prison term in Bengaluru in the disproportionate assets case on January 27 but remained in the city’s Victoria hospital where she was treated for Covid-19. Ilavarasi also tested positive and was released from prison on February 5. According to the family members, they will return to Chennai via road together while Sudhakaran is yet to be released.Also read: Night ops to continue in Uttarakhand, says ITBP; alert in UPIn September 2020, the I-T department had attached Sasikala’s under-construction bungalow opposite late AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa’s residence ‘Veda Nilayam’ in the upscale Poes Garden and 64 other properties under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act. Previously in 2017, the Income-Tax department had attached properties of Sudhakaran and other associates of Sasikala.The AIADMK has been firefighting fearing deflection when their former interim general secretary and close aide of J Jayalalithaa returns to Chennai from Bengaluru on Monday. On Sunday, there was additional security at the party headquarters in Chennai while chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami was campaigning in the city.Palaniswami chaired a meeting on Saturday night with senior party leaders urging for them to be united. There is already security cover at ‘Veda Nilayam’ which the government turned into a memorial on January 28 and Jayalalithaa’s burial place has been closed a week after inauguration on January 27 citing finishing works - both acts seen as a way to prevent Sasikala’s entry. Sasikala was staying at 'Veda Nilayam' until she was convicted in the case.“Betrayers who meet Sasikala will be expelled,” party spokesperson, Vaigaichelvan told reporters. The party has so far expelled their Karnataka state-in charge for planning to meet Sasikala and several functionaries for putting up her posters. But on Sunday, innumerable posters welcoming Sasikala sprung up.AIADMK ministers have filed two complaints at the DGP office against Sasikala for using the party flag in her car. They also urged the police to ensure law and order isn't affected on her return. “Sasikala and Dhinakaran have plans to disrupt the law and order and have decided to blame the AIADMK for the chaos,” law minister CV Shunmugam told reporters outside the DGP office.Meanwhile, Sasikala's family, including her nephew and chief of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), TTV Dinakaran, are in Bangalore to bring her back. The situation erupted into a war of words between AIADMK leaders, the breakaway faction of the AMMK as well as the DMK on Sunday. Dhinakaran expressed that it was laughable to watch ministers filing complaints against them. AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar called Sasikala and Dhinakaran as the B-team of the DMK. Reacting to that, former Union minister Dayanidhi Maran asked which team Jayakumar belonged to. Speaking to reporters in Karaikudi, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram said, “Entire AIADMK cadre will go to Sasikala, we don’t know whether it is before elections or after when they lose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-on-vk-sasikala-s-return-tamil-nadu-govt-confiscates-properties-of-her-kin-101612721769540.html
07-02-2021||India||Election or nomination? Cong divided over CEC||NEW DELHI: As more details of Friday’s Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting emerged, it is now clear that the new bone of contention between party leaders who in August called for an overhaul of the organisation and staunch loyalists of the leadership is a demand that members of the Central Election Committee (CEC) be elected, not nominated.Hindustan Times has spoken to several delegates who attended the meeting, including signatories to the letter written in August to interim chief Sonia Gandhi in which they demanded a “full-time and effective” leadership that is “visible” and “active.” The people, who requested anonymity, confirmed that the schedule for elections to the post of president and CWC members was accepted, but a spat ensued when the demand was voiced for even CEC members to be elected.. The demand was articulated by Ghulam Nabi Azad, leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, his deputy Anand Sharma, and former finance minister P. Chidambaram, who wasn’t a signatory to the original letter, but supported elections to the CEC, the people said. They said CEC members should be chosen by the same electoral college that takes part in the election of the president.The CEC, headed by Sonia Gandhi, selects the party’s candidates to all elections and so is a very powerful body. At present, its members include Rahul Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, senior leaders AK Antony, Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik, KC Venugopal, Mohsina Kidwai, Girija Vyas, Janardan Dwivedi, M Veerappa Moily and Oscar Fernandes.The oppositionto the proposal was initially in the form of a healthy debate. Antony opposed the proposal in what one letter writer described as a “sober manner.” Soni asked if an election to the CEC would require an amendment to the Congress’s constitution and Sharma clarified that it didn’t.It was around that point of time that Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot used “harsh words” against the letter writers to their shock. Since the December 19 meeting with Gandhi, there had been a feeling that a rapproachment was in the works, especially with Venugopal and Soni reaching out to the letter writers to understand their concerns and implement reforms within the party.Speaking in Hindi, Gehlot is learnt o have questioned the need for the 23 leaders to send such a letter in the first place. “Nobody even knows your names, nobody recognises you,’’ Gehlot is learnt to have said. To which Sharma responded: “That may well be true. I don’t have any identity but that of the Indian National Congress. And it’s because of that our face and name are known. And that’s why you are also known. This is not the way to talk. Nobody has given you the authority to insult your colleagues.’’Rahul Gandh then intervened. “I can understand the emotion that Ashok Gehlot had expressed (his views with) and what he was feeling, but at the same time I agree with Anand Sharma ji and feel that harsh words should never have been spoken,” people who attended the meeting quoted him as saying. A letter writer said the delegates were taken aback by the Rajasthan CM’s words. “Just because he is a chief minister, it doesn’t give him authority over us. There are six former chief ministers among the letter writers,’’ said this person.Hindustan Times reached out to CM Gehlot’s office, but received no response. A spokesperson for the Congress denied that there had been any harsh exchange of words at the meeting.While the letter writers want elections at all levels and the CEC is one such forum, a former CWC member told HT that the CEC’s membership carried the kind of prestige that even the CWC, the party’s top decision making body, didn’t have. “It’s the only one where a member can feel important and seems to influence who gets a party ticket,’’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-or-nomination-cong-divided-over-cec-101612721388666.html
07-02-2021||India||U'khand glacier burst: Scientists to be airlifted to affected areas, says IAF||A team of scientists from Delhi have reached Dehradun and they will take aerial reconnaissance in areas affected by the glacier burst in Chamoli district of Uttarkhand, Indian Air Force Public Relation Officer Wing Commander Indranil Nandi on Sunday."All the specialised personnel who were airlifted from Delhi have reached Dehradun. The airlifting of these personnel from Dehradun onwards to the affected areas will start at 6:45 am tomorrow," Nandi said while briefing media about the ongoing rescue operation led by the IAF in the state."Scientists with specialised equipment will also be taken to the areas for aerial reconnaissance. We will ensure that maximum bases are available to support the operations," he added.Meanwhile, Inspector General of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Amrendra Kumar Sengar said, "Since the flow of water was very fast initially, bodies are being recovered far away from the incident site. Some are trapped in deep areas and others in tunnels, so there is an issue of access."Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar said that the rescue work at the National Thermal Power Corporation's (NTPC's) 900-meter long Tapovan Tunnel had to be halted due to a rise in water level.The Indo-Tibetan Border Police's (ITBP) Public Relation Officer had earlier said that almost 30 labourers have been trapped inside tunnel number 1 in Tapovan area, adding that 12 workers were rescued from tunnel number 2 after a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off at Joshimath in Chamoli.A glacial broke in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli District of Uttarakhand on Sunday led to massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda Rivers and damaged houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project.

07-02-2021||India||Nearly 6mn vaccinated, India ranks 3rd in world||India now ranks third among countries for the highest number of Covid-19 vaccines administered to citizens, with close to six million people having been inoculated against the viral disease in the first 23 days of the immunisation drive launched on January 16. The country that has vaccinated the most number of people is the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, with 36.82 million and 11.48 million, respectively, having received a vaccine.“India has scaled another global peak in its fight against Covid-19. India has become the third topmost country in the world in terms of the number of COVID19 vaccine doses administered. Only the United States and the United Kingdom remain ahead of India,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Sunday.According to the health ministry, states in India have vaccinated more than 200,000 beneficiaries each. Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous state, alone accounts for 673,542 of all vaccinations so far, followed by Maharashtra with 473,000 and Rajasthan with 459,000.As of 8 pm on Sunday, February 7, a total of 5,775,322 people have received a Covid-19 vaccine under the countrywide inoculation drive. The cumulative vaccination coverage includes 5,304,546 health-care workers and 470,776 front-line workers -- municipal staff, police personnel, civil defence staff and so on -- across the country.Close to 400,000 vaccinations have taken place in the country across 9,000 sessions in the past 24 hours, and at least 100,000 vaccination sessions have been conducted so far in the country.There has been a sustained increase in the number of people being vaccinated every day, with as high as about 500,000 individuals getting vaccinated on some days.The number of adverse events following immunizations has also been one of the lowest in the world, with close to 10,000 adverse events reported among health workers in the past 23 days. Twenty-eight persons have been hospitalized in the country after vaccination; there has been no serious adverse reaction due to Covid-19 vaccines. The total percentage of adverse reactions out of total vaccinations is roughly about 0.0005%. Among 22 deaths reported of health care workers who were vaccinated against Covid-19, none has been linked to the vaccine. “There is a thorough investigation that follows post any deaths in persons who are vaccinated in the country. The post-morten is conducted by a medical board that comprises at least three doctors. There are also adverse events following immunisation committees at the state and national level that go through the data and reports. So far, our experts have not established causality in any of the deaths,” said a senior health ministry official with knowledge of the matter, who did not wish to be identified. The debate regarding the safety of Covid-19 vaccines is also settled, said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, citing Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) data. “There has been no death attributed to the vaccine, and if there is a side effect in one in 1,150 people, then it is hardly a side-effect. The Covid-19 vaccines are as safe as they can be,” he said.The country has also reported less than 80 daily deaths related to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, which is the lowest in nine months.The country’s Active Caseload was 148,766 as of Sunday. The present active caseload consists of 1.37% of India’s Total Positive Cases. “India’s cumulative recoveries stand at 10, 522,601 today. The Recovery Rate is 97.19%. 81.07% of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 6 States/UTs,” the health ministry statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-6mn-vaccinated-india-ranks-3rd-in-world-101612721332286.html
07-02-2021||India||Need highways road safety police: Report||New Delhi: The Centre and states must form dedicated national and state-level highway road safety police, and enhance the institutional framework with statutory bodies in the form of road safety authorities with quasi-judicial powers and sizable funds, the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPRD) has recommended. A National Road Safety Plan (NRSP) prepared by former director general of police and chairman of the Telangana road safety authority, T Krishna Prasad, circulated to all states and Union territories for implementation, has also recommended deploying an advanced life saving ambulance for every 100 kilometres of road length on the highways as well as use of drones and air ambulances to rescue accident victims and provide food and medical help. The report, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT, has come against the backdrop of the National Road Safety month being observed by the Centre between January 18 and February 17. “In India, enforcement is majorly restricted to city limits only. There exists no enforcing mechanism on national and state highways. Hence it is anticipated that the road crashes and deaths are happening more on highways. In fact, 55% of road crashes and 62% of road fatalities happen on just 5% of road length of National and State highways,” said the report, which suggested “effective enforcement activities” on national highways, state highways and other roads. According to data from the ministry of road transport and highways, road accidents claimed nearly 150,000 lives in 2018. India is a signatory to the United Nations Brasilia Declaration on road safety, which called for reducing road fatalities by 50% by 2020. The BPRD’s report suggests the formation of a National Highways Road Safety Police (NHRSP) for strict enforcement of rules against traffic violations on highways across India. Similarly, there should be a dedicated State Highways Road Safety Police (SHRSP) for state highways. “The highway development in India has seen a much-awaited push since last two decades. The road length has increased considerably by construction of several multi-lane highways. However, over the same time, the safety performance of the roads has deteriorated in terms of increase in the number of road fatalities,” it added. The report said that if implemented, the NRSP will result in an annual reduction of 12% to 15% in road accidents and fatalities and will increase traffic law compliance among road users, and encourage good driving practices. Subsequently, it will provide employment to around 32,000 people. The report said that “a budgetary support arrangement coupled with a pan-India Road Safety Police” will effectively complement India‘s endeavour to reduce road accident deaths and also result in saving of the cumulative loss to gross domestic product (GDP) to the extent of about ₹5 lakh crore by the end of the fifth year. On top of that, a notional 37,667 human lives would have been saved when the National Highway Road Safety Police is deployed, the report estimated. Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, while inaugurating the first ever National Road Safety Month last month, said that the government aims to halve road accidents and deaths before 2025. Gadkari also said India had recorded a significant drop in road accidents and deaths in 2020 compared tot 2019 partly due to the lockdown induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. “A total of 1.5 lakh people died, while more than 4.5 lakh people got injured in road accidents every year, resulting in social-economic losses from accident deaths equivalent to a shocking 3.14% of GDP every year,” Gadkari added. He said 70% of road fatalities were in the age group of 18 to 45 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-highways-road-safety-police-report-101612721330417.html
07-02-2021||India||India unprepared for roll-out of 5G: House panel on IT||New Delhi: India is entirely unprepared to roll out 5G telecom services, the parliamentary panel on information technology said in a report adopted on Wednesday, blaming the government’s “laidback” approach to the launch of the technology. A telecom official said 5G trials were set to start soon and a roll-out was likely by early 2022. The panel, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, concluded that “sufficient preparatory work has not been undertaken for launching of 5G services in India. As such, India has not moved beyond the modest beginning stage as compared to other countries in the world”. On January 28, Prasad had said that the test bed for the next generation technology was ready and the country would be using indigenously made telecom equipment. The minister added that the government would soon grant a permit for the 5G trials.“We lagged in 2G, 3G and 4G but in 5G India should move at a speed faster than the world with made-in-India 5G. We have made a test bed and we are soon going to permit it. Core network should be Indian,” Prasad said at a National Informatics Centre Services Incorporated (NICSI) event to launch government e-office tools. Government officials familiar with the matter said the 5G trials are likely to commence soon and the technology will be rolled out across metropolitan cities by early 2022. “It will be rolled out in the metros first and then percolate to other parts of the country,” an official said on condition of anonymity. In its report, the parliamentary committee raised concerns that the advent of 5G services in the country may be further delayed, judging from previous experience.“While 2G was deployed globally in 1991, it was deployed in India only in 1995; 3G was deployed globally in 1998 but deployed in India ten years later, i.e. in 2008. Similarly, 4G services were launched in India seven years after their global launching in 2008. This reflects very poorly on our planning and execution. Now when many countries are swiftly moving towards 5G technology, India is likely to witness its deployment only by the end of 2021 or early part of 2022, that too partially,” said the report, a copy of which was sen by HT. At a January event by industry lobby Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), Prasad said India did not want to miss the 5G bus and urged Indian companies to be “proactive in creating an Indian 5G model.” India is still evaluating its 5G testing models. Several countries around the world have already deployed 5G, and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s chairman Mukeh Ambani said in December that his company would do so in “the second half of 2021.” That may not happen because India is yet to auction radio waves (spectrum) for 5G. Unless time-bound action is taken, “India is going to miss the bus on 5G opportunities,” the parliamentary committee report warned. The Department of Telecom had earlier set the target of starting 5G trials in 2019 and roll out the next-generation service in 2020-21.Because of claims by the defence ministry and space department on part of the spectrum that was identified for 5G services, the deadline was missed. Government officials familiar with the matter said that the issues, as far as the availability of spectrum were concerned, have been resolved after meetings with the cabinet secretary. “The concerned ministries and the cabinet secretary have met regarding spectrum availability. Sufficient spectrum will be available,” the official mentioned above said. Concerns flagged by the parliamentary committee include lack of preparedness, spectrum issues and, uncertainty around sale of radio waves for 5G, among others. “The Committee finds that inadequate availability of spectrum, high spectrum prices, poor development of use cases, low status of fiberization, non-uniform RoW {right of way} issues, deficient backhaul capacity, etc. are some of the factors coming in the way of rolling out of 5G services in India,” the report said.The official cited above added that as far as pricing was concerned, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had made its recommendation, but a final decision would be taken by the government. “The price TRAI has recommended may be high, but ultimately the government will decide what is a fair offer.”The official added that DoT has already conducted a hackathon and identified 100 uses of 5G; it awarded Rs. 1 lakh per entry in the contest. “Initially, 5G will be rolled out on the existing 4G core. It will then be developed further,” the official said. The official further stated that the price of 5G mobile handsets would also come down once the technology becomes commonplace.The panel also highlighted security concerns surrounding the roll-out of the technology and the vulnerabilities it presents.“Reliance Jio has informed the Committee that from 5G onwards, technology will become much more intrusive in our business operations, given the applications, widespread digitisation, e-governance, the smart city project, all the cameras in a city, the data centres, the devices and the chipset in the devices, etc. Now, the more open and denser this whole network gets, the more vulnerable it becomes to threats,” the report cautioned. “Because of the increased dependency of communication networks, the hacking of 5G networks is a very clear national security risk. The only solution is to build secure and trustworthy indigenous communication infrastructure,” the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association informed the panel, said the report. The threats are simplified as STRIDE, where S stands for Spoofing, T stands for Tampering, R stands for Repudiation, I for information disclosure,‘D for denial of service making the network unavailable when it is needed, and E for what they call the escalation of privileges. “Because of the increased dependency of communication networks, the hacking of 5G networks is a very clear national security risk. The only solution is to build secure and trustworthy indigenous communication infrastructure,” Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association informed the panel, according tot the report. The parliamentary committee has factored in that massive data, both personal and non-personal, which will demand special efforts for its protection, will be generated with the adoption of 5G services.“The growing concern over availability and protection of user data and privacy will exacerbate with security challenges in 5G. The Committee are aware the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is still under consideration of the Government and will deal with various data security issues.” It has recommended that indigenous intellectual property rights, equipment and software should be encouraged and developed.The panel has also considered the global security concerns surrounding telecom equipment provided by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and ZTE Corporation, twomajor Chinese equipment providers in India.The US and European Union have banned Huawei over these concerns, India has not taken any specific call on the matter. “In view of the security-related concerns raised by various countries, such as USA and European Union, the Committee feel that adequate precautions should also be taken by India before installing telecom equipment from Chinese sources in the Indian telecom network including 5G. The Committee desire that in-built safety measures be put in place to ensure that the security of the country is not compromised. The Committee also desire that such safety mechanisms should be strictly adhered to by public and private telecom companies,” the report said. Telecom expert Mahesh Uppal said 5G will present its own challenges and that the country was not really prepared to roll out the services on any significant scale.“I think what the officials are saying suggests that there has been some movement and the government has been working on freeing up more spectrum for 5G,” Uppal said. “We still do not know whether the last word has been said on that.”Uppal added: “A more important issue is that price of spectrum is too high.

07-02-2021||India||Raj CM opposed ‘love jihad’ law, but govt stand contrary||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has criticised several BJP-ruled states over new anti-conversion laws, saying these legislations “will leave consenting adults at the mercy of state power”, but his government appeared to take a contrary stand before the Supreme Court in a December 2019 affidavit, in which it did not object to further scrutiny and prior approval by the state machinery into interfaith marriages.The Rajasthan government supported making it mandatory for anyone wishing to change his or her religion to first inform the district collector, and then wait for an approval; endorsed that there must be a gap of at least a week between the conversion and wedding; and said that those facilitating the conversion as well as the wedding should be made responsible for making sure there no coercion is involved.These requirements for an interfaith marriage, which have some similarities with the controversial ordinances issued recently by the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh government against forcible conversion, are currently in force in Rajasthan through a high court order, which the state has chosen to implement and not appeal.To be sure, the state has not promulgated any law of its own to govern conversations, for marriage or any other purpose.In its affidavit dated, December 16, 2019, the state informed the Supreme Court that the government has issued instructions to the director general of police and to all divisional commissioners and district collectors to enforce the directions issued by the high court on making inquiries before conversion and interfaith marriages.The Rajasthan government refused to comment on the matter.“That the state government has decided to implement the order dated December 15, 2017, passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Rajasthan at Jodhpur, vide circular dated March 8, 2018,” stated the affidavit, which has also attached the circular issued by the state’s Home Department. The matter in which the affidavit was filed -- it is pending before the Supreme Court -- is an appeal by a Jodhpur-based woman who converted to Islam and married a Muslim man in 2017. Her brother filed a habeas corpus petition before the Rajasthan high court, alleging forcible conversion and enticement by the man.In its judgment on December 15, 2017, the high court declined to declare their marriage as void in law, but issued a string of directions to regulate conversions and interfaith marriages in the state.Taking note of the fact that a 2006 draft law against forcible conversion in the state is yet to receive assent of the Governor, the high court said that till the time the state government came up with a law, the court had a duty to issue some guidelines to “check the problem of forcible conversion of religion for the purpose of solemnising marriage only”.The high court added: “It is obvious that in some of the religions it is a condition precedent that a male or a female must be of some religion.”The guidelines maintained that the authority or the person who is performing the conversion ceremony must ascertain that the individual wishing to convert has “full faith” in the new religion and should also ensure there is no threat or force on him or her. Besides, that authority or person “shall give information to the District Collector/SDO/SDM, as the case may be”.The set of directives added: “The person, who is desirous to change his/her religion, shall give information to the District Collector/SDM/SDO of the concerned city and Sub-Divisional Area before conversion of religion. The District Collector/SDM/SDO shall put such information upon the Notice Board of its office on the same day.”According to the high court order, the person, who has converted, “shall solemnise the marriage/Nikah after one week of such conversion of religion,” and that the authority or person, before whom such marriage or Nikah is being solemnised, shall first ensure that all the information regarding conversion has been made to the individual getting married and the authorities concerned.While the state government chose not to challenge the judgment but decided to rather comply with it, the appeal in the SC was filed by one ‘Mr X’ who wanted to remain anonymous. The petitioner contended that the judgement “directly infringed upon the fundamental rights granted under the Constitution, including the right to live with dignity enunciated by a nine-judge bench in the K S Puttaswamy judgement (right to privacy)”. “The high court is in error by unlawfully vesting an appointed authority the untrammelled power to ascertain the intention (mental state) of a person intending to convert,” said the petitioner, adding the guidelines requiring such persons desirous to convert to inform the authorities and prove their bonafide was in complete violation of the Constitution and in contrary to laws of evidence and procedure. The appeal was filed in December 2018, when the Gehlot-led Congress was in power in the state. In April 2019, the apex court sought a response from the state government, which was represented by its additional advocate general Manish Singhvi. The state subsequently filed its affidavit through an additional deputy commissioner of police in December that year. In its reply, the state unequivocally submitted that it “has decided to implement” the high court order. While the government order was issued in March 2018 when the state was ruled by the BJP, the Congress government has chosen to defend the directions on regulating interfaith marriages. Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said, “Political parties come and go but the government is a continuing entity. It is the government that takes a decision on policy matters which are subject matters of litigation. Here, it appears that the government of Rajasthan has taken a conscious decision to implement the high court order and oppose the appeal against this order in the Supreme Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-cm-opposed-love-jihad-law-but-govt-stand-contrary-101612721209841.html

The intensity of the river's flow in a short span of time was such that it engulfed whatever came in its way.This was a grim reminder of the Kedarnath deluge of 2013 which led to widespread devastation in the ecologically fragile Himalayan region."At 11 am, the water level recorded at Joshimath was 1,388 metres," Saumitra Haldar, Chairman, Central Water Commission told PTI.During the 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods, the highest flood level (HFL) at Joshimath was 1,385.54 metres, he added.However, by 6 pm on Sunday, the water level of the river had reached the normal levels recorded a day before, said Rajesh Kumar, the superintendent engineer (Upper and Middle Ganga division) of the Central Water Commission (CWC).He said water levels have started receding.At Joshimath, which bore the fury of floods, the water level recorded at 1 PM on February 6 was 1,372.58 metres. At 6 PM on Sunday, hours after the disaster, the water level was 1,375 metres.In Nandprayag at the lower stretches of the river, the water level at 6 pm was 840.40 metres. A day before, it was 848.30 metres at 1 pm. Kumar said the situation was similar in Rudraprayag, Srinagar, Devprayag, Rishikesh and Devprayag.The water level at the Srinagar Hydroelectric Project was also at the Mean Draw Down Level which helped accommodate excess flow from the upper stretches. This will be released slowly, Halder added.The sudden flood in the middle of the day in the Dhauli Ganga, Rishi Ganga and Alaknanda rivers -- all intricately linked tributaries of the Ganga -- triggered widespread panic and large-scale devastation in the high mountain areas.Two power projects - NTPC's Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project and the Rishi Ganga Hydel Project - were extensively damaged with scores of labourers trapped in tunnels as the waters came rushing in.Sixteen men were rescued safely from a tunnel in the Tapovan project but about 125 were still missing. As night fell in the ecologically fragile Himalayas and rescue work in the difficult to access areas became more difficult, there were fears they may be dead.Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said seven bodies were recovered and at least 125 were missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dhauli-ganga-river-s-water-level-at-joshimath-breached-all-records-after-glacial-burst-cec-official-101612711002455.html

07-02-2021||India||'Tired of aunt-nephew regime': PM Modi on those joining BJP in Bengal||Accusing the West Bengal government of "corruption and extortion" and calling for real paribartan (change), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday pitched for BJP in Bengal, saying that those concerned about the state are joining the BJP.“We need a double engine government in Bengal for its progress. The regime of extortion will end and real paribartan (change) will come when a BJP government is formed. We are seeing real change in Tripura where the corrupt Left government was uprooted by the people. Tripura is doing exemplary work to develop itself but in Bengal the government is doing nothing,” said the PM during a political rally in Haldia.“The TMC is not implementing even the national education policy. People of Bengal are still waiting for one nation one ration card. Recommendations of the 7th pay commission is implemented in so many states but Bengal is still waiting. I have heard the state cannot even pay salaries to government employees on time,” he added.Referring to football, the most popular sport in Bengal, the PM said the TMC has committed many fouls. “They have committed fouls in development and on the trust of the people,” he said, adding that when the BJP forms its government, the first meeting of the cabinet will pass an order to implement all central schemes for farmers.“They will get even the money that they were deprived of,” he said referring to the Prime Minister Kishan Samman Nidhi project.“Bengal will show TMC the Ram card. I can see that you have made up your mind. Partners of the TMC who are tired of the aunt-nephew regime are looking for change. Those who are really concerned about Bengal are joining the BJP," he said.The PM said that in Bengal the fight is not just with the Trinamool but also with its hidden friends.“You must have heard of match fixing in games. TMC is also into match fixing with the Left and Congress. They meet secretly behind closed doors in Delhi. In Kerala, the Left and Congress share power every alternate five years. They say to each other: ‘You loot for five years and I will loot for five.’ We have to be careful about this. We have to warn others,” he said.In Haldia, the PM dedicated to the nation the LPG import terminal built by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. It has been constructed at an investment of around ₹1100 crore and has a capacity of 1 million metric tonnes a year. It will cater to the requirement of LPG in Bengal and other states in east and north-east India, according to a statement issued by the Union petroleum ministry."Those who talked of ‘maa, maati, manush’ do not have the courage to raise their voice for Bharat Mata because they have criminalised politics and politicised the police administration,” said Modi.‘Maa, maati, manush’ ( mother, land and people) is one of the popular slogans of Mamata Banerjee.Earlier in the day, the PM was in Assam where he inaugurated the Asom Mala road project which will connect rural and state roads to national highways. He also laid the foundation of two medical colleges at Biswanath and Charaideo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tired-of-aunt-nephew-regime-pm-modi-on-those-joining-bjp-in-bengal-101612704956962.html
07-02-2021||India||'No ghar wapsi till farmers' demands are met': Rakesh Tikait||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday said that the protest that they have launched is a people's movement and wpn't fail. He was addressing the attendees of a 'kisan mahapanchayat' in Haryana."There will be no 'ghar wapsi' till farmers' demands are met. This is a people's movement, it will not fail," said Tikait.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson claimed the campaign against the agriculture laws is going strong. With many "khap" leaders present at the “mahapanchayat”, Tikait lauded their role in strengthening the stir.Tikait is widely credited by the farmer unions and their supporters of bringing the 75-day-old agitation back on track after Republic Day violence. The tractor rally which the farmer leaders took out in Delhi on January 26 was marred by violence when a group of protesters, defying the approved route, marched towards central Delhi and clashed with the police.A few of them even stormed the historic Red Fort and hoisted a religious flag along with the Tricolour from its ramparts - an image which was a loss of face for the farmers' movement.The authorities as well as general public lashed out at farmers for the Red Fort incident. Soon, the police issued orders asking the protesters to disperse and end their stir. At the three border points near Delhi - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur - the protest began to lose steam.But Tikait vowed to carry on and addressing a gathering at the Ghazipur border, made an emotional announcement that he will "kill himself but won't end the protest", with tears it his eyes. That worked and the farmers got ready to once again take on the government over three farm laws passed in September last year.The protesters then announced a 'Chakka Jam' which was carried out peacefully across the country on February 6. Tikait said on Saturday that the farmer leaders have give the central government 'time' till October 2 to withdraw the legislations.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since November 26, 2020 near Delhi, demanding a rollback of the three laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-this-is-a-people-s-movement-won-t-fail-says-rakesh-tikait-101612706483808.html

It proposed a further 200 metre area as a ‘regulated area’ where construction is not prohibited, but has to be approved by the NMA. The NMA has sought objections to its proposals till February 18.While the temple site of 9.7 acre is protected area, the prohibited area is 37.061 acre along Meghanad pacheri (boundary wall) and regulated area is 138.385 acre. Currently, all four sides of the temple are mainly used for commercial and residential purposes.The draft bylaws have met with stiff resistance from the Naveen Patnaik government and the ruling Biju Janata Dal. In a letter to the NMA on Sunday, chief administrator of Sri Jagannath Temple Administration, Dr Krishan Kumar requested for withdrawal of the draft notification “to protect the interest of the Lords, sevaks and devotees at large".“….Recently, the state government acquired lands and properties for strengthening safety & security of the centuries old shrine for the project of Sri Jagannath Heritage Corridor that will provide pilgrims with facilities such as drinking water, toilets, cloak rooms and Queue Management System. These properties have been acquired by State Government through negotiations and most of the people have come forward to contribute their lands and properties for the purpose of this project. Any regulation which has the potential to restrict development of facilities and amenities on lands voluntarily contributed by devotees of the Lord will hurt their sentiments,” Dr Kumar wrote.The SJTA reasoned that as the Sevayats are likely to be severely and adversely affected by any intervention of the authorities like this draft notification, they must be consulted before any process to restrict their rights is undertaken by the National Monuments Authority. "Any adverse impact on Sevayats have a direct bearing on continuity of Niti-Kanti (rituals) of Lord Shree Jagannath,” he said.Puri’s MP Pinaki Mishra condemned the NMA notification calling it an "outrageous attempt by the Centre to derail the extraordinary work being done due to chief minister Naveen Patnaik's efforts to improve surroundings of Jagannath and Lingaraj temple"."Clubbing our living Gods’ abode with mausoleums is blasphemous. Odia sentiments deeply hurt," Mishra tweeted.The Biju Janata Dal also slammed the notification saying it hurt the sentiments of Jagannath lovers. "This would create problems in daily rituals of the Lord. While the CM is making efforts to make Puri a world heritage city, NMA should reconsider its decision," the BJD tweeted.The NMA's proposed notification restricting any construction within 100 metre radius of the protected monument is likely to adversely affect the Naveen Patnaik government's plans to build amenities for devotees of both Jagannath temple in Puri and Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar. In Puri, the state government has a ₹3500 crore project lined up for development of the city as a world heritage city while in Bhubaneswar it has lined up ₹700 crore plan for beautification of the area around Lingaraj temple. The NMA's draft bylaw for the 13th century Vaishnavite temple of Ananta Basudeva near the Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar is likely to scupper the government's beautification plans.The BJP which saw BJD walking away with all the credits for development of the two heritage temples in Puri and Bhubaneswar, has also jumped into the fray.Soon after the NMA bylaws were up on its website, Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan took up the matter with Union culture minister Prahallad Singh Patel. "The bylaws are restrictive in nature and more time and consideration should be given on matters of such religious importance," tweeted Pradhan. He also added that Patel assured him about not taking any steps that may hinder the development of the Jagannath temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-bjd-protest-nma-notification-around-jagannath-temple-101612705482882.html

It is wrong. The Prime Minister should invite the farmers to his residence like he had offered tea to (then US President) Barack Obama with his own hand (in 2015), which is fine as he was our guest. We expect the PM to invite the farmers, offer them tea and biscuits and tell them the (agri marketing) laws are being repealed, and that they should be happy," Owaisi said.Owaisi said the PM should understand the plight of agriculturists who feed the country, if he claims to have risen from poverty."When a poor person weeps out of helplessness, then nature tells us to help the poor, but those who have no sympathy for the poor, they remain unaffected by tears of the poor. We are with farmers, they are our'annadatas', they work hard to get us food," he said.Taking a dig, Owaisi said the massive protest by farmers has "disturbed sleep" of PM Modi."They came out in thousands, shouted slogans, and took out a tractor rally in Delhi (on January 26). The BJP, with 300 MPs, is worried about how to tackle farmers," he said.With BTP leader Chhotu Vasava by his side, Owaisi made a strong pitch for the unity among tribals, Muslims, Dalits and OBCs in Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/host-farmers-at-your-house-like-you-treated-obama-owaisi-to-pm-modi-101612700226390.html
07-02-2021||India||Congress challenges Kerala CM, CPI(M) to come clean on Sabarimala||Ahead of the upcoming assembly polls, Opposition Congress led UDF on Sunday challenged Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the CPI(M) to come clean on the Sabarimala women's entry issue. "What is the stand of the CPI(M) and Chief Minister on Sabarimala? Are they with the devotees? Do they have the guts to say they are with the devotees? Will the CM shed his fake persona of a renaissance leader?" Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala asked. The LDF government had erected a 620 km "renaissance" wall on January 1, 2019, in which lakhs of women from the northern end of Kasaragod to the southern tip here, had participated as part of a state sponsored initiative to uphold gender equality. The 'Women's wall' was conceived in the backdrop of frenzied protests witnessed in the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala after the LDF government decided to implement the Supreme Court verdict, allowing all women to pray at the Ayyappa shrine. Two women in their forties had trekked the hill shrine a day after the human wall was erected and offered prayers, breaking the age-old custom of not allowing those in the menstrual age to pray at the Ayyappa temple. Chennithala also wanted Vijayan to clarify if there was a change in the stand of the party and left front on the issue. "Is he prepared to state that they would stand with devotees? Do not hurt their sentiments further," he told reporters at Malappuram. The draft Sabarimala bill, brought out by the Congress on Saturday would be discussed by the UDF to give final touches. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said in Kottayam that the UDF had never thought of making sabarimala apolitical agenda during the polls. Asked about the Marxist party's stand, CPI(M) leader M Govindan Master, said: "let the decision of the larger bench come. And then we will hold discussions with all sections on how it can be implemented." Attacking the two fronts, BJP Kerala unit President K Surendran, said both have shifted from their traditional stand with an eye on the coming polls and are 'cheating' people. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had announced the party stand which was against the devotees, he said. Now the UDF has said they will bring in a legislation to protect the rights of Sabarimala devotees and they have also prepared a draft bill, he added. Surendran alleged that during the height of the Sabarimala protests, no Congress worker was arrested by the Vijayan government while over 52,000 cases were registered against activists of the BJP and right wing outfits. Is the Pinarayi Vijayan government prepared to withdraw all the cases registered registered then and apologize to the Ayyappa devotees ? he asked. Surendra also said if the BJP comes to power, all the Devaswom boards in the state would be dissolved, politicians removed from its administrations and believers appointed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-challenges-kerala-cm-cpi-m-to-come-clean-on-sabarimala-101612697257276.html

At present, the Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, has been given the Bilaspur- Prayagraj-Delhi route, he said.Speaking about the budget 2021-22, he said after it was presented, the stock market witnessed a considerable boost and the budget also earned praise from intellectuals and independent commentators across the country.When asked about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remarks that the budget reflects the Centre's intention to privatise PSUs, the minister blamed the opposition party for weakening the economic condition of Air India."If the point was being raised about privatisation of Air India, which is our national asset, its economic condition was worsened during the Congress-led UPA government," he added.At present, Air India has an accumulated debt of ₹60,000 crore and the process of its privatisation is underway since long, but it will be the NDA government which is going to properly materialise it, said Puri.He assured that the process will be carried out transparently through open bidding."In 2006, during the Congress-led UPA government, the privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports was done and I give credit to them for it as the Airports Authority of India (AAI) got ₹29,000 crore from the move which was used for the development of other airports," he said."Privatisation is required as it is not the government's specialisation to run airports. Although there are several airports which are being successfully run, when private capital enters, the activities increase manifold," he added.On the ongoing protest by farmers against the new agriculture laws, Puri accused the opposition of misleading the cultivators over the legislations and said his government is ready to sit with the protesters to resolve the issue.He expressed confidence that the issue will be resolved soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-targets-1-000-routes-under-udan-scheme-civil-aviation-minister-puri-101612698686415.html
07-02-2021||India||BJP announces candidates for Delhi municipal bypolls||The BJP on Sunday announced its candidates for the upcoming bypolls in five municipal wards in Delhi, a day after the AAP and the Congress announced their candidates.The BJP has fielded mostly local leaders to test waters in the bypolls, which is seen a precursor to the municipal polls in the national capital next year.The BJP has fielded its mandal president from Rohini - C, Rajesh Goyal, against AAP’s Ram Chander, former MLA from Bawana, and Congress’ Mewati Barwala from ward number 32N (Rohini-C).The contest here is going to be interesting, as Congress and BJP have fielded two first-timers against a former AAP MLA. This is considered to be an AAP stronghold, as the former councillor, Jai Bhagwan, is now AAP MLA from Bawana. Ram Chander won the assembly bypoll from Bawana in 2017 by defeating Ved Prakash, former AAP MLA from the constituency who had joined the BJP just before the bypoll in 2017.For ward number 62N (Shalimar Bagh North) in north Delhi, BJP has fielded former councillor late Renu Jaju’s daughter-in-law, Surabhi Jaju. The bypoll on this seat was necessitated after Renu Jaju’s death two years back.Though it is considered a BJP stronghold, it is going to be a tough fight as Jaju is pitted against AAP’s Sunita Mishra, who is party’s mohalla coordinator of the area and also secretary of AAP’s women’s wing in the Shalimar Bagh assembly constituency, and Congress’ Mamta, who is contesting for the first time.In ward 2-E (Trilokpuri), the contest will be between BJP’s Om Prakash Gugarwal, former party’s local unit president, and AAP’s Vijay Kumar, who has been the secretary of All India Safai Mazdoor Union, Congress’ local leader Bal Kishan. There is a large number of slum clusters in this ward which is an AAP stronghold. This was one of the 11 wards AAP won in 2017 municipal elections in East Delhi Municipal Corporation.For ward number 08-E (Kalyanpuri), the BJP has fielded Siya Ram Kanojia, a local party worker, against AAP’s Dhirendra (Bunty Gautam), a senior party leader from Kondli. “He has done remarkable work during the Covid pandemic. Bunty Gautam has been a part of the AAP from the time of its formation,” AAP said in a statement. The Congress has fielded Dharampal Maurya.In Chauhan Bangar ward, the BJP has fielded Mohd. Nazir Ansari, former president of BJP’s minority wing in northeast district. He is pitted against Congress’ Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad and AAP’s Mohammad Isharaq Khan, former MLA from Seelampur.Monday is the last day to file nominations and the bypolls will be held on February 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-announces-candidates-for-delhi-municipal-bypolls-101612697356541.html

That’s why I have always associated the welfare of tea garden workers with the overall progress of Assam,” said Modi.In his second visit in a fortnight to Assam, the PM launched an ambitious road network project and laid the foundation of two medical colleges.To be constructed at a total cost of ₹1122 crore, the medical colleges at Biswanath and Charaideo districts will have 100 MBBS seats and 500-bed hospitals.Modelled on the lines of Bharat Mala, the Asom Mala project is aimed at improving 890 km state highways.“Earlier good healthcare was a dream. People in Assam had to travel for hours, wait endlessly and face a lot of hardships. But that has changed in the past five years and it is visible,” said Modi.“Till 2016, the state had just six medical colleges. But in the past five years, six new medical colleges have come up. The two new medical colleges will not only provide excellent healthcare but in coming years but thousands of new doctors will emerge from the region itself,” he added.PM Modi mentioned that till 2016, every year 700 MBBS doctors used to pass out of the medical colleges in Assam, but with setting up of new colleges now 1,600 new doctors would join the healthcare sector annually.“I have a dream that each state should have a medical and technical college where education is imparted in the mother tongue of the region. Our government in Assam will set up such colleges,” he said.The PM stated that setting up of a unit of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on the outskirts of Guwahati would bring relief to people in Assam and northeast. He blamed previous governments in the region for not taking up such ventures in the healthcare sector.During his first visit to Sivasagar on January 23 the PM gave land allotment certificates to 1,06,000 landless families.Assembly election in Assam is due in April-May and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition is attempting another term in power by announcing and launching several major schemes.A sum of ₹50,000 each as seed money to nearly 2,00,000 youths to start business ventures, appointment of nearly 30,000 teachers, transfer of ₹3,000 each to bank accounts of nearly 8,00,000 tea garden workers and ₹830 every month to nearly 22 lakh families are some of the initiatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conspiracy-to-malign-image-indian-tea-not-spared-either-pm-modi-in-assam-101612687198454.html

The police said that the female suspect is a distant relative of the deceased and she along with her friend hatched a conspiracy to rob the victims.The two deceased were identified as Dolly Thakur, 32, and Anshu Kumari, 16, who was a tutor of the former’s children.Uma and Sonu visited Thakur's house at Saraswati Vihar at around 8.30 pm on Saturday. Dolly was in the house with her three minor children while Anshu was teaching them.She was a resident of the same locality and student of class nine at a private school in Ghaziabad.“The two suspects entered the house of the victim (Dolly Thakur) where they had tea and then overpowered those present in a room on gunpoint. Suspect Sonu shot Dolly in the abdomen and the 16-year-old tutor in the head. Thereafter, his pistol got jammed and he inflicted severe injuries to Dolly’s three minor children with a knife and grinding stone. Leaving them for dead, both fled the house,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).Thakur’s three children including twin girls, Gauri and Minakshi aged nine years, and her son, Rudra, aged five years, suffered severe injuries inflicted with a knife and grinding stone but survived.The incident in the house came to light when Dolly’s husband, Mahesh Thakur and her father-in-law returned from their work at around 9.30 pm on Saturday. They run an eatery at Chopla Market in Ghaziabad and had shifted to their new residence at Saraswati Vihar during Diwali last year.The Ghaziabad police deployed five teams to trace the suspects after Dolly’s family also lodged complaint against unidentified persons for murder, attempt to murder and robbery as cash and jewellery items were also taken away.“The most important clue was given by one of the two girls who told that ‘Amma’ (grandmother) had visited the house. The children used to call the suspect woman with this name. When we visited her house, she was present and revealed the plot to us,” the SP said.“Meanwhile, her friend (suspect Sonu) was trying to flee the city and was spotted near Dasna by one of the police teams. He opened fire at police personnel and sustained an injury to his leg when police opened retaliatory fire,” SP said while adding that the case will be fast tracked in court and testimony of children will be of prime importance against the suspects.Police also recovered the pistol that was allegedly used in the crime and the stolen cash and jewellery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-arrested-for-double-murder-injuring-3-kids-during-robbery-in-ghaziabad-101612686603222.html

It will burden the common people and cause inflation. It is not good if only the Centre receives the cess revenue," Baghel told the reporters on Sunday.The Chief Minister was speaking to reporters at the Swami Vivekananda Airport in Raipur before leaving for his visit to the poll-bound state of Assam.During his budget speech, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the imposition of Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) of ₹2.5 per litre on petrol and ₹4 per litre on diesel. However, there would be no additional burden on the consumer overall as Sitharaman during Budget presentation also proposed to reduce Basic Customs Duty on these items.Responding to a question about his meeting with Union Minister Piyush Goel on Friday, Baghel stated, "A delegation of ten ministers accompanied me in the meeting and every minister informed about the progress of work being done in their respective departments.""We discussed the promises we were able to keep and what work is yet to be taken up in that direction," he added.Baghel is one of the Congress Chief Ministers appointed as senior observer for overseeing election campaign management and coordination in the poll-bound Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-demands-withdrawal-of-cess-on-petrol-diesel-introduced-in-union-budget-101612683529405.html

They are recipients of Bharat Ratna. Actors like Akshay Kumar were enough for this task," said Thackeray."This issue was about the policies of the government and not of the country. It was not a matter related to China or Pakistan. It was a matter of farmers. The Bharat Ratna recipients tweeted on behalf of the government and now they are being trolled," he said.Days after Tendulkar made comments on the protest by farmers, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had asked the former Indian cricketer to "exercise caution while speaking about other fields"."Many people (celebrities) have reacted sharply to the stand taken by them (farmers). My suggestion to Sachin Tendulkar is he should be cautious while commenting on fields other than his domain," Pawar had said.Taking to Twitter, former Indian cricket team captain tweeted: "India's sovereignty cannot be compromised. External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Let's remain united as a nation. #IndiaTogether #IndiaAgainstPropaganda."His remarks came after a few international celebrities including pop star Rihanna commented on farmers' protests.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three new farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-shouldn-t-have-asked-big-personalities-to-tweet-on-farmers-raj-thackeray-101612675635485.html

07-02-2021||India||CM Mamata Banerjee likely to skip inauguration event to be attended by PM Modi: Report||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to give a miss to a programme during which Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of key infrastructure projects in the poll-bound state’s Haldia district on Sunday, PTI reported citing an official from the state secretariat. The Trinamool Congress chief has also asked her party’s workers to skip the programme, PTI also reported.In a programme scheduled for the evening, PM Modi will inaugurate four key projects from oil, gas, and infrastructure sectors in Haldia.The exact reason for the possible absence was not shared. The "insult meted out to her" on January 23, when several people started raising Jai Shri Ram' slogans just before she was set to speak, could be the reason, the news agency also reported. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar who has a tense relationship with the state chief minister is scheduled to attend the event, it also reported.Also Read | Nadda sharpens attacks on TMC ahead of PM Modi's 1st rally in poll-bound BengalOver the last few days, political tension has been rising in West Bengal where assembly elections are due in April-May. The tussle between the BJP and Banerjee’s TMC has also intensified as the former is hoping to wrest power from the ruling party after emerging as a second-biggest party during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.On January 23, Banerjee refused to speak at an official event after a section of the crowd sitting at the audience started shouting "Jai Shree Ram" slogans. Prime Minister Modi was also part of the event organised by the central government to commemorate the 125th birth anniversary of freedom fighter Subhash Chandra Bose. Expressing displeasure over the incident, Bannerjee said the "insult was unacceptable" and refused to continue with her speech as a protest.She also called for dignity at government programmes, saying they are not organised by a single political party. "I think there should be some dignity when a government programme is being held. This is not the programme of one political party. This is a programme of all parties and the people," she had said at Victoria Memorial.While the incident drew sharp condemnation from TMC leaders, the BJP’s leadership said there was nothing wrong with the slogans and accused Banerjee of indulging in appeasement politics. "None of the dignitaries said anything. Why did she lose her cool? It reflects her mindset of appeasement politics. (She) appeases a particular community before elections," said the BJP’s Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-banerjee-likely-to-skip-inauguration-event-to-be-attended-by-pm-modi-101612680842177.html

And it’s free.“This is for the first time that a heritage tour on vintage cars, some of them near a century old, has been organized in the city for senior citizens. The minimum age has to be 75 years. One can apply online and it would be a first come first serve basis,” said Prabir Roy, managing committee member of the Automobile Association of Eastern India.Every day at least seven to eight vintage and classic cars would take the participants on a heritage tour lasting for a few hours. The list of cars includes a 108-year-old Gebrüder Stoewer, a 99-year-old 12/4 Austin Tourer, a 1923-built Panther Sloper, a 1928-built Auburn 6-80, and the rare ones such as Morris 8, Rolls Royce Phantom-III and Mercedes Benz 260 Stuttgart among others.“As the cars are very old and we would be virtually bringing them out of their ventilation, so it won’t be possible for us to say which cars would be available on a given day. It would depend on availability,” said Arindam Saha, general secretary of AAEI.The journey would kick off from the AAEI’s office in south Kolkata and touch upon some of the heritage buildings such as Netaji Bhavan, Jorasanko Thakur Bari and go right up to Dakshineswar Kali Temple. As the cars are very old, they would move at an average speed of 15-20 km per hour. Each trip would last for three to four hours.“We would allow only two persons in a car. So it could be either an elderly couple or two single senior citizens. One has to apply online and reach our office. The participant would be also provided lunch at the end,” said Roy.Even though Covid-19 cases have dropped in the city, the organisers said that the cars would be thoroughly sanitized before the trip. One has to wear a mask and bring a sanitizer.Valentine Day falls on February 14 and the entire week is celebrated as Valentine week with a name for each day such as Rose Day, Propose Day and Chocolate Day among others.“Even though it is the young generation who celebrate the Valentine Day and the week with much fervour, we thought of organizing this unique tour for senior citizens who are mostly confined to their homes and are often lonely. It may rekindle the old memories,” said Saha.The programme began with a vintage and classic car rally on Sunday. The heritage tour starts from Monday and will end with Valentine’s Day next Sunday.While a vintage car is one which was manufactured before 1939, those built after 1940 are called classic cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heritage-tour-on-vintage-cars-for-kolkata-s-senior-citizens-this-valentine-week-101612679583543.html

The action was taken after at least four note verbale were issued to Canadian authorities at Vancouver and Ottawa after death threat to the Indian consul general on December 26, 2020. Two police complaints were also filed by the Vancouver consul general office.Also read | India takes up with Italy, Canada incidents outside missions in Rome, VancouverIn a diplomatic note to Canadian foreign ministry, the Indian high commission on February 2 informed that one Inderjit Singh Bains made death threats against Prime Minister Modi on January 26 outside the Vancouver consul general office and posted on the Facebook account of fellow separatist Narinder Singh Khalsa. The English translation of the rabble-rousing speech was sent to the Vancouver police department in a complaint filed by the consul general.Although Hindustan Times has reviewed the contents of the speech, it is not reproducing it as it is communal and incendiary. The political activist makes it clear that they will take care of Modi as they have taken care of other political leaders and Indian Army generals in the past.Also read | In probe against Khalistanis, NIA examines people linked to farmers’ protestsThe letter from Indian high commission to Canadian foreign ministry makes it amply clear that death threats to the Indian Prime Minister constitutes an act of terrorism and requested that the matter should be thoroughly investigated and the action should be taken against the individuals to mitigate any security risk posed.Since December 2020, pro-Khalistan elements in Canada have taken over the protests against farm laws and are using communal speeches to divide the Indian diaspora by extolling the virtues of so-called Khalistan leaders. A reaction to this was a large Tiranga car rally organised in support of farm laws on Saturday afternoon in Vancouver.Also read | Battle to begin with repeal of farm laws, says Mo Dhaliwal who created ‘toolkit'According to a diplomatic note written to the Canadian authorities on December 28, Inderjeet Bains is associated with Gurdwara Dashmesh Darbar in Surrey, Vancouver.

The Khalistani supporter has threatened Indian diplomatic personnel time and again but the Vancouver Police Department has never initiated any legal proceeding or enforced the law even after a formal police complaint was filed by the Vancouver Consul General about him for his inflammatory speeches on December 25, 26, 2020, and January 26, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trudeau-govt-wakes-up-to-death-threat-to-pm-modi-provides-security-to-envoys-101612678127959.html

They are hardcore farmers who are chanting ‘Jai Hind’ and fighting their battle. The farmers are getting support across the world. Popstar Rihanna’s support provoked strong reactions from the ‘bhakts’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The recent violence and rioting at Capitol Hill by Trump followers was condemned by many Indians including our Prime Minister Modi. Modi had held campaign rallies in Ahmedabad and the US for Donald Trump. That too was interference in their internal affairs," said Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut in his weekly column, Rokthok in the party mouthpiece Saamana.He said that the world is watching what is happening in the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border at Ghazipur. The executive editor of Saamana, has also taunted Indian celebrities like Akshay Kumar, Kangana Ranaut, Sachin Tendulkar and Lata Mangeshkar who joined the ‘India against Propaganda’ drive where they condemned the international stars for their interference in India’s internal matters.The MP has also said that the celebrities were roped in by the government after it realised that the farmers' protest was getting international attention. They had jumped in the fray after Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and Meena Harris, who is the niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris expressed open support for the farmers.“Our celebrities did not sympathise with the farmers who have been agitating from the last three months. This demonstrates that the Central government is using them to neutralise the foreign condemnation. "The farmers are agitating not to create unrest or divide the country. It is a humanitarian struggle which is bound to receive support from across the world,” Raut said.He said the government should seriously introspect why the farmers are getting international support. Raut said that the people standing in support of the stand taken by Rihana, will be termed as anti-national. He has also criticized the use of force by the Centre against agitating farmers.The Shiv Sena has been constantly attacking the Central government in support of the farmers. It has even called the Red fort incident on Republic Day a conspiracy to defame the farmers’ movement.The farmers have been agitating at Delhi’s borders seeking the repeal of three farm laws which they say is designed to destroy their livelihood and favour the corporate lobby.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-struggle-bound-to-receive-global-support-says-shiv-sena-101612677923575.html

The intensive security on Saturday came in order to avoid the rerun of Republic Day violence, when clashes broke out between the police and protesters following which one farmer died after his tractor overturned and several were injured on both sides. Follow latest updates on farm stir hereOn Saturday, farmers’ ‘chakka jam’ call —blockade of national and state highways— against the internet ban near the protest sites and alleged harassment by authorities remained largely peaceful. Several thousands of farmers from across states, especially in Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, came out in support while symbolic road blockades were observed in other parts of the country. The unions, however, had withdrawn the call for the blockade in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi citing inputs regarding some “miscreants trying to disrupt peace”.As the three-hour blockade led to traffic snarls, farmers were seen offering food and water to stranded commuters on the Rohtak-Delhi highway. There were similar reports from Punjab as well. Farm leaders said protesters stalled traffic on roads in parts of Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. No untoward incident was reported from anywhere. Several protesters, however, were briefly detained by the police in several states for blocking roads.Farmers have been camping at Delhi borders for more than two and a half months now demanding a repeal of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which farmers say favour big corporations. The Centre has refuted the concerns and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but talks are currently locked in a stalemate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-police-deployment-at-delhi-borders-to-keep-up-vigil-day-after-chakka-jam-101612675862314.html
07-02-2021||India||Financial packages for tea garden workers brew a poll issue in Darjeeling||Days after the Centre and the West Bengal government announced financial packages for tea garden workers in their respective budgets, political parties in Bengal’s Darjeeling and adjoining districts have turned this into a major issue ahead of the assembly polls due in March-April.On February 1, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her budget speech that the Centre will spend ₹1000 crore for the welfare of tea garden workers of West Bengal and Assam. Since both states are going to the polls, opposition parties said this was part of the sops to woo voters.On Friday, while presenting the state budget, chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced a ₹150 crore package for the state’s tea garden workers.The north Bengal region has 54 assembly seats. Of these, tea garden workers and their families comprise a sizeable section of voters in around 15 seats. These are located in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts.In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as a major challenger to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) by winning seven of the north Bengal region’s eight seats, including the one in Darjeeling.The 283 tea gardens in north Bengal employ three hundred thousand permanent workers, according to garden owners and trade unions. The tea gardens have always witnessed trade union movement over demands of the workers. The Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), and the latter’s partner, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), still have influence on these workers. Many of the workers are tribal people and Gorkhas.Against this backdrop, the Central and state budgets have become election issues in the hills with the BJP and the TMC making all efforts to woo tea garden workers in their campaigns. While the main contenders are flaunting their budgets, the Congress and the CPI (M) are calling the packages indirect bribe for voters before the polls.Saman Pathak, former CPI(M) Rajya Sabha member and state committee member of the party’s trade union front, said, “Action speaks louder than words. Had the Centre and the state been serious about welfare of the workers, they would have fixed minimum wages, given them land rights and taken action against owners of tea gardens that have not paid provident fund and gratuity to employees.”A resident of north Bengal, Pathak said, “The daily wage of ₹202 at local tea gardens is among the lowest in the country. The state government is not serious about implementing minimum wages for which a committee was formed more than five years ago.”Mani Kumar Darnal, general secretary of National Union of Plantation Workers, which is affiliated to the Congress, said, “The state and the Centre are making cosmetic moves. Healthcare and housing facilities in local tea gardens are pathetic.”Both Pathak and Darnal said the workers and their families, who have been sweating for more than hundred years, have no right on the land where they reside.Kisan Kalyani, TMC’s Jalpaiguri district committee president and also a tea plantation owner, denied the charges.“Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is deeply attached to the tea garden workers. Her Chaa Sundari scheme, a free housing project for those without home, bears testimony to that,” said Kalyani.“The state government has allocated ₹500 crore for Chaa Sundari and those who have no houses will get one in three years,” Banerjee had said during her recent north Bengal tour. She also announced that more than 4,600 workers have been given allotment letters for houses at 12 tea garden areas in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts.Darnal said, “Workers who will get houses under Chaa Sundari have been given conditional land rights. This is a gimmick before the election.”A tea planter, who requested anonymity, said, “Since Assam has more than 600 gardens, a large chunk of the ₹1000 crore announced by the Centre will go to that state. The same thing has been happening with disbursement of the Tea Board of India’s subsidy to planters.”Pathak and Darnal demanded a white paper on the expenditure the state claims to have made since the TMC came to power in 2011.Raju Bista, BJP Lok Sabha member from Darjeeling and the party’s national spokesperson, said, “Both planters and workers have suffered during the TMC regime. Mamata Banerjee should name one scheme that her government has launched for the industry between 2011 and 2019. For 10 years, her government has ignored the plight of workers and planters. She announced the Chaa Sundari scheme in 2020. But so far it remains only on paper.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/financial-packages-for-tea-garden-workers-brew-a-poll-issue-in-darjeeling-101612675768904.html

I resigned as a MLA to protest against privatisation. The plant has had losses as it doesn't have its own mines. Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy must put pressure on Prime Minister," Rao told ANI.He said he will launch a non-political joint action committee as a move of agitation asking the Centre to revoke its decision."People of Visakhapatnam fought for this steel plant. The steel plant has been incurring losses due to the lack of its own mines. If the central government allocated mines to the plant, it will be in profits. But privatisation is not a solution for the problem," he added.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Reddy on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to reconsider the disinvestment plans of RINL and explore other opportunities to put the plant back on track.In a letter, Reddy said the recent decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) which has given in-principle approval for 100 per cent strategic disinvestment of the government of India's shareholding in RINL, Visakhapatnam, along with management control by way of privatization has become a cause of concern for the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-mla-resigns-from-post-against-rinl-s-disinvestment-plans-101612664432253.html

He, of course, did discuss it with the SKM later and it was a joint thing," Pal told reporters at a press conference at the Singhu border."So basically what we are trying to say here is that he announced it in a hasty manner. Nothing else," he added.Pal, however, cleared that everything is fine within the SKM and people shouldn't assume that there are any differences between the leaders.Later in the evening, the SKM issued a statement, claiming that 'chakka jam' was also held in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Saturday."Chakka jam programme in Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand and Bihar was a complete success," it stated.It also stated that farmers organised chakka jam in more than 200 places in Madhya Pradesh while in Maharashtra, farmers led the chakka jam in many places, including Wardha, Pune and Nashik."The success of Chakka Jam was also seen in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu," it stated.The three-hour long nationwide 'chakka jam' by protesting farmers was held on Saturday amid tight security, even as there was no such event in the national capital which was turned into a fortress with heavy security deployment by the Delhi Police, paramilitary and reserve forces personnel to prevent any untoward situation.The Delhi Police had also used drone cameras to keep a tight vigil at protest sites.Ten Delhi Metro stations, including Mandi House and ITO, were closed for the duration of the 'chakka jam' from 12 noon to 3 pm, and reopened after the protest ended.Around 50 people were detained near Shaheedi Park in central Delhi for allegedly holding an agitation in support of the 'chakka jam’.

The resolution passed at the meet reiterated the farmers' demand for the repeal of the three new farm laws.Speaking at the meeting, senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot said the Union government had not discussed the bills with state governments and farmers' organisations before bringing them in Parliament."We will not step back till these demands are met," the former Rajasthan Congress chief said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-to-visit-rajasthan-next-week-to-raise-voice-for-protesting-farmers-101612662693359.html
07-02-2021||India||Andhra CM writes to PM requesting reconsideration of RINL's disinvestment plans||Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to reconsider the disinvestment plans of RINL (Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd) Visakhapatnam and explore other opportunities to put the plant back on track.In a letter, Reddy said the recent decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) which has given in-principle approval for 100 per cent strategic disinvestment of the government of India's shareholding in RINL, Visakhapatnam, along with management control by way of privatization has become a cause of concern for the state government."RINL is the largest public-sector industrial unit in the state creating employment opportunities for close to around 20,000 people directly and many other indirect employment opportunities in the city of Vishakhapatnam," he stated.The Chief Minister recalled that the plant had a good performance between 2002 to 2015 earning profits with positive net worth but had pragmatically turned-around in 2002 after being reported to Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) as a sick company."The company has around 19,700 acres of land currently and the valuation of these lands alone could exceed one lakh crore rupees due to the location of the plant in the urban area and rapidly expanding urban sprawl," Reddy wrote.The Chief Minister noted that RINL currently has a capacity of 7.3 million tonnes and has taken up plant modernisation and capacity expansion recently which made the plant borrow loans from banks to take up the expansion."Owing to the unfavourable steel cycle globally the company was making losses since 2014-15 and was finding it difficult to service the debt. One of the major structural issues that also leads to the high cost of production is the absence of captive mine thereby affecting the profitability," he said further.Reddy pressed that the plant will again become a profitable venture given some support from the Government of India instead of taking the disinvestment route by some turnaround measures such as "allotting captive iron ore mines to bring down the input costs, swapping high-cost debt with low-cost debt, and converting debt into equity through equity conversion.""I request you to consider the following measures for revival of RINL Visakhapatnam," he said.He suggested that the operation of the plant can continue to achieve the turnaround, and said "As with all the sectors of the economy, the steel sector is also seeing a V-Shaped recovery. RINL has achieved the highest ever capacity utilization of 6.3 MTPA against the capacity of 7.3 MTPA from December 2020 and started making a monthly profit of close to ₹200 crores. Continuing this performance for a further period of two years will help the financial situation immensely."He also said that having captive iron ores mine of its own will reduce input costs for RINL. Reddy said currently, RINL is purchasing iron ore from NMDC Bailadila mines at market price, which has put the RINL at a cost disadvantage of around ₹5,260 per MT of steel (at ore level)."Many of its competitors have captive mines for more than 60 per cent of their requirements and buy only the rest from NMDC. Even SAIL has its own captive mines with reserves of iron ore sufficient for 200 years. This excess cost of iron ore has cost implications of more than Rs. 3,472 crores for RINL. It is essential to create a level playing field for all the players and hence allotment of captive mines for RINL will help tide over this cost disadvantage. Orissa is blessed with iron ore and the captive mine in Orissa State will go a long way in reviving the plant," he stated.The Andhra chief minister added that financial restructuring can also help the plant, by converting the short term loans along with long term loans into equity taking off repayment pressures and interest burden."The high-cost debt which is actually Rs. 22,000 cr is being serviced at interest rates as high as 14 per cent. Conversion of these loans into equity by the banks so as to remove the interest burden totally and listing the entity (RINL, Vizag) on the stock exchange giving the banks exit option through the stock exchange route through general public may also be explored. These measures could ease the burden of debt servicing and improve the financial sustainability," he said.Reddy added that the steel plant stands as a testimony to the will of the Telugu people and it is continued as an icon of Telugu achievement in our collective psyche to date, and added that the state government is ready to work with the Ministry of steel to protect RINL."Therefore, I request you to kindly reconsider the disinvestment plans of RINL Visakhapatnam and explore other opportunities to put the plant back on track. I assure you that Andhra Pradesh Government will closely work with the Government of India under your able leadership in making this happen and together we can revive the plant for unlocking the greater value to the society and in particular to the people of Andhra Pradesh," he stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-writes-to-pm-requesting-reconsideration-of-rinl-s-disinvestment-plans-101612659133296.html
07-02-2021||India||Farm union leader Rakesh Tikait calls on farmers for 'tractor revolution'||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday called on peasants across the country to join the “tractor revolution” as part of the ongoing protests at Delhi's borders against the new agri laws introduced by the Centre.During a speech to supporters at the Ghazipur protest site, Tikait reached out to the farming community, many of whom especially in the Delhi-NCR region have been upset over the National Green Tribunal's ban on diesel vehicles, including tractors, that are over 10 years old.“The tractors which run in the farms will now run at the NGT's office in Delhi also. Until recently, they had not asked which vehicles are 10 years old. What is their plan? Phase out tractors older than 10 years and help the corporates? But the tractors older than 10 years will also run and the movement (for repeal of the new farm laws) will also be strengthened,” Tikait, 51, told the crowd amid cheers.Also Read | Intervention by PM Modi may resolve farm bills issues, says Sharad PawarHe said more and more farmers across the country will participate in the ongoing farmers' stir for rollback of the contentious laws. Recently, 20,000 tractors were in Delhi and the next target is taking that number to 40 lakh, Tikait said.He also called on tractor owners to attach their vehicles with the 'tractor kraanti' (tractor revolution).“Write 'Tractor Kranti 2021, 26 January' on your tractors. Wherever you will go, you will be respected. We have a target of 40 lakh tractors,” he said.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader, whose emotional appeal recently had revived the protest that was losing momentum post the January 26 violence in Delhi, also called on villagers to bring a fistful of soil from their farmlands to the agitation sites and take back a similar amount of 'mitti' of the revolution from the protest sites.“Go and spread this revolutionary soil in your farmlands and never will traders look at your farmlands (to usurp it),” Tikait said.Exhorting supporters to keep the momentum going, he asked them to be prepared to reach protest sites as the agitation at Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu border points of Delhi could go on till October.Also Read | Traffic snarls across states as farmers block key highways“Be prepared at villages, whenever a call is made, reach the protest the way the youth (from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh) has done (after the January 26 episode),” he said.Ghazipur has earlier witnessed the influence of Tikait over the farmers' community in north India when hundreds of people, including women and children, from villages in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand reached here with water and home-made food on the BKU leader's call.Tikait had made a call for water and food from villages following disruptions in water supply at the protest site by local authorities in the wake of the January 26 violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-union-leader-rakesh-tikait-calls-on-farmers-for-tractor-revolution-101612658834002.html

07-02-2021||India||Relief, anger as Valley gets back 4G net after 18 months||The residents of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday expressed relief over the restoration of high-speed mobile internet services in the region but maintained that it wasn’t a cause of celebration as they deserved an apology from authorities for denying them, what they called “their basic right”, for 18 months.Authorities suspended 4G mobile internet services in J&K on August 4, 2019, a day before the central government nullified the Constitution’s Article 370, which accorded special privileges to the region, and bifurcated it into two UTs — J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. The government also suspended landline and internet services, fearing widespread protests in the restive region. The UT has moved several steps towards normalcy since then, with the gradual restoration of communication lines.In an order issued on Saturday, Shaleen Kabra, principal secretary (home), ordered restoration of 4 services in the region and directed inspectors general of police in Jammu and Kashmir divisions to ensure compliance and “closely monitor the impact of lifting of restrictions”.Tariq Ahmad, a 19-year-old college student from Srinagar, welcomed the move but said it was too little too late. “It is alright that they have restored the internet because it was the need of the hour but I don’t think there is any excitement as people are aware that they have lost a lot in these one and a half years. We lost our dignity, our statehood and most importantly our special status,” he said.Political analyst and author, Gowhar Geelani, said the authorities had not done them any favour by restoring 4G mobile services. “After having snatched your right to high-speed internet service for 18-long months, restoring internet is not something to celebrate about. It is actually a moment to reflect how compensation can be sought from the cellular companies who took money for the services they have failed to provide for so long,” he said.In August 2020, high-speed internet was restored in two districts of J&K — Ganderbal and Udhampur districts — based on the parameters laid down by the special committee, which recommended that the areas, where high-speed services are allowed, should have low intensity of terrorist activities.Anuradha Bhasin, the executive editor of a local daily, said she didn’t see any reason to thank the government for the move. “I actually see some going out of their way to thank govt [government] functionaries for 4G restoration. They’re not offering us charity. We should be asking for compensation for our deprivation and losses,” she said in a tweet.“It is better late than never. The government has realised how much losses our economy has suffered. This move will give a boost to the economic recovery now,” president, Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Sheikh Aashiq told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relief-anger-as-valley-gets-back-4g-net-after-18-months-101612646718943.html
07-02-2021||India||SC judge hails Modi as ‘most loved Prime Minister’||Supreme Court judge MR Shah on Saturday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the “most popular, loved, vibrant and visionary leader” at a virtual public function to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Gujarat high court.“I am glad and feel proud and privileged to participate in this important function of release of commemorative stamp of Gujarat HC on completion of 60 years and that too by our most popular, loved, vibrant and visionary leader, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendrabhai Modi,” said justice Shah at the beginning of the function, which had the Prime Minister as its chief guest.As the sitting Supreme Court judge was about to conclude his address, justice Shah, who hails from Gujarat, once again referred to Modi as the “most loved Prime Minister” at the virtual event, which also had Gujarat high court chief justice Vikram Nath, Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta in attendance.The remarks by justice Shah left some former judges of the Supreme Court divided on whether it was proper for a sitting judge of a constitutional court to express himself in such a manner at a public function.Former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha told HT that such comments by a Supreme Court judge at a public event should be avoided. “These things are absolutely avoidable. As a famous quote goes, restraint is the better part of valour,” he said.Justice Lodha added that he belonged to a different school of thought and practised restraint in his personal as well as judicial life, which was also bound by a code of conduct.Another former judge of the top court, justice Gopala Gowda said that he was “astonished” to see a sitting apex court judge showering praise on the PM when the government was the biggest litigant in the SC and had the highest stakes in policy matters.“Releasing of a commemorative stamp by the PM is a most welcome thing. But for a sitting Supreme Court judge, who is a constitutional functionary, to compliment the Prime Minister with such adjectives is unwarranted and uncalled for. The tremendous confidence of people in the judiciary will be eroded if Supreme Court judges start praising executives in this fashion,” he said.Justice Gowda said that when a judge of a constitutional court speaks, they must remember that the credibility of the institution is at stake and people’s faith must not be shaken by their remarks.However, justice BP Singh, another retired judge of the top court, did not find justice Shah’s remarks inappropriate. “He has not commented on any case in the Supreme Court. These could be his (justice Shah’s) personal views and he may genuinely feel like that for the Prime Minister. Why should it create any doubt? I don’t think it should become an issue,” said justice Singh.Last year, Supreme Court judge justice Arun Mishra (now retired) courted controversy by saying that “PM Modi was a versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally”. The Supreme Court Bar Association had passed a resolution criticising justice Mishra’s comments as “reflecting poorly on judicial independence”.A Code of Conduct for the Supreme Court and high court judges called ‘Re-instatement of Values in Judicial Life’, was resolved in the chief justices’ conference of 1999. The 15-point code primarily recommends that a serving judge maintain an air of “aloofness” in their official and personal life.Point number 6 of the Code of Conduct lays down that a judge should practise a degree of aloofness consistent with the dignity of their office. Point number 8 states: “A judge must not enter into public debate or express his views in public on political matters or on matters that are pending or are likely to arise for judicial determination.”In his address, PM Modi said that the Supreme Court had become “number one” in the world in hearing cases through video-conferencing as he praised how the virtual hearings had facilitated ease of justice by not only increasing the ease of living of the citizens of the country, but also by facilitating the ease of doing business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-judge-hails-modi-as-most-loved-prime-minister-101612646576003.html
07-02-2021||India||Twitter India’s public policy head resigns||Twitter India’s public policy head Mahima Kaul has resigned from her post citing personal reasons, a senior executive of the social media firm confirmed on Saturday. Kaul said she has stepped down from her role in the firm to take some time off.People familiar with the matter stated that Kaul quit the microblogging website in the first week of January, and will continue with the company until the end of March to help the transition. The job listing has been made public on Twitter’s website. “At the start of this year, Mahima Kaul decided to step down from her role as Twitter Public Policy Director for India and South Asia to take a well-deserved break. It’s a loss for all of us at Twitter, but after more than five years in the role we respect her desire to focus on the most important people and relationships in her personal life. Mahima will continue in her role till the end of March and will support the transition,” Twitter global policy head Monique Meche said in a statement.News of Kaul’s resignation comes at a controversial time for the website, which came under fire from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for “violating Indian law” by not taking down tweets related to “farmers genocide”. Meity sent Twitter a sternly worded notice, threatening the company with penal consequences if over 250 accounts and posts that were flagged by the government weren’t blocked.The firm, which blocked the accounts on Monday, restored them shortly after as stating that they constituted “free speech” and were “newsworthy”. The lifting of the local ban came in the backdrop of widespread outrage against Twitter for censoring free speech. The accounts are still accessible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-india-s-public-policy-head-resigns-101612646382783.html

It’s police violence, militant nationalism, and attacks on labor rights. It’s global authoritarianism. Don’t tell me to stay out of your affairs. These are all of our issues,” Harris said, a day after she was targeted on social media for having supported the farmers’ agitation along with several other international personalities. The Indian government has maintained that it was an internal matter and that propaganda was being spread against the country by vested interests.“Weird to see a photo of yourself burned by an extremist mob but imagine what they would do if we lived in India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-vice-president-s-niece-voices-support-for-stir-again-101612646003989.html
07-02-2021||India||US panel urges India to allow peaceful protest||The leadership of the powerful Congressional India Caucus has urged the Indian government to ensure that the norms of democracy are maintained and the protesters are allowed to demonstrate peacefully and have access to the Internet, as it discussed the issue of the ongoing farmer’s agitation in the country.Congressman Brad Sherman, Co-Chair of the Congressional India Caucus said that he convened a meeting with his other Republican Co-Chair Congressman Steve Chabot, and Vice-Chair Congressman Ro Khanna to speak with India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, regarding farmers demonstrations in India. This was the first meeting of the India Caucus, the largest country-specific caucus in the US House of Representatives, on the issue.“I urged the Indian government to make sure that the norms of democracy are maintained and that protesters are allowed to protest peaceably and to have access to the Internet, and to journalists. All friends of India hope that the parties can reach an agreement,” he said.The external affairs ministry has said any protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the government and the farmer groups to resolve the impasse. “The Parliament of India, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector. These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming,” the MEA said in a statement on Wednesday.“The temporary measures with regard to internet access in certain parts of the NCR region were... understandably undertaken to prevent further violence,” it said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-panel-urges-india-to-allow-peaceful-protest-101612645849763.html
07-02-2021||India||Traffic snarls across states as farmers block key highways||The three-hour chakka jam (traffic halt) call by farm unions protesting the three agricultural laws evoked huge response on Saturday in Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, even as symbolic road blockades were held in other parts of the country. The unions, however, withdrew the call for blockade in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi citing inputs regarding some “miscreants trying to disrupt peace”.Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who is part of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, said they have received reports of traffic being halted in almost every state and the entire protest was peaceful.Rakesh Takait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, however, alleged that attempts by miscreants to discredit the protests in some areas were thwarted by volunteers. “Because of these inputs, we had decided to call off the ‘chakka jam’ in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand,” the 51-year-old Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader, credited with reviving the farmers’ stir, said. He also declared that the protest on the outskirts of the Capital will continue till October 2 and an effort will be made to “connect every village” with the agitation. He asked farmers to take soil from Ghazipur border to their farmland as a symbolic gesture to express solidarity.For 72 days, farm unions have camped outside Delhi demanding repeal of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which farmers say favour big corporations. The Centre has refuted the concerns, and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but talks are currently locked in a stalemate.Scores of protesters were also briefly detained by the police in several states on Saturday for blocking roads. Farm leaders said protesters stalled traffic on roads in parts of Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karanataka. No untoward incident was reported from anywhere. “At 42 places in Karnataka, the protests were held and police took farmers into custody.”Raising slogans against the Centre, many farmers parked their tractor-trailers or squatted in the middle of roads in Punjab and Haryana, blocking several highways, including the Chandigarh-Zirakpur, Amritsar-Pathankot, Tarn Taran-Kapurthala, Ferozepur-Fazilka, Muktsar-Kotkapura, Bathinda-Chandigarh, Ludhiana-Jalandhar, Panchkula-Pinjore and Ambala-Chandigarh highway. Protests were also held at Shambhu near Ambala and at many toll plazas. “The protest was completely peaceful,” said Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan. “Around 6,000 to 7,000 protesters on an average took part in Chakka Jam each place,” he added.In Haryana, traffic was blocked on almost all national and state highways for three hours. Rustic farmer songs were played and people perched atop truck-tractors hoisted the tricolour on the KMP Expressway even as biscuits and fruits were distributed to the protesting farmers and those stranded.In Rajasthan, farmers at many places including Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Dholpur and Jhalawar stalled traffic on the highways and main roads and held demonstrations, police said.Protests were also staged in Maharashtra’s Karad and Kolhapur. At least 40 protesters, including Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan’s wife Satvasheela Chavan, were detained in Karad, a police official said. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna leader Raju Shetti and others were detained briefly in Kolhapur.In Telangana, police said several people were taken into preventive custody. Similar reports came from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where farmers blocked highways in different parts.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traffic-snarls-across-states-as-farmers-block-key-highways-101612645448695.html

Addressing reporters in Vijayawada, he said so far there was no “visible expression” of the talks on ground.The minister was replying to a query on whether there would be any ministerial level talks between both the countries on skirmishes between troops of the Asian giants.The two countries have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks to resolve the face-off, but no significant headway has been made so far.“So, military commanders have held nine rounds of meetings so far. We believe some progress has been made, but it is not, in a kind of situation where there is a visible expression of that on the ground,” he said.He added India has so far supplied Covid- 19 vaccine to 15 countries and another 25 nations were in the queue at different levels to get the dose. “I think right now we have already supplied to about 15 countries... I would say there would be another about 25 countries which are at different stages in the pipeline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-with-china-to-continue-jaishankar-on-lac-standoff-101612644995400.html
07-02-2021||India||Medical tourism to India on the up as Covid impact ebbs||Twenty-one end-stage kidney, liver and heart patients from Myanmar arrived at New Delhi’s Apollo Hospital on Friday in a chartered flight arranged by the hospital, as medical tourism that was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic has started picking up again.Most of these patients are lined up to undergo organ transplants, and had been waiting for months for travel restrictions due to the pandemic to ease as transplant surgeries are not widely done in their country.“With initial lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed worldwide due to Covid-19, the condition of these patients had deteriorated to such an extent that a transplant was the only way out. These patients were chronic cases of kidney, liver and cardiovascular diseases and have been waiting for organ transplants for over six months now,” the hospital said in a statement.“Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals along with the Indian embassy has arranged for a special chartered flight to get these patients to India for immediate kidney/liver transplants and expedite treatment for patients requiring attention for cardiovascular ailments,” it added.The ministry of external affairs (MEA), government of India, did not officially comment on the arrival of these patients; however, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that special permission was given for airlifting the 21 ill persons on humanitarian grounds.Medical tourism in India had been steadily growing over the past few years. The government data for 2019 and 2018 showed at least 6% of the overall tourist flow to India was of people arriving for treatment. Foreign tourist arrivals for medical reasons in 2019 were 697,453 — 6.4% of the total; for 2018, the number was 644,036, 6.1% of the total tourist inflow.While the ministry of tourism is yet to make public data on international patients who arrived for treatment to India in 2020, most hospitals that had 10-15% of their patient rush from overseas said they did not see the usual rush of international patients last year because of the pandemic.“The percentage of international patients dropped substantially last year; it is picking up this year but very gradually. The normal rush is still not there. In our hospital we would see about 10-15% foreign patients annually, which is now as low as 2-3%, but patients have started coming in,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, Institute of Critical Care & Anesthesiology, Medanta hospital.Also, patients who travel to India for treatment currently are largely those needing critical care.“These are all patients suffering from chronic conditions that can be life-threatening such as organ failure, cancers or brain tumor. For the initial few months there were absolutely no patients from the overseas. By July critical patients started trickling in. Travel for elective procedures such as putting orthpaedic implants, etc, however, has vanished completely,” said Dr Sibal.Dr Mehta says, “Also, no patients are coming from countries that are called bubble safe such as the UK or the US. Most patients are from Asian or African countries. It will take some time before things actually get back to normal. After all, not everyone can afford to charter a flight.”Apollo Hospital has an information centre at Yangon, Myanmar, and on the request of patients, a special flight was arranged to fly them to India.“The Indian mission in Myanmar was of great help in transporting these patients. They had been waiting for a while, some even for over six months, to get treated. These are all critically ill patients who were on regular follow-up but couldn’t travel for treatment. We tried to treat them optimally through virtual consultations, but now they needed surgery,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-tourism-to-india-on-the-up-as-covid-impact-ebbs-101612644405066.html
07-02-2021||India||Internet at Delhi borders snapped again, for 24 hrs||As farmers held a three-hour chakka jam protest against the Centre’s frequent suspension of internet at protest sites, heavy police barricading and the three new agriculture laws, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Saturday snapped internet services again at Delhi’s borders for 24 hours.The 24-hour internet suspension began at midnight on Friday and was to end at 11.59pm on Saturday.The suspension of internet services was announced in the interest of “maintaining public safety and averting public emergency”, the order issued on February 5 said. Singhu, Ghazipur, Tikri borders and surrounding areas came under the purview of this suspension order.The MHA ordered the first suspension of internet services amid the ongoing protest on January 26, when the farmers’ tractor march led to a violent stand-off between protesters and Delhi Police.A group of protesters who entered the Capital deviated from the pre-agreed route of their tractor march and entered the Red Fort. Since then, there have been regular suspensions of internet services in the Capital’s border areas.Saturday’s three-hour chakka jam, in which state and national highways across the country were blocked between 12 noon and 3pm, except in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, was in protest against these internet suspensions, among other things.Similar orders blocking internet services had been passed in Haryana as well — after January 26.The service disruption as well as the months-long protests in the national capital and surrounding areas have drawn the attention of the international media while global celebrities such as pop star Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg, on their social media accounts, extended support to the farmers’ protest.Since the three-hour chakka jam was the protesters’ first major event after the Republic Day march, the Centre, Delhi Police and Haryana Police stepped up security measures. Union home minister Amit Shah met Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava and national security adviser Ajit Doval on February 4 to review the security situation ahead of the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internet-at-delhi-borders-snapped-again-for-24-hrs-101612643861046.html
07-02-2021||India||‘Chakka jam’ passes off largely peacefully||Delhi turned into a virtual fortress on Saturday amid heavy deployment of security forces as farmers protesting against three contentious agricultural laws held demonstrations in some states including Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan as part of a three-hour “chakka jam”, even though no demonstrations were held in the national capital.Thousands of farmers across the country blocked roads with vehicles and boulders to demand a repeal of the three laws, with no major incidents of violence being reported. The government and farm unions have not been able to find a solution to the stand-off over 11 rounds of talks, and the farmers have rejected a proposal by the Centre to put the laws on hold for 18 months.On Republic Day, farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed with the Delhi Police and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.While the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers unions spearheading the agitation, said earlier that the “chakka jam”, or road blockade, would not impact Delhi and the national capital region (NCR), there was heavy police deployment across the Capital, with at least 40,000 personnel standing guard at various spots. Mobile internet services were again suspended at three border points – Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri – until Saturday night, according to a Union home ministry order.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait declared that their protest on Delhi’s outskirts will continue till October 2 and an effort will be made to “connect every village” with the agitation. He said inputs were received regarding some “miscreants trying to disrupt peace” during the “chakka jam”. “Because of these inputs, we had decided to call off the ‘chakka jam’ in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand,” the 51-year-old Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader, credited with reviving the farmers’ stir after the Republic Day violence, said.After the “chakka jam” concluded, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha said on Saturday evening that the protest once again proved that farmers across the country were united against the three central farm laws. It said the call for “chakka jam” received huge support across the country.Shouting slogans against the Centre and the three farm laws, many farmers parked their tractor-trailers and blocked roads in Punjab and Haryana, impacting highways including Chandigarh-Zirakpur, Amritsar-Pathankot, Tarn Taran-Kapurthala, Ferozepur-Fazilka, Muktsar-Kotkapura, Bathinda-Chandigarh, Ludhiana-Jalandhar, Panchkula-Pinjore and Ambala-Chandigarh.Farmers also squatted on roads in Odisha, Karnataka, Maharashtra and other states with flags and banners protesting against the laws. Thousands of farmers blocked the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway in Haryana.No incidents of violence were reported in the Capital, even as the Delhi Police detained 62 people from outside Shaheedi Park near Maulana Azad Medical College, where they had gathered to hold a protest in solidarity with the ongoing farmers’ agitation and the three-hour-long “chakka jam” protest. They were released later in the evening, according to officials. The police also used drone cameras at several places including the protest sites at the borders for aerial surveillance. On Friday evening, they began conducting checks at entry points at Delhi’s borders.At places such as India Gate, Red Fort, and residences of the Prime Minister and President, police were on high alert and monitored the movement of vehicles. At India Gate, along with the riot control force, the police also stationed water cannons for emergency use. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said: “The security around the iconic structures and important buildings was tightened. There were no protesters in the New Delhi area.”As a precaution, the entry and exit gates of many Delhi Metro stations were also shut. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said in a statement on Saturday morning that the entry and exit gates at Mandi House, ITO, Delhi Gate, Vishwavidyalaya, Lal Quila, Jama Masjid, Janpath, Central Secretariat, Khan Market and Nehru Place metro stations were closed for public. The gates were opened after 3pm, when the three-hour “chakka jam” concluded. A Delhi Metro official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the gates were closed on the police’s instructions to prevent unruly protesters from entering the Metro premises or gathering at important locations.At the three border points – Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur – the protests remained peaceful after farm leaders repeatedly told the protesters not to cross the barricades to enter Delhi or indulge in violence. The Delhi Police have placed multiple layers of barricades and cement boulders at the borders to ensure that the protesters do not drive their tractors into the national capital.Many among the protesters said they would ensure that their agitation was not marred by violence like the one during the tractor rally on January 26. At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers were injured when the protesting farmers on their tractors deviated from the pre-approved route of the rally, assaulted police personnel when they were stopped from entering parts of central Delhi, and also stormed the Red Fort premises.“We have been sending out messages to our brothers in other states that instead of coming to Delhi for the protests, on Saturday, they should support the movement by blocking their respective state highways and internal roads. The gathering here might be fewer than usual, but that is because the participation at the highways was immense,” said Sahil Kamboj, a volunteer at the Tikri border.Farmer leader Tikait, while addressing a gathering at Ghazipur, said the Centre should repeal the farm laws by October, failing which they will intensity their protest further. “We have given time to the government till October 2 to repeal the laws. After this, we will make further plans. We won’t hold discussions with the government under pressure. We won’t return home unless our demands are met,” he said. In other parts of the country, scores of protesters were held briefly by police as they stalled traffic on roads in Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. However, no untoward incident was reported during the protests across the states. Farmers’ associations supported by opposition parties, including the Rashtriya Janata Dal, held an hour-long “chakka jam” in Bihar in response to the nationwide agitation.In Rajasthan, farmers at many places including Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Dholpur and Jhalawar stalled traffic on the highways and main roads, police said.The Congress and Left parties, too, held protests in some states in support of the “chakka jam” called by the farmer unions. “Rasta roko” protests were staged in Karad and Kolhapur cities in Maharashtra.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chakka-jam-passes-off-largely-peacefully-101612643121956.html
07-02-2021||India||Intervention by PM Modi may resolve farm bills issues, says Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday said that the highest level intervention from the Central government may help in resolving the deadlock between the Centre and farmers organisation over contentious farm bills which has resulted in over 70-day long protest, by the agrarian community. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the defence minister Rajnath Singh should intervene and resolve the impasse.He also slammed the Centre for failing to handle the farmers’ agitation properly and taking extreme steps against the protestors, which have never happened in the country post-independence.“In my opinion, the central government should take an initiative and a senior-level minister should intervene. I don’t want to disrespect Narendra Singh Tomar (Union agriculture minister) but the Prime Minister or defence minister should intervene then the issue may be resolved. If it happens then those leading the protest should also look for a resolution,” Pawar told reporters.“To stop protestors, roads were cemented with nails. It has never happened in the country since independence. The government took extreme measures which also shows their attitude. Whenever farmers come out on streets like this then the government is expected to show some consonance,” he said.Pawar alleged the BJP is defaming the ongoing agitation of farmers by calling them “Khalistanis” or “terrorists”. “The ruling party has taken a stand to defame farmers by calling Khalistanis and terrorists. These agitators are farmers who have made the country self-sufficient in food production. Calling them with names is not a quality of civilized culture,” the veteran leader said.Meanwhile, thousands of farmers, peasants, along with social activists and political leaders participated in the nationwide chakka jam called by Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Saturday in Maharashtra. Farmers in many parts of the state blocked national highways and state highways to show their opposition to the three laws passed by the Centre.Except for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), prominent parties including Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party, Congress, Swabhimani Sanghatna, Left parties and its affiliated bodies All India Kisan Sabha and All India Centre for Trade Unions (AICTU) participated in the agitation across the state. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the protests are not political, but the party stands for the demands of the farmers’.Reacting to comments from foreign celebrities, Pawar said that farmers are protesting despite all the odds since the last over two months and people were sympathetic towards them in the country. “Now, similar views are expressed abroad for the farmers which are not good for the country. The government must take them seriously,” he suggested.Linking these reactions over farmers’ protests with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support to the candidature of Donald Trump as Presidential candidate for the second term, he said, “I remember when the Prime Minister was on a US tour, he declared that Trump will be elected for a second term and a few sections appreciated him. Today, people from abroad are also reacting the same way because of the same reason,” he said, blaming Modi for interfering in the internal matter of the United States.Swabhimani Sanghatna leader Raju Shetti led a protest in Kolhapur. Shetti slammed the Centre for making celebrities tweet in support of the farm laws. He said that the government has forgotten that “crores of common people” have brought them to power, but once they dump them no celebrities will ask them.Kishore Tiwari, president of Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission, led a protest in Yavatmal district blocking the national highway. Tiwari, who is associated with the Shiv Sean and holds MoS rank, was detained by the district police.In Mumbai, Samajwadi Party, NCP, Left parties protested in Kurla. NCP spokesperson and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik participated in a protest near Kurla station. Malik, who is the party’s Mumbai unit chief, said that the three laws are an attempt to get industrialists in the agriculture sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intervention-by-pm-modi-may-resolve-farm-bills-issues-says-sharad-pawar-101612642500755.html
07-02-2021||India||Munawar Faruqui released from Indore central jail on late Saturday night||Stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui was released from Indore central jail late night on Saturday, a day after the Supreme Court granted him interim bail in a case registered against him in Madhya Pradesh for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.The delay caused in releasing the stnad-up comedianwas allegedly due to prison officials citing a warrant issued by a Prayagraj court against Faruqui. Arrested for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, Faruqui was in Indore jail since January 1.After release, Faruqui, 32, walked out of the jail and left for his home with his cousin brother Zaid Pathan and an advocate friend.Faruqui has been released after Indore central jail officials received a certified copy of Supreme Court's order, additional superintendent of Indore Central jail.LKS Bhadoriya said. Faruqui’s advocate Anshuman Srivastava said, “We handed over the certified copy of Supreme Court order to jail authorities late evening on Saturday which led to his release.”On Friday, the top court had granted him interim bail after the Madhya Pradesh High Court had rejected his bail plea on January 28. The Apex court also stayed the production warrant issued against Faruqui by a court in Prayagraj in connection with an FIR lodged there.Faruqui's lawyers on Saturday submitted a copy of the SC order in the local court, which then directed that he be released on a bond of ₹50,000 and same amount of security.But he was not released. Asked for the reason, an official of the Indore Central Jail said a court in Prayagraj had ordered Faruqui's production in a similar case on February 18.Prison officias had cited the jail manual on Saturday noon and said an order from the Prayagraj court or a competent government officer was needed to release him.In the absence of the requisite order, the comedian would have be taken to Prayagraj on Sunday morning, jail officials had said.Faruqui and four others were arrested on January 1 following a complaint by a BJP MLA's son that objectionable remarks about Hindu deities and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were passed during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore on New Year's day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/munawar-faruqui-released-from-indore-central-jail-on-late-saturday-night-101612641149751.html
07-02-2021||India||Police wait for Google to help them trace creators of ‘toolkit’||The Delhi Police on Saturday said they were waiting for a response from Google from which they have sought assistance in identifying the author/creator of a “toolkit” or document, which allegedly detailed an action plan for online and offline protests associated with the ongoing farmers’ agitation.Any concrete progress in the investigation into the toolkit case will happen only when the Google helps the investigating team with the IP addresses and details of the two e-mail accounts, through which the toolkit was created, a senior police officer associated with the probe said.“We are hoping that Google will share the desired information. As of now, we are collecting details of the social media accounts that posted the toolkit or screenshots of its content,” said the officer.On Friday, the cyber prevention and awareness detection (CyPAD) unit of the city police sent a letter to Google and asked for details of the people who drafted the toolkit, edited and circulated it. Separately, police are also trying to get details of the Instagram account mentioned on the original toolkit, through which a live session was screened.Apart from the toolkit case, police have registered 44 more cases in connection with January 26 violence and the incident of January 29 when a group of people, claiming to be locals, entered the protest site at Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police.Police on Saturday updated the list of arrested persons on their website. The new list has the names of 125 persons, three more than the previous list. The names of three persons, who were arrested by the Burari police station on February 3, also figure in the updated list. Their identification was done on the basis of video footage analysis.While two persons have been arrested so far in connection with the vandalism and violence at the Red Fort, investigators said that they have been conducting raids to nab eight key suspects, including actor Deep Sidhu and one Jugraj Singh, who were allegedly involved in the violence at the UNESCO World Heritage site. Police have identified Jugraj as the one who had allegedly hoisted a religious flag at the ramparts of the fort.The other six absconding suspects have been identified as Buta Singh, Iqbal Singh, Gurjant Singh, Gurjot Singh, Jagbir Singh and Sukhdev Singh. Police have already announced R6 lakh rewards – R1 lakh each for Deep, Jugraj, Gurjant and Gurjot while R50,000 each for the other four – for information leading to their arrest.Another officer who did not want to be named said that Iqbal has been identified as the one who had done a Facebook live from the Red Fort during the violence.Officials said they have identified over 100 suspects and notices are being sent to them for joining the investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-wait-for-google-to-help-them-trace-creators-of-toolkit-101612640104797.html
07-02-2021||India||'Exercise caution': Pawar's piece of advice to Tendulkar amid farmers' stir||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday advised Bharat Ratna and former international cricketer, Sachin Tendulkar, to be cautious while commenting on issues other than his field. He also said that the common people have fiercely reacted to the stand taken by Indian celebrities to counter tweets by foreign celebrities on the ongoing issue of farmers' agitation.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) also took on the Centre for dragging Bharat Ratna awardees Lata Mangeshkar and Tendulkar in its campaign to counter tweets by celebrities such as international pop star Rihanna. He slammed the Centre saying that the issue was of government's policy and not a national issue to use such legends to garner support.“They (Indian celebrities) have taken a stand but the common people have fiercely reacted to the position taken by them. I would also advise Tendulkar to exercise caution while speaking about any other field,” Pawar commented.Also read: Delhi-NCR peaceful as 40,000 security personnel keep vigil during ‘chakka jam’Thackeray, who was speaking to reporters, said that the Union government should have not exposed Mangeshkar and Tendulkar to social media trolling. "The government should not have asked Sachin Tendulkar and Lata Mangeshkar to tweet and put their reputation at stake. This is an issue of the government's policy and not of country's like some threat from China or Pakistan. Now they have to face the wrath of social media trolling."“The government should have limited its use of celebrities in its campaign to actors such as Akshay Kumar,” he remarked.He further said, "They (Tendulkar and Mangeshkar) are legends in their fields, and they are very simple people. They should not have been asked to tweet with the same hashtag. They tweeted what the government asked them to tweet, and now they are at the receiving end."Thackeray also slammed the Centre for issuing clarification to pop singer Rihanna's tweet supporting the farmers' stir.Reacting to comments from foreign celebrities on farmers’ protest, the former Union agriculture minister also said that farmers are protesting despite all odds for over two months and people were sympathetic towards them in the country. “Now, similar views are expressed abroad for the farmers which is not good for the country. The government must take them seriously,” he suggested.Linking these reactions over farmers’ protests with PM Modi’s support to the candidature of Donald Trump for US presidential polls for the second term, he said, “I remember when the Prime Minister was on a US tour, he declared that Trump will be elected for a second term and a few sections have appreciated him. Today, people from abroad are also reacting the same way because of the same reason,” he said, blaming PM Modi for interfering in the internal matter of the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exercise-caution-pawar-s-piece-of-advice-to-tendulkar-amid-farmers-stir-101612636528676.html

07-02-2021||India||Delhi's borders quiet as police ramp up checks||Amid the large-scale police deployment and a host of steps taken to curtail the movement of farmers, the three-hour nationwide “chakka jam” — a blockade of national and state highways — called by farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws, went off peacefully on Saturday at the three protest venues at Delhi’s Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders.In view of the violence in the Capital on Republic Day during the tractor rally taken out by farmers, in which one person died and several others were injured, the Delhi Police had put in place a thick security blanket to ensure that no untoward incident takes place during the chakka jam.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “Considering the violence that erupted on January 26 during the tractor rally, we did not want to take any chances. Elaborate security arrangements were put in place and full-scale vigil was maintained to check any untoward incident and traffic-related inconvenience. No violence happened on Saturday and the traffic remained normal.”The blockade was not observed inside the Capital. Highways leading to Delhi were free from the blockade so that farmers could reach the protest sites. There was no blockade in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh either as decided by farmer unions, for the same reason.However, all three protest venues saw thinner crowds on Saturday with farmer leaders saying that a large number of protesters had returned to their respective states to take part in the chakka jam there.At the Singhu border, farmers did not stop any private or shared public vehicle from plying along the stretch where the protest has been taking place for over two months now. “These locals have supported us from Day One. They have already done more than their bit for our movement. So we decided not to impose the jam on them,” said Jagmohan Singh, one of the many volunteers there.At Tikri, farmer leaders on the stage continued to remind the participants to hold the chakka jam as a non-confrontational event. Several young farmers, who had been camping at Tikri border, went back to their villages and home towns to lead the blockade of state highways there.“We have been sending out messages to our brothers in other states that instead of coming to Delhi for protests, on Saturday they should support the movement by blocking their respective state highways and internal roads. The gathering here might be smaller than usual, but that is because the participation at the state level is immense,” said Sahil Kamboj, a volunteer.Despite peaceful scenes at the Tikri border, the security arrangements near the protest site were intense on Saturday. Between Friday and Saturday night, the Delhi Police had set up a multilayered security cordon comprising their personnel, paramilitary personnel, concrete barricades, barbed wire fencing, and nail boards drilled onto roads to stop farmers from entering the national capital.On the roadside near the police barricades in Ghazipur, farmers prepared a small patch of land for cultivation and planted sugarcane and potatoes.Lata Chaudhary, a farmer from Baruat, said, “The police have set up a multilayered barricading and have drilled nails onto the road to prevent our movement as though we are criminals. Today, we planted sugarcane here in front of them (police) to make them realise that we are just farmers and they should not wage a war against us.”On Friday, Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had planted flower saplings beside the police barricades. The police, on their part, added another layer of barricades on Saturday and allegedly removed the flowers planted by protesters. “The government fixed iron nails in our path, but we have planted flowers next to them, Tikait said.Also watch: 'No ghar wapsi till laws are withdrawn': BKU’s Rakesh Tikait | Farmers’ protestAt 3pm, farmers gathered at the Ghazipur border site started honking their vehicles in unison. However, at Singhu border there was no such collective honking. “In the rest of the country, the jam was for three hours. Here, it has been going on for 73 days now. If the government can’t hear us despite so long, our involvement in the chakka jam won’t make a difference,” said Manmeet Kaur, a farmer from Gurdaspur in Punjab.“You can see that thousands of farmers have gathered here. The crowd is sitting for kilometres from here. If we wanted to cause trouble, their (police’s) barricades will not be able to stop us. Our movement was always meant to be peaceful. On January 26, some unruly elements tried to defame farmers and our movement but that was a political ploy,” said Daya Ram, a farmer from Mansa in Punjab.Also read: Traffic snarls across states as farmers block key highwaysAlso read ‘Chakka jam’ passes off largely peacefully||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-protest-sites-at-delhi-borders-remain-peaceful-during-chakka-jam-101612634198747.html
07-02-2021||India||'Protests limited to one state, farmers instigated': Minister in Parliament||The opposition has not been able to point out the shortcomings in the farm bills but continues to label them as “black law”, said Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday during the third consecutive day of the debate in the Rajya Sabha over the farm bills“Opposition used all platforms to criticise the bills. I heard all their statements during the debate. Opposition is continuously saying that this is a black law and should be repealed. I have been holding meetings with farmers’ unions for the last several months. I'm asking the same question to them also, what are the black provisions in these bills? But till now, I'm waiting for their reply,” he said.The agriculture minister also underlined that the government's offer to amend the laws did not mean it had any flaws. He also said the protests over farm laws were limited to only "one state" adding that the farmers were being "instigated”.“I made it clear that if the government is ready to make amendments, it doesn't mean there is any problem in farm laws. People in a particular state are misinformed. Farmers are being misled that others would occupy their land if these laws are implemented. Let me know if there is a single provision in contract farming law which allows any trader to snatch away the land of any farmer,” he said.The minister's "one state" attack refers to the protest led by farmers mainly from Punjab, a Congress-ruled state, as he countered the opposition charge that farmers across the country are protesting against the three new laws.“Our efforts are that farmers' incomes are doubled and contribution of agriculture to GDP increases rapidly. These agriculture laws are also an important step in this direction. I want to tell this House and farmers that PM Modi is committed towards welfare of farmers,” he added.The central law on contract farming, Tomar said, does free the farmers from paying taxes on their sale and also empowers them to exit agreement with traders while as per the provisions of Punjab contract law, a farmer could be sent to jail or be liable to pay penalty of up to ₹5 lakh for violation of agreement."I also want to ask farmers, specially those from Punjab where norms are different, including commission for arhtiyas (commission agents)...we have freed farmers from tax and state governments are levying taxes...so should the agitation be against those who are levying taxes or the one who is freeing them of taxes?” he said during the debate.Opposition parties like the Congress, Shiv Sena, SAD, NCP, Samajwadi Party and Left parties who have extended their support to farmers’ demand that the laws be repealed also attacked the Centre in the upper house. Sena MP Sanjay Raut attacked the government for dubbing the farmers protesting against the farm laws as "anti-nationals" and for "defaming" their agitation. Raut alleged that anyone speaking the truth is dubbed as a "traitor" or "anti-national" and that cases of sedition have been slapped against those criticising the government."We heard minister Dharmendra Pradhan asking us to listen to the truth. For the last six years, we have been listening to the truth, even the untruth dubbed as truth. The atmosphere in the country today is such that anyone writing the truth is dubbed as traitor and anti-national…When the farmers are uniting and fighting for their rights, you see anti-national acts. They are not anti-nationals or khalistanis,” he said.Expressing concerns over the violence that took place on Republic Day at the farmers’ tractor march, Raut said: “There has been no discussion from the Centre's side on who was actually behind the violence, but over 200 farmers have been put in jails for the same.”BSP member Satish Chandra Misra demanded that the government should repeal the three farm laws and also provide legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP) on all crops. He slammed the government for trying to stop farmers' protest and alleged that multi-layered barricades, barbed wires and iron nails studded on roads have been put up on Delhi borders, calling it “human rights violation.""I am not able to understand when you (the government) are ready to suspend the laws for 1.5 years, what is stopping you to withdraw these Acts," he said.Congress MP Pratap Singh Bajwa accused the centre of passing farm laws at a time when the country was focused on and suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic to stifle opposition. This was an “undemocratic” manner to pass laws, he said. “Today we have cut electricity, water supply, internet supply of our own farmers, we have put barbed wire fences around them, resembling a Berlin Wall,” Bajwa said. These things are shameful for the world’s largest democracy, he added.Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge accused the Centre of lying about MSP.“They (Centre) lie regarding MSP. Modi ji never stops saying that Congress did not increase MSP, [the] reality is in Congress’ time MSP increased by 219%, they only increased a little over 40%,” he said.“This government has always said that they will double farmers' income, but I want to tell you that when Modi ji became the PM, within a month in June 2014 all States gave a diktat that even if one rupee above MSP is given then action will be taken. Then the states stopped giving a bonus to farmers,” he said.Kharge also said the government conspired to encroach on farmers land and give it to corporates when congress leader Rahul Gandhi convinced the Centre to change the Land Acquisition Act to give four times compensation to farmers.The Marathon 15-hour long discussion in Rajya Sabha on Motion of thanks to President's address concluded on Friday.The Centre is scheduled to reply on Monday after question hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agriculture-minister-fires-khoon-ki-kheti-jibe-at-congress-in-parliament-101612529957607.html
07-02-2021||Today's||Make public transport safe for women||The finance minister’s emphasis on women working across all sectors, and in night shifts with adequate protection, is positive. But for this to work, a prerequisite is ensuring their safe and sustainable mobility in cities. Urban planning should be reviewed keeping in mind the safety of women. For rural India, the challenges are different and more daunting.Due to poor planning in many urban areas, women do not have access to safe or affordable transportation. The pandemic has further reduced financial resources available to women and this must be factored into public transport planning.For a start, the police, transport authorities and civil society organisations have to work together to help in ensuring that women don’t face any form of sexual or other violence in public transport. This is one reason why women are reluctant to use public transport, which reduces their ability to go to and from work. There are enough CCTVs in urban areas, but that alone does not ensure safety for women.There has to be adequate lighting in urban spaces as many women have to walk long distances from metro or bus stations to reach home. Many urban spaces are not well-lit or effectively patrolled in the evenings. Women should be involved in decision-making in urban planning so that their concerns are factored in when framing plans. There are some initiatives in other cities which are worth studying.In London, its public transport operator uses information technology, which has led to solutions to address women’s safety and easy mobility. Among the ideas generated were fare discounts and step-free buses as women often combine domestic chores with work and may have to carry large packages, which hinder their mobility.In addition, there must be regular safety audits in urban spaces and public transport systems through which authorities can frame better ways to work out programmes for safety.A social enterprise working on data collection for safer cities, Safetipin, collected data from five cities, namely Bhopal, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Pune, which showed that women tend not to venture out into public spaces after dark. Some of the reasons cited were poor visibility due to high-boundary walls and lack of well-lit walking paths. Safetipin has also mapped safety scores for public spaces in order to identify ways in which safety for women can be improved.There has been an earlier suggestion that cities should promote the presence of hawkers in public areas as this would ensure greater street activity and, thus, improve safety for women on their way to and from home.In addition, there must be efforts by employers to provide safe transportation wherever possible for women at affordable rates. If local government bodies work with the police, areas which are unsafe for women can be identified and patrolling improved.Public spaces and transport should be a major focus so that women are able to fully participate in the workforce without any fear of violence. With economic distress due to the pandemic, there is going to be more pressure than ever on women to contribute to the household income. And this must be enabled in every possible way, starting with upgrading public infrastructure.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/make-public-transport-safe-for-women-101612621008097.html
07-02-2021||Today's||The dilemmas in regulating online speech||On February 3, the Indian government issued a stark warning to Twitter for having defied its order to block access to around 250 accounts that had posted tweets in the context of the farm protests. In an 18-page missive, Twitter was told it was in no position to determine the “impracticability or the disproportionality of the said measure”.“Twitter… is an intermediary bound by the orders of the Central Government,” said the letter, with a warning that Twitter India executives could face punishment, including jail terms. The trigger was the social media company’s position that it found the posts and accounts to “constitute free speech” and “newsworthy”. “Protecting public conversation and transparency is fundamental to the work we do at Twitter,” a representative told multiple media organisations, off the record.The exchange underscored the political sensitivities around the farm protests. But more importantly, it could become the first shot to be fired in a battle that holds implications for free speech, regulation of technology, and, possibly, even geopolitics. At the core of this confrontation is a simple question: Who has the mandate to regulate speech online — the State or the private entity running the service?There is no easy answer. In 2011, Facebook and Twitter helped the citizens of Egypt launch a most successful pro-democracy movement. The role of social media in bringing about the Arab Spring was captured succinctly in a protester’s tweet: “We use Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.”On February 11, 2011, hundreds of thousands of people gathered at Tahrir Square succeeded in their revolution, just like their counterparts in Tunisia had a month earlier, while also leveraging technology.In a more recent example, from 2019, anti-China protests in Hong Kong too were mobilised and coordinated over social media and digital networks. But this campaign did not have the same sort of success seen in Egypt and Tunisia. The Great Firewall of China — where the government has close control over what can and cannot be said online — has now descended upon Hong Kong.In these three instances — particularly the first two — online speech helped address the information asymmetry between a State that did not enjoy popular support and the people.But the evolution of technology in the social media domain during this decade has created vulnerabilities, which are being exploited by bad actors to strike at the heart of democracy and democratic institutions. This was most visible in 2016, when political disinformation is believed to have influenced the United States presidential election and the Brexit referendum.Because social media companies held up principles of free speech against the State, it gave the people of Egypt and Tunisia a chance to express their will. At the same time, because social media companies failed to stop the abuse of their platform, the will of the people in the United States and the United Kingdom — at least to some degree — was manipulated.The temporality of these examples is relevant too. They suggest that increasingly, social media companies have not been — by virtue of being unwilling or simply ill-prepared — able to prevent the abuse of their platform. When their passivity to content moderation has often led to the rise of misinformation and disinformation, their algorithms have actively propagated harm and marginalisation.The origins of social media trace back to cyberutopianism, where early activists wanted the medium to help emancipate the oppressed from the oppressor. In the last 20 years, the internet has undoubtedly risen to that role — the MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter are only the most recent in a long list of success stories.Ultimately, then, the entity that holds the best mandate to regulate speech online is a democratic, rules-based institution. This does not often translate into the State, and it almost certainly cannot be embodied by a private corporation. The world needs to evolve an independent, impartial domain — almost similar to an independent judiciary — to help navigate the dilemmas at the heart of regulating online speech.binayak.dasgupta@htlive.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-dilemmas-in-regulating-online-speech-101612620997912.html
07-02-2021||Today's||The global scrutiny of Indian democracy||The farm protests — in opposition to the government’s measures and the new laws to liberalise agricultural markets — have continued to intensify. After the shocking violence and vandalism on Republic Day, farm groups went into a huddle and it appeared that the protests would lose momentum. But when the Uttar Pradesh Police sought to disperse protesters from Ghazipur, at Delhi’s borders, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader, Rakesh Tikait’s resistance and emotive appeal led to a renewal of the agitation.The images of thousands of protesters, continuing to oppose the State for months, in a largely non-violent manner, lend themselves to a captivating narrative and evoke solidarity. Even those who believe that the farmers are wrong in their demands or have been maximalist during negotiations cannot but help admire the tenacity and determination of this mass movement.But when this image is coupled with images of what can be seen as a degree of State coercion — either through heavy police deployment or barricades or orders of internet shutdowns or first information reports against journalists or arrests of ground-based reporters — then the narrative of ordinary citizens fighting for their livelihood against an insensitive State gets enhanced traction.This is the broad explanation for the range of international reactions to the farm protests. But this response cannot be understood in isolation.Ever since Narendra Modi’s impressive electoral victory in 2014, and even more so since his resounding triumph in the 2019 elections, there has been a story that has gained increased attention in the West. This is the story of India’s perceived democratic backsliding. The overwhelming tone and nature of the international media’s coverage of contentious domestic political issues reinforce a narrative that India is turning back on its democratic, secular, pluralist roots and its open and free society is no longer as open and as free.The under-representation and exclusion of minorities from the power structure of the ruling party; instances of hate speech by members of organisations broadly associated with the ideological worldview of the ruling dispensation; and a set of laws and policies — from the effective abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the subsequent detention of leaders and crackdown on connectivity to the process to update the National Register of Citizens in Assam, which left out 1.9 million residents of the state, from the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the Shaheen Bagh protests to the Delhi riots — have all fed into this perception that India is sliding back from its constitutional roots. The recent international response to the farm protests has to be seen in this wider context, for in itself, the agitation may not have elicited a response except from Sikh members of the diaspora.The government believes this narrative is unfair. After all, it is through the democratic route that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come to power in two consecutive elections. It also believes that this international criticism is a result of a campaign by domestic political rivals and activists who have been unable to mount an effective domestic opposition to the regime and thus seek support from elsewhere. Political managers in the BJP are convinced that, in this case, international criticism has little to do with the farm laws or the nature of agricultural markets or the direction of Indian economic reforms — but guided solely by an attempt to undermine Modi internationally and box the Indian State into a corner. This narrative, many in the government believe, is also being encouraged by India’s geopolitical adversaries directly or indirectly.The problem, however, for the government is that irrespective of what it sees as the flaws in the liberal international narrative on India, this narrative is becoming more entrenched. If India were not a democracy, or if it did not care about its image as a responsible and rule-abiding member of the international community, which respected human rights internally, this may not have mattered — after all, there are a range of countries with a far worse record on civil liberties which continue to escape the same level of scrutiny.But for India, democracy is both a matter of pride and a geopolitical asset. It is not a coincidence that all members of the Quad are democracies and the intent of the framework is to contain the belligerence of an authoritarian dictatorship such as China or that its democratic values give India tremendous soft power in the region and beyond. The fact that there is a new administration in Washington, which will be far more amenable to the views of human rights groups as well as factor in international media coverage, adds to the challenge. Dismissing the narrative, therefore, is not an option.The government, then, has a choice. It can feel that the only way to counter what it sees as mischievous propaganda is by doubling down and converting it into an instrument of nationalist mobilisation. This week, what appeared to be coordinated tweets from political leaders, ministers, and a range of Indian celebrities in defence of Indian sovereignty was an outcome of such a strategy. This may even be helpful domestically and put critics on a backfoot.But it doesn’t help in countering the challenge posed by the perception that Indian democracy is in trouble. And that is why the most effective response is not by issuing a statement but by strengthening India’s democratic framework — ensuring a political structure which is more inclusive of the country’s minorities; enabling independent institutions to work independently, even if their decisions, at times, go against what the executive would prefer; deploying a more consultative and democratic method of resolving differences internally; stepping back from any measures that can be interpreted as cracking down on freedom of citizens; and evolving a more collaborative relationship with the parliamentary Opposition to send out a message of national unity on key issues.This isn’t always easy. For instance, in the case of the farm laws, the government has clearly indicated its willingness to negotiate, offered to stay the laws for 18 months, and address any issues the farmers may have. This is an interest-based negotiation. Unfortunately, this has run up against the position-based one of the farmers — that the laws be repealed for a start.India has the right to take its own decisions, frame its own laws, and work according to its own nationally defined priorities. Its democratically elected government has the mandate to push legislative changes and reorient policies within the framework of law. But at a time of global interconnectedness, there is bound to be enhanced scrutiny of its internal record. The focus should be to improve that record and communicate more effectively to the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-global-scrutiny-of-indian-democracy-101612620956741.html
07-02-2021||Today's||The persistence of the employment crisis||For the vast majority of us, the economy boils down to a simple matter of employment and jobs. Without one, most of us are broke. And nothing shatters self-esteem more than being unemployed. So, this Sunday morning, let’s analyse the budget in terms of the problem of employment and how effectively it’s been tackled.The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), widely acknowledged as the principal authority on employment, says immediately after the lockdown, over 120 million lost jobs. By December, when the finance minister (FM) was preparing the budget, employment was still 14.7 million below pre-Covid-19 levels. Other surveys put that figure at 18 million. However, in January, employment increased by 11.9 million. But, compared to January 2020, it was still 9.8 million lower.This hides the fact that many who have found jobs were forced to accept lower levels of remuneration. Salaried employees were worst hit with 21 million lost jobs. Within this category, white-collar professionals saw jobs reduced by 31%. The next worst-affected were industrial workers, with 26% lost jobs.Dig deeper and the problem of employment has other worrying roots. India’s labour force participation rate hovers around 40%. The global rate is 66%. We’re far behind. It’s even worse when you focus on female labour participation. Official statistics establish its fallen 8% to 23% between 2011-12 and 2017-18. CMIE puts it even lower at 11%. In comparison, female labour participation in Bangladesh is 30%, in Indonesia 39% and Thailand 45%. India is the odd one out.So the conclusion is clear — the budget was presented when unemployment is a serious problem and against the historic background of very low labour participation and dismally worrying female labour participation.Now, what did the budget do about this? Let me quote Mahesh Vyas, CEO of CMIE: “The Government of India does not recognise any employment problem in the country,” he said. “The Finance Minister’s speech contained no specific scheme to help the unemployed or to generate employment directly.”Let’s start with rural unemployment. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is designed to tackle this. But the FM slashed next year’s allocation by almost 35%. So not only has its importance diminished but, as Vyas picked up, Sitharaman did not mention MGNREGS in her speech. That silence is telling.In interviews, the FM said the budget’s schemes to promote textiles and infrastructure, particularly roads and housing, will create a substantial number of jobs. But will they? Infrastructure has a long gestation period and its allocations are often unspent or tied up in bureaucratic knots. This is why Vyas says the allocation for roads and housing “is unlikely to make a material difference to employment”. He has a similar conclusion for the scheme to promote textiles. It’s “unlikely to move the needle on employment much”.Not being an economist, I can’t confirm Vyas’s conclusions. But as our most widely acknowledged authority on employment, his doubts and the language he’s used are worth noting. They could be an important note of caution.What I find inexplicable and politically insensitive is the government’s lack of acknowledgement of the fact 120 million lost jobs last year. Their lives and their children’s futures could have been destroyed. Yet there were no words of sympathy and comfort. It’s almost as if we don’t remember the tens of millions forced to walk back to their villages, their lives decimated, their futures uncertain.Once again, let me quote Vyas: “The Economic Survey and the Finance Minister’s speech did not recognise, in any manner, the fact that scores of millions of Indians lost livelihoods in 2020-21.” He makes a further telling point. Most people who lost jobs found ways of surviving without help from the government. It seems that will be the case next financial year too.So, this Sunday, when you read glowing praise for the budget from industrialists and bankers don’t forget the unemployed millions who have found little succour. Many of them can’t afford a Sunday newspaper.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-persistence-of-the-employment-crisis-101612620938067.html
07-02-2021||Editorials||RBI’s optimistic economic view||On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced its decision to keep policy rates and the monetary policy stance unchanged. This was not surprising. But the more significant part of the MPC resolution was its assessment of the macro-economy going forward. The Gross Domestic Product growth is expected to reach 10.5% in 2021-22, in sync with the 14.4% nominal growth projected in the budget. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das was also categorical in saying that the economy has bottomed out. What is worth underlining is the fact that both the government and RBI have decided against withdrawing support measures even though they see a robust recovery underway. In fact, there is growing evidence that such support is being carefully recalibrated to achieve specific ends. The budget’s focus on capital expenditure is one such example. Similarly, RBI has allowed banks to deduct loans made to micro, small and medium enterprises from their cash reserve ratio requirements. When read with the fact that most experts believe that it is the larger, more credit-worthy borrowers who have gained from the cheap credit environment post-Covid-19, this seems like a conscious effort to tilt the scales in favour of the smaller players. Similarly, both fiscal and monetary policy are exploring hitherto uncharted areas of resource mobilisation. The government is planning to monetise brownfield assets, while RBI has allowed retail investors to invest directly in government bonds. While the results of such moves will need to be tracked, they are, at least in principle, game-changing policies. The importance of such synergy in policymaking cannot be over-emphasised at the moment.To be sure, results from RBI’s latest forward- looking surveys also highlight the need to guard against any complacency on the economic front. While its business expectations surveys, like other high-frequency indicators such as PMIs, paint an image of robust recovery, consumer confidence continues to be weak and much below pre-Covid-19 levels. Because India does not have high frequency official data on consumer spending or employment, any such distress can go undetected for months. Both monetary and fiscal policy will do well to guard against ignoring such distress. MPC has reiterated its commitment to prioritising growth is reassuring on this count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/rbis-optimistic-economic-view-101612707947998.html
