The use of money was also quite evident from the involvement of Norway-based networks in so-called dispute resolution in South Asia at the same time. While Chinese intent is understandable, the intent of Scandinavian networks in South Asia was part of a larger game plan. In both cases, money acted as a lubricant. The role played by Pakistan-Turkey orchestrated digital media post abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019 is well documented. So is the role played by Chinese state media in psychological operations against the Indian Army and government after May 5, 2020 PLA aggression on the north banks of Pangong Tso.This gives rise to the question: Is India and the government prepared to deal with the perception onslaught? The answer is a flat no – despite the fact that the current political dispensation in Delhi is itself no stranger to managing perception and image. There are several reasons for this.One, all servers of these global internet platforms and news-aggregators-turned-editors-and-publishers are based in either the US or Europe. This means that India, despite having framed relevant IT laws cannot make these firms accountable. The result: large technology firms pretty much decide what people see online and what they don’t; who gets to express their opinions, and who doesn’t.Two, the role of lobby groups in promoting a certain perception or creating a global outrage against India is underestimated by the South Block, which, with a few exceptions, suffers from an imperial past. It is like the Indian military, which wants to buy more tanks in the age of stand-off laser weapons. So, while Indian adversaries such as China and Pakistan hire lobbyists or sponsor chairs in global think-tanks, Indian law prohibits the hiring of paid networks to the counter digital narrative.Also Read: How #IndiaTogether became top trend after Rihanna's tweet on farmers' stirThree, Indian embassies in the west have hired lobbyists firms but only to promote bilateral relations and not to counter negative propaganda. Weaned on the non-aligned narrative of the past century, Indian diplomats, again with a few exceptions, are still to come to terms with the new media and medium. Perhaps that is the reason why action against Chinese Confucius Institutes and prior approval for MoUs between universities of countries sharing land borders with India is still work in progress despite a July 15 red flag by intelligence agencies.Four, Indian security agencies and police are still to absorb the changes in the virtual world, where VPNs make the task of locating the cyber adversary very difficult and even friendly countries do not share critical cyber technologies. The fact is that the Indian offensive capabilities are extremely limited, and the budget restricted as compared to even countries such as Turkey, leave alone the US, Russia and China.Five, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is perpetually under stress, especially when it comes to dealing with the digital world. Decisions to make large technology companies accountable for content is a technical, legal, social, and diplomatic issue, and even now, different standards apply to digital news media and print news media, which is accountable to the last word.Six, one of the ways to counter disinformation and information is to have a counter-narrative. While the political parties in power use their own cyber warriors to fight this battle, the government’s counter-narrative is the job of the Press Information Bureau. PIB is still caught in a time warp of an era gone by where the print was King. Today, the order stands reversed and digital media is supreme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/perception-is-the-truth-in-information-warfare-over-farm-laws-101612424959375.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||350 buses provided to police, para-military personnel taken back by DTC||Over 350 buses provided to the police and the para military personnel were taken back by the DTC on Thursday, officials said.The move comes a day after the Delhi government decided to withdraw all the buses under special hire.The decision was taken in the backdrop of heavy deployment of police and para military personnel on Delhi's border points in view of the farmers agitation against Centre's farm laws.The low-floor DTC buses have been extensively used for movement of police and paramilitary personnel for deployment in various parts of the city. The departments concerned have been asked to relieve the buses, officials had said on Wednesday."As per direction of the authorities, 360 of the total 576 buses provided to police and para military under special hire have been withdrawn to different depots. However, 216 buses are still with the security personnel in view of the law and order situation," said a senior Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) officer.In normal times, about 100 buses are provided by DTC to the police and para military forces. However, the number of buses went up to 576 after farmers started their protest at the Delhi borders, officials said.It was decided that all the Delhi Transport Corporation buses on special hire would be withdrawn with immediate effect, by the Delhi government, on Wednesday. It was also decided by the authorities that approval of the government will be required now before requisition of buses under special hire, officials had said.Some DTC buses that were used by police and security personnel to block the roads during the tractor parade by protesting farmers on January 26, were vandalised by a section of protesters who had entered the city. The BJP leaders have slammed Delhi government for withdrawing buses from police and para military personnel amid the protests at the city borders and charged the ruling AAP of taking the decision for "political" gains in Punjab where Assembly polls are scheduled next year.The farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and UP are protesting at Delhi border that have been fortified with barricades, cement blocks, concertina wires, spikes and deployment of heavy police and para military personnel.

04-02-2021||Delhi||Govt says lockdown led to improvement in river Yamuna's water quality||The water quality of the Yamuna in Delhi improved during the lockdown due to the stoppage of industrial effluent discharge, availability of more water for dilution and absence of polluting human activities, the government told Lok Sabha on Thursday.It said the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) carried out water quality tests at three locations -- Palla, Nizamuddin bridge and Okhla -- in April last year.The assessment of the water quality in April as compared to the pre-lockdown period in March showed improvement at Palla, where the river enters Delhi, in terms of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and at Nizamuddin Bridge and Okhla in terms of dissolved oxygen (DO) and BOD.Biochemical oxygen demand is the amount of dissolved oxygen used by microorganisms in the biological process of metabolizing organic matter in water.Dissolved oxygen is the amount of oxygen available to living aquatic organisms. High BOD levels mean there is a high level of microorganisms in the water, and a high content of organic material that is broken down by the organisms.The greater the BOD, the lower the amount of dissolved oxygen available for fishes and other aquatic lifeThe improvement in the water quality was attributed to the "release of fresh water from Wazirabad Barrage" which washed away sediments, settleable and colloidal form of pollutants in the river, Minister of State for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria informed Lok Sabha. Other reasons included the stoppage of industrial effluent discharge (about 35.9 million litres a day), "good penetration" of solar radiation in the water body and the absence of human activities such as throwing of garbage, bathing, washing of clothes due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-says-lockdown-led-to-improvement-in-river-yamuna-s-water-quality-101612461587700.html

Within three hours, PM Modi was in Trivandrum, and I was here as well. He deputed me here for a week, to personally look after the patients and take care," Nadda said.Slamming the ruling party, the BJP chief alleged that the entire state machinery in Kerala is involved in corruption."One CM has a love for gold, the other one delivered and derived energy from 'SOLAR'. It has given a very bad name to Kerala as a state. In both corruption and scam cases," he said.Regarding the COVID-19 cases in the state, Nadda said that COVID has been mismanaged in a massive way."Over half the cases are from Kerala at this time. When India has the highest recovery and lowest fatality rate, Kerala is performing poorly," he added.Nadda arrived in Kerala on Wednesday for a two-day visit to the state to review the BJP's election preparations ahead of Assembly polls.

04-02-2021||Delhi||Judge recommends counselling, meditation to reform gang-rape convict, upholds 10-year jail term||The Delhi high court on Thursday said correctional courses, meditation therapy, vocational training and psychometric tests should be given to reform a man convicted of gang-raping a 13-year-old boy along with is accomplices in a truck in Aman Vihar area in 2016.Justice Anu Malhotra, while upholding the 10-year-old prison sentence awarded to the man, said educational opportunities and skill development programmes should be given to the man for making himself self-dependent.The court said adequate counselling should also be given to him to keep him from joining antisocial groups and to make him understand the reason for him being in prison.The man, Chand, through his counsel had challenged the conviction and punishment awarded to him in February last year for aggravated penetrative assault on the minor.According to the prosecution, the man along with two others, one of them a juvenile, sexually assaulted the child and also criminally intimidated him on January 25, 2016, around 3am. The child had told the police that he was beaten and forcibly taken aboard an oil tanker truck, where he was sexually abused while being held at knifepoint.The judge said the trial court had rightly convicted Chand because there was no motive for the child to falsely implicate him. It said the appellant does not deserve any leniency and there is no infirmity in the judgment of the trial court.“In the circumstances, there is no infirmity whatsoever in the judgment and the appellant merits no leniency... The appeal is thus declined,” Malhotra said.He asked the jail superintendent to submit a biannual report till the date of release of the convict, detailing the measures taken to reform and rehabilitate him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/judge-recommends-counselling-meditation-to-reform-gang-rape-convict-upholds-10-year-jail-term-101612461370705.html

04-02-2021||Other||Delhi: FIR against two children’s homes for ‘abuse and irregularities’||New Delhi: A first information report (FIR) was registered on Wednesday against two care homes for children after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) reported a host of abuse and irregularities such as sexual abuse, using the children for anti-CAA protests, not providing them the right living conditions, Covid-19 norms violations, among others, the police said. The police identified the two homes as Umeed Aman Ghar, a home for boys, and Khushi Rainbow Home, a residence for girls -- both based south Delhi. “The NCPCR conducted inspections at the two homes on October 1 and submitted their findings to us. We did a preliminary enquiry after that and registered an FIR under the Juvenile Justice Act and the section 188 (disobedience to an order passed by a government servant) at Mehrauli,” Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south) said on Thursday. According to Priyank Kanoongo, chairperson of NCPCR, the two homes are run by Centre for Equity Studies where activist Harsh Mander is a director. Kanoongo accused the officials of the two homes of trying to “derail” the enquiry process by saying that Mander was not connected to them. While Mander remained unavailable for a response despite repeated phone calls and a text message, a response sent by the management of the homes said that Mander only conceived the Rainbow Homes Programme (HRP) under which the children are cared for. The management said the NCPCR was trying to malign the reputation of HRP as Mander is a “known critic of the government and its policies”, they added that Mander was no longer associated with the “day-to-day running” of the programme. Kanoogoo said there were shortcomings in how the children at the home for boys were kept and the arrangements for their toilets and bathrooms despite several incidents of sexual abuse.The management of the homes said none of the three known cases of sexual abuse between 2012 and 2016 involved the staff there and was perpetrated by inmates. They said all cases were brought to the notice of the authorities and led to registration of FIRs. But DCP Thakur said that there were reports of sexual abuse continuing and not being reported. However, no cases of sexual abuse was found in the home for girls. Kanoogoo, as well as the findings of an inspection by NCPCR on October 1, pointed to alleged irregularities in the financial aspects of the two homes, the living conditions of the children and flouting of several applicable laws. Other allegations, the DCP said, was of the children being sent to attend anti-CAA protests, not having necessary measures in place to deal with Covid-19 and foreign nationals visiting the homes. The management denied any financial irregularities, and said that no children were sent to attend any protests and there were no set rules or standard operating procedures (SOPs) for several shortcomings that the commission noted during the inspection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-fir-against-two-children-s-homes-for-abuse-and-irregularities-101612461311592.html

But the government did not share data for beneficiaries under each category. On Thursday, 13 cases of adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI) were recorded, but none of them were severe in nature, senior government officials said.Health care workers are the first priority group for the inoculation drive, which was rolled out across the country on January 16. In Delhi, 240,000 health workers have registered for the vaccination.Front line workers come next on the priority list. They include police officials, fire officials, municipal staff, sanitation workers, schoolteachers and staff across all departments and agencies which were engaged in Covid-19 management. Delhi has an estimated 600,000 front line workers, of which around 350,000 have registered for vaccination so far, said data shared by senior government officials, who added that the registration drive for front line workers is underway.Last week, the Union government told states to consider starting vaccination for front line workers by the first week of February, following which the Delhi government scaled up its vaccination capacity on Tuesday by increasing the total number of vaccination sites from 106 to 183 and the number of vaccination days in a week from four to six“The trial run for vaccination of front line workers started today (Thursday) at least three vaccine centres in each of the 11 revenue districts. Few more centres will be roped in on Friday. We plan to start it full-fledged vaccines by Saturday. The front line workers will be eligible for shots in the same centres where health workers are being vaccinated. This is the reason why overall capacity for vaccination was scaled up,” said a senior government official.A senior official in the health department of the New Delhi Municipal Council said, “Registered front line workers will also be allowed for out-of-turn jabs, similar to the policy adopted for health care workers. The government is helping with the list of beneficiaries for all centres. The centres will have to ensure that records are properly maintained.”On Wednesday, Delhi had recorded the lowest vaccination turnout for a single day – at 40.25%. In Delhi, the highest single-day turnout was recorded on January 25, the fifth day of the drive, at 91.5%. Delhi had 81 vaccination centres then, which was increased to 106 on January 27.Government officials and experts attributed the recent decline in turnout to lack of awareness among beneficiaries about the new centres and decline in figures in several of the existing vaccination centres which, they said, suggest that they may have reached a saturation point. However, they said, the turnout is likely to go up once again now with doors opened for front line workers.Dr Namrata Makkar, deputy medical superintendent at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, said: “The turnout numbers should increase. Now that thousands of health workers have already been vaccinated in Delhi, the confidence-building exercise should be easier for front line workers and eventually the masses. In its awareness drives, the government should clearly deliver the message that how the vaccine is the biggest preventive measure against a potential second wave of the disease, which several countries across the world have witnessed.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “More centres will open doors for front line workers on Friday as part of the ongoing trial. It was a good decision to start with the trial and assess management-related issues. With time, the turnout numbers should go up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/9494-get-vaccine-jabs-in-city-trial-for-front-line-workers-starts-101612461312165.html

It said that a crime can happen in a fraction of seconds but the investigation takes time, while adding that it was to analyse the mindset of such petitions.“So you started typing the petition right after the incident on January 26 noon? Do you know how much time is given for investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code? You are a lawyer. How much time is given for an investigation?”“You expect the investigations to be completed within two days of the incident? Does the government have a magic wand which it will wave and everything will be done? Should we dismiss it with cost or will you withdraw,” the bench asked advocate Vivek Narayan Sharma, appearing for the petitioner.Man arrested for R-Day violence gets bailA Delhi court has granted bail to a man arrested for allegedly being part of unlawful assembly and conducting riots in the Uttam Nagar area during the tractor rally on Republic Day. The court stated that “no fruitful purpose would be served by curtailing the liberty of the accused”.Additional sessions judge Dheeraj Mor, while granting bail to one Sandeep Kumar, said that the Investigating officer’s report is “conspicuously silent” about his previous criminal involvement.“Therefore, there is no reason to doubt the submissions on behalf of the accused that he has clear antecedents. He is no more required for the investigation of this case. In the aforesaid circumstances, no fruitful purpose will be served by further curtailing the liberty of the accused,” the judge said in his order of February 3.The judge also noted that co-accused Gurvinder Singh, with the similar allegations as that of the accused, was released by the police after giving a notice.Kumar, through his counsel, advocate Kapil Chaudhary, had contended his client was falsely implicated in this case and he was just a bystander at the spot of occurrence. He said that Kumar was neither part of the unlawful assembly nor he was involved in the riots.The counsel said that Kumar owns a shop of iron rods at Kakrola, Dwarka Mor, New Delhi and he was not part of any agitation.However, opposing the bail application, additional public prosecutor Satvinder Kaur, told the court that the accused was part of unlawful assembly that committed riots and caused injuries to nine police personnel. She said that the members of the unlawful assembly also damaged the public property including the cluster buses.The police had earlier released a list of over 120 arrestees after allegations that several protestors were illegally detained without even informing their families.Advocate Harpreet Singh Hora said that their legal team has been providing legal aid since the first day of the arrests of several farmers and this type of orders give them hope.“Additionally, the bail reinforces our faith that the people who have been wrongly implicated in these cases shall get justice. What we are doing is upholding the law and we will strive to fight cases of these farmers till this reaches a logical conclusion,” he said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over two months now against the three farm laws.The tractor parade on January 26 that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/43-firs-in-r-day-violence-13-being-probed-by-special-cell-delhi-police-tells-hc-101612461250767.html

But the BJP has distributed the money among their own leaders. While the BJP leaders are claiming that they did not receive any money, bank statements show otherwise,” said the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations. Employees in the municipal bodies – from health workers and teachers to sanitation workers and clerks – have been protesting over non-payment of their salaries.While the corporations claim that they are facing a massive financial crunch because of inadequate funds released by the Delhi government, the latter has accused the municipal bodies of multiple scams. On January 14, the Delhi government had announced that it would give ₹938 crore to the MCDs for payment of salaries to their employees.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These allegations are baseless. Delhi government has not given the MCDs ₹1,095 crore. They have given the MCDs ₹438 crore for salaries and ₹463 crore for expenses under other heads related to health and education.

It will start with Delhi government hospitals and, with time, aim to rope in hospitals operated by the Central government, civic agencies and private ones, said senior officials in the health department.The system will include issuing health cards to patients, which would essentially be a QR code-based system that can keep tabs on clinical details such as health checks, follow-ups, surgeries, medications and vaccinations.The system is also supposed to include a mobile-app as well as a 24x7 call centre to help patients with health-related information, seeking consultation and other assistance. The centralised call centre will provide two levels of help — first where an operator will receive people’s calls and messages and provide them with requisite information and the second where doctors and experts will provide appointments based on the problem or immediately provide solutions for emergency cases.“The chief minister directed the officials to ensure that work is strictly completed within the stipulated deadline. He also instructed to ensure that the distribution of the health cards is started at the earliest. In the meeting, the healthcare helpline was also discussed… Under HIMS, various features such as a web portal, mobile app, etc will be launched to store a database of the health condition of residents of Delhi. The system will be implemented by August 2021 in all Delhi government hospitals,” said a statement issued by Kejriwal’s office on Thursday.It further said, “The system seeks to target the health care delivery process. All the patient care services, hospital administration, budgeting and planning, supply chain management, and backend services and processes will be brought under the system. The entire system will be on cloud and digitized. This will enable citizens to avail all information on one platform, which will help them in emergency cases. With this, Delhi will become the only state to have a cloud-based health management system.

The judge granted bail to Kuldeep Singh in connection the murder of an auto driver Babbu during the riots that had broken out in the Khajuri Khas area.The court also said that one of the witnesses, Munna, claimed that he was present when the incident happened on February 25, 2020; however, he never approached the local police station or make any call to the police on 100 on that day.“…instead he went on to name the applicant (Kuldeep Singh) for the first time during the course of recording of his statement by the investigating officer (IO) on May 18, 2020. Between February 25 and May 18, 2020, Munna never made any complaints whatsoever to the local police/investigating agency,” the court said in its order.The judge also said that the case of another eyewitness, Imran, is the same — he did not make any complaint to the police on his own till June 20, when his statement was recorded.The court said that identification of the accused by two beat officers is hardly of any consequence. It questioned the actions of one of the policeman in waiting till May 11, 2020 for the identification of the accused.“In my opinion, the identification of applicant by aforesaid police officials is hardly of any consequence, as this court is not able to comprehend as to why the beat officers waited till the recording of their statements/ supplementary statements when they had categorically seen and identified the accused indulging in riots…..,” the court said.“Being police officials, what stopped them from reporting the matter then and there in the police station or to bring the same in the knowledge of higher police officers? This cast a serious doubt on the credibility of aforesaid two police witnesses,” it added.The court granted bail to Kuldeep Singh on a bail bond of ₹20,000 and asked him to maintain peace and harmony in the locality. Communal riots had broken out in north east Delhi in February 2020 claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ne-delhi-riots-bail-to-murder-accused-for-humungous-delay-in-recording-eyewitness-accounts-101612461190138.html

The Bill will now be tabled in the ongoing Budget session of Parliament, he said.The Centre’s move could lead to fresh friction between the office of the L-G and the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government which have squared off several times in the past six years over the extent of each other’s powers. The battle of primacy ended up in the Supreme Court, where it is still pending. “The Union cabinet has stealthily approved amendments to give so much power to the L-G that he can now stall any project or work initiated by the elected government in the Union territory. As per the Centre’s proposal, the final decision-making power will lie with the L-G and not the elected government,” Sisodia said.The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter.Specifically, the proposed law will clearly spell out the functions of the Council of Ministers and the L-G by giving more discretionary powers to the L-G. The proposed amendments suggest that the L-G could act in his discretion in any matter that is beyond the purview of the powers of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi in matters related to the All India (Civil) Services and the Anti Corruption Branch. If the legislation is passed, all the incentives offered to the people of Delhi by the AAP government would be taken away by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government, Sisodia warned. Under the current arrangement, following an order by the Supreme Court on July 4, 2018, the L-G is in charge of police, land, and public order, and the state government, the rest. The proposed law is “nothing but a backdoor channel being created by the BJP-led Central government to directly rule over Delhi. If this happens, then all the freebies and subsidies given by the AAP government will be snatched away from the people of Delhi. The BJP-led Centre will revoke our free power, water and bus rides for women schemes. It will also revoke the free treatment in Delhi government hospitals which every resident of the city is entitled to,” Sisodia said. He added that giving such powers to the L-G means empowering the Centre to rule directly over Delhi. Because Delhi is a Union territory, the L-G is appointed by the Union ministry of home affairs. “The Centre’s attempt to reduce the powers of an elected government is not just against democracy but it is also against our Constitution. The Constitution of India clearly states that barring three subjects - police, land and public order - all other subjects and works will be under the direct control of the elected government, which currently is that of Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party,” he said. Sisodia said that in 2015, the Central government misinterpreted the Constitution to claim that the L-G would run the Delhi government. When AAP challenged the interpretation in the Supreme Court, a constitution bench clarified that the elected government had the right to take decisions on all subjects except matters related to the police, land and public order, with the L-G only having to be kept informed about the Delhi government’s day-to-day decisions, Sisodia said. The court is yet to rule on who has control over the subject of services, which deals with transfers, postings and annual performance reviews of bureaucrats.“Now that it has no way out, the Central government is now keeping aside and overlooking the Constitution and the observations of the SC to directly rule over Delhi,” the deputy chief minister said. The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter.Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said all union territories are administered by the Central government through the L-G.“Delhi has very limited powers because of its nature as a union territory. It is something the Delhi government has to compromise with. The President administers it through the L-G and hence the assembly has very limited powers. But, it is true that it was unnecessary for the Centre to initiate such an amendment at such a junction when the Supreme Court has given a subject wise clarity on several issues. Maybe the central government is attempting to clarify the division of power further,” he said.The Delhi BJP said the Centre’s decision to amend the Govt Of NCT of Delhi Act is an important step to ensure proper governance in the national capital.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said repeated instances of conflict between the Arvind Kejriwal government and the lieutenant governor in the past six years have put the “prestige of the national capital and people’s lives and welfare at stake”.“The latest move by the Delhi government to withdraw DTC buses from police duty is a glaring example of why how national capital Delhi’s law and order and other serious administrative powers cannot be left to the state government. Steps being taken by Centre are important to maintain law and order and administrative control in the national capital,” he said. Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said when the Congress was in power at the Centre, the focus was strengthening the state governments. “But the current BJP government is creating a dictator-like regime and weak state governments are unable to stand before it.” “Arvind Kejriwal, who portrayed hinself before the public as someone who would fight against the government, is now proving to be a weak leader who cannot safeguard the interests of Delhi and its people. I want to ask him (Kejriwal), why doesn’t he sit on a protest against the central government now? Why doesn’t he fight for the rights of Delhi? Since this government came into power in Delhi, we have time and again seen weak leadership from the AAP government, and the BJP at the Centre is taking advantage of this,” Chaudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-wants-to-rule-over-delhi-through-back-door-channel-sisodia-101612461130115.html

In the letter, special commissioner of police Robin Hibu said if any untoward incident happens in Delhi then DTC may be held accountable.A senior DTC officer confirmed that the corporation has received the letter after which DTC managing director met Hibu to resolve the issue. The DTC MD also raised the pending dues on the part of the Delhi Police amounting to about ₹10 crore with Hibu, officials said.Till Thursday, of the total 576 buses, over 350 buses provided to police and para military personnel were returned to DTC. Late Wednesday evening, the Delhi government issued a directive to DTC to seek prior approval before giving any of its buses on ‘special hire’ by the Delhi Police or any other organisation. The order came in the wake of 40 DTC and cluster buses getting damaged during the tractor rally by protesting farmers on Republic Day when the police used buses as barricades at several locations, including ITO and Akshardham.“As per direction of the authorities, 360 of total 576 buses provided to police and para military under special hire have been withdrawn to different depots. However, 216 buses are still with the security personnel in view of law and order situation,” said a senior DTC official.Normally, about 100 buses are provided by DTC to the police and para military forces. However, the number of buses went up to 576 after farmers started protest at Delhi borders, officials said.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticised the Aam Aadmi Party government on Thursday for withdrawing DTC buses given to the city police, saying chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is pushing the city into a state of anarchy for political gains, especially in Punjab and Delhi. The AAP which is the main Opposition party in Punjab has extended support to the farmer agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws. Several BJP leaders such as party’s national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, MPs Meenakshi lekhi, Parvesh Verma, Ramesh Bidhuri, Manoj Tiwari tweeted on Thursday with hashtag #KejriwalWantsAnarchy, criticising the decision to withdraw DTC buses. “India has a history of brave patriots from Prithvi Raj Chauhan to APJ Kalam & also has a history of Jaichand to Mir Jaffar. Recent action by Arvind Kejriwal to deny DTC bus services to police is a case in point which proves his anarchist credentials in support of Delhi seizure,” tweeted Meenakshi Lekhi, BJP MP from New Delhi. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta tweeted, “Delhi Police has always been a victim of cheap politics of Anarchist CM @arvindkejriwal. For their political interests, @aamaadmiparty has blamed Delhi Police for every act of violence in the city be it Jamia, JNU, Delhi Riots or Farmers protest violence. #KejriwalWantsAnarchy.”Gupta said Kejriwal was compromising with the safety and security of the people living in Delhi.Demanding immediate withdrawal of the order, BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who is also the leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly, said, “The buses are needed by security forces. This is not the time to do politics. For political gains in Punjab, he shouldn’t push the city into a state of anarchy. The order should be immediately withdrawn.”Bidhuri added, “It is regrettable that Kejriwal neither went to ask the health condition of 300 police personnel injured during the Republic Day violence nor uttered a word of sympathy for them.” Despite calls and text messages, the AAP did not comment on the allegations by the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-asks-dtc-to-review-decision-to-recall-buses-101612461010157.html

Police said three customers were allegedly found in compromising positions at the spa, and were arrested along with the spa manager by the Sector 20 police. The Delhi-based owner of the establishment has also been booked and is on the run at the moment.Police officers said 14 women were rescued from the spa who alleged that they were being forced to provide illegal services to customers. Eight cell phones, cash and used contraceptives were recovered from the spot.“Most of these women are from Nepal and the north-east who have been living in the city for years now. When questioned, they said they were being forced to work there. They were sent to a women’s shelter for rehabilitation,” said deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1, Rajesh S.Officers said Noida police is not taking action against the women. They added that the police had used decoys posing as customers to bust the operation.The DCP said that the department has sent a letter to the district administration to seal the spa and take further action, while notices will be issued to the other spas as well.“We are yet to receive the letter but once we do, necessary action will be taken,” said city magistrate Umashankar Singh.Officials said that unlike Delhi, there are no provisions to recall licenses of running spa centres in Noida. A senior police official said that most of the spas operating in the city are running illegally.“Our teams had raided six-seven other places last week following tip-offs but no evidence of nefarious activities was found at the time, because of which action could not be taken,” said the official, asking not to be identified.Officers said that the spas have been operational since 2005 and are now under police radar.“We have identified a few places in Sector 18, a couple of city malls in Sector 51, among others, and are building teams for raids.

04-02-2021||Noida||Noida sees rise in night temperature, mercury to drop by Saturday||Noida: The city on Thursday witnessed a rise of three degrees Celsius in minimum temperature, while parts of it saw light drizzle thereby dropping the day temperature. The city has seen the minimum temperature rising by seven degrees Celsius since Tuesday. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature for Noida on Thursday was recorded at 15 degrees Celsius against 12.1 degrees a day earlier and 8.4 degrees on Tuesday. The maximum temperature, however, dropped due to thundery development and drizzling. Noida recorded a maximum temperature of 23 degrees Celsius against 25.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier and 27.2 degrees on Tuesday. IMD said that while the minimum and maximum temperatures will continue to be well above the season’s average, the mercury is likely to fall from Saturday due to return of the cold north-westerly winds. According to weather analysts, Noida saw light drizzle – too low to measure – that impacted the minimum temperature slightly. The current active western disturbance – a weather system that causes rains or snowing in the Himalayan states and subsequent rains or thundery development over the national capital region (NCR) – will, however, pass through the region by Friday, further leading to change in the wind directions from warmer easterly to colder northerly. “Noida saw very light rains on Thursday. But, the sky will get clear on Friday. There will be a slight drop in mercury on Friday, and the minimum temperature is likely to fall considerably and hover around seven degrees by Saturday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. For NCR, the average minimum and maximum temperatures, based on Safdarjung observatory, were 12.4 degrees Celsius and 23.2 degrees Celsius against 10.4 degrees and 26.1 degrees a day earlier. The Safdarjung area also recorded an average rain of 0.5mm, IMD said. The minimum and maximum temperatures on Friday are expected to hover around 12 and 24 degrees Celsius, respectively. Meanwhile, the air quality of the region saw remarkable improvement as wind speed increased. However, the air quality remained under ‘very poor’ category. “The wind speed further increased on Thursday and the maximum speed recorded was 20 kmph. This led to further improvement in the air quality.” Srivastava added. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Thursday was 322 against 339 a day earlier. Greater Noida’s AQI was 312 against 345 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad reported an AQI of 338 against 388 on Wednesday. An AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The three cities – Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad – had been suffering either ‘very poor’ or ‘severe’ levels of air quality since January 13, while the best air quality last realised was under ‘moderate’ category on January 4. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the surface winds will be supportive of better air quality. “Surface winds are high and easterly in direction. Under the approaching western disturbance, isolated rain is expected tomorrow. AQI is likely to further improve to the poor category tomorrow, and may touch moderate for a shorter period. The improved AQI is likely to stay for a couple of days,” said a SAFAR statement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-sees-rise-in-night-temperature-mercury-to-drop-by-saturday-101612460230583.html
04-02-2021||Noida||Noida: Traffic police set up road safety cell to prevent accidents||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar traffic police on Thursday set up a road safety cell for better management of traffic-related issues and preventing accidents. With a dedicated team of eight officials led by a traffic inspector, the safety cell will coordinate with different departments and civil society members to help make the roads safer.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), GB Nagar, said that most of the accidents take place as commuters fail to obey traffic rules. “We have developed the road safety cell which will coordinate with different departments related to traffic and also create awareness among the public and the road users,” he said. The safety cell will also coordinate with different NGOs, resident welfare associations, and market associations to deal with the traffic problems effectively, he said, adding that a dedicated mobile phone number will soon be issued to contact the cell.“The cell will work every day. It will organise workshops for the drivers of commercial and public vehicles such as buses, trucks, auto rickshaws, etc. The cell will also organise awareness programme in schools, colleges and other educational institutions,” Saha said.According to the GB Nagar traffic police data, as many as 358 people died while 240 were injured in 442 accidents in the district from January 1- September 15 last year. Rohit Baluja, director, Institute of Road Safety Education, in a programme of road safety month – November 2020 – had said that as per the National Crime Records Bureau, every year around 23,000 people die and 28,000 others are injured in road accidents in Uttar Pradesh only.Anurag Kulshrestha, president of TRAX, an NGO working towards road safety, is an advisor to the road safety cell. Kulshrestha said that a number of fatalities take place due to poor qualities of helmets used by two-wheeler riders. He also demonstrated this at the event by placing some sub-standard helmets on a table and hitting them with a hammer, which were damaged with one blow.The DCP (traffic) said that the traffic police will soon run a drive and take action against the seller and manufacturers of sub-standard helmets in GB Nagar. “We will take action leading to an FIR,” he said.Kajal Kumari, a student of Shyam Singh Smarak Inter College, Sarfabad, also attended the programme with her classmates and NCC cadets. “I also used the hammer to break a sub-standard helmet. I have learnt that road safety is very important and people should buy good quality helmets,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-police-set-up-road-safety-cell-to-prevent-accidents-101612460230088.html

At the time of the allotment of the flat, the developer had assured that the said project was duly approved by the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA).Later, Gupta, a Delhi resident, came to know that no approval had been granted by GDA in respect of the said project. He then contacted the developer and wrote emails for the cancellation of allotment and refund of the deposited money. He paid an amount of ₹2,74,571, which was 20% of the total cost of flat, as per the order of the consumer forum.The developer denied the allegation and stated that 20% of the basic sale price of the flat constituted the earnest money. The earnest money shall stand forfeited in case of default by the buyer not making payment of all instalments in time, the developer said.Then Gupta filed a complaint with the consumer court on March 27, 2015, against the developer having its corporate office at Noida, seeking relief by directing the developer for cancellation of allotment of the flat and refund of the deposited money.The developer stated that it had applied for the sanction of the site plan of the project on October 7, 2013, but it was sanctioned by GDA on July 14, 2014.“The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission comprising president Anil Kumar Pundir and member Daya Shanker Pandey has directed the developer to cancel the allotment of flat and refund the deposited amount of ₹2,74,571, along with an interest of 9%. The order was delivered on January 29,” Aditya Bhati, representative of District Consumer Court Advocates Association, said on Thursday.When asked, a Wave City spokesperson said, “We will honour the court order and refund the money.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gbnagar-district-consumer-commission-directs-builder-to-refund-money-for-wrong-info-101612460110098.html

His statement comes in the light of Tikait and farmers protests stationed at the borders of the national Capital drawing criticism over politicians’ visits to protest sites after incidents of violence on Republic Day in Delhi.“Yahan vote nahi milega, yahan roti mil sakti hai; galatfahmi main mat rehna (you can get food here, but not votes; do not harbour misconceptions). Don’t come here seeking votes. Jung chhidi hui hai (there is a fight going on). This is not the ‘manch’ (stage) for seeking votes. The MPs and MLAs who are coming here are our guests, but they will not be allowed to make speeches from the dais as the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (the apex body of farmers’ unions leading the protests) has issued guidelines in this regard,” Tikait said at UP Gate Thursday evening. He, however, lashed out at the government on issues of heavy barricading at the Delhi-UP border and Ghaziabad and the issue of internet services there being snapped.“The agitation will be long. Plan ‘A’ went on for 70 days, and we now have plan ‘B’. Under this, we are calling for 15 persons and one tractor to be sent from a village for 10 days of stay here. After 10 days, this group can go home and another group can come here for the protest. With such an arrangement, we can stretch this agitation for long. If we can plan the sowing of our crops, we can plan to prolong our agitation. We sow crops and they sow nails,” Tikait added. He said if need be, the farmers can resort to underground boring to get water and can also get generator sets and water tanks brought to the site. He also added that the government should talk to the core-committee at Singhu Border and decide on the issue of repeal of the three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price.“For the past three days we have observed that some people have arrived who have different views . We have put a complete ban on speaking against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and we will not allow this from the dais as well. There are people who are uploading such videos. They must leave,” Tikait added.He said that during the Chakka jam planned for February6, protesting farmers in their respective areas should offer milk,groundnuts, fruits and food to people and should also hand over memorandums to their respective district officials. As part of the call, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has called for state and national highways to be blocked.Since the protests began at UP Gate on November 28, 2020, there have been many instances where speakers have made comments against the government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from the dais. After the developments on Republic day in Delhi, many politicians from opposition parties have visited the UP Gate site. Prominent among those were Delhi’s deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, Uttar Pradesh Congress committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda, while many others have spoken to Tikait over the phone and extended help and support.The site also saw visits by Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Singh Chautala and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, besides several others who tried to come to UP Gate on Thursday morning but were unable to cross the heavy barricading at the border. “The protest is completely political; it is a form of masked protest for political opposition. People who have no agenda are resorting to such tactics. They say that farmers are with them. But the farmers are not with them but with PM Modi. There are many people from different political parties who are going there and participating in one way or the other,” said Chandra Mohan, spokesperson and state secretary of BJP – UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dont-come-here-to-seek-votes-says-tikait-on-politicians-coming-to-up-gate-101612460049971.html
04-02-2021||Noida||Barricading stops MPs from meeting farmers at UP Gate||The multi-layered barricading at the UP Gate border once again came in for criticism as 15 members of parliament (MPs) from different political parties arrived to express solidarity with the protesting farmers. Unable to cross the barricading from Delhi, they returned without going to the site.The protesters said that if the leaders had resorted to a sit-in at the border, it would have created a lot of pressure on the Delhi Police to remove the barricades. Among the MPs were Lok Sabha members former Union minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Supriya Sule of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK’s) Kanimozhi and Trinamool Congress’s Saugata Roy. They said they were shocked at the magnitude of the barricading in place. “It is for the first time in my life that I have seen such barricading that stops people meeting people in the national Capital. We have been trying to raise the issue of farmers in the Parliament for the last two days. We have seen such multi-layered barricading, almost a fortification, only at the Pakistan border. They (police) told us that it is closed and said that we cannot go. Are we anti-nationals or terrorists? Are these farmers anti-nationals or terrorists?” Badal told reporters on the Delhi side of UP-Gate border. “It is also humanly impossible to cross it (the barricading). The DMK and our leader MK Stalin have been supporting the (farmers’) cause right from the beginning and we want the laws to be withdrawn. We just came here to say that we are with them,” said Kanimozhi. Delhi Police barricaded the border with iron grilles, concertina wires and even big boulders to prevent anyone or any vehicle from breaking it. Earlier barricades were easily pushed aside by tractors and farmers in their march to Delhi. Ever since it was put up last week, the nails on the ground to prevent tractors from going through came in for special criticism.On Thursday morning, a group of workers were also seen removing the nails and it was speculated that the Delhi Police had decided to remove them. But that was not to be.“These are just being repositioned. Position of arrangement at the border remains same,” said Deepak Yadav, DCP – East district of Delhi.Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava on Tuesday had said, “I am surprised when tractors were used on January 26 and police were attacked and barricading was broken, no on raised questions. What we did? We have just strengthened the barricades so that they should not be broken time and again.” On the other hand, the farmers at UP-Gate have also been voicing concerns over the barricading and said that it was causing affecting their supplies and people who wished to join them. They added that the barricading was also affecting local residents who now had to switch to other routes. “We don’t know why such heavy barricading was put up in the first place. It also prevented MPs from visiting us. We feel that had the members staged a sit-in near the barricades, it would have created a lot of pressure on the Delhi Police,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of UP-Gate farmers’ committee. Pintu Biswal, a native of Ghazipur district in Uttar Pradesh, also echoed similar sentiments. “I have been here for the past two months and have seen a number of politicians coming to support the farmers. But they come and go. No one sits here with us,” he said. Prominent among those were Delhi’s deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, UP Congress committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda, while many others have already spoken to Tikait over the phone and extended help and support. The site also saw visits by Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Singh Chautala, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal and also Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut.

04-02-2021||Other||Khattar govt bent on appointing former HPSC chief as power regulator||Chandigarh The Haryana government is contemplating to appoint a former chairman of Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) RK Pachnanda as the chairman of Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC). The move, legal experts say, is in contravention of Article 319 of the Constitution which prohibited member of a public service commission from holding offices on ceasing to be such members. Article 319 says that a chairman of a state public service commission shall be eligible for appointment as the chairman or any other member of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) or as the chairman of any other state public service commission, but not for any other employment either under the central or a state government. The state government, however, has taken a legal opinion on the matter from advocate general BR Mahajan, who is learnt to have given a green signal for Pachnanda’s appointment on the grounds that HERC is a quasi- judicial body and does not fall under the constitutional restriction. Mahajan, however, was unavailable for a comment. When asked on the legality of the move, power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala, who will administer the oath of office to the new HERC chairman, refused to comment. Legal experts however disagree on the justification. Former Haryana advocate general, Ashok Aggarwal said such an appointment will violate the spirit of the Constitution. “ Prima facie, even though HERC is a statutory body, one can’t say that it’s not a government employment. Whether such a move will hit the letter of law can be a matter of debate. But by all means, the move violates the spirit of the Constitution. This is not an exercise in tune with the spirit of the Constitution. The idea of putting a constitutional bar was to ensure the independence and impartiality of members of the public service commission by insulating them from allurement of a future employment under the government,” Aggarwal said. Another former advocate general Mohan Jain said there was clear constitutional prohibition on chairman or member of a public service commission from holding offices once their term in the commission is over. “ The appointments in HERC are done by Haryana government. There is a certain amount of control that government exercises over the electricity regulatory commission,’’ Jain said. Box What Dr BR Ambedkar had said Speaking about the employment or eligibility for employment of the members of the Public Service Commissions, Dr BR Ambedkar, regarded as the architect of the Constitution, said in the Constituent Assembly on August 22, 1949, that both the chairman and members of the central and state public services commission have been made ineligible for reappointment to the same posts once their term of office is over. “I think that is a very salutary provision, because any hope that might be held out for re-appointment, or continuation in the same appointment, may act as a sort of temptation which may induce the member not to act with the same impartiality that he is expected to act in discharging his duties. Therefore, that is a fundamental bar which has been provided in the draft article,” he had said. Dr Ambedkar had further said there is also a provision that neither of these shall be eligible for employment in any other posts. “There is therefore a double disqualification. There is no permission to continue them in their office, nor is there provision for their appointment in any other posts,’’ he said. The only exceptions where they could be appointed are mentioned in Article 319.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/khattar-govt-bent-on-appointing-former-hpsc-chief-as-power-regulator-101612459330058.html

The overall statistics of Day 1 (see box) provided by Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation states only 21.50 per cent of students were present. At least 303 private and 120 civic body-run schools conducted classes for 5-8. “Number will increase as many schools will put in place Covid prevention measures soon. There are 647 schools in PCMC for class 5-8,” said Parag Mundhe, education officer in PCMC. Private schools in PCMC showed good response and parents were happy with the arrangements. “Students were happy to be back in school instead of continuing with the online classes.

Developers of five such projects have also been directed not to demand payment from buyers till the adequate amount of construction is carried out.The decision was taken after a review meeting on Tuesday, wherein officials observed that some developers were not executing the work at the required pace.Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, said that directions have been issued to officials to constitute a team and visit the construction sites to check the status of work as there have been repeated complaints from buyers regarding delays in construction. “The report should be submitted to this office in the next week and after perusing the same, we will make recommendations to senior officials in Chandigarh for initiating action against the developers,” he said.DTCP officials observed that a number of complaints had been received directly by the department, while a few were also registered with the CM Window, following which it was decided that a status report be obtained in this matter. Mann said that earlier, the department considered the status report submitted by developers in good faith, but the rising number of complaints have forced them to intensify scrutiny.The decision to call for an inspection was also triggered by the fact that some of the developers did not attend the review meeting called by the department on January 27. A major grouse of the homebuyers in these projects has been that while 50% of the payments have been made, the pace of work has been inadequate.“Affordable housing will remain viable only if the builders deliver the projects within the stipulated time of four years. The majority of buyers in these projects are end-users, who want the units to live there. If timelines are not followed, then the entire idea would be defeated,” said Mann, adding that the directions from the government state that projects under this segment should be completed on time.Gurugram has 80 affordable housing projects on the ground and there are around 50,000 such apartment units in various stages of construction. To boost this segment, the department has already announced an increase in the land available in residential sectors and the size of the projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-to-inspect-affordable-housing-constructions-as-complaints-pile-up-101612458310433.html

As per information available with the agency, the estate office had received around 242 applications in January and, till Tuesday evening, 79 were pending. The citizen charter had required the office to clear applicants’ requests within a fixed timeline -- 32 such categories had to be completed in two weeks -- and many of these were flouted.For instance, the process to issue a completion certificate needs to be completed in four days and the certificates should be issued within eight working days and so on. Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, said, “We are also working to ensure that CM Window complaints are resolved.” Earlier, the chief administrator had also taken cognizance of delay in processing of applications in Gurugram, said an official privy to the matter. “Apart from instructions from local officials, the direction from head office will ensure that pending work is completed on priority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-tells-estate-office-1-to-clear-pending-files-101612458311006.html
04-02-2021||Gurugram||Pathways School blocks online access over fee issue||As many as 80 to 100 students of classes 9 to 12 of Pathways School Gurgaon have been blocked from attending online classes by the school authorities since Monday over a shortfall in fee payment, the parents’ association said on Thursday. Members of Pathways School Gurgaon Parents Association (PSGPA) alleged that the school was pressurising students to ensure that parents pay the full composite fee (instead of 80%, as per interim court order) for classes, despite the matter being sub judice. The parents’ association has lodged a complaint with the district education department which has sought a response from the school. The school, meanwhile, said that since physical classes for grades 9 – 12 had commenced from January, no rebate/concession on school fee will be granted for these grades from January onwards. In an email response to HT, a school representative said, “The rebates/concessions on school fee were to be granted ‘till school commences its physical operations’. Since physical classes for grades 9 – 12 have commenced from January, no rebate/concession on school fee is to be granted for these grades from January onwards.”The school and PSGPA have been embroiled in a dispute over fee payment since last March. The PSGPA had also approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, which, in December 2020, passed an interim order declaring that the school could charge 80% of the composite fees on a monthly basis for online classes. Parents, however, said that the school raised an invoice seeking 100% of the composite fee in January irrespective of whether the student opted for online or physical schooling. Subsequently, parents were given time till January 31 to pay the fee. Strangway Orridge, a parent, said his son, a class 11 student, had been blocked from accessing online classes since Monday. “The principal of the school wrote an email to my son regarding the fee matter last week. After that, since Monday, they have suspended my son’s school accounts and he has not been able to access classes or lessons,” said Orridge. He said that he had been paying 80% fee of the composite fee regularly, as mandated by the court order. “The school is choosing students as soft targets. Our children are not able to make submissions, which are crucial. Even if they visit schools, they can’t make submissions,” said Orridge. Gauri Webster, the president of PSGPA, said, “The whole issue is in court. We are complying with the court’s directive and paying the fee as per the interim order. Why can’t the school wait till the court gives a final verdict? The court has said that the 20% rebate on composite fee will continue till the matter is decided.” She said that students were being asked to visit schools for submission but online access to students was being denied. “Students are being called to school, but since they don’t have access to their accounts, they cannot learn or submit any work despite physical visits,” said Webster.The school, in its reply to HT, stated that while it had extended full support to parents and remained in full compliance with the directives of the state and Punjab and Haryana high court, there were some parents, who — in spite of having been directed to make payments by the director of secondary education, Haryana, and the Punjab and Haryana high court — were failing to do so. “Several requests and reminders issued by the school to such parents have gone unheard, compelling the school to take steps in accordance with the law,” the reply stated. District education officer Indu Boken referred to a directive of the department issued on Wednesday and said that private schools were expected to abide by the orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court issued in June and October last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/pathways-school-blocks-online-access-over-fee-issue-101612458309911.html
04-02-2021||Gurugram||Vij launches drive at police commissioner’s office||Haryana home and health minister Anil Vij on Thursday launched the second phase of the vaccination drive at the office of the commissioner of police, KK Rao. Vij said that the health department has sufficient doses of the vaccines and all front-line workers, including the police personnel, will be vaccinated within 10 days. “The health teams are dedicated and are working hard to ensure all people get vaccinated as soon as we get the vaccines. All police officials and MCG officials will be covered within 10 days and others will be covered under the third phase,” Vij said. Police personnel will be inoculated at five camps in different areas in the city. The police said that personnel aged above 50 years and those deployed at state and district borders are being given priority. Rao said that 409 personnel, including 10 officers, were vaccinated on the first day of the drive. There was no hesitation from the force and none of them reported any side effect, he said. Rao and Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, were among the first to take the Covishield jab at the commissioner’s office on Thursday. “The deputy commissioner and I were the first ones to get the vaccination shot to convey a message that the vaccine is safe and assure others not to pay heed to misinformation. We were the first ones to get vaccinated so as to assuage apprehensions about the vaccine,” he said. Other senior officials, who were vaccinated on Thursday, included the joint commissioner of police, deputy commissioners of police, assistant commissioners of police, station house officers and personnel who were deployed at borders with Delhi and Rajasthan. The drive was planned to begin at 10am at commissioner of police building but due to the sudden visit by Vij, the arrangements were changed and the vaccination started at 11.30am at the commissioner’s office. The four other dedicated vaccination sites for the police were set up at the traffic tower, Sohna police station, Manesar police station and police lines. The police said that personnel were registered beforehand and locations were allocated close to their police stations. There are 5,930 police personnel in Gurugram and about 400 personnel had tested positive for Covid-19 last year.Amit Chauhan (37), constable, posted with the complaints branch, was the first to get vaccinated. He said that he was excited and relieved to get vaccinated, but his family members were reluctant due to a fear of side effects. “Immediately after getting vaccinated, I informed my family that I am fine and do not have any symptoms like nausea and headache. They asked me to rest for the day and asked about my experience,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vij-launches-drive-at-police-commissioner-s-office-101612458252766.html
04-02-2021||Gurugram||Wayu devices reduced dust pollution by 35-50%, shows data; experts sceptical of impact||A preliminary analysis of particulate matter concentrations near 53 outdoor air purifiers, which were installed at six locations in the city by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) last year, shows that the devices are able to reduce dust pollution by 35 to 50% in the immediate vicinity of the device.Authority officials said that this analysis, conducted by Delhi-based NGO Indian Pollution Control Association, although promising, needs to be substantiated with better data before a decision can be taken on installing more such purifiers at other locations.In November last year, GMDA had launched Project Air Care, a corporate-funded partnership with a private pharmaceutical company, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and Indian Pollution Control Association (Ipca), which is certified by the central pollution authority and founded under the aegis of IIT-Delhi.The campaign involved installing a total of 65 Wayu — Wind Augmentation purifying Unit — devices at Subash Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Bakhtawar Chowk, and other areas with high traffic volume. Of these, 53 were installed by November-end and have been operational since launch.“Each week, a team is sent out to change the filters, do routine maintenance, and monitor variations in air quality around the device. All of Gurugram’s Wayu units are in working condition. Our preliminary findings suggest that they are being able to reduce particulate matter pollution to a significant degree in a radius of 20 metres around the device, or 500 square metres, in terms of area,” said Dr Radha Goyal, deputy director, Ipca.“The efficiency depends on local conditions and proximity to emission sources. We are installing another 12 units at AIT Chowk and in Sector 54 by Saturday and will start monitoring those weekly too,” she said.Goyal added that Ipca has been granted a three-year operation and maintenance contract for these devices by the GMDA, which includes submitting timely reports on their performance. While all the devices are not going to have an equivalent impact, Goyal said that the range of efficacy lies between 35 and 50%. “This basically means that when the device is turned on, it can reduce at least a third of total dust pollution load, if not more. We have also sent filters from each device to be tested by Neeri, which developed the technology, to understand the chemical constituents of particulate matter at key traffic junctions in Gurugram,” she said.Subash Yadav, head of the GMDA’s urban environment division, however, clarified that the authority does not have immediate plans to install more such devices, beyond the 65 stated in the contract. “The interim results look promising, but we need more proof of performance before we can scale up this intervention. We will give it a couple of more months to see if these devices are durable, and we will require a more detailed report about each device’s impact. Ipca is currently preparing one, which will be reviewed next month,” he said.This view was also echoed by VS Kundu, the chief executive officer of GMDA, who said, “We may also seek an independent report from a third-party agency to see how the Wayu units are performing. Any decision to install more devices will also depend on the CSR budget of the partner organization for the next financial year.”Experts, however, remained sceptical of these measures. A senior Delhi-based air pollution scientist and former member of the erstwhile Environment Pollution Control Authority (Epca), requesting anonymity, said, “These purifiers did not work when Delhi implemented them in late 2018. The devices kept getting tampered with or vandalised because there was no concessionaire appointed for maintenance. While the technology itself is sound, the impact is going to be negligible because the principle is weak. In an indoor setting, with limited volumes of air, filters are a good option. But the sheer volume of ambient air is too much for these devices to be effective outdoors.”Responding to this, Kundu said that a detailed air pollution mitigation plan for the city is currently in the works. “We cannot provide any more details at the moment because it is in too early a stage. Proposals have been sought from three organisations, including The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) and Neeri. The broad contours of the plan are yet to be worked out, and the final draft is a few months away. We will share more details as the plan progresses.”However, Yadav and Kundu both said that this plan would be part of a larger environment management plan for the city, along the lines of the recently published Comprehensive Mobility Management Plan for Gurugram, which was outsourced to the Delhi School of Planning and Architecture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wayu-devices-reduced-dust-pollution-by-35-50-shows-data-experts-sceptical-of-impact-101612458251436.html
04-02-2021||Gurugram||Turnout at 44% on Day One of second phase of vaccinations in Gurugram||The second phase of Covid-19 vaccinations started on Thursday, but only 44% of the 1,100 registered front-line workers, which comprised police, municipal workers and revenue department staffers, showed up to take the jabs, according to the district health department data. A reluctance among workers of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and revenue department led to a boycott of vaccination at a few session sites and caused an overall dip in the footfall on the first day of inoculation of front-line workers.Of the 1,100 front-line workers, only 481, comprising police, MCG and revenue department workers, took the Covishield jab at 11 dedicated session sites. Over 400 of the total who took the jabs were police personnel, said officials. Almost 81% of the 500 targeted police personnel turned up for the vaccinations at the five session sites. The other two departments — MCG and revenue – together reported a turnout of only 14%. Against a target of vaccinating 500 MCG workers, comprising sanitation and other staff, only 67 turned up across the five vaccination sites, while only five of the 100 revenue department workers took the shot at the session site set up at the Mini Secretariat. Haryana home minister Anil Vij, who is also the state health minister, inaugurated the second phase of Covid-19 vaccination drive at police commissionerate in Gurugram. The commissioner of police, KK Rao, and deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Yash Garg, were present during the inauguration and received their shots in the presence of the minister. Vij said that across the state, about 450,000 front-line workers have been identified for the second phase of vaccinations. In Gurugram, roughly 18,000 such workers are registered, who are planned to be covered across the 11 session sites, said officials. Considering the high footfall among its employees, the police department has planned to add five more new sites to the existing ones. On the other hand, among the MCG sites — the MCG office in Sector 34, community centres in Islampur, Sukhrali, sectors 27 and 10A — a few of them lacked proper management on Thursday. A vaccination site was yet to be set up at the MCG’s Sector 34 office till 11am, as per a visit by the HT team. Besides, the site lacked proper seating space for observation after vaccinations and had no facility for adverse events. MCG officials present at the site said that messages were not delivered to the vaccine beneficiaries. “We are contacting some of our employees to come for vaccination,” said an official, who did not wish to be named. The staff at the site said that none of the senior officials of the agency had turned up for the inoculations. Confusion prevailed at the Islampur site due to the presence of two community centres in the area. The session site was opened after 11.30pm and over 40 sanitation workers who had reached the site boycotted the vaccination due to apprehensions. According to the district health department data, two session sites set up for the MCG, at Islampur and Sukhrali, reported zero vaccinations. Ashish Singla, the medical officer of MCG, was unavailable for comment.“The health department provides vaccinators, data entry operators and helps in arranging police personnel at the vaccination site fixed by the department concerned,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “Other arrangements — from setting up the vaccination site to motivating employees — had to be done by the department. It can be expected that the footfall of MCG employees will improve on Friday,” Singh said.The health department also continued with the vaccination of healthcare workers. Of the 650 people targeted on Thursday, at least 506 workers took the vaccine shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/turnout-at-44-on-day-one-of-second-phase-of-vaccinations-in-gurugram-101612458252081.html
04-02-2021||Gurugram||Zero vaccinations at two MCG session sites||A group of men and women wearing khakhi uniforms had gathered outside the community centre in Sector 38 on Thursday morning to head to the Covid-19 vaccination site at Islampur community centre on Sohna Road. But before reaching the site, they decided not to take Covid-19 vaccination, after hearing that many of their seniors in the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) had not taken the shot. “We will go to the vaccination site but won’t take the shot. Vaccination is voluntary, and it cannot be forced,” said Sachin, supervisor, sanitation staff of Ward 28, even as 20 people surrounding him nodded in agreement. “Why is so that we are being pushed to take the vaccine but not our seniors?” said Sachin.A woman worker, requesting anonymity, said that the entire sanitation staff has pulled through the worst of the pandemic over the last year. “So, is it even necessary to take the vaccine now?” she said. Many sanitation staff who reached the vaccination site posed similar questions to Kamlesh, an Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM), who was deployed as a Covid-19 vaccinator at the Islampur site.The entire sanitation group of over 40 people boycotted the vaccination and left the site despite Kamlesh’s efforts to motivate them. None of them took the vaccine jabs, even as the vaccinators waited till 5pm. A similar situation prevailed at Sukhrali, where none of the registered vaccine beneficiaries turned up for the shot, citing multiple reasons. Rajbala, a vaccinator at Sukhrali said, “Based on the contact numbers given in the beneficiary list, we have contacted the MCG staff. Some of them directly refused, while others said that they are too busy to come for vaccination.” Out of the five vaccination sites for MCG workers, these two sites reported zero footfall. Due to apprehension and lack of awareness regarding the safety of Covid-19 vaccine, front-line workers decided to turn away from taking the jab on Thursday. Hesitancy regarding vaccination existed even among healthcare workers. The vaccination of front-line workers, however, has brought to the fore the lack of awareness as well as fears among white-collar workers.Overall, only 67 of the 500 MCG workers took the jabs. “These workers are not confident to take the vaccination as they are scared. If one from the group takes the vaccine, others will certainly follow,” said a vaccinator at the Sector 10A session site. The vaccination at the site did not start until the councillor of the area arrived to motivate the staff. At the vaccination site at the MCG’s Sector 34 office, some employees at the superintendent level inquired about the vaccine but cited multiple health issues for not taking the shot. A computer operator at the MCG office, who took the vaccine said, “Unnecessarily, senior officials are scared of vaccination. Someone has to come forward and be a part of it at least motivate others.” The vaccinators at the site also said that the staff has been lacking confidence to come forward.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh and chief medical officer of MCG, Dr Ashish Singla, were unavailable for comment on Thursday. A senior official of the administration privy to the matter, said, “Vaccination of MCG employees cannot improve until seniors set an example by getting vaccinated at each of sites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/zero-vaccinations-at-two-mcg-session-sites-101612458250596.html
04-02-2021||Gurugram||‘Reluctance can only be tackled through positive messaging’||The deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Yash Garg, who took the Covid-19 vaccine shot on Thursday said that hesitancy for vaccination can only be addressed through positive messaging. In a conversation with Archana Mishra, Garg talked about plans to tackle the poor turnout of front-line workers from the municipal corporation and revenue department in the second phase. Garg also shared plans for the third phase of vaccination by collating the data of prioritised groups.How do you assess the success of the vaccination drive in Gurugram so far?The vaccine has been an integral part of Covid-19 management. It is the fastest and the safest way to build herd immunity. In Gurugram, roughly 24,000 healthcare workers have taken the shot. Minus the duplicity in the registered list of vaccine beneficiaries, there are close to 31,000 healthcare workers in the district. Over the next 15 days, the plan is to cover workers who have been left out. Now, the second phase has also started; therefore, the commissioner of police and I took the Covid-19 vaccine to assuage any concerns and address rumours regarding vaccine safety. A vaccine is not launched without proper safety protocols. There could be minor side effects, which indicate the body is building up an immune response. Therefore, people should not be hesitant in taking the shot.As compared to healthcare staff, front-line workers from MCG and revenue seem to be more hesitant as at some of the sites, not a single beneficiary turned up on Thursday. How do you plan to address the issue?Since vaccination is a voluntary exercise, reluctance can only be tackled through positive messaging on a massive scale. Also, one has to lead by example to motivate others. Meetings will be held with the departments concerned and the MCG commissioner to circulate messages regarding the safety of the vaccine. Also, social media and available resources will be used to create awareness after identifying the lacunas in the vaccination drive and the reasons for the lag.When is the third phase of vaccination likely to start?The third phase of vaccination includes people above 50 years of age with co-morbidities and also those who are younger than 50 years but have co-morbidities. The phase is yet to be rolled out by the central government. However, we are trying to do the preliminary work of building our database. Vaccination sites and workers are being identified. We are also trying to coordinate with private sectors. By the time the third phase is rolled out, the district will be in a good position with a solid plan for vaccination.How are the prioritised group for the third phase being identified?During the pandemic, a lot of surveys have been conducted in the district. The administration will also utilise the data collected through Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) or Family ID card. Multiple sources are being used. The self-registration mechanism might also start for the general population.When will the district administration begin the vaccination of employees of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) as they too have been added as the front-line workers?The state government has given time till February 7 for collating the data of PRI workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/reluctance-can-only-be-tackled-through-positive-messaging-101612458249981.html
04-02-2021||Pune||Engineering specialisation courses top picks this year||Pune: As the institutional-level admissions will begin from February 5 for engineering courses, this year’s trend shows students going only for few specialisations like computer science, artificial intelligence, data science and instrumentation. Traditional engineering specialisations like mechanical, chemical, civil and other courses are hardly getting student admissions. Pharmacy courses are also getting few takers across the state. A senior state education department official on condition of anonymity said, “Computer science and artificial intelligence specialisation for engineering courses are in demand this year. In such tough times of Covid-19 pandemic where each college and institute is struggling to survive, they cannot sustain if seats for various courses remain vacant. Several engineering colleges across the state have yet to see a single admission.” Admission process of various engineering and other professional courses got delayed this year. “There are students waiting for the institutional-level round to start, just to get the college and specialisation of their choice. Hence, vacancy rate is high across the state. There are limited seats for the selected engineering specialisation that students seek admission. If admission is not done this year, many students have decided to skip this year and try next year with fresh CET exam and admission process.” said Prof Kishore Tayade, from one of the engineering colleges from Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/engineering-specialisation-courses-top-picks-this-year-101612457649874.html
04-02-2021||Pune||Admission delays leave students frustrated in Pune||Pune: The delayed admission process for various professional courses in the state has left students and parents a frustrated and worried lot. The Maharashtra State Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell has completed two Common Admission Process (CAP) rounds for engineering admissions along with other courses. From February 5, the institutional-level round of MHT-CET Bachelor of Technology (BTech) counselling 2021 will begin. “Colleges have many vacant seats for various courses like engineering, pharmacy, management, agriculture and other streams. Specifically in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur cities, there are colleges where admissions are not happening which include both government and private colleges. We have completed the two CAP round of admissions and now the institutional-level admission process will begin,” said Maharashtra Chintamani Joshi, commissioner, state CET cell. “While admission process is still going on, medical and dental courses admissions have completed. Engineering admissions will end on February 5 then agriculture and law admissions will start from same day. But the response by students is not as expected in engineering as except computer sciences and artificial intelligence, there are vacancies for other courses across the state. For example, in one college there are 100 available seats for an engineering course and only two students have shown interest,” said Joshi. The Class 11 First Year Junior College (FYJC) admissions are also delayed. For this year’s 11th standard admissions, 72,820 students were eligible for admission in 304 colleges of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas. Due to the interim stay given by the Supreme Court (SC) on the implementation of the quota for the Maratha community in jobs and education, the state education department stopped the admission process for FYJC since September 9 and it resumed from November 26. After completing three regular rounds and two special rounds of admission process, the deputy director of education (DyDE), Pune, took one round of first-come-first-served (FCFS). At least 36,000 seats are still vacant in Pune division and the remaining students who have still not completed the admission process will get one more chance for FCFS second round that will be announced soon. “We have received permission from the state government to take one more round of FCFS. The schedule of the round will be announced soon,” said AS Ukirde, deputy director of education for Pune division. Kuldeep Ambekar, student and president of Students’ Helping Hand organisation, said, “Post issues related to Covid, the delay in admissions for various courses has added to students’ woes. Technical issues and state government’s decisions have led to admissions still going on. Hope the admission delay does not affect students’ career prospects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/admission-delays-leave-students-frustrated-in-pune-101612456989845.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||'No reason to change govt's plan': Delhi HC on plea demanding inclusion of legal fraternity in Covid vaccine drive||The Delhi High Court on Thursday said the Government has its own priority in vaccination drive and it sees no reason to change the priority as decided by the Centre while hearing a petition seeking inclusion of judges, judicial staffs, advocates and the members of the legal fraternity in the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination.Meanwhile, after noting the submission of senior lawyer Pradeep Rai representing the petitioner, the bench of Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the authorities to consider the petition as a representation.Petitioner Amrender Singh, a practicing lawyer sought, the entire Rule of Law depends on the functioning of courts and the litigants are suffering delays in delivery of justice in absence of normal functioning of courts.The plea states that several advocates amongst the legal fraternity has faced unprecedented times due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and is still dealing with the repercussions of the same.The plea had alleged that the Government failed to include the legal fraternity in its first vaccination drive without having regard to the life, health and wellbeing of the Judges, practicing advocates and other staff of the legal fraternity.It added that due to pandemic, the courts have not functioned to their full capacity and restricted audience, absence of examination of witnesses, limited hearing of cases, malfunctioning of software programmes operating the video system and delays in hearing are leading to a crisis not only for the litigants and lawyers but also to many who draw their sustenance from the courts- small canteen workers, couriers, photostat shops, stationers etc.Many are being driven to penury and others seeking relief in the long-pending case, the plea said.Plea seeks direction to extend the present vaccination programme to the legal fraternity to usher in normalcy in the working of the judicial system.This will restore the faith of the people in the judiciary. Opening court halls and hearings in physical form are of seminal importance. It would be in the larger interests not only of the litigating public but also in the history of the administration. It will assuage a system that has been fractured by the pandemic.The Supreme Court Bar Association on 18th January through a letter requested the Union Law Minister to extend the vaccination to Judges, members of the staff and lawyers who work in the judicial system as frontline workers, but no action has been taken till date to include the legal fraternity in present vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-reason-to-change-govt-s-plan-delhi-hc-on-plea-demanding-inclusion-of-legal-fraternity-in-covid-vaccine-drive-101612429980808.html
04-02-2021||Pune||Slam Dunk: Selecting elite talent – what physical attributes does NBA talent selection prioritise?||Pune: It is the 2015 NBA finals, and the Golden State Warriors are down 2-1 to the Cleveland Cavaliers led by LeBron James. With a basketball hoop that is 10 feet above the ground, height has usually been a premium advantage to each team. However, in this pivotal Game 4, coach Steve Kerr opts to replace a 7’1 starting centre with a 6’7 wing player in the starting lineup. The Warriors go on to win the game and the championship in six games. A few decades earlier, a move like this would have been unthinkable. What caused the evolution of playing styles in the NBA and how has this impacted the current NBA game?In the 1980s decade, the most valuable commodity in basketball was size, specifically height. The best teams were usually the teams that had the most talented and biggest athletes playing close to the rim, scoring the majority of their points in the painted area close to the goal. Teams that ruled the decade such as the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers featured multiple superstar big men such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Robert Parish, Kevin McHale and Moses Malone. In fact, even in the 1984 NBA draft where Michael Jordan was picked with the number 3 pick, the two players selected ahead of him were both centres. Through the 1990s, height was still prioritised heavily in constructing NBA lineups. The more frequent adoption and common usage of the 3-point shot made it so that smaller teams could compete and attempt to outscore bigger teams. However, with the dominance of the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s, this was the first time that a team featuring a guard (Michael Jordan) and a wing (Scottie Pippen) as the primary offensive and defensive players won multiple championships. Height was still regarded as a premium commodity, emphasised by teams consistently selecting big men with higher picks in the NBA Draft. With the success of the Chicago Bulls, there was a paradigm shift towards talented wing players who could score, pass and defend all over the floor in the 2000s. The NBA started to emphasise the skillsets of versatile players such as Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Jason Kidd and Kevin Garnett. The two best teams of the decade were both led by hulking big men in Shaquille O’Neal for the Lakers and Tim Duncan for the Spurs. Despite this, more and more franchises started shifting towards a style that emphasised versatile skillsets for traditionally different positions. Big men who could shoot further away from the rim like Dirk Nowitzki, pass the ball like Chris Webber and guard multiple positions like Kevin Garnett became the first in a wave of players to prove that a paradigm shift was occurring in the talent selection of the NBA. Finally, in the era of the 2010s the league started to see a complete shift towards versatility in athleticism and positional length. Looking at the current NBA, the most impactful players and lineups played by coaches feature players with above average hand sizes and wingspans, with the athleticism to cover the entire court quickly and move fast laterally. In fact, the average NBA player has never been shorter in comparison to the past 39 seasons. Players that have the most impact and have won championships in today’s NBA like LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard all possess these elite physical attributes. In fact, there are a number of NBA Drafts that have now selected wings or guards as #1 picks in this era. This is how the NBA has evolved in its talent selection compared to previous eras, which consistently prioritised height over athletic versatility.Adi Vase is the first Indian to work in the physical coaching and sport science departments of NBA teams.

04-02-2021||Pune||Prabha Atre foundation starts initiative to create resource centre for Kirana gharana||With an intention to create a resource centre which will help study Kirana gharana, Prabha Atre foundation has started an initiative which will be useful for music researchers and lovers. Kirana gharana is one of the most prolific Indian classical khyal gharanas. The Prabha Atre foundation intends to document published or written material related to Kirana gharana and its artists under a roof. Many legendary musicians have come from Kirana gharana. Prabha Atre is one amongst them.“The documentation or written material on performing arts and music is too less. Scriptures which are available today for research rely on books which were published in 15th and 16th century books such as Bharat Natya Shastra. Through these books we just learn the theoretical aspect of music,” said Bharathi MD, honorary secretary of Prabha Atre Foundation.“There are not many books available on contemporary performing art. There are few a books and material available which documents and analyses contemporary performing art,” Bharathi MD added.Given the historic and vast nature of the Indian classical music, it is a mega task to document entire classical music forms. So, for now Prabha Atre foundation has begun with the Kirana gharana. “Considering the limited resources and infrastructure, we have we decided to concentrate on Kirana gharana. Maharashtra, northern Karnataka is the region from where Kirana gharana musicians have emerged. Prabha Atre belongs to Kirana gharana. So, we thought of creating a resource centre where we can collect the material related to Kirana gharana and it will be available for those who want to study it,” said Bharathi MD.The foundation is collecting the books, articles and other material related to Kirana gharana. It has asked music lovers also to contribute to this initiative. Any material (written or recorded) about Kirana gharana and its artists or Kirana gharana and its artists are welcomed to be collected for the resource centre. This material will be codified and properly stored in physical or digital form.Those who wish to contribute can give material at Prabha Atre Foundation, opposite Sambhaji Garden, JM road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/prabha-atre-foundation-starts-initiative-to-create-resource-centre-for-kirana-gharana-101612437064532.html

The Congress leader also attended the final prayers organised for the deceased.Priyanka said that the government is choosing to look at the agitation against the three laws as a political conspiracy. “The three farm laws are crimes (being committed) against the farmers and should be rolled back, but the bigger crime is calling martyrs ‘terrorists’ and viewing the farmers’ protests as a political conspiracy against (the government),” Priyanka was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.She also said that the Congress will stand by the farmers and voiced her support to the family’s demand for a judicial inquiry into the death of the farmer. She said, “Family members of the deceased want judicial inquiry. We are with the farmers and their families. The government is yet to identify this movement as a real struggle. There is no politics behind it. It is painful for our farmers.”The Congress, Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party, Trinamool Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and BJP’s ex-ally Shiromani Akali Dal along with other opposition parties have expressed their support for the farmers’ agitation.The farmers have been protesting since November last year against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The farmers’ unions representatives came under criticism after the January 26 clashes but they claim that outsiders had infiltrated the movement in a bid to malign the agitation. They continue to claim that the laws will lower the incomes of farmers and pave the way for multinational corporations to earn profits off the agricultural sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/govt-needs-to-stop-viewing-protests-as-political-conspiracy-says-priyanka-101612436286233.html

Many of them were carrying water collected from 36 communities of 36 villages in steel urns.

04-02-2021||Pune||Maharashtra home minister says Usmani to be arrested from “wherever he is”||A day after a First Information Report (FIR) was filed against Sharjeel Usmani, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday said that the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) leader will be arrested from ”wherever he is”. A case has been registered against Usmani by Swargate police on Tuesday for allegedly trying to create divide between two groups as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) threatened to launch a statewide protest. Usmani (23) is a resident of Uttar Pradesh, was one of the speakers at January 30 Elgar Parishad in Pune, where he made controversial remarks about Hindus. He had earlier hit headlines after his arrest by the UP police on July 10, 2020, over allegations of his role in the violence that broke out at AMU during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December 2019. He was released on bail on September 2, 2020. Calls and text messages sent to Usmani went unanswered. “Police have investigated the video clippings of the Elgar event held on January 30 in Pune and a case has been registered against Sharjeel Usmani for his offensive remarks. He is currently not in Maharashtra, but we will arrest him from whichever state he is in, be it Bihar, UP, Gujarat or elsewhere,” said Deshmukh, while speaking to reporters in Mumbai. In Pune, BJP leaders stepped up pressure after the FIR and met police commissioner Amitabh Gupta demanding invoking of sedition charges against Usmani and his arrest. “Yes, a case has been registered under Section 153(a) of the Indian Penal Code based on a complaint lodged by advocate Pradeep Gawade about a speech made at Elgar Parishad. The case is registered at Swargate police station. Investigation is on,” said commissioner Gupta. Besides being a lawyer, Gawade is also BJP Yuva Morcha general secretary in Pune. The BJP launched an attack on the state government based on the nature of the case that was registered against Usmani. The BJP leaders have also asked for the organisers of the Elgar Parishad to be booked for sedition. Moreover, Chandrakant Patil, state chief of the BJP, wrote to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to register an FIR against Usmani and arrest him. “We have asked for the sections of sedition to be invoked against him. If that is not done, we will hold large scale protest. The state government is being two-faced in this matter - they are trying to protect these criminals. The Shiv Sena, which asked for votes based on Hindutva, has taken a complete U-turn,” said Jagdish Mulik, Pune unit head of Bharatiya Janata Party. Mulik met with commissioner Gupta and joint commissioner Ravindra Shisve along with mayor Murlidhar Mohol, MLA Mukta Tilak, and complainant Gawade. In a letter that was given to the commissioner, the BJP members raised the issue of Usmani to have been invited to the Elgar Parishad 2021 in Pune by Harshali Poddar, a member of Kabir Kala Manch, who is among the multiple accused in the case registered after the Elgar Parishad in 2017. The first edition of the Elgar Parishad was held on December 31, 2017, and allegedly triggered caste clashes in Bhima Koregaon the next day. Following the clashes, Pune police arrested multiple activists and lawyers including Sudha Bharadwaj, VV Rao, Sudhir Dhawale, Arun Ferriera, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Surendra Gadling, Vernon Gonsalves, and Rona Wilson by Pune police. After the current Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government took office, Centre transferred the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) who then arrested at least four more including Jyoti Jagtap, Ramesh Gaichor, Sagar Gorkhe of KKM, and journalist Gautam Navlakha. “They have distributed literature during the Elgar Parishad that made defaming statements about the death of Babasaheb Ambedkar. The book claims that he was murdered by his wife, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Shripad Dange, and brahmins,” said Gawade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-home-minister-says-usmani-to-be-arrested-from-wherever-he-is-101612435805887.html
04-02-2021||Pune||Organiser condemns Sharjeel Usmani’s ‘Hindu’ remark during Elgar Parishad in Pune, also slams BJP||Former Bombay high court judge BG Kolse Patil, one of the organisers of January 30 Elgar Parishad, said on Wednesday that he condemned former AMU student leader Sharjeel Usmani’s remarks during the event. Patil said that Usmani’s speech was “fine”, but the usage of the word “Hindu” was wrong and the organisers have condemned it. “It was his mistake. Instead of the word Hindu, he should have used the word ‘manuwadi’ or ‘brahminwadi’,” said the former judge. Kolse Patil also criticised the BJP for demanding action against the AMU leader. “BJP is making an issue out of this, purely to defame Elgar Parishad. Those who are now talking about Hindus, we appeal to them for a discussion.” Usmani did not respond to calls and text messages. Following his remarks, Swargate police filed an FIR against Usmani on Tuesday, based on the complaint by advocate and the general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), Pradeep Gawade. The FIR was filed under section 153a (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Uproar broke out following Sharjil’s video going viral on social media, followed by the demand for action against Usmani, by the Maharashtra BJP, accusing him of hurting religious sentiments of the Hindu community. Saturday’s event was organised by the Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyan, an umbrella body of 250 Dalit, Left and other social organisations. It was addressed by Arundhati Roy; former bureaucrat Kannan Gopinathan; former Bombay HC judge BG Kolse Patil; journalist Prashant Kanojia, Ayesha Renna and singer Bunt Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/organiser-condemns-sharjeel-usmani-s-hindu-remark-during-elgar-parishad-in-pune-also-slams-bjp-101612435685344.html

Announcing this at a press conference in Shimla on Thursday, state police chief Sanjay Kundu said that a team of Kullu police arrested a 38-year-old native of the west African country of Ivory Coast after recovering the contraband from him in the national capital. Kullu superintendent of police Gaurav Singh, who joined the press conference virtually, said that the special investigation unit of the district police zeroed in on the accused after the arrest of two peddlers of African origin on January 30 with 55gm of heroin. “On tracing their links, the special investigation unit was able to track down the supplier in Delhi and make its highest seizure of 6.27 kg of the synthetic drug,” Singh said, adding that the accused had been brought to Kullu for questioning. Preliminary investigation showed that the accused was living in Delhi without valid travel documents. A case was registered against him under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act that punishes a person using a forged passport for entering India or illegally staying in the country to a jail term of at least two years. The drug supplier in Delhi was in touch with heroin peddlers across the country, including those active in Himachal Pradesh. The Himachal Pradesh Police have so far arrested 23 foreign nationals, including 16 from Africa, for drug smuggling. Committed to cracking down on drug mafia: DGP Kundu said that the state police were committed to cracking down on the drug mafia. “It’s a myth that the police catch only small-time peddlers. The Kullu police recovered 123 kg of charas along with two guns in January. That was the biggest drug seizure in the state’s history,” he said. Additional director general of police, law and order, Ashok Tiwari and ADGP, crime and security, N Venugopal were also present at the press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kullu-police-seize-6-27kg-of-heroin-from-african-supplier-in-delhi-101612434065863.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||BJP-led Central govt wants to rule Delhi through back door: Sisodia||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday slammed the Centre for “stealthily” approving a proposal to amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act to give more power to the lieutenant governor, who reports to the Central government.Addressing a digital press conference, Sisodia said the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the proposal to “snatch powers” from the elected chief minister and the Delhi Cabinet and strengthen the authority of the lieutenant governor. A bill will now be tabled in the ongoing Budget session of Parliament for the amendment, he said. The move is set to trigger a fresh tussle between the lieutenant governor and the Delhi government. “The Union Cabinet has stealthily approved amendments to give so much power to the L-G [lieutenant governor] that he can now stall any project or work initiated by the elected government in the Union Territory. As per the Centre’s proposal, the final decision-making power will lie with the L-G and not the elected government,” he said.Also Read | Govt will help find missing farmers: Delhi CMSisodia warned if this legislation is passed, then all subsidies would be taken away from the people of Delhi by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “This is nothing but a back door channel being created by the BJP-ruled Central government to directly rule Delhi. If this happens then all the freebies and subsidies given by the AAP [Aam Aadmi Party] government will be snatched away. The BJP-led Centre will revoke our free power, water and bus ride for women scheme. It will also revoke the free treatment in Delhi government hospitals which every resident of the city is entitled to,” he said.Sisodia said giving such powers to the L-G means giving it to the BJP-ruled Central government to rule Delhi. “The Centre’s attempt to reduce the powers of an elected government is not just against democracy but it is also against our Constitution. The Constitution of India clearly states that barring three subjects - police, land and public order - all other subjects and works will be under the direct control of the elected government which currently is that of Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP,” he said.Sisodia said in 2015, the BJP-led Central government misinterpreted the Constitutional rule to say that the L-G would run the Delhi government. “...when we went to the Supreme Court to challenge this, the constitution bench of the Apex court clarified that the elected government in Delhi had the right to make decisions on all decisions except the three subjects. The SC had stated that the L-G will only have to be informed about the Delhi government’s day-to-day decisions,” he said.“Now that it has no way out, the BJP-ruled Central government is now keeping aside and overlooking the Constitution and the observations of the SC to directly rule Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjpled-central-govt-wants-to-rule-delhi-through-back-door-sisodia-101612431123823.html

04-02-2021||Chandigarh||AAP seeks to gain foothold in Himachal with 2022 elections||With two years left for the Himachal Pradesh assembly elections, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is trying to gain a foothold in the hill state that is known for its bipolar politics.The AAP opened an office in the state capital Shimla on Sunday and announced its intention to contest from all 68 assembly constituencies in the 2022 polls. Spokesperson SS Zogta said AAP will also field its candidates in the upcoming municipal corporation (MC) elections in Dharamshala, Mandi, Solan, Palampur and Shimla . “Time is ripe for AAP to enter the fray as the people of Himachal are fed up with both the parties: Congress and BJP. Electricity generated in Himachal is being sold to other states while we have to pay exorbitant bills. The BJP has failed to live up to people’s expectations. Meanwhile, the Congress in is facing a leadership crisis and is in doldrums,” said Zogta.  AAP has never contested assembly elections in the state before though it did try its luck in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Former BJP MP Rajan Sushant, who has now formed Hamari Party Himachal Party, had been the party’s convener in the state. However, all four candidates pitched by AAP, including Sushant and Kamal Kanta Batra, the mother of Kargil hero and Param Vir Chakra awardee Vikram Batra, lost the election. While Sushant polled around 20,000 votes, others had to forfeit their deposits. Voters traditionally alternate between BJP, CongThe two-party system has been ingrained in Himachal politics for so long that there has been almost no scope for a third alternative. Voters in the hill state have traditionally alternated between Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party, formerly known as Bharatiya Jan Sangh, for the last five decades.Any third option emerging in the state’s political scene only served the purpose of demurring. Previously, attempts have been made to launch a third front but the parties, whether national or regional, failed. “The largest community homogeneity and Congress and BJP’s penetration at grassroots level perpetuates bipolarity in Himachal’s politics. The rule of two clans has also re-enforced the bi-party system,” says Harisha Thakur, heads of the political science department at Himachal Pradesh University . Regional parties in Himachal have not succeededLok Raj Party (LRP), headed by former speaker Thakur Sen Negi, was the first regional party formed in the state in 1967. JBL Khachi was another tall leader of the LRP. In the 1972 assembly election, LRP had pitched candidates in 16 constituencies. They won two seats, only to be disbanded by the time of the next elections. No third party succeeded for the next two decades as power changed hands between the Congress and BJP. Come 1990, the Janata Dal (JD), made a mark on the political landscape. Vijai Singh Mankotia, who had left the Congress, led JD to a big victory, winning 11 seats in a pre-poll alliance with BJP, which got an absolute majority with 46 seats. Former chief minister Thakur Ram Lal’s outfit Jan Him Kranti Morcha had merged with the Janata Dal . However, the coalition government was dismissed in the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. By the 1993 assembly elections, Mankotia was back with the Congress and JD had faded into oblivion.Congress veteran Pandit Sukh Ram also tried to give HP residents a third alternative. After parting ways with the Congress, he founded the Himachal Vikas Congress (HVC) in 1997. HVC won five seats in 1998 and formed a post-poll alliance with the BJP. It helped the saffron party, which was one seat short of majority, to form a government. Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) made a foray into Himachal’s political landscape in 2008 but could only secure one seat. Its lone legislator Sanjay Chaudhary later joined the BJP. The BJP witnessed a split in 2012. Maheshwar Singh, former president of the saffron party, with other disgruntled leaders formed Himachal Lokhit Party (HLP) before the 2012 elections but won only one seat. The party merged with the BJP before the 2017 assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-seeks-to-gain-foothold-in-himachal-with-2022-elections-101612427643159.html

Of the 45 sites where the Covid-19 vaccination was administered on Monday, 22 sites are for Pune rural where 1,690 beneficiaries were vaccinated of the 2,200 which took the percentage to 77 per cent for the day. PMC and PCMC reported more than 100% of beneficiaries being vaccinated. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer at Pune zilla parishad said, “We had not started the walk-in vaccination methods at our session sites and were dependent on the Co-WIN app. While PMC and PCMC are allowing walk-ins for registered beneficiaries, we are yet to start it at all our centres.” Since the beginning, Pune rural reported a vaccination percentage of about 61 in the initial few days which remained at par with beneficiaries vaccinated in PMC and PCMC. However, the urban areas reported more beneficiaries being vaccinated after walk-in vaccination for registered beneficiaries was allowed. In Pune rural, the process of session creation at Co-WIN app as per the central government’s guidelines was continued and the vaccination percentage went down comparatively. Dr Bhawan Pawar, district health officer said, “We anticipate wastage of at least 10 per cent doses of the entire lot. Every dose has a short life of just a few hours after it is opened and so when fewer beneficiaries turn up at the site, the dose is considered inefficient.” As per the data from the district information office, while Pune rural reported wastage of 822 doses since the beginning of the vaccination drive in the district, PMC saw 461 and PCMC registered 325 wasted doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-rural-reports-lower-turnout-leading-to-vaccine-wastage-101612424525569.html
04-02-2021||Pune||Sassoon hospital offers cancer treatment at minimal cost but lacks dedicated centre||Changuna Bansode, a 74-year-old woman will now live with only one and a half kidney after a recent surgery at city-based Sassoon General Hospital (SGH). A portion of Bansode’s kidney was surgically removed as it was cancerous, and it cost her less than ₹4,000. In spite of the regular occurrence of such cases at the hospital, there is an absence of a dedicated cancer centre at SGH which caters to thousands of patients. Shobha Kamble, a relative of Bansode said that the patient was diagnosed with cancer and the surgery would have been very expensive at a private hospital. “We had to get her to Sassoon General Hospital. She was taken in for surgery twice in January but due to high blood pressure, the surgery was not done. At last, recently, the surgery was done, and she is fine now. Under various medical schemes, the overall cost of surgery was meagre, and we are happy that she could get the best treatment at this hospital,” said Kamble. Dr Kiran Kumar Jadhav, associate professor at BJ medical college and Sassoon hospital with the department of surgery operated on the patient. According to Jadhav, a portion of Bansode’s kidney was malign. “Thankfully, we could save the rest of the kidney. Now the patient has one and a half kidney and it is functional. The patient has responded well to the treatment,” said Dr Jadhav. SGH is a tertiary hospital and witnesses a wave of patients from all parts of Maharashtra, including that for cancer. However, the hospital does not have a dedicated cancer centre. “Our department has done around 42 cancer surgeries in December and January. On average, at least seven patients come to the hospital for chemotherapy. Many patients prefer SGH as the cost of treatment here is less as compared to private players. With so many footfalls for cancer itself, a dedicated centre is a need of the hour,” said Dr Jadhav. Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean, BJ medical college and Sassoon said that the hospital has all the facilities for patients at lower costs. “For several years the proposal for a cancer centre is in the pipeline. We need a proper budget and land for constructing a dedicated centre where surgery, chemo and radiotherapy can be given to patients at affordable costs. We are taking all the efforts that we can to get the budget sanctioned as well as the land for the centre,” said Tambe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sassoon-hospital-offers-cancer-treatment-at-minimal-cost-but-lacks-dedicated-centre-101612424523540.html
04-02-2021||Pune||Round two: Frontline workers receive Covid vaccination||The round two of phase one Covid-19 vaccination began on Wednesday as 67 frontline workers were administered the vaccine at district hospital, Aundh. The district saw 94 per cent beneficiaries being vaccinated as 4,913 registered beneficiaries received the jab of the 5,200 targeted for the day. The vaccination for frontline workers took place at only two centres in Pune rural while Pune city and PCMC did not report any vaccination for frontline workers. On the first day of vaccination, 67 frontline workers and 4,846 healthcare workers in the district got vaccinated. The vaccination for frontline workers was delayed for the past few days due to the technical glitches in the Co-WIN app. However, on Wednesday, only 67 frontline workers could get vaccinated at only two of the 52 sites both of which were located in rural Pune. Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer said, “The vaccination for frontline workers could not be started at all sites as the link could not be activated.” Dr Ashish Bharati, chief health officer at PMC, confirmed that despite creating an additional session site for Covid-19 vaccination at PMC’s Kamala Nehru hospital, the vaccination for frontline workers could not be done as the link did not activate. He said, “We are having regular video conferencing with state officials also regarding the issue. Unless the link is activated, we do not have the list of registered beneficiaries and so we cannot even manually call them for the vaccination which we have been doing for healthcare workers as of now.” PMC topped the three local authorities in the district with 2,399 of the 1,900 registered or 126 per cent beneficiaries vaccinated at 19 session sites. Pune rural reported 80 per cent or 1,999 registered beneficiaries of the 2,500 targeted vaccinated while PCMC reported the lowest with 64 per cent of the registered beneficiaries vaccinated or 515 of 800 targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/round-two-frontline-workers-receive-covid-vaccination-101612424521406.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to change its fleet of cars to electric vehicles in 6 months: CM||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced that the Delhi government will change its fleet of hired cars to electric vehicles (EVs) within the next six months and launched a new campaign -- Switch Delhi -- to spread awareness about the subsidies provided by the city administration on EVs. Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said vehicles are one of the main contributors of air pollution in the national Capital. The Delhi EV policy, announced in August last year, envisages that 25% of all new vehicle registrations should be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) by 2024.“We have to make EVs a jan andolan (mass movement) now. So, we are launching the Switch Delhi campaign today to create awareness about EVs. The idea is to convince people to switch from their current vehicles to EVs,which have zero emissions. I also urge the youth, who are looking to buy their first car or bike, to go for an EV as the Delhi government is giving huge subsidies and there is no road tax or registration charges,” Kejriwal said. The chief minister also stated that the government will soon float a tender to set up the first 100 charging stations across Delhi. Also Read | 166k students in Delhi fell off grid as schools moved onlineA senior transport official said for the installation of EV charging stations, a centralised tendering system will be adopted to hire an energy operator to run, maintain and upgrade charging stations. “Land-owning agencies will be required to provide land for the installation of public EV charging stations,” the official said.Kejriwal urged companies having a large fleet of vehicles to shift to EVs. “I request resident welfare associations (RWAs), market associations and delivery fleets to participate in the campaign to promote the use of EVs and switch to such vehicles. The Switch Delhi campaign also seeks to convince companies, malls, cinema halls, restaurants and commercial shopping complexes to get charging stations installed in their parking spaces,” he said. Kejriwal said around 6,000 EVs have been bought in Delhi ever since the city’s EV policy was announce in August 2020. “Almost all of the applicants have received subsidies from the government. The Delhi government credits the subsidy amount directly into the bank accounts of a new EV purchaser within three days,” he said.The policy gives a subsidy of ₹10,000 per kWh to the first 1,000 e-cars or electric four wheelers, with a capping of ₹150,000 per vehicle. A subsidy of ₹5,000 per kWh of the battery capacity up to ₹30,000 is also to be given on the purchase of each electric two-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, rickshaw and freight vehicle. To push people to shift to EVs, the policy also has a “scrapping incentive” for those who make the switch.On August 7 last year, Kejriwal had announced the Delhi EV Policy 2020, with a focus to increase the adoption of electric vehicles in the city by incentivising the purchase and use of the EVs. The policy aims to register 500,000 electric vehicles in the city by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-change-its-fleet-of-cars-to-electric-vehicles-in-6-monthscm-101612424462719.html

04-02-2021||Chandigarh||Fearing backlash, candidates avoid BJP symbol in Punjab civic polls||The farmers’ agitation has generated such a crisis for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the grassroots level in Punjab that for the urban local body (ULB) polls in the state on February 14, candidates it is backing, or is known to support, are standing as independents. The last date for filing papers was Wednesday. The saffron party couldn’t field its candidates on all seats in 18 urban local bodies of Doaba region, comprising Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts. Here, polls are scheduled in 22 urban local bodies, including Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur municipal corporations. BJP office-bearers, who are in charge of polls, said the party has fielded all candidates in Nawanshahr (19 in 19 wards), Mukerian (15 in 15) and 49 in 50 wards of Hoshiarpur. In Jalandhar district, the BJP failed to field a single candidate in Kartarpur municipal council and two nagar panchayats of Lohian and Mehtapur. BJP in-charges of Lohian and Mehatpur, Sudarshan Sobti and Amarjit Singh, for Kartarpur, said, “Our candidates are contesting independently in both nagar panchayats. Our representatives have been threatened by the Congress and the SAD.”Congress general secretary and Kartarpur improvement trust chairman, Rana Randhawa, rubbished these charges. “The BJP has lost ground in Punjab due to anti-farmer policies,” said Randhawa. Seeking anonymity, a senior BJP leader said candidates were reluctant due to farmer agitation, and most were contesting independently. In Hoshiarpur district, where the party has a good grip on the ground, it has managed to field maximum candidates in four ULBs including Hoshiarpur Mukerian, in 12 of 15 in Dasuya and in 10 of 15 of in Tanda. It has found it tough in Garhdiwala (four of 11) and some other bodies.In Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Poonam Manik, BJP district president said the party found just six candidates for Rahon (13 wards) and three against a total of 15 seats in Banga municipal council. SBS Nagar BJP general secretary Pritpal Bajaj said, “Party workers fear contesting the polls as Banga is a small town and their candidature can hit the spirit of brotherhood.”Rakesh Duggal, the Kapurthala BJP president, said the party had fielded candidates in 38 of the 50 wards in teh MC. Senior BJP leader and former cabinet minister Manoranjan Kalia said there were a large number of wards in towns, where party leaders were being threatened and prevented from filing nomination. “We are compiling the data and will take this up at the state level,” he said. Bathinda BJP president  to fight as Independent Fearing a backlash from farmer unions, the Bathinda district BJP president Vinod Kumar Binta filed nomination his papers as an Independent candidate from Bhucho Mandi municipal council. Binta of Bhucho town was accompanied by his close aides. “We want to avoid any conflict with farmer unions in the electoral battle. Farmer unions are opposing the BJP from holding any political or social programme, hence I am contesting as an Independent,” he said, evading a direct reply on whether he had the support of the state party leadership. BJP office-bearers feigned ignorance that the district head is not contesting on the party symbol. No one from the district was apprised of Vinod’s decision, party sources said. “It causes embarrassment to the party when the electioneering is on and the BJP is trying to establish itself electorally,” said a source in the BJP.For Bathinda MC, the BJP managed to field candidates only on 42 of 50 wards. The Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the AAP filed papers for all 50 seats.Dushyant Gautam, in-charge of Punjab BJP affairs, said Binta is being expelled for anti-party activities. “He crossed the party lines by contesting as an Independent. There will be a strict bar on him for rejoining the party for the next six years,” said Gautam, also the national general secretary of the party.Over 2,000 file papers in Majha regionAs many as 2,078 candidates filed their nominations for two municipal corporations (MC), 11 nagar councils (NCs) and three nagar panchayats (NPs) in the Majha region districts of Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot. Here, no trend could be established yet, but in Amritsar district, 156 candidates, including 50 of the Congress, 27 of the SAD, 28 of the AAP and 11 of the BJP, have filed the nominations for Jandiala NC (15 wards).

However, it also brought life in the higher altitude regions of the state, including the state capital, to a grinding halt. Around 250 main and lateral roads were closed for traffic due to heavy snowfall in eight districts. The strategic Hindustan-Tibet Road or National Highway 22 was closed for traffic at Kufri and Narkanda near Shimla due to the snowfall.In Shimla town, snow accumulated on the circular road and the continuous snowfall hampered the snow-clearing operations on the main road and other roads, including national highway 5 that connects Dhalli and Fagu. “Besides NH-22, more than 200 lateral roads in the state have been closed for traffic due to the snowfall and slippery conditions,” state public works department chief engineer Archana Thakur said. The Shimla-Kalka Road was closed for traffic beyond Tara Devi Temple, eight kilometers downhill from the main town, due to snowfall.Shimla additional superintendent of police Parveer Thakur said, “Continuous snowfall has hampered efforts to clear snow accumulated on roads in Shimla and surrounding areas.” Electricity and communication lines were also disrupted in Shimla. The snow and rain in Himachal Pradesh since Wednesday broke a prolonged dry spell that lasted over a month. January witnessed a 53% rain deficit much to the worry of farmers and fruit growers.

04-02-2021||Bhopal||No poisonous substance in viscera of Bhopal man who died after Covaxin trial||No poisonous substance was found in the viscera report of Deepak Marawi, 42, the Bhopal resident who died of suspected poisoning nine days after taking part in the Phase III trials of India’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin in December. Marawi’s death came to light on January 9 when his family blamed his participation in the trial for it.Marawi’s post-mortem report earlier concluded that cardio-respiratory failure as a result of suspected poisoning led to his death. The viscera report confirmed the presence of ethyl alcohol and omeprazole, an antacid, in his body.Viscera samples comprise internal organs preserved to ascertain the cause of death in cases where autopsies are inconclusive. They can be tested for various drugs and poisons.Madhya Pradesh’s medico-legal department head Ashok Sharma said if the viscera report did not confirm any poisonous substance in the body, it does not mean that he did not consume any poison. “Due to a fast metabolic process, it is hard to confirm the presence of some poisonous substances.” Sharma said Marawi might have had alcohol that upset his stomach. “He had taken omeprazole to treat his upset stomach. But it is hard to confirm anything.”Marawi’s son, Akash, said he wants justice. “He [Marawi] was jobless and went for clinical trials to earn money. He did not have any money to purchase alcohol. He did not go anywhere after the trial. So, we are sure that he did not consume any alcohol.” He added it is their right to know the real cause of his death to ensure punishment for those responsible for it.Activist Rachna Dhingra questioned how a man could die of suspected poisoning without consuming poison. “The government should answer this question. Instead of taking required action to stop the vaccination and to probe the real cause of death Marawi, the state government was seen defending People’s Medical College and Bharat Biotech.”Bharat Biotech International Limited, the Covaxin maker, has said Marawi’s death was unrelated to the dose administered to him at the medical college.Rajesh Kapur, the head of the college who earlier said Marawi fulfilled criteria for trails and was reported to be healthy during a follow-up, refused to comment on the viscera report.State medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said they will take forensic science experts’ views even as police were also investigating the matter.Deputy police inspector general Irshad Wali said they have received the report and were investigating the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/no-poisonous-substance-in-viscera-of-bhopal-man-who-died-after-covaxin-trial-101612415640440.html

The role of contractors came into question as they were suspected to have held back payments and retained a portion of workers’ wages.At least two Karnataka government-commissioned reports have confirmed allegations made by the workers and several other violations by the company.Apple had suspended any new business to Wistron after its internal investigation too found violations. Wistron reacted by removing its vice-president overlooking India operations.A senior executive at Wistron declined to comment and a mail sent to the company’s headquarters in Taiwan remains unanswered.Days after the violence, the Karnataka government had said that they will ensure reopening of the company within 15 days; however, it has been nearly two months since.Karnataka is one of the most industrious states and attracts huge investments each year from both domestic and international corporations.About 43km away from Wistron’s plant, over 2,000 shop floor workers of Japanese car-maker Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) remain on strike since November 10.TKM’s operations have been hit after workers initially protested the suspension of one union member which eventually led to the company declaring a lockout. The Karnataka labour department held reconciliation meetings and ordered workers to return to their shifts from November 19. The company extended the lockout four days later citing “lack of congenial and safe atmosphere” at the plant.The company withdrew the lock out on January 12, but workers have refused to return due to the insistence of the management that they sign an undertaking on safety and productivity, which the latter maintain is not a government mandate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/wistron-to-resume-manufacturing-operations-within-a-week-karnataka-govt-101612413600281.html

There will be nine to ten phases. The SEC will take a final call on it,” said Amrit Lal Meena, additional chief secretary, panchayati raj department.Incidentally, Meena said the state government has no plans to implement the two child norm for candidates in the upcoming panchayat polls. “No amendment in the act is proposed. The election will take place as per the existing provisions,” he said.The SEC has started publishing the list of polling centres for physical verification and invited claims/ objections from the general public by February 11.Public is encouraged to object if anything is found wrong with the polling stations announced by the commission. An objection can be raised, for example, if the polling station is housed in a private property, at Mukhiya’s house, in a police station, inside a hospital or dispensary or if it is more than 2 km away.“The field officials have been asked for physical verification of the booths. Once we get feedback on any inconveniently located booth or on other anomalies, we will set up new polling stations,” said a senior SEC officer.The SEC has identified 1.19 lakh polling stations so far. The final publication of the list of polling stations will be done on March 2, the official said.Also Read: Plan to promote Bihar as medical tourism destinationBesides, the draft of the updated ward-wise voters’ list has been published on February 1 and the finalised list will be published on February 19.

04-02-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Key borders remain closed, traffic in Delhi diverted||Traffic in eastern and central parts of the city, especially on roads leading to Delhi-Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh) border, will remain heavy and motorists travelling between Delhi and Ghaziabad will face traffic jams as the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border remains closed due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation. All the six lanes of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, NH-9 and NH-24 are closed because of the UP Gate border blockade, and vehicles entering Delhi from Ghaziabad are being diverted to alternate border routes such as Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra, Loni, Kondli, Chilla, New Ashok Nagar, DND Flyway, and Kalindi Kunj. Delhi Traffic Police officials say the NH-24 road is kept open for traffic going to Delhi from Ghaziabad through Ghazipur roundabout. So, motorists entering Delhi from Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar or Apsara border may take a right turn from the Ghazipur roundabout and take NH-24 road from there to move towards south and central Delhi via Sarai Kale Khan and the Ring Road. Similarly, motorists can take Vikas Marg after taking a right turn from below the Patparganj Industrail Area flyover from Anand Vihar-Ghazipur road.

Also, traffic is affected on Aurobindo Marg due to the ongoing repair work of a subway by the public works department (PWD).Apart from the UP Gate border, some borders in outer, western and southwestern Delhi connecting Haryana are also completely closed due to the farmers’ protest. These are Singhu, Tikri, Saboli and Piau Maniyari. Traffic police officials said that Jharoda and Auchandi borders will be opened only during morning and evening peak hours while Lampur, Safiabad, Singhu school and Palla toll tax borders are open for traffic. As traffic is expected to remain heavy on GT Karnal Road, Outer Ring Road and NH-44, the traffic police have asked motorists to avoid these routes and take alternate or diverted routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-as-key-borders-remain-closed-traffic-in-delhi-affected-101612409820378.html

04-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: For the inner hipster in you||Spending the afternoon in a cool cafe and being seen with a sleek laptop, or better still, with one of those elegant writing pads, is certainly the most sophisticated kind of show-off. Indeed, all hipsters (and aspiring writers) are occasionally spotted jotting on imported notebooks that cost a bomb.But a truly hip human is one who believes in sourcing hyperlocally. That’s why you have to try out these writing pads sold in a handful of used bookstores of central Delhi’s Daryaganj. The shopkeepers say that the notebooks are made in tiny printing workshops, buried deep within the Walled City’s neighbourhoods, especially in the cramped lanes around the Turkman Gate.Irrespective of their origins, these writing pads are so beautiful that the inner writer in you might immediately want to start penning down your magnum opus in them. This evening, one of the unnamed stores, teems with shoppers. The variety of notebooks is breathtaking. Some are as big as an A4 size. Some are bigger than that—the ideal drawing material for a dreamy architect. Some pads have the dimensions of an average pulp fiction paperback. Some pads are bound like a hardback. Some are sewn—“silai wali” in the shop lingo. Many are, as the shopkeeper calls it, “spiral bound.” Some have gilded pages. Some have red covers; some others, blue or black, and even green. And then some have pages that have a delicate yellowing shade, as if they had once belonged to one’s great-grandmother when she was a young diarist.The pages are either lined or plain, and display none of those overdone illustrations that you might find in more artsy notebooks, to distract you from their true purpose.Now let’s face it, there is also a chance to stumble into a flawed notebook that lacks a fine finish, with something looking amateurish about its production. But the imperfections make the notepad more endearing, letting one imagine the person who made it partly with his own hands (the workshops use machines too, confirms the shopkeeper). And one of the nicest things about these diaries is that they are super cheap. In fact, they are sold on the kilogram basis. Just the thing for our struggling hipsters. The shops open from 10am to 7pm, and are across the road from the Daryaganj police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-for-the-inner-hipster-in-you-101612392606228.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||IMD forecasts rain today and hotter days till Feb 7||Delhi and the neighbouring NCR towns are expected to receive light to moderate rainfall on Thursday under the influence of a fresh western disturbance that will pass over the region, weather scientists said.India Meteorological Department (IMD) said under the influence of the same western disturbance the temperatures may rise. A western disturbance is an extratropical storm originating in the Mediterranean region that brings sudden winter rain to the northwestern parts of the subcontinent.India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings on Wednesday show that the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for Delhi, was 10.4 degrees Celsius, which was two degrees above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature of the day also clocked four degrees above the normal, at 26.1 degrees Celsius.Also read: Of 18,000 beneficiaries, only 7,000 get Covid-19 shots in CapitalKuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said light to moderate rainfall along with thunderstorm is likely in Delhi and NCR on Thursday.“The clouds, however, will pass from Friday. The temperatures will remain on the higher end because of the passing western disturbance,” he said.Srivastava added the temperature will fall again briefly from February 7. This fall, however, will not be very significant, he said.“The large difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures can happen specially when a western disturbance is approaching and the wind direction changes,” Srivastava had said.“There is no forecast of a drop in temperatures. From February 7, the minimum temperature will be around 7-8 degrees Celsius. From February 11 again, the minimum temperature will rise,” Srivastava said.The incoming western disturbance also resulted in improved wind speed leading to a reduction in the pollution levels in the city. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 330, in the ‘very poor’ zone. The AQI on Tuesday was 364, also in the ‘very poor’ category.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) predicted that the western disturbance is likely to positively impact ventilation.“The improved ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively for the next three days. AQI is likely to improve to the lower end of the very poor to poor category for the next two days. AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate but in the lower end of the very poor category on February 6,” the Safar forecast read.In a statement, IMD said heavy rainfall or snowfall is also expected to take place over Jammu and Kashmir on February 3 and 4, and over Himachal Pradesh on February 4.Moderate rain or thundershowers with isolated lightning and hailstorm is also likely over the plains of northwest India during February 3 to 5, over Madhya Pradesh, east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand on February 4 and 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/imdforecasts-rain-today-and-hotter-days-till-feb-7-101612392145011.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Of 18,000 beneficiaries, only 7,000 get Covid-19 shots in Capital||Delhi saw its lowest ever Covid-19 vaccination turnout percentage on Wednesday, with fewer than half of the day’s targeted health care workers getting jabs, even as the state government decided to open up the inoculation programme for front line workers on a trial basis from Thursday.Of the 18,300 health workers who were due to get a jab of either Covaxin or Covishield on Wednesday, only 7,365 turned up on a day the government significantly ramped up the number of vaccination centres.So far, of 240,000 health workers who are registered for vaccination in Delhi, 81,258 have been administered their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.The government on Tuesday scaled up the number of vaccination sites from 106 to 183. Vaccines will now be administered six days a week, up from four earlier, the state administration had announced on Monday.Also read: Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districtsDelhi, on Wednesday, recorded a turnout of 40.25% which, according to government records, is the lowest since January 16 when the vaccination drive was launched.The city also recorded 17 adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI) on Wednesday, none of which were reported to be severe, said officials.Till Wednesday, the lowest turnout was recorded on the second day of the drive (January 18) at 44.2% and the highest on sixth day (January 25) at 91.5%. During that phase, Delhi had 81 vaccination centres.Government officials and experts attributed the decline in turn-out to a lack of awareness among beneficiaries about the new centres, adding that several other facilities may hit their vaccination saturation points.Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the turnout on Wednesday.Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department at Maulana Azad Medical College and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination task force for India, said: “At this point, the aim should be to strengthen last-mile reach out. People across priority groups who want to get vaccinated at the earliest should get the opportunity to do so. This will also contribute to confidence building among other beneficiaries. The turnout figures will naturally go up again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/of-18-000-beneficiaries-only-7-000-get-covid-19-shots-in-capital-101612390723639.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Protest, blockades: Locals have to take long way home||On Wednesday, Pooran Singh, 32, a resident of Sonipat’s Biswamil area, about 10 kms from Singhu border, was walking with his wife Sapna and two children, precariously on the nearly two-foot-wide dirt track near the farmers’ agitation spot, which runs adjacent to a large drain.The dirt track, which widens to up to five-foot as one moves closer to the Singhu border protest site, is one of the two routes that locals have been using for the past one week to cross the protest site. Residents are also using another route via Narela and Singhu village, which means a detour of several kilometers.Heavy barricading by police near the protest sites at Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri is inconveniencing the local residents, who are now taking detours to cross the intercity borders.“Earlier, we could take shared vans to reach Azadpur where I work. But due to the increase in police barricading, there are only a few routes left. The shared vans have also hiked their fares. The nearly 30km journey from my home to work has become difficult. So, I am bringing my family and will stay at temporary accommodation in Azadpur till the barricades are removed,” Singh, a mason, said.Also read: MHA says blockade of borders causing inconvenience to localsE-rickshaws and other last-mile connectivity options ferrying people between Sonipat, Panipat, Bahalgarh to Kundli have doubled their fares. Vehicles stationed at the first police barricade — around 1.5km away from the main stage — were charging people ₹160 instead of the earlier ₹80. Arun Nishkarma, 40, who drives a van, said he increased the fare from ₹30 to ₹50 to ferry people between Sonipat and Kundli border.Along with six-layer concrete barricades set up on both carriageways of GT Karnal Road, police have also installed iron nails, made concrete walls, set up concertina wires, put containers filled with cement, and blocked most of the alternative routes. Locals said the move has heavily affected their movement – more than the agitation did in the past two months.Sonipat resident Sanjay Sharma, 40, who procures material from a garments’ factory in Kundli industrial area and supplies it to different parts of Delhi and Haryana, had been facing problems while commuting on his motorcycle since December.“The police barricades make it look like the people here are living in jail. It used to take around 30 minutes to travel from Kundli industrial area to my home in Sonipat. Now it takes me around two-and-a-half hours,” he said.Sharma said, “The farmer volunteers had ensured smoother movement of vehicles during the agitation. They do facilitate movement. But the police barricades and the personnel posted here do not let us cross these barricades and they have also blocked alternative routes.”On Wednesday, police officials used iron frames to block another dirt track leading to the main highway barely a kilometre from the main stage.No one except police personnel was allowed to go beyond the second barricade installed at this spot. Until Wednesday, media persons were allowed to walk till the Singhu toll border around 400 metres away.At Tikri, local residents are forced to take longer route for their daily commute.“My shop is near the main (Rohtak) road but because of the protests and the police closing off the entire area, now my workers and I have to take the longer route,” said Sisupal Singh Channa, who owns a garments shop near Baba Haridas Park.Hathram Pal, who owns a mobile repair and recharging shop near the protest spot at Tikri, said his business had taken a major hit because of the internet services being cut-off by the administration.“These farmers have been here for nearly two months and we have not faced any problem, the issue started when the government started getting involved and cut off electricity and internet,” Pal said. Mobile internet services were suspended at the protest spots following the Republic Day violence.Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson, said, “The barricades are set up as a preventive measure. We are trying to ensure as little inconvenience to the public as possible in the given circumstances.”Senior farm leader Darshan Pal said the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has taken note of the transport-related problems He said, “SKM intends to resolve the problem as far as possible.”(With inputs from Shiv Sunny)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/protest-blockades-locals-have-to-take-long-way-home-101612390052542.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||166k students in Delhi fell off grid as schools moved online||Over 166,000 students in Delhi’s government and municipal schools are missing, the impact of education moving online as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The number is roughly 8.5% of the students enrolled in the Capital’s schools.The data, culled from the education department of Delhi, and civic bodies that run the municipal schools, shows that these children have simply fallen off the map -- the schools say they can’t trace them.Government officials and school authorities say the migration of thousands of families to their home states during and after the lockdown, and the sudden shift to online education are the main reasons for this.While schools have already reopened for classes 10 and 12 last month, they have been allowed to call in students of classes 9 and 11 from February 5.Also read: Schools kick off prep as parents, students welcome exam scheduleAccording to figures available with the Delhi government and the three civic bodies of east, north and south Delhi, the maximum number of students who can’t be found are those enrolled in schools run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (or North MCD).Officials at North MCD’s education department said around 20% (58,000) of the 290,000 students enrolled across 714 schools could not be reached despite several attempts over the past 10 months. In schools run by the south civic body, around 15% (44,000) of the 284,000 students in 581 schools can’t be reached. And in schools run by the east municipal corporation, around 20% (33,600) of the 168,000 students enrolled in 365 schools are completely out of touch.The situation is better in Delhi government schools. Only around 31,000 (approximately 2.5% ) of nearly 1,255,000 students enrolled in its 1,030 schools (from kindergarten to class 10) can’t be found.According to assessments by Unicef, over 460 million children across the world were unable to access remote learning tools last year. The UN has called on countries to ensure a generation of children do not lose out an education due to the pandemic.Attempting contactOver the past few months, the government and municipal schools have attempted door-to-door visits, sending letters and assignments to addresses on their records, and forming peer groups to locate the students.Officials at Delhi government schools said a majority of students who can’t be found are those who were promoted from municipal schools at the end of the last academic session and were admitted to class 6. Awadesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said, “At least 40 students are completely unreachable at our school. Of them, 25 are in class 6. We have taken all possible steps but these children were not found at the addresses mentioned in our records. We got to know from the neighbourhood that these families returned to their villages after the lockdown and have not returned yet.”Every year, around 100,000 students move from municipal schools to government ones in class 6; municipal schools only offer education till class 5. Due to the pandemic, the induction of such students happened online this time, on the basis of names sent by municipal schools.“Either the families of these students don’t have mobile phones or they have changed their numbers and did not get the information about the admission of their children in class 6. We are trying to trace such children,” said the principal of another government school, requesting anonymity.Then there are the younger children in municipal schools. Vibha Singh, principal of a municipal school in Gandhinagar, east Delhi, said 49 students can’t be found. “Their houses are locked and their numbers are not reachable. We are assuming that they migrated to their villages during the lockdown…”‘Will continue to search’Experts said it’s possible that some of them may have been pulled out of school and pushed into working to help family finances roiled by the pandemic.Sanjay Gupta, director of NGO CHETNA, said, “Extensive steps need to be taken to trace students who have been pushed into child labour due to financial difficulties wrought by the pandemic. The priorities of parents have also changed amid the financial crises. The switch to online education is also responsible for the situation. There is a possibility of more drop-outs if this situation continues.”The Delhi says it has managed to trace almost 97.5% of the students from KG to class 10.Mukesh Suryan, chairperson, south MCD education committee, said, “As per the Right to Education Act, 2009, we can’t strike off any student from the rolls up to class 8, whether they attend school or not. We will continue searching for these students with the help of fellow students and neighbours throughout the year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/166k-students-in-delhi-fell-off-grid-as-schools-moved-online-101612385072733.html

Our government will make every effort to trace the protesters who are missing and I will even speak to the Lt Governor and the Central government if the need arises,” Kejriwal said.Also read: Shashi Tharoor, Rajdeep Sardesai file plea in SC to quash FIRsThe move comes a day after a delegation from the legal team of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella platform of about 40 farmer unions protesting against the farm laws at Delhi borders for over two months, met Kejriwal and gave him a list of 29 missing farmers.“I can understand the pain and suffering of these people, who are unable to connect to their family members and children, are going through. It is the responsibility of every government to find the missing people and intimate their families regarding the same. Many farmer unions have also reached out to the Delhi government and me,” Kejriwal said.On Sunday, SKM said that more than 100 people were missing since the tractor parade on Republic Day that descended in. The union has formed a committee to look into the issue, which seeks to compile information on the “missing persons” to able to initiate formal action with the authorities. The six-member committee has urged people to share information on missing persons on the phone number 8198022033.“The people whose family members are missing can look at this list to know if their family members are among those arrested. If yes, they will get to know the jail that they have been put in. I hope that many people who have gone missing will be traced through this list,” Kejriwal added.Since the beginning of the farmers’ protest, the Delhi government has show support to farmers’ protest. It also provided basic facilities of water, sanitation and food at almost all the major protest sites in Delhi. In December, Kejriwal had visited Singhu border thrice to meet the farmers. In January, Kejriwal announced that the AAP will be fighting elections in six states in the coming two years. These states include Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh from where a majority of fame era have come to protest against the farm laws.Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha in Punjab, said, “We welcome that Delhi Chief Minister has promptly acted on our request for locating the missing farmers. We requested him in his capacity as the CM and not as a political leader.”“We have already uploaded a list of all the 122 people arrested in the cases on our (Delhi Police) website, which is a public platform. The list has names of the arrested persons, their residential address, age, name of the police station and the FIR number in which they have been arrested. Any individual can access the list by visiting our website. In case, anyone still has any doubts about the arrested persons, they can directly seek assistance from the concerned district control room number or visit the police stations concerned,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-will-help-find-missing-farmers-cm-101612381793544.html

While a facility for day-to-day maintenance has been set up in India, one for larger maintenance is in the work.” The seaplane service between Kevadia and Sabarmati riverfront (Ahmedabad) – was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhai Patel on October 31 – to attract tourists to the Statue of Unity. It was then temporarily suspended within a month. After re-commencing operations on December 30, 2020, the airline said no flights operated on three days – January 9 due to bad weather, and January 14 and 15 given the kite flying festival. An aviation safety expert who did not wish to be named said, “Aircraft do not go for maintenance twice with barely two months of its flying. This means that they did not get the paperwork done as required.” Last week, HT had reported that seaplane services were unable to attract passengers as expected. According to sources, it is flying with around 50% capacity. The airline, however, maintained that their flights to Kevadia are clocking an average load of over 90%. The seaplane, under the government’s Udey Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) project is operated by Spice Shuttle, a fully-owned subsidiary of SpiceJet, which wet-leased the seaplane from Maldives Island Aviation Services (MIAS). MIAS is owned by the Maldives government, making both the aircraft and its crew the property of a foreign entity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/india-seaplane-flown-back-to-maldives-for-2nd-time-in-3-months-for-maintenance-101612381316684.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||World Cancer Day: ‘Delay in diagnosis during lockdown led to late-stage cancer’||The Covid-19 pandemic in March last year left hundreds of cancer patients – both within and those coming from outside the city – without early intervention and timely treatment. Due to the initial delay in diagnosis, hospitals in Mumbai have observed that almost 30% of patients are in advanced stages of the disease, thereby reducing their chances of recovery. However, 11 months down the line, with relaxations in lockdown restrictions, screening and diagnosis of patients has improved by more than 100%. ‘Delay in cancer treatment amidst lockdown’ On the eve of World Cancer Day, which is today, hospitals in the city said almost 30% of the newly diagnosed/registered cancer patients have developed advance-stage cancer due to delayed diagnoses during the lockdown, and many consequently have reduced chances of recovery.In 2019, a total of 82,538 new cancer cases were recorded, which dropped to 60,699 in 2020. In April, May and June 2019, the hospital recorded 6,933, 7,035 and 6,273 new cancer patient registrations. Following the outbreak of the pandemic, new registrations during the same three months in 2020 significantly dropped to 1,002, 3,020 and 2,688. Citing several reasons for the drop of almost 20,000 new registrations last year, deputy director of TMH and gastrointestinal cancer surgeon Dr Shailesh V Shrikhande said, “Almost 60% of registered patients at our hospital come from outside Mumbai, including from neighbouring states. During the initial months of the lockdown, severe restrictions were imposed on transportation all across the nation. So, patients, especially those from outside Mumbai couldn’t come for diagnosis.” At the beginning of the pandemic, several civic-run and private tertiary care hospitals were converted into dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. With outpatient departments (OPD) closed and non-emergency services temporarily halted, the number of cancer patients in private hospitals also reduced by almost 50%. Dr Sanjay Dudhat, head of onco-surgery department, Nanavati Hospital, said that the pandemic resulted in a 45% drop in medical oncology (chemotherapy/radiation therapy) and a 69% dip in cancer surgeries as compared to 2019 at the hospital. “Cancer patients are most vulnerable to getting infected with Covid-19 due to their weak immunity. As a result, many patients deferred visiting hospitals out of fear of constructing the virus,” said Dr Bharat Bhosale, medical oncologist at Bombay Hospital and Holy Spirit Hospital. Dr Bhosale added that due to the economic slowdown, several working professionals lost their jobs, which changed the cancer care management system. “NGOs also had run out of funds, and couldn’t financially support the treatment of patients from the lower economic class,” he said. ‘Patients detected with advanced-stage cancer post lockdown due to delayed diagnosis’ With relaxations in restrictions, cancer patients who waited for months are now flocking to hospitals for treatment. Due to the late diagnosis, however, oncologists have found that recently-diagnosed patients have developed advanced-stage cancer. “Almost one-third (or 30) have developed cancer at the third and fourth stage of the disease, which could have been cured if diagnosed earlier. Many have even died without getting treatment on time,” said Dr Sanjay Sharma, surgical oncologist and director of Asian Cancer Institute, Mumbai. Doctors said that early detection is the most essential step in cancer management and eradication, and delay in diagnosis causes a rise in mortality rates. “The key for a cure is to detect cancers in stage 1 or 2, i.e. within two to three months of cancer development in the body. As per our observations, the five-year survival rate in stage 1 and 2 of cancer is about 98%, which falls sharply to 30-40% in the advanced stages (3 and 4),” said Dr Dudhat. “On average, the tumour grows by 1cm within eight months to a year. Tumour biology in younger patients is more aggressive, causing faster development and spread in the absence of treatment.” Doctors also said that patients detected with smaller tumours before the pandemic could have recovered through surgery. “However, as they delayed the treatment, we had to perform pre-surgical chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumours, followed by surgically extracting them, and putting them on post-surgical chemo, radiation and hormonal therapy for complete recovery from the cancers,” said Dr Dudhat. As patients couldn’t avail treatment at tertiary-care hospitals, they consulted local doctors who lack expertise, which further aggravated their health condition, said city oncologists. “In dire need, patients approached local hospitals with no adequate facilities. They performed ‘sub-optimal’ treatment which wasn’t up to the mark,” said Dr Sharma. The pandemic also dried up blood banks as blood donation camps were halted to avoid any possible chance of spread of infection, which became a huge problem for patients suffering from blood-related cancer. “Bone marrow transplants need a large quantity of blood. Since these patients also have zero immunity against any virus, a few transplants were postponed during the initial stages of the pandemic,” said Bhosale. ‘Current situation is better, but coming months will be crucial’ Patient footfall has increased since September, said oncologists. For instance, registration of new cancer patients at TMH increased by 140% from August to December 2020. Similarly, at Nanavati Hospital, post the national unlock, there has been a 108% increase in the number of patients seeking cancer-related treatment and consultations. “In November and December 2020, we recorded more registrations than in the same months in 2019. Also, there hasn’t been a huge fall in the number of emergency surgeries performed at our hospital. For instance, in my gastrointestinal oncology department, in 2020 we performed 250 emergency services, as opposed to 287 the previous year,” said Dr Shrikhande. Doctors have cautioned that the coming months will be crucial to gauge the impact of delayed diagnosis on the fatality rate of cancer patients, as many in advanced stages are still undergoing treatment. “The drop in footfall indicates a probable increase in cancer fatalities caused by delayed or irregular cancer surgeries, radiation or chemotherapy,” said Dr Dudhat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/world-cancer-day-delay-in-diagnosis-during-lockdown-led-to-late-stage-cancer-101612380236552.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Will not obstruct access to south Mumbai jetty, BMC assures HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday disposed of a petition which had sought unhindered access to the Lotus jetty at Haji Ali which local fisherfolk perceived would be restricted, due to the ongoing coastal road work. However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) informed the court that it was building a navigation bridge for the benefit of the fisherfolk at the spot and they could access to the jetty. The court took the assurance of the BMC on record, and also permitted the fisherfolk to approach the evaluation committee set up by the civic body to settle their claim for damages to their fishing boats, due to the ongoing coastal road work. A division bench of justices RD Dhanuka and VG Bisht, while hearing the petition filed by 10 fishermen, subsisting through fishing activities from the Lotus jetty at Haji Ali, was informed by advocate Meenaz Kakalia that the petition was not opposing the coastal road work or reclamation of land for the same, but only sought unhindered access to the jetty, which they apprehended would be obstructed by the development work. The petition also sought compensation from the civic body, which is undertaking the coastal road development work for the damage caused to their fishing vessels, anchors and nets due to the development and reclamation being carried out at the jetty. In its reply, the BMC through senior advocate Aspi Chinoy and advocate Joel Carlos informed the court that the apprehensions of the fisherfolk were misplaced and unfounded as the BMC was constructing a navigation bridge at the jetty that would provide a passage for the fishing boats to enter and exit from the jetty. The affidavit, in reply, submitted that the petition was an attempt by vested interests to stall the coastal road project and hence the petition should be dismissed. After hearing the submissions and perusing the affidavit, the court recorded the undertaking of the BMC that the petitioners would have unhindered access to the jetty and their livelihood through fishing activities would not be affected. The court also directed the petitioners to approach the fisher-folk Rehabilitation Assessment Committee which has been set up by the BMC to evaluate the effect if any, of the project on the livelihood of the fishermen and deal with issues related thereto for the damages caused to their vessels, anchors and nets for compensation and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-not-obstruct-access-to-south-mumbai-jetty-bmc-assures-hc-101612379756580.html

04-02-2021||Mumbai||Power tussle on in Maharashtra: Consumers, MSEDCL both wait for relief||The year 2020 has been a tough one, particularly for the 24.2 million consumers of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL). The trouble started during the Covid-induced lockdown period, when scores complained of hefty bills. Initially, the CM Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government promised them a waiver, but soon, in a complete U-turn in November 2020, state energy minister Nitin Raut announced that consumers will have to pay the entire bill as the government cannot provide any relief. With arrears mounting to ₹63,740 crore, as of January 2021, MSEDCL has directed its regional offices to recover dues or cut the power supply in case of non-compliance. While political parties such as the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and Raju Shetti’s Swabhiman Shetkari Sanghatana, along with the Maharashtra State Power Consumers’ Association, are still demanding a waiver, residential consumers, many of whom have even has lost their jobs to the lockdown, are staring at a crisis. MSEDCL in losses The state’s distribution arm, MSEDCL, is the largest power supplying company in Maharashtra. It supplies power to the whole of Maharashtra and some parts of Mumbai. Recent data accessed by HT reveals that the agriculture sector owes ₹37,236 crore to the MSEDCL, while residential consumers owe ₹3,380 crore. Industrial and commercial consumers also owe ₹296 crore and ₹723 crore, respectively, among other categories. Being a major agrarian state, agricultural consumers account for 25% of the total power consumption in the state, although they account for only 14% of the revenue generation, a report on the ‘The Curious Case of India’s Discoms’ by the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) released in August 2020 stated. The revenue gap is owing to a tariff design where other categories of consumers pay a higher price to cross-subsidise electricity for agricultural consumers. The report state: “Even though the share of commercial and industrial consumers in total electricity consumption is 45% by volume, their revenue contribution is a much higher (at) 56%. Residential consumers take 20% of all electricity consumed and provide 20% of discom revenue.” Shantanu Dixit, co-ordinator, energy group, Prayas, said that incorrect estimation in agricultural consumption through the years has also resulted in the ballooning of arrears. Dixit referred to a report by a working group formed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) which stated that MSEDCL overestimated supply to the farm sector by 10,000 million units in 2018-19. “Apart from this, the political flip-flops on bill waiver in the state have resulted in a large number of well-paying categories also not clearing their dues on time,” Dixit said. Prayas is a non-government organization working in the energy sector in Maharashtra. Other reasons for losses also include power thefts, aggregate technical and commercial losses (21% as of March 2020), and purchasing high-cost power from obsolete plants owing to long-term power purchase agreements, the IEEFA report states. Ameya Pimpalkhare, an energy expert based in Mumbai, said, “A city like Delhi can afford to waive power bill because it is largely urbanised and the billing efficiency is also better. In Maharashtra, the arrears from agricultural consumers have accumulated for decades now. The power sector needs a serious recalibration now.” Covid woes When the national lockdown was imposed in March 2020, the MERC asked utilities to suspend physical meter-reading to avoid contact. It also asked utilities to charge consumers based on the average of the preceding three months – December, January, and February – of winter. “This effectively means that consumers underpaid in April and May, even though the consumption was high owing to summer and excess usage of power as everyone was home all the time. In June, when the actual meter-reading began, the residual electricity amount was also taken into consideration, resulting in the high bills,” an official from MSEDCL explained. However, citizens and even celebrities slammed the authorities on social media for the bills. Almost 1,100,000 consumers complained of excess bills, of which 752,000 were MSEDCL consumers. In August 2020, the state said it was planning to waive the excess bill by bearing the surplus amount for April, May, and June. State energy minister Nitin Raut in October said that consumers will get good news during Diwali. Owing to these promises, pending complaints, job and business losses during the pandemic, more than six million consumers did not pay a single rupee towards their bill between April and November 2020. On November 17, 2020, Raut, however, said the state cannot provide any relief. An MSEDCL consumer, who did not wish to be named, said, “The state changed its stance from waiving excess bills to saying we will now cut the power supply. This may be the norm for repeat offenders, not for people who have received erroneous bills.” Pratap Hogade, a power expert and also from the Maharashtra State Power Consumers’ Association, said, “We are demanding a 50% waiver for the six-month lockdown period.” The associations also met Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar recently with their demands. Outgoing managing director of MSEDCL, Aseemkumar Gupta, last week told HT that MSEDCL has asked officials to take two steps – to take the top to bottom approach while recovering dues and to rectify errors or doubts in bills. Vijay Singhal, who has been appointed as the new managing director of MSEDCL, did not want to comment on the issue as he has just taken charge. The way ahead Last week, while unveiling a new amnesty scheme for farmers, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to them to make maximum use of the scheme and pay their bills on time. While experts say a waiver of any kind would prove to be disastrous for the state discom, there are ways in which issues can be resolved. According to Dixit, the state needs to immediately resolve pending billing complaints, especially in the agricultural sector. “There should be a permanent drive to resolve complaints and for timely recovery. Apart from this, people also need to be responsible and pay their bills on time, else ultimately quality and reliability of supply will suffer badly,” he said. Ashok Pendse, a power expert from Mumbai, said the issues cannot be resolved unless there is political will. “This whole mess is the government’s creation.” The IEEFA report also lists a series of recommendations for MSEDCL to better its financial position. This includes meeting agricultural power demand through solar power, which will reduce the burden of cross-subsidy. It also suggests reducing its reliance on old, inefficient plants for procuring power and incentivising solar rooftop schemes in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/power-tussle-on-in-maharashtra-consumers-msedcl-both-wait-for-relief-101612379396659.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to reopen colleges from February 15||The Maharashtra government has decided to restart physical classes in colleges and universities from February 15, after a coronavirus-enforced gap of over 10 months, said state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant on Wednesday. However, the state has restricted the attendance of students in physical classes to 50%, a move that will continue for at least a month for now. The state government will take a further decision after a review of the situation. “We have decided to restart colleges and universities in the state from February 15. Colleges can conduct physical classes with 50% students in a class. They also have been directed to ensure Covid-19-appropriate behaviour is strictly followed in campuses,” Samant told reporters.“As students have been taking online lectures for the past many months and many who stay far away and don’t want to come back for physical classes, we have asked the varsities to give them an option for mode of education. Those who want to continue online lectures should be allowed. We are sure universities will not make any decision that would result in educational loss for students,” he said.The state government has also decided to relax the mandatory condition of 75% attendance for students in colleges this academic year. This is being done as we are starting physical classes from February 15, the higher and technical education minister said.The minimum attendance required for this academic year for the students will be decided later, he clarified.Even for examinations, the state government has authorised universities to decide whether they want to conduct offline or online examinations. “The vice-chancellors have requested us to allow both the modes — offline and online — for conducting examinations and we also share the same opinion. We have also asked them to discuss the issue with students before taking any decision,” the minister said.The state government has also empowered district collectors to take a decision based on the Covid-19 pandemic situation in the respective district.It has further decided not to start hostels for students as of now. The higher and technical education minister said that they are going to be started only conducting structural as well as fire audits. “We cannot allow four students in one hostel room like we used to do in pre-Covid times. Now that is not possible as Covid-19 appropriate behaviour needs to be followed. We’ll have to allot one room per student to ensure social distancing is practised. So the varsities will have to decide a criteria for the students to be allowed to use hostels as there are a limited number of hostels. Also, many hostels are still being used as quarantine centers,” he informed.On Tuesday, Samant said that they had taken an in-principle decision to restart colleges and universities across the state and are preparing standard operating procedure for the same. The minister had also asked the vice-chancellors of all universities to come up with plans for resuming physical classes in in a meeting held on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-reopen-colleges-from-february-15-101612379336390.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai education budget: ₹16 crore for Covid-19 essentials in civic schools||Supplying Covid-19-related essentials, opening 10 new Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools and rebranding civic schools – are some initiatives the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will spend on, as part of its education budget for 2021-22. On Wednesday morning, the civic body announced its budgetary estimates for the year and allocated ₹2,945.78 crore for education in 2021-22. This is a marginal increase from last year when BMC had set aside ₹2,944.59 for its schools. In the backdrop of the Covid-19 outbreak and anticipating reopening of schools soon, a provision of nearly ₹16 crore is set aside for procuring infrared thermometers, soaps, hand wash and masks for students. Hand sanitisers will not be distributed to students as they are not advisable for young children, as per health experts. This year, the civic body will also open 10 new CBSE schools in different parts of the city for which there is a budgetary estimate of ₹2 crore. These schools will operate from existing BMC buildings for students from pre-primary to Class 6, and education will be free of cost. Continuing the civic body’s previous rebranding efforts, nomenclatures of all its schools will be changed to Mumbai Public School supplemented by the original school name. The civic body has designed a new logo for its schools. To ensure standardisation of educational content in balwadis across different mediums in the city that will be implemented this year on, BMC has created a training programme in partnership with UNICEF, Pratham, Save the Children India and Rocket Learning. Similarly, child protection teams will be constituted at the school and ward level to address complaints concerning rights violation and other student grievances “These teams will hear complaints from students and parents and conduct awareness sessions about good and bad touch, and the rights of children,” said Mahesh Palkar, education officer, BMC. Some of the civic body’s previously announced initiatives like the virtual training centre in 480 BMC schools, Vidyan Kutuhal Bhawan for science-related learning and financial support to meritorious SSC students for their future education are retained and have been allotted a budget. Despite allocating funds worth ₹20 crores for the installation of CCTV cameras in 2020, work on the same is yet to begin and the initiative finds no budgetary allocation this year. Some new additions Supplies of Covid-19 related essential healthcare equipment: ₹15.90 crore Developing a school playground in a phased manner: ₹5 lakh Opening 10 CBSE schools: ₹2 crore Career counselling programmes: ₹21.10 lakh Old initiatives continued Virtual Training Centres: ₹13.15 crore Online drawing competition: ₹50 lakh Digital classrooms: ₹28.58 crore||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-education-budget-16-crore-for-covid-19-essentials-in-civic-schools-101612379156607.html

04-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hall ticket, tech issues delay ITI examination||Computer-based tests during the ongoing examinations conducted by Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) have been marred by several issues over the past one week. While students could not download their hall tickets for the examination, their actual examination had to be postponed in parts, especially after the server crashed repeatedly on the day of the exam.After receiving several complaints from students, the Association of Non Government ITIs have now approached the Directorate General of Training (DGT) seeking clarity. “Server and technical errors apart, the Trade Electronic Mechanic students were worst affected as after all the delay, maximum questions asked in their exam were out of syllabus. We don’t know whom to approach anymore,” said a student on condition of anonymity. In January this year, the association has also approached the DGT for clarity on exams especially since they are to be conducted online this year, but to no avail. “Computer-based exams are being carried out for ITI students without considering ground realities and the economic repercussions on ITI trainees, causing them undue stress and anxiety,” said a member of the association. While exams were scheduled to take place starting January 28, the hall tickets were to be downloaded on January 27. Thousands of students complained about not being able to download their hall tickets and were eventually told they will not need the document at the time of the examination. In some cases, students faced problems as they were not allowed in exam centres without the hall tickets.“The exam authorities waited till the day of the exam to ask ITIs to upgrade all computers from MS Office 7 to MS Office 10, which led to more chaos. Some institutes ended up waiting hours for the server to pick up on January 28 and were eventually informed that the exam was cancelled,” said the principal of an ITI on condition of anonymity. He added that the same exam was rescheduled for January 29, only to face more server trouble that led to the exams being cancelled second day in a row. “For the time being, exams scheduled for February 2 and 3 too have been rescheduled, but the new exam dates have not been released yet. This confusion has left students more anxious than ever, yet we have no response from the DGT in the matter,” added the principal of another ITI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaihall-ticket-tech-issues-delay-iti-examination-101612378976429.html

The second phase of immunising frontline workers like police personnel and civic staff started on Thursday. Manish Renge, district health officer, Thane zilla parishad, said, “We are gradually working on increasing the number of vaccination centres across the district. Moreover, we are setting up additional teams of vaccinators at each centre. This will help increase the number of immunisations. Those who have already registered on the CoWIN portal can walk into any centre across the district to get themselves vaccinated. There are various such measures undertaken to ensure that we reach out to more beneficiaries and increase the number of vaccinations across the district.” Meanwhile, starting Thursday, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) will vaccinate 5,116 frontline workers who have registered till date. So far, of the registered 8,000 health workers, KDMC has managed to vaccinate 3,500 since the vaccination programme began. KDMC has plans to complete vaccination of frontline and health workers by February 15. “The number of registered health workers were 5,000 earlier, which increased to 8,000 after many more people showed a willingness to get vaccinated. The list of registered frontline workers is 5,116, which will also increase in the coming days,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC. The civic body has now included private centres for the vaccination programme, however, the inoculation itself will be done by trained municipal staff. “We will start vaccinations at AIMS Hospital in Dombivli from Thursday.

In the preliminary investigation, it has come to light that the gang has issued around 1,000 fake degrees of at least 16 government and private universities and school boards.“Five people, who used to pose as educational consultants, have been arrested. We have also recovered 859 fake degrees, 93 stamps, 5,102 holograms, 16 receipt books, six laptops, four printers, three CPUs, two LCD monitors, two keyboards and other stationery items in bulk besides a Hyundai i20 car,” said deputy superintendent of police Amroj Singh during a press briefing on Wednesday.Two of the suspects are from Mohali district: kingpin Nirmal Singh, alias Nimma, of Kartarpur village, and Ankit Arora, alias Goria, of Fatehpur Sialwa. The remaining three are from Uttar Pradesh: Vishnu Sharma of Mathura, Sushant Tyagi of Meerut and Anand Vikram Singh of Ghaziabad.SP (rural) Ravjot Kaur Grewal said these men were running the racket from fake educational consultancy centres in different parts of the nation. “It is a large nexus and also a cyber-oriented crime,” she said. They were duping students on the pretext of providing them degree certificates of various renowned Indian universities, said the SP. “In return, they were collecting a big amount of money as well as ID proofs from the students. The students who wished to study abroad or who wanted to fill the gap years were their main targets. At least, 1,000 such students have been identified yet,” said Grewal. The suspects were using the names of renowned universities and boards, including Punjabi University, Patiala; Adesh University, Bathinda; IK Gujral PTU, Jalandhar; Sikkim University; and Punjab School Education Board, to lure the students. However, role of none of the university or board officials has come to light yet, said police.Grewal said the racket came to light after the kingpin, Nirmal Singh, was arrested by the Zirakpur police at Kalka Chowk following a tip-off January 26. During interrogation, he revealed details of his accomplices, who were arrested from different areas and recoveries were made from them.‘Probe on, more breakthroughs likely’“The suspects are literate and many of them have worked in education sector, due to which they had links with education consultants. A team of hackers was also active in the racket. We are investigating this case thoroughly and more breakthroughs might be made,” said the SP. The mobile phones used by the suspects in these crimes have also been recovered and sent to technical forensic team.The suspects are in police remand. They have been booked under Sections 259 (having possession of counterfeit government stamp), 260 (using as genuine a government stamp known to be counterfeit), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation), 470 (forged document), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal, etc, with intent to commit forgery), and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, said Zirakpur station house officer Onkar Singh. The gang’s modus operandiThe accused used to break into data charts of universities/boards after hacking their websites.The chart was edited to upload the names and addresses of their clients.By using hi-tech printers and scanners along with fake holograms and stamps, they made several degree certificates.

04-02-2021||Chandigarh||Covid vaccine dose wastage below 5% in Chandigarh||Even though, on an average, only 48% of the targeted health workers have come forward to take the coronavirus vaccine shot in Chandigarh, the wastage of doses stands at just 4.7%, half the permissible limit of 10%.Till February 2, 433 vials of Covishield vaccine, with each containing 10 doses, have been used. Of the total 4,330 doses, only 202 have gone waste, majorly due to non-availability of the targeted beneficiaries.“The vaccine coverage is as important for us as preventing the wastage of doses. We have trained and instructed the vaccinators that the vials once opened should be utilised properly. The Union health ministry has set 10% as the permissible limit, but we have been able to keep it under 5%. As the sphere of targeted groups will increase, the chances of wastage will become lower,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department.Officials said the vial is opened only after around six to seven beneficiaries arrive at the vaccination site, and special attention is given in the evening hours, when the chances of doses going waste are higher.Around 11,475 health workers are to be inoculated in Chandigarh, of whom around 4,000 have received their first shot so far.Top officials receive jab as second phase beginsThe health department on Wednesday started the second phase of vaccination drive to cover frontline workers from other departments, including police and municipal corporation. However, the response remained lukewarm.Of the 150 targeted, only 66 (44%), including 38 police personnel, turned up. Meanwhile, among health workers, 314 (31%) of the 1,004 targeted received the jab. While cops are being vaccinated at the Police Hospital in Sector 26, municipal employees got the dose at the government hospital in Sector 16, with MC commissioner KK Yadav being the first.After getting vaccinated, director general of police Sanjay Baniwal urged people to come forward. “It’s human to fear the unknown, but there is no need to fear. We will win against Covid-19,” he said. The first dose was given to assistant sub-inspector Rajani, who said: “Now I feel safe.” In the neighbouring Mohali district, too, senior administrative and police officials were vaccinated. They included senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh and additional deputy commissioners Aashika Jain and Rajiv Gupta. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the second phase of the drive is for 8,621 pre-registered frontline warriors in the district, and 54 have been vaccinated on the first day.“It was a painless and satisfactory experience with no adverse effects after vaccination,” said the SSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-vaccine-dose-wastage-below-5-in-chandigarh-101612378558970.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena plans monthly events to woo Gujarati voters ahead of BMC polls||In a bid to woo the Gujarati community, the Shiv Sena has planned an event every month to connect with the community in Mumbai ahead of the 2022 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) election. After their first event in January, the party will now hold the second gathering of the community in Malad (West) on February 7 where 21 Gujarati business owners will join the party. The party, according to its national organiser Hemraj Shah, has planned events in Gujarati-dominated areas in western and central suburbs. For the gathering on Sunday, the Sena has come up with a theme of Raas-Garba — the traditional folk dance of the community. Last month, the Sena held an event with the tagline — Mumbai ma jalebi ne fafda, Uddhav Thackeray aapda (Jalebi and fafda in Mumbai, Uddhav Thackery is ours), in an attempt to reach out to the community. Shah, a prominent Gujarati face in the Sena, said, “We will hold events for the community every month. Next month we will have one in Goregaon, later in Borivli, Mulund, etc. This time we have kept the theme as garba.”He said the party aims to expand its base through these events. “Every political party holds programme and events to expand their party base. There is no need to woo the community. The community is smart and votes after careful thought. I am confident that the people would vote for the Shiv Sena as they have appreciated Uddhav ji’s idea of ‘sarva dharma samabhav’ (all religions are equal), and Gujaratis like this,” Shah said.Retaining power in the Mumbai civic body is going to be a prestige issue for the party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which bagged almost as many seats as the Sena in the 2017 elections, has started campaigning for the civic polls. The BJP has been attacking the Sena and the Thackeray government on various issues including shifting of the Metro car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-plans-monthly-events-to-woo-gujarati-voters-ahead-of-bmc-polls-101612378557657.html

The seismic microzonation, tsunami atlas, and hazard vulnerability risk assessment (HVRA) will investigate the severity of the impact of such disasters on various areas, and their impact on the livelihood of citizens. It will identify threats that require a timely and coordinated response to protect lives, property and reduce socio-economic loss.A budgetary provision of ₹18.26 crore has been made for this project, in BMC’s budget 2021-22, presented before the standing committee by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, on Wednesday. The project has been in the planning stage for almost a year. A senior civic official from the disaster management department, who has been working on the project said, “It is in the planning stage right now, and the process has begun. It will take between six to eight months to complete the project.”HVRA will be tied to an artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based decision support system (DSS). This will be an automated system that will alert the civic officials on impending disasters.Mumbai is located in Seismic Zone III, near the Panvel seismic zone, which is known to be seismically active.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-budget-18-26-crore-to-study-areas-at-risks-from-disasters-101612378556403.html

This comes in the backdrop of Mumbai being chosen as a member of the C40 cities – a global network of cities committed to tackling climate change, in December 2020.Speaking to the media later, Chahal said, “This is a crucial step in equipping Mumbai to tackle issues of rising pollution and climate change. The department will become operational from April 1, 2021.”C40 membership encourages cities to develop and implement a climate action plan compatible with the Paris Agreement goal. The leaders of these cities use a science-based approach and there is an exchange of best practices to take effective action for keeping the global average temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius and reducing emissions by 2030 as per the Paris Agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-set-up-climate-change-department-from-april-1-101612378376244.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||BMC: Single planning body for Mumbai?||In a significant move which could have an impact on city administration if approved by the state government, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has proposed it be made a single planning authority for Mumbai. Currently, multiple agencies act as the special planning authority for areas in the city. For example, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is the special planning authority for Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Oshiwara Business District and Cuffe Parade. The Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) has powers in areas where slum projects are taken up and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) is the special planning authority for its colonies. Several urban planners have been suggesting the city needs one authority to plan its development and control haphazard vertical development owing to lack of coordination among different agencies. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “Several authorities are authorised to plan development of layouts in their possession. There is no control of the BMC on these authorities, whereas the BMC is providing all infrastructural facilities such as water supply, sewerage facility, roads, streetlights, solid waste management services, etc. This leads to loss of revenue to BMC and citizens have to suffer in case of any obstacle that may arise in the infrastructural facilities.” Making it a single planning authority for the city will facilitate speedy development and also solve the problems with regard to infrastructural facilities of citizens residing in these layouts, under one roof, according to the civic body. Chahal said, “By single planning authority we do not mean to execute several infrastructure projects going on in the city, but we plan to act as a planning authority. A single planning authority will mean Mumbai can have integrated planning and development in the immediate future. This proposal is under active consideration of the state government.” Chahal also added that in the coming months, the BMC could be made the planning authority for Cuffe Parade and Marine Drive. “Many citizens and various stakeholders have approached us for having a single planning authority, and the state government has been very positive about it,” he said. Amruta Ponkshe, an independent urban planner, said, “What BMC has proposed today has been a demand since long. But the BMC needs to have a proper plan to execute it and should involve citizens and other stakeholders.” The Congress which is also Shiv Sena’s ally in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition at the state supported the proposal of the BMC. Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in the BMC, said, “The plan is good for the city, but it will require the BMC to improve on a lot many things, and this also means improving its administrative strength.” Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party (SP) corporator and group leader in the BMC, said, “We support the plan to make BMC the single planning authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-single-planning-body-for-mumbai-101612378197958.html

In a press conference held on Wednesday, the group of 24 Mumbai cyclists unveiled the design for the stand. They are looking at presenting the proposal to city mayor Kishori Pednekar.Firoza Suresh, bicycle mayor of the city and founder of the Smart Commute Foundation (SCF), who is spearheading the campaign, said, “In 2020, we selected 24 bicycle councillors for each of the 24 wards. These councillors, in the last few months, have identified places where the bicycle stands can be set-up. The design is also such that it will not occupy a lot of space.”Suresh, on Wednesday, said that the campaign looks at making Mumbai the bicycle capital of the country by 2030. “During the pandemic, there has been a 35% increase in the number of cyclists. We have to keep this momentum going, and it is possible only by providing the right infrastructure to cyclists,” she added.Somnath Gharge, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), traffic, who was present at the event on Wednesday, pointed out that in 2019, nine cyclists died and 38 were injured in crashes on the road. “We need a shift in attitude,” Gharge said, stressing on the need for cycling infrastructure in the city.SCF is also working on creating a comprehensive cycling map for Mumbai, which it plans to present to the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclists-identify-600-locations-in-mumbai-for-stands-101612378196534.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||BMC scrapped Mulund hospital land deal after scam was exposed, alleges Kirit Somaiya||Mumbai
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Kept development, not polls, in mind, says Mumbai civic body chief||What was your vision behind the budget for the city? I want to give a major push to infrastructure development for Mumbai and improve civic amenities for citizens. Last year, the ratio between capital expenditure and revenue expenditure was 35:65. I have brought it down to 48:52. Capital expenditure has seen an almost 71% increase this year, in comparison to the last year.Does the BMC have funds for it? There is a shortfall in revenue due to lockdown and BMC’s financial health is a worry. There is a gross misunderstanding that the BMC has lost revenue. Our net losses are virtually zero, as all money is recoverable. The income from property tax in 2020-21 decreased by ₹2,268.58 crore in comparison to the estimate last year. This money is recoverable in the form of arrears from all taxpayers. Similarly, from the Development Plan department, we saw reduced income of ₹2,679.52 crore, but we had already revised our estimated income in December last year, so the loss is negligible. There is no question of bankruptcy or poor fiscal health of the BMC. If that was the case, you would see the administration present a budget less than previous year’s budget. This year’s allocation has instead increased by 16%. We are also not dipping into our reserves. What is the main focus of the budget? For the first time, the BMC is heavily spending on infrastructure projects. The projects kickstarted in this budget amount to a total project cost of ₹42,000 crore. Of this, ₹13,000 is the cost of the coastal road. New projects worth ₹29,000 crore have been undertaken. For example, construction of the sewage treatment plants will cost ₹15,000 crore, Goregaon-Mulund Link Road will cost ₹6,600 crore, ₹4,790 crore will be utilised for hospital upgradation, Mithi river rejuvenation and widening will cost ₹3,200 crore, and other river rejuvenation projects on Dahisar, Poisar rivers will cost ₹1,400 crore, the desalination plant will cost ₹2,200 crore. These projects are all kickstarting this year and will take four or five years to complete. This is the last budget before BMC elections in 2022, and has been criticised by the Opposition as an ambitious pre-budget election. Comment. All projects that have received sizable allocation in this budget will take over three or four years to complete. So how do they impact the BMC polls? I am not handing out any freebies, discounts, rewards, etc. It has been made keeping the long-term development of the city in mind. What was your idea behind asking the state government to make BMC the single planning authority in the city? The matter is under consideration of the state government now. I took this decision for the benefit of Mumbai, and for integrated, wholistic, and speedy development. Nowhere in the world does a model of multiple planning authorities work. The task of planning needs to be handed to a singular body for better management. The decision was taken purely on merit. Why is BMC considering formation of a fee revision authority? It becomes difficult sometimes for elected bodies to take timely decisions about revision of various taxes and charges. Along the lines of (Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission) MERC for electricity, the BMC too needs to have a body that will take care of timely tax revision, which is binding on the BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kept-development-not-polls-in-mind-says-mumbai-civic-body-chief-101612377958402.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Travel, safety are major issues in reopening Mumbai colleges from February 15||The decision of the state department of higher and technical education, to reopen colleges with 50% capacity starting February 15, has invited mixed reactions both, from colleges and students. While many feel it is time to take baby steps towards bringing students and staff back on campus, others questioned the move, especially since the government or the University of Mumbai (MU) has not shared detailed guidelines on how such a task can be achieved.“As of now, we only know that colleges need to reopen starting February 15, but the details of this move are still unknown to all. Unless we are informed exactly how to implement this move, the institute can’t take any decision towards reopening,” said Parag Ajgaonkar, principal of NM College, Vile Parle. Ajgaonkar added that while the college has started slowly preparing to bring back students in a phased manner, nothing is certain unless the government clarifies its decision.Other than the worry of a large number of students returning to campus, colleges are also concerned about how this will be possible, especially since trains are still not open to the general public during peak hours. “Reopening of schools is still possible because students depend on autos, cars and school buses to commute, but college students largely depend on trains. Since trains are not open to them from 7am to 1pm and again from to 9pm, how do we expect staff and students to commute?” asked TA Shiware, speaking for the management of Wilson College, Worli. He added that the government should first rework travel restrictions before reopening colleges.Several city colleges have around 3,000 to 5,500 students, and another few hundred teaching and non-teaching staff. Even with 50% attendance, colleges are worried about bringing students back on campus.While most institutes already have a sanitisation program in place, some are worried about the expenses that will be incurred by them once students start attending regular lectures. “We have 4,000 students plus staff to cater to, and even if only 50% of them are on campus, sanitising every class and ensuring sanitisers for all students and staff will be a huge cost to incur. The government should look into offering some financial aid to colleges, especially those with a large number of students,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/travel-safety-are-major-issues-in-reopening-mumbai-colleges-from-february-15-101612377957181.html

In the 2020-2021 budget MUTP 2 had received ₹200 crore, MUTP 3 received ₹300 crore, and MUTP 3A had received ₹50 crore.Critical railway projects under MUTP include a new suburban railway corridor between Panvel and Karjat railway stations, communication-based train control system(CBTC), procurement of 47 air-conditioned (AC) local trains, quadrupling of the railway line between Virar and Dahanu railway station, elevated railway corridor between Airoli and Kalva railway stations, and control on midsection trespassing. “We are happy that like in the last few years, the fund allocation has been as desired and work will get a further boost. The projects are at different stages of implementation and will be completed with works as they proceed,” said RS Khurana, managing director, Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation, which handles suburban railway infrastructure projects. Further, ₹316 crore has also been allocated for passenger amenities on the Central Railway in the Union Budget 2021-2022, a ₹21-crore increase from the ₹295.6 crore for the same purpose in the 2020-2021 Budget. In the 2019-2020 Budget, ₹284 crore was allocated, and for 2018-2019, budgetary allocation was ₹204 crore.“The net plan outlet, as compared to last year is higher, and it will help promote all railway infrastructure works and projects on the Central Railway,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR. Replacement of 605 smart card-linked automatic ticket vending machines (ATVM) has been proposed in the Budget. Apart from the provision for a video surveillance system, the Budget also provides allocation for 115 escalators on the suburban railway stations on CR and 65 escalators for Western Railway (WR) stations. Passenger associations have welcomed the budget and stated that a committee should be formed to monitor the progress of each project. “The increase in budgetary allocation is good as the projects can be completed with improved speed. We welcome the increased allocation but the railway ministry should direct forming a committee to monitor the progress of each project under MUTP,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railways-allocates-650-crore-in-budget-to-improve-mumbai-suburban-network-101612377596361.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body budget: 10 million to get Covid vaccine||Vaccination of one crore citizens and construction of a new building in Kasturba Hospital to tackle communicable diseases are among the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) plans for 2021-22, according to the budget announcements on Wednesday. The civic health department has been allocated ₹4,728.53 crore in the budget, 8% of the capital expenditure of the civic body. In his budget speech, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “Computerised registry of people needing vaccination and undergoing vaccination, mega storage for whole Mumbai, training of various stake holders for vaccination, local cold storage by ILR refrigerators are being activated, Jumbo facility centers, major hospitals and important peripheral hospitals have been identified as vaccination centre. BMC’s eventual plan is to vaccinate around 1 crore citizens of Mumbai.” On whether the BMC was prepared to finance vaccination for citizens of Mumbai, Chahal said, “The single-window for procurement of vaccines in the country is the Central government for now. All procurement will happen through the Centre, under the guidelines of both the Central and state government. The Central government, in its budget for the country, has reserved ₹31,000 crore for vaccination, and I guess this should answer question of where the money for vaccination will come from.” Chahal added, “Our aim is to vaccinate one crore population and we need to understand that vaccinating the entire population is a process. Further, we have also undertaken repairs for civic hospitals and health centres.” The BMC has proposed to improve the infrastructure of healthcare institutes, carry out major structural repairs at 29 hospitals, 287 health posts and/or dispensaries and 28 maternity homes for which ₹822 crore has been allocated. Further, the BMC plans to invite tenders for construction of a new building to accommodate the existing wards of Kasturba Hospital, the first city hospital to be used as an isolation facility for Covid-19. The BMC has also allocated ₹5 crore for clinics-on-wheels wherein one van in each city, western and eastern suburbs, will give treatment to patients. The BMC has also proposed to take efforts to explore other forms of medicine such as Unani, Ayurveda and a policy to check important health parameters of senior citizens at home. As of Wednesday, Mumbai has vaccinated 58,623 health care workers in the first phase, and has 310,141 Covid-19 cases followed by 11,375 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-budget-heeds-to-vax-populi-target-10-million-101612377536338.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Phase 2 of Covid-19 vaccination drive: 793 frontline staff inoculated on Day 1||After a delay, Maharashtra started phase 2 of the vaccination drive to inoculate over 600,000 frontline workers along with vaccination of around 786,000 healthcare workers which is already in progress. On Wednesday, the state health department inoculated 35,096 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 793 frontline workers, including police personnel, sanitation and revenue department staff. The second phase got off to a slow start due to technical glitches in CoWIN, the Centre’s mobile phone application that is used for enrolment of the people to be inoculated. On Wednesday, the state recorded a turnout of 62%, which is a drop from Monday’s turnout of 77%.A total of 354,633 people have been inoculated in a total of 11 sessions held till date. Of them, 344,942 HCWs have been immunised across the state, according to a release issued by the state health department. The vaccination drive was started on January 16 and is now being held four days a week. Despite a rise in the number of health camps to 555, the state government on the first day of phase 2 could inoculate only 793 frontline workers owing to technical glitches in the CoWIN app.In many districts, the app failed to send out automated messages to beneficiaries to arrive at vaccination centres, as a result of which the phase-2 drive was conducted in only seven to eight districts on Wednesday. It may take a day or two to resolve the issues, officials said.“We are facing technical glitches in informing the beneficiaries to reach the vaccination centres. The app could not send the automated message to them; as a result, we could not roll out phase 2 in all the districts of the state. This is the reason the number of beneficiaries among frontline workers is very less,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity.The technical glitches in the CoWIN app had already delayed the rollout of the second phase, scheduled on February 1. The authorities were facing difficulties in sending out messages to the beneficiaries and also in transfer of data from the state to districts. On Monday, the state had conducted a mock drill as part of its preparations for phase 2 of the drive.Data of the beneficiaries is populated onto CoWIN and the session allocation, details of vaccination to the beneficiary, information about the next dose will be captured and communicated digitally by the app.“We have planned to continue vaccination of both HCWs and frontline workers simultaneously. While doing so, those HCWs who have completed a gap of 28 days will also be called for the second shot of the vaccine. This will help us in completing the drive in less time,” said another official.The state has also continued giving shots of Covaxin to beneficiaries at six centres and vaccinated 408 people on Wednesday.In the two districts of Mumbai, 57,585 beneficiaries have been vaccinated so far, the health department said.According to data released by the health department, Akola and Bhandara districts reported over 100% turnout. Akola reported 107% turnout, with 320 beneficiaries were vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/phase-2-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-793-frontline-staff-inoculated-on-day-1-101612377417061.html
04-02-2021||Mumbai||Revenue dips, but Mumbai civic body’s budget ambitious||While its revenue was affected by the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, the Mumbai civic body presented an ambitious budget of ₹39,038.38 crore, although there are no clear signs of increase in the revenue. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is relying on money to be received from the state and its agencies like Slum Rehabilitation Authority to meet its expenditure and an internal loan to fund its infrastructure projects partly. The budget presented by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday reported a drop in the civic body’s income in 2020 by ₹5,876.17 crore. In 2020-21, the BMC earned ₹22,572.13 crore, against the estimated ₹28,448.30 crore. The 2021-22 budget is 16.74% more than last year’s budget which was ₹33,441.02 crore. Moreover, the capital expenditure has shown increased by a whopping 71% at ₹18,750.99 crore, in comparison to the previous year when it was pegged at ₹10,903.58 crore. BMC’s revenue expenditure for 2020 is pegged at ₹20,276.33 crore, as opposed to last year’s allocation of ₹19,096.74 crore. As the lockdown resulted in closure of many small and large commercial units, the property tax collection in the previous year was ‘adversely affected’, the budget said. Moreover, the slowdown in real estate due to lockdown, and migration of labour during lockdown months led to decrease in revenue of the development plan department. The property tax department earned ₹4,500 crore, less than the estimated ₹6768.58 crore. The development plan department earned ₹1,199.99 crore, instead of ₹3879.51 crore estimated in budget 2020. The state in January announced 50% reduction in construction premiums to give impetus to real estate projects, which resulted in a loss of over ₹2,000 crore for the BMC’s DP department. Subsequently, the BMC revised its budget, reducing it by ₹2,259 crore, at a total size of ₹31,182 crore, instead of ₹33,441.02 crore. Chahal has maintained that BMC continues to be in a sound financial position. He said, “This is not a loss in revenue. This money is recoverable, as arrears. The BMC’s financial position is strong. That is why we could increase the size of the budget this year. The BMC has not dipped into its reserves for this.” The BMC has proposed to raise ₹5,876 crore as internal loan to meet its budget requirements. Chahal said, “This money will be drawn from the separate fund of ₹14,000 crore, generated from fungible FSI premiums. This is separate from our reserves.” The BMC presently has ₹50,953.27 crore in reserves, that are linked to various infrastructure projects, and ₹26,682.95 crore locked in for pensions, provident funds and gratuity of its staff. In 2021, BMC expects an income of ₹7,000 crore from the property tax department, ₹2,000 crore from the development plan department, and ₹10,583.08 crore from compensation from the government for octroi, apart from income from water and sewage charges, interest from investments and sewage charges. To recover its revenue, the BMC is banking on ₹1,600 crore expected from land premiums and infrastructure development charges from SRA. The state also owes BMC ₹5274.16 crore until December 2020, for property tax, water charges, sewage charges, and BMC’s share in various taxes collected by the state. The BMC is also considering setting up of a fee revision authority to ensure timely revision of all taxes, whose decision will be binding on the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/revenue-dips-but-mumbai-civic-body-s-budget-ambitious-101612377356284.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt orders DTC to withdraw buses given to police on special hire||The Delhi government has directed the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) to seek prior approval before allowing any of its buses to be taken on ‘special hire’ by the Delhi Police or any other entity for that matter, senior transport officials said on Wednesday.The government order comes in the wake of at least 40 DTC and cluster buses getting damaged on Republic Day when protesting farmers clashed with the police during their tractor rally. At several points, including near Akshardham and ITO, the Delhi Police had placed buses, besides barricades, to stop farmers from moving beyond the routes approved for the rally.The directive was issued late Wednesday night to suspend direct issuance of DTC buses on special hire came with the approval of transport minister Kailash Gahlot, senior officials said.Also read: Delhi CM says government will help find missing farmersAfter the order, all DTC depots issued notices to the area SHOs of the Delhi police recalling buses with immediate effect.“It has been decided by the competent authority to withdraw all buses deployed on special hire with immediate effect. It is, therefore, requested to relieve buses immediately and any further requisition of buses shall be considered after the approval of the competent authority,” read the electronic messages sent to the area depot managers and the SHOs.Gauging the urgency of the matter, this communication was made through emails as well, said a member of the DTC Ekta Karamchari Union - a body of DTC employees.“The Delhi police has been taking state-run buses on special hire since a long time. But, the basic idea was to transport police personnel for mass deployment in specific areas,” said a senior government official.“But, over the years it was noticed that the police started using these buses for other reasons such as using them as barricades to block roads to putting them up as shields to protect forces from potential violence during riots. The damage ultimately is borne by the DTC which is already running under loss,” said a transport official.“At least 35 DTC buses were damaged in the Republic Day incident and this count is likely to increase as the assessment is still going on. As for cluster buses, a total of five buses were damaged throughout the day on January 26,” said a senior transport official.Each bus costs about ₹50 lakh at least, the official added.The damages were mostly on the windscreen, gate glasses, bumper and window glasses.“Ever since February 1, hundreds of state-run buses are now being used as barricades to block roads. At least 6-7 such buses were deployed to block the Delhi-Meerut expressway alone,” said a senior DTC official.Another official recalled how DTC drivers and depot managers had to face the brunt in the form of police cases when migrants started returning to their hometowns during the coronavirus pandemic-induced lockdown in April-May last year. “Even during that time, those buses were taken on special hire by the police. But all the blame and FIRs were faced by DTC employees,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-orders-dtc-to-withdraw-buses-given-to-police-on-special-hire-101612376996583.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Police register cases against social media users for peddling ‘misinformation’||Delhi Police on Wednesday said they have registered four cases against several social media accounts as part of their action against the “massive misinformation campaign being undertaken on social media to incite violence in the name of farmers’ protests and cause large-scale disturbance in the national capital”.They said requests for the removal of the “offensive and unlawful posts” has been sent to the service providers.The police did not name the Twitter handles against which the Cyber Prevention Awareness and Detection (CyPAD) unit of the police registered the cases for allegedly sharing or posting fake posts over violence during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day.Also read: Police announce reward for info on R-Day violence suspectsLast week, the police arrested a 29-year-old man from Rajasthan’s Churu and apprehended a minor boy from Rajasthan for allegedly posting an old video with fake message about resignation by 200 Delhi Police personnel, said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.“Several other accused persons indulging in such activities have been identified and efforts are underway to affect their arrests. Notices to join the investigation have been issued to four persons. Further action against them will be taken on the basis of their deposition,” said Biswal.Among those who were issued notices was Yogita Bhayana, founder of NGO, PARI, for two tweets that she posted around the time of the clashes. Bhayana was booked by the police for the two tweets and in the notice issued to her, she was asked to “inform the source and reason for uploading” the two posts.While the two tweets couldn’t be found on Wednesday, Bhayana said they were in reference to the alleged shooting by police — a charge denied by the police.“I stand by what I tweeted. They were not done with an intention to cause riots. I just shared my concern about police’s atrocities against farmers and in the hope that it would stop instead of aggravating,” said Bhayana.Ahead of the farmers’ tractor march on Republic Day, which turned violent, Delhi Police reported over 300 Pakistan-based Twitter handles trying to vitiate farmers’ protest.On January 30, the Union ministry of electronics and IT (MEITY) directed Twitter to block around 250 tweets and Twitter accounts which were using offensive, inciting hashtags which have been making fake, intimidatory and provocative tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-register-cases-against-social-media-users-for-peddling-misinformation-101612376995413.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Increased police blockades cut protesters off from toilets, water||The rampant fortification of farm protest sites in Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur has restricted access to toilets, sanitation facilities, and water, agitators at the three border spots have said, alleging that the Delhi Police are intent are cutting off basic facilities to quell the stir.Since January 29, when a group of persons, claiming to be locals, entered the Singhu border agitation and clashes with farmers despite police presence, the number of barricades at the spots has been increased and alternate routes have been cut off. This means farmers spread across the eight-kilometre-long protest area have to now often travel long distances to reach toilets or access drinking water.While supplies coming from Punjab and Haryana at Singhu have not been affected so far, since the barricading and blockades are on the Delhi side, access to toilets and water tankers provided by the Delhi government has been severely disrupted.Also read: Police announce reward for info on R-Day violence suspectsJasvir Singh, a farmer at Singhu border from Punjab’s Tarn Taran district said, “By installing barricades, the police are trying to cut off supplies and intimidate us. Older farmers are being forced to relieve themselves in the open or take a longer route to reach the toilet near a petrol pump. The Delhi government toilets, which are installed only a few metres from here, are now beyond reach.”Earlier, farmers could access the various mobile toilet facilities around the entrance to the Singhu border agitation site and washrooms set up at the nearby Guru Tegh Bahadur Memorial. Farmers spread over the eight-kilometre-long protest spot had access to mobile toilet stations set up by NGOs, welfare groups as well as Haryana authorities.A senior police official, requesting anonymity, said, “Not all routes have been closed. We have kept one side open for them and farmers can move between the two stages using inner lanes and use toilets which have been moved in that area.”Sukhwinder Kaur (44) a disabled person from Punjab’s Jalandhar district protesting at Singhu, uses a wheelchair, and said her family members now have to carry her till the toilets. “It is difficult, but I wanted to come here and protest with the farmers as the government has done every possible thing to break the spirit of the movement,” Kaur said.Protestors at Tikri said after the security forces shut off access to the site, basic amenities such as access to toilets have been an issue, especially for women protestors. However, local residents and several NGOs and startups have pitched in with makeshift facilities.On Sunday, Basic Shit, a start-up that has been installing low-cost urinals across Delhi, conducted a do-it-yourself workshop for protesters, to help them build toilets and urinals around the agitation areas. The first batch of these has been installed near gate number three of Pandit Shriram Sharma Metro station.Local residents have also been providing access to the toilets in their houses and shops for farmers.“The people around us have been extremely supportive. They have allowed women and senior citizens to use their personal toilets. We are also contacting NGOs and startups to help us raise money to build makeshift toilets. The public toilets have been blocked and that is a problem,” said Chaudhary Ranjit Singh, one of the organisers at Tikri border.At Ghazipur border, farmers had access to toilets, some of which have been set up by the local administration and some of their own. Here, none of these basic amenities fell on the Delhi Police’s side of the barricades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/increased-police-blockades-cut-protesters-off-from-toilets-water-101612376936074.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Court dismisses Jamia varsity plea seeking FIRs against cops for Dec violence||A Delhi court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by Jamia Millia Islamia seeking registration of FIRs against police officers for their alleged forcible entry into the varsity and assault on students in December 2019, during the anti-CAA (Citizenship (Amendment) Act) protests.On December 15, 2019, a protest against the CAA near Jamia had turned violent, resulting in the torching of four public buses and two police vehicles and stone pelting. At least 40 people, including students, policemen and firefighters, were injured in the incident. Public buses and private vehicles were also set on fire.Metropolitan Magistrate Rajat Goyal said the policemen were “acting in order to control the law and order situation which had emerged in relation to the anti-CAA protest even though some actions were questionable”. The judge also said students from the varsity were protesting which had turned violent and the situation had become tense.Also read: MHA says CAA rules under preparation, exercise pushed to July“Thus, actions of respondents in doing so are clearly connected to their official duties, though some of the said actions might be questionable. This court has no hesitation in holding that acts allegedly committed by the police… were committed in the discharge of official duties,” the court said in a 16-page order.The court also noted that the violence was due to some anti­social elements and that the protests held by students of Jamia were largely peaceful.“… one aspect which is clear from the factual background is that some of the protests had become violent and that police… were acting to control the said protests at the relevant point of time, so as to prevent violence and law and order situation from further deteriorating,” the court said.Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI), through its counsel Asghar Khan and Tahir Khan, had sought the registration of criminal cases against the police officers for their alleged atrocities on students in December 2019.JMI in its plea said that in pursuit of clearing the crowd, police had broke into the university without seeking any sanction from the varsity officials and used excessive and arbitrary force, and thrashed several university security guards and students.It had also contended that the police had caused destruction of property and fired tear gas shells while also resorting to a lathi charge. The plea had claimed that the police had also hurt the religious sentiments of the locals by entering the university mosque.The court, while rejecting the plea, said it cannot be said that the acts allegedly committed by the police were wholly unconnected to their official duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-dismisses-jamia-varsity-plea-seeking-firs-against-cops-for-dec-violence-101612376879494.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Students groups, activists held citizen march in solidarity with farmers||Members of several student organisations and activist groups gathered at Mandi House on Wednesday for a march in solidarity with the farmers protesting at Delhi borders against the new farm laws.Carrying placards and posters with slogans that read “Dilli ke log kisano ke sath” and “no farmers, no food”, and shouting slogans against the legislations, nearly 200 protesters gathered at Mandi House around 12.30pm.They wanted to march till Jantar Mantar, but were stopped by police personnel who then installed barricades across Barakhamba Road.Also read: S Jaishankar says Motivated campaigns targeting India will never succeedThe protesters refused to disperse immediately and instead carried out a sit-in protest at Mandi House till late evening.The protest saw at least 21 organisations participate, including the All India Students’ Union (AISA), Students’ Federation of India (SFI), All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU), and National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), among others.Prasenjeet Kumar, AISA national general secretary, said the Centre should accept the farmers’ demands instead of “waging a war” against them.“The government should immediately retract the complaints filed against the farmer leaders and release those who have been arrested,” Kumar said.Another protester, Sandeep Kumar, a Delhi University (DU) student, said, “Not only has the government not been listening to farmers, they have instead put in place several layers of metal and concrete barriers, fixed iron spikes on the road and built concrete walls to stop them. What kind of behaviour is that? We won’t have food to eat if farmers stop working.”Protesters criticised the Delhi Police for not allowing them to march till Jantar Mantar.Sucheta De, a member of AICCTU, said, “Why have Delhi Police installed so many barricades and deployed riot-gear to stop some students, women, labourers, and activists from carrying out a peaceful march in support of our farmers? Why don’t the police deploy such security when violence actually happens in the city?”Eish Singhal, DCP (New Delhi), said the protesters were not given permission to carry out a march because the area is a “non-designated protest spot” as per the Supreme Court’s directions, apart from the fact that Section 144 is in place as well. “The organisers were duly conveyed about the same. Adequate arrangements were made to avert any untoward situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/students-groups-activists-held-citizen-march-in-solidarity-with-protesting-farmers-101612376875394.html
04-02-2021||Delhi||Blockade of borders causing inconvenience to locals, loss to exchequer: MHA||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) said on Wednesday that the blockade of city borders by farmers protesting against the three farm laws is causing inconvenience to the residents of Delhi and neighbouring states, besides financial loss to the people and the exchequer.In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday to a question by Shiv Sena member Anil Desai, union minister of state (home affairs) G Kishan Reddy said, “The Delhi Police has informed that Ghazipur, Chilla, Tikri and Singhu borders of the national capital are blocked by agitating farmers and it is inconvenient to the residents of Delhi and neighbouring states. In any agitation, there is financial loss incurred by people and governments”.The police have created multiple layers of barriers near the three protest sites at Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu, including metal and concrete barricades, concrete walls, barbed wire mounted on barricades to contain the protesters there and to prevent them from entering Delhi.Also read: Students groups, activists held citizen march in solidarityReddy also defended the use of force by the police during the Republic Day tractor rally, saying the security personnel were left with no option but to use tear gas, water cannons and mild force to control the crowd as farmers were aggressive and damaging government property.The ministry also told the Rajya Sabha that neither the Enforcement Directorate (ED) nor the National Investigation Agency (NIA) sent summons to 40 people related to voluntary agencies, groups and individuals who are providing humanitarian support to the farmers agitation.NIA officials who declined to be named said two dozen people were summoned in mid-January as “witness” in the probe into the funding of the agitation by suspected Khalistani supporters. They said the investigation did not have anything to do with the protests by itself.Farm leaders and the Opposition parties claimed last month that the NIA issued summons to 40 activists from Punjab in a bid to “intimidate” them into withdrawing their support to the protests. The summons were reportedly sent in connection with a case against Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, the legal adviser of the US-based Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan outfit, for allegedly funding various activities in India and organizing protests outside Indian missions abroad.Home ministry officials also said that there was no plan as of now to further extend the suspension of internet connectivity at Delhi’s borders. Internet was suspended at Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu borders till Tuesday 11pm by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/blockade-of-borders-causing-inconvenience-to-locals-loss-to-exchequermha-101612376815388.html
04-02-2021||Pune||Mula-Mutha river rejuvenation project: PMC yet to acquire land for three STPs||Pune: The much-hyped and long-pending Mula-Mutha river rejuvenation project funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is still waiting land clearance for construction of three sewage treatment plants. The sewage units are crucial part of project undertaken by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Launched five years ago, the project is still on the waiting list in terms of deadline execution. The ₹990-crore project was sanctioned by the central government in January 2016. Under the JICA project, the civic body will construct 11 new STPs across the city to reduce the pollution of Mula-Mutha river. The project will create an additional sewage treatment capacity of 396 million litres per day (MLD) over the existing 477 MLD, laying of 113.6 km of sewer lines and renovation/rehabilitation of four existing intermediate pumping stations. Once the project is completed by January 2022, the total STP capacity available in Pune will be 873 MLD, which will be sufficient to cater to sewage generation for the year 2027, according to civic authorities. When the project was okayed by the Centre, BJP city unit had put up hoardings and banners and gave thanks to Member of Parliament (MP) Prakash Javadekar who was handling the environment ministry. Meeting at Delhi Union minister Nitin Gadkari called a meeting to discuss the river rejuvenation project for Pune, Nagpur and other irrigation projects in Delhi last Wednesday. Maharashtra’s irrigation minister Jayant Patil, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, MP Girish Bapat and municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar attended the meeting. Gadkari instructed PMC to speed up the JICA project. Ahead of civic polls, BJP is pushing for completion of pending projects. Land for STPs According to the PMC land estate department, the corporation requires 1.26 acres in Warje area that belongs to 39 private owners. The compensation needed to acquire the land is ₹26.25 crore. PMC also needs ₹3.25 crore for 600 sq m land in Kharadi. In Baner, PMC has identified 6.50 sq m which costs around ₹10 crore. Jagdish Khanore, superintendent engineer, drainage project department, said, “As the Centre is not going to pay for land acquisition, operation and maintenance of the project, PMC’s expenditure share will increase. At present, the corporation has a share of 15 per cent in the project.” Nilesh Choudhary, one of the landowners in Warje, said, “There are 39 farmers owing 6.50 acre in the area. After the village merged into PMC, they stopped farming in their land, but it is their only source of income. Corporation has valued the land for ₹26.25 crore, but we demand ₹47 crore as per the ready reckoner rate.” Sakharam Barate, another landowner who owns nine guntha, said, “Discussion with authorities is still on.” Drainage department claims Khanore said, “We have acquired land for nine STPs out of 11. Remaining two — Warje and Baner — are in final stages of acquisition. We have completed formalities and a comprehensive tender of the project will be floated soon.” However, a civic official on condition of anonymity said that PMC is yet to acquire land in Kharadi, Warje and Baner areas. On Tuesday, the civic administration tabled a proposal to give cash compensation to owners in Warje and Kharadi lands. The ₹990.26-crore project is funded by the Centre ₹841.72 crore (85%) and PMC ₹841.72 crore (15%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mulamutha-river-rejuvenation-project-pmc-yet-to-acquire-land-for-three-stps-101612362473163.html

MA Jinnah was contesting the Bombay municipal elections. While Chagla and Jinnah were at the Town Hall on the day of the polling, Mrs Jinnah drove up to them with lunch. The said lunch being “lovely ham sandwiches”. Since Jinnah obviously could not be seen in public enjoying those sandwiches, he and Chagla went to Cornaglia’s, a very famous Bombay restaurant. There they ordered two cups of coffee, a plate of pastry and a plate of pork sausages. While they were having lunch, in came an old, bearded Muslim gentleman with a young boy of ten. Tea and soft drink were ordered for them. The boy picked up one of the sausages and ate it with much relish. Chagla and Jinnah watched this uneasily. After the gentleman and the boy left, Jinnah was furious. He wanted to know why Chagla had not stopped the boy from consuming the forbidden meat. Chagla replied – “The question was: should I let Jinnah lose his election or should I let the boy go to eternal damnation? And I decided in your favour.” The eating habits of Indians have often been linked to religious prohibitions that prevent the consumption of certain foods, like, beef for Hindus or pork for Muslims. They are also linked to the spread of vegetarianism which excludes from diet almost all animal-derived foods. European, especially Italian, restaurants and cafes in the nineteenth and twentieth century India were the saviours of Europeans and Europeanised Indian elites who wanted to enjoy European fare without being bothered by taboos surrounding food. The first Italian restaurants in India, Peliti’s in Calcutta (Kolkata) and Shimla, F Cornaglia in Bombay (Mumbai) and Poona (Pune) were appreciated for their cooking and service and became milestones of the social life in these cities. Federico Peliti introduced macaroni to India. He had studied sculpture under Vincenzo Vela in Carignano and took part in the Third War of Italian Independence as a light cavalryman. In 1867, he decided to become a confectioner, a profession which was in great demand at that time. Two years later, he won a confectionary competition in Turin (it is said he baked an elaborate cake adorned with a figure of Queen Victoria and the backdrop was of a tall spire). Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India, got to know of this, hired Peliti to be his chief confectioner and brought him to India. After Lord Mayo’s assassination, Peliti opened his first restaurant in Calcutta.This was a bold step, involving serious difficulties, as luxuries such as Peliti wished to place before the public were absolutely unknown in India, and further, there were no chances of him obtaining skilled confectioners in the whole of the country. He persevered, however, practically single-handed for a couple of years, and eventually he was compelled by the increasing size of his business to obtain qualified assistants from Italy. The first batch of his recruits included Felice Cornaglia, his cousin. Born in Carignano, F Cornaglia too had trained in Turin and sophisticated “architectural cakes” with finely crafted Gothic structures were his speciality. While Peliti expanded his restaurants to Shimla and Nainital, Cornaglia worked at the restaurant in Calcutta. Around 1880, Peliti established a branch in Bombay. Finding these restaurants too difficult to manage, he eventually presented the Bombay business to Cornaglia. On December 22, 1891, a notice appeared on page 4 of The Bombay Gazette announcing that “F Cornaglia was the successor to Federico Peliti, the latter having nothing to do with the Bombay and the Poona business.” It was signed by F Cornaglia of 83 Medows Street, Fort, Bombay and 1, Main Street, Camp, Poona. It’s unclear whether F Cornaglia in Poona initially started as Peliti’s. All we know is it was the first European restaurant in Poona and was initially situated on 1, Main Street, from where it moved to East Street in 1894, and then to 6, Arsenal Road (presently Moledina Road) around 1905. Hotel Ramakrishna, opposite Westend Theatre, occupies the Victorian bungalow today, where F Cornaglia was located till it shut down in the 1940s. (Concluding part on F Cornaglia will appear next week)Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

The plea is seeking directions to the authorities to provide users with an option to opt out of sharing users’ personal data with Facebook, as mandated in the updated policy.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notices to the ministry of electronics and information technology and WhatsApp on the plea which has contended that the new policy is in violation of right to privacy of an individual.The plea has also sought formulation of guidelines, rules and regulation for safeguarding the privacy of the citizens. It has said that the “fissures in law with respect to data are quite conspicuous and a framework to regulate the same is the need of the hour”.Also read | Any ‘senior, responsible’ Facebook staff can appear before panelOn Wednesday, additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma said the Centre has sent out questionnaires to WhatsApp on various issues, seeking answers. He also said a joint parliamentary committee is looking into the matter.The PIL, filed by Seema Singh and Meghan Singh, said, “Social media in recent years has been used by billions of people around the world and millions of Indians today are dependent on Whatsapp. Therefore information which is generally personal is shared at an enormous level. This information is susceptible to being misused if the social media giant decides to either sell or exploit the information, sensitive to the users, to any third party.”Also Read | SC notice on privacy concerns to Google, WhatsApp, Amazon UPIsThis is the second petition challenging the new privacy policy.Earlier, a law student, Chaitanya Rohilla, had challenged the new privacy policy which has now been pushed to May after backlash on its terms and conditions. Earlier, WhatsApp had made it mandatory for the users to accept the new conditions by February 8.The court, while hearing Rohilla’s plea, had said that WhatsApp is a private application and it is not mandatory for people to download it if they had problems with its new policy.

04-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police announce ₹6 lakh cash reward for info on R-Day violence suspects||The Delhi Police on Wednesday announced cash rewards of ₹6 lakh for information leading to the arrest of eight suspects, including actor Deep Sidhu, allegedly involved in the violence and vandalism at the Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26.On Wednesday, the police also arrested one suspect, Dharmendra Singh Harman, a Delhi resident identified from several video clips of the clashes at the fort, a senior officer said.Police said they have identified more than 260 vehicles, including nearly 100 tractors, which were part of the rally and involved in the violence at the fort and other places in Delhi when protesters clashed with the police after breaking barriers and entering the city from Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stir“We have announced ₹1 lakh against Sidhu, Jugraj and two others because they appear to be the key conspirators. Raids have been conducted at many places in Punjab and other states, but the suspects are on the run. The family members of some of them are also untraceable,” said a senior officer.Investigators who declined to be named explained that the rewards were in two categories – ₹1 lakh and ₹50,000 – for different suspects even as teams of Delhi Police failed to locate these eight suspects despite multiple raids at locations in Delhi-NCR, Punjab and Haryana. A case was registered after the violence at Red Fort at the Kotwali police station and a special investigation team of the crime branch was handling the probe.Officers said the raids to arrest the suspects are still on.Among those who carry a reward of ₹1 lakh are Jugraj Singh from Punjab’s Tarn Taran, who has been identified as the one who hoisted a farmers’ union flag and a religious flag at Red Fort; Deep Sidhu, Gurjot Singh and Gurjant Singh.Police said that ₹50,000 reward each will be given for information leading to the arrest of four other suspects identified as Jajbir Singh, Buta Singh, Sukhdev Singh, and Iqbal Singh.All the eight men are wanted in the same case registered under sections pertaining to offences such as rioting, attempt to murder, attempt to commit culpable homicide, dacoity and criminal conspiracy, apart from vandalising the historic monument. Two cases were registered in connection with the violence and vandalism at the monument in which more than 40 police personnel were injured.The announcement has been made through separate order issued on Tuesday against each of the eight men by deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Chinmoy Biswal, who has now been transferred to the crime branch and appointed the spokesperson of the city police.Many video clips and photographs showed protesters clashing with the security personnel and hoisting the religious flag on the monument. In the videos, Sidhu was also seen among the protesters.A second police officer said that of the eight suspects, five belong to Tarn Taran from Punjab and the police have not ruled out the possibility that they “carried out the act of vandalism and violence” at the Red Fort as part of a “pre-planned conspiracy”. The other three suspects are from Haryana’s Karnal (Sukhdev Singh) and Punjab’s Muktsar (Sidhu) and Ludhiana (Iqbal Singh).Investigators said of the 260 vehicles identified so far, notices have been sent to many of their owners. Also, notices have been sent to nearly 200 people, including farm leaders, who were part of the farmers’ tractor rally. They were asked to record their statement or join the investigation “However, none of them have responded to the notices so far,” the officer added.A total of 44 cases have been registered in connection with the violence at Red Fort and other places in Delhi during the rally and an incident on January 29 when a group of persons, claiming to be locals, entered the protest site at Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police.Police said they have arrested 124 people in connection with the violent incidents that left 510 security personnel injured.On January 28, Sidhu denied the charges against him through a Facebook post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-announce-cash-rewards-for-info-on-r-day-violence-suspects-101612331690116.html

04-02-2021||World||President Biden to end US support for Saudi-led offensive in Yemen||President Joe Biden will announce an end Thursday to U.S. support for a grinding five-year Saudi-led military offensive in Yemen that has deepened humanitarian suffering in the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.The move would fulfill a campaign pledge by Biden, whose administration plans to pursue diplomacy to end the overall conflict in Yemen.Biden also is announcing the choice of Timothy Lenderking as special envoy to Yemen as soon as Thursday afternoon, when the president is due to speak at the State Department. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the selection, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement. The Gulf-based newspaper The National first reported the pick.Lenderking has been a deputy assistant secretary of state in the agency’s Middle East section. A career foreign service member, he has served in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other countries inside and out of the Middle East.Saudi Arabia began the offensive in 2015 to counter a Yemeni Houthi faction that had seized territory in Yemen and was launching cross-border missiles at Saudi Arabia.A Saudi-led air campaign since then has killed numerous civilians, and survivors display fragments showing the bombs to be American-made. The conflict has deepened hunger and poverty in Yemen, and international rights experts say both the Gulf countries and Houthis have committed severe rights abuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-to-end-us-support-for-saudi-led-offensive-in-yemen-101612458679985.html
04-02-2021||World||Biden expected to name veteran diplomat as special envoy for Yemen: Report||US President Joe Biden was expected to announce on Thursday the appointment of a veteran U.S diplomat as his special envoy for Yemen, a person familiar with the issue said, indicating a more active US role in efforts to end that country's civil war.Biden was expected to name Timothy Lenderking for the new post in a foreign policy speech, said the source on condition of anonymity. Lenderking's expected appointment was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Lenderking has extensive experience dealing with Yemen and the Gulf. He has been the deputy assistant secretary of State for Gulf affairs and served in the US Embassy in Riyadh.Yemen's civil war pits the internationally recognized government against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, including large numbers of civilians, and created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.A Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015 on the side of the government and enjoyed the backing of the former Trump administration, with the war increasingly seen as a proxy conflict between the United States and Iran.But the mounting civilian death toll and growing humanitarian calamity - the United Nations estimates that 80 percent of Yemen's 24 million people are in need - fueled bipartisan demands for an end to US support for Riyadh.Biden pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign that he would curtail US support for Saudi Arabia's military campaign in Yemen.The United Nations has been struggling to broker peace talks between the government and the Houthis, an effort that Lenderking likely would be tasked to boost.Biden's decision to name a special envoy comes as the State Department reviews a Trump administration designation last month of the Iran-aligned Houthi group as a foreign terrorist organization.The United States last week approved all transactions involving Yemen's Houthi movement for the next month as it carries out the review. But the United Nations is still hearing concerns that companies are planning to cancel or suspend business with Yemen despite the move.The United Nations and aid groups have called the designation to be reversed, warning it would push Yemen into a large-scale famine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-expected-to-name-veteran-diplomat-as-special-envoy-for-yemen-report-101612457855616.html
04-02-2021||World||Biden to visit State department as US reengages with its allies||President Joe Biden is sending a message to his messengers.Two weeks into the presidency, Biden on Thursday is visiting the State Department, the most senior of the Cabinet agencies, to underscore his promise to restore a multilateral approach to U.S. foreign policy and mark his administration's reengagement with the international community.White House press secretary Jen Psaki, formerly the State Department’s top spokesperson, said Biden’s visit “is largely focused on his desire to thank the men and women who are Foreign Service officers, civil servants, who are the heart and soul of that institution and, frankly, our government.”Psaki added that Biden would “talk broadly about foreign policy,” but said it wasn’t intended to be his first major foreign policy address as president.Still, the trip is set to come in conjunction with a number of policy announcements meant to restore the nation's place on the global stage.During Thursday's visit, officials said, Biden planned to announce that he will increase the cap on the number of refugees allowed into the United States to more than eight times the level at which President Donald Trump's administration left it.Trump drastically reduced the refugee admissions cap to only 15,000 before he left office. Biden’s plan would raise that number to 125,000, surpassing the ceiling set by President Barack Obama before he left office by 15,000.The timing of Biden's visit so early in his term is deliberate, as much symbolic as it is a nod to his interest in foreign policy and his years as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he represented Delaware.Trump had waited more than a year to visit the department, making his first appearance only for the swearing-in of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, and repeatedly assailed it as part of a “deep state” out to undermine his administration. Trump denigrated and dismissed its employees and unsuccessfully tried over multiple years to slash its budget by up to 35%.Biden, by contrast, chose longtime confidant Antony Blinken to be his secretary of state, aiming to reinvigorate an American diplomatic corps that had been depleted and demoralized under four years of the Trump administration.He will be greeted by employees eager to hear that diplomacy has returned to the top of the presidential agenda and that the expertise of long-serving foreign service officers will be valued. Although Biden’s first nominations and appointments to senior positions at State have trended heavily toward political appointees, the president and Blinken have pledged to promote career staffers.To that end, the Biden administration is set to name a longtime U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Tim Lenderking, as its special envoy in Yemen. The move comes as Biden is searching for a diplomatic end to the Saudi Arabia-led military campaign that has deepened humanitarian suffering in the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the selection, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement.Lenderking, a career foreign service member, has served in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other countries inside and out of the Middle East.The State Department visit comes after Biden moved on Wednesday to extend the last remaining treaty limiting Russian and American stockpiles of nuclear weapons, acting just two days before the pact was set to expire. It also follows days after a coup in Myanmar that has emerged as an early proving ground of Biden's approach to multilateralism.On another major foreign policy issue, Biden is weighing whether to cut off U.S. support that flourished under Trump for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. U.S. aid has been condemned by the international community and has helped contribute to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.At the State Department, Biden may also address asylum claims for residents of Hong Kong, according to one official. He indicated during his campaign that he was interested in providing protection to people persecuted by the Chinese government.Officials said Biden would not necessarily override the record low refugee cap of 15,000 that Trump set for the current budget year. Instead, the 125,000 figure would be proposed for the budget year beginning Oct. 1. The president is required by law to first consult Congress on his plans before making a determination.Advocates had said that the backlog of tens of thousands of refugees left by the Trump administration had made it unlikely Biden’s target of resettling 125,000 refugees could be reached this year. It will take time to rebuild the pipeline. More than one-third of U.S. resettlement offices were forced to close over the past four years with the drop in refugee arrivals and hundreds of workers were let go.Another issue that may be addressed Thursday is a review of vetting procedures for refugees, according to the officials and others. The Trump administration had put in place extreme background checks that had brought the program to a standstill, advocates say.The Trump administration also narrowed eligibility this year, restricting which refugees are selected for resettlement to certain categories, including people persecuted because of religion and Iraqis whose assistance to the U.S. put them in danger.Biden is expected to do away with those categories at some point and have the program return to using the long-standing referral system by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees that makes selections based on a person’s need to be resettled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-visit-state-department-as-us-reengages-with-its-allies-101612457351019.html
04-02-2021||World||US Treasury Secretary Yellen convenes US market regulators to discuss GameStop||US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will hold a meeting Thursday with top financial market regulators to discuss recent trading volatility that saw shares like GameStop soar last week.Yellen said officials will be "looking carefully at these events," although she did not commit to taking any action.The volatility was created after a social-media-fueled buying frenzy for stocks that were shorted by hedge funds, including of video game store GameStop, which surged over 400 percent before falling sharply.Yellen this week called for the meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to review the volatility."We really need to make sure that our financial markets are functioning properly, efficiently and that investors are protected," she said in her first television interview on ABC's "Good Morning America" on Thursday."We're going to discuss these recent events and discuss whether or not the recent events warrant further action."The events under review erupted when a group of small-time investors on Reddit joined forces to try to thwart hedge funds that made massive bets that the shares would fall.Instead of declining, the wave of buying boosted the share prices of struggling companies, including GameStop and movie theater brand AMC Entertainment.But the share prices fell sharply when the frenzy subsided.- Need for action? -The events led to some retail investor apps such as Robinhood -- which says its goal is to "democratize finance for all" -- to limit trading in some of the most volatile stocks last week, drawing the ire of critics.Progressive US senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren called for action against what they said were Wall Street abuses by hedge funds."We need an SEC investigation," Warren told CNN Sunday. "It's a rigged game, and it's been a set of players who come in and manipulate the market."But Yellen said "we need to understand deeply what happened before we go to action."Yellen's role, however, is limited to convening and consulting, since Treasury does not have jurisdiction over stock market activity, which is the purview of the SEC and CFTC.But she has long experience with the issues as a former chair of the Federal Reserve and member of the board for many years, as the central bank monitors all financial market activity for potential risks to the economy.Treasury also chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which monitors financial risks to coordinate better policy actionThe FSOC brings together the SEC, CFTC and other banking and housing regulators, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).Yellen had to receive a waiver from ethics lawyers at Treasury to hold the discussion about market activity, as she had received at least $700,000 in speaking fees from hedge fund Citadel, a key player in the GameStop saga, according to US media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-treasury-secretary-yellen-convenes-us-market-regulators-to-discuss-gamestop-101612456375923.html
04-02-2021||World||Britain explores mixed Covid vaccine shots as variants threaten||British researchers are to explore mixing doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines in a world first trial aimed at finding new ways to swiftly reduce coronavirus infections as new mutated variants emerge.While thousands of individual changes have arisen as the virus mutates on replication and evolves into new variants, only a tiny minority are likely to be important or change the virus in an appreciable way, according to the British Medical Journal.Among coronavirus variants currently most concerning for scientists and public health experts are the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants, which appear to spread more swiftly than others.British Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said current Covid-19 vaccines would probably still protect people against infection with the new variants, but this would need to be closely monitored."Its very unlikely that the current vaccine won't be effective on the variants ... especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalisation," Zahawi told Sky News."All manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others, are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant - there are about 4,000 variants around the world of Covid now."Ravi Gupta, a professor of microbiology at Cambridge University, said Zahawi had misspoken and was referring to individual mutations, not variants."The number of mutations has little actual relevance as many mutations emerge and disappear continuously," Gupta said. "Scientists are using ‘variants’ to describe viruses with mutations that are transmitting in the general population – there aren’t 4,000 of those."The so-called British variant, known as VUI-202012/01 or B.1.1.7., has mutations including a change in the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to bind to the human ACE2 receptor - meaning that it is probably easier to catch."We have about 50% of the world's genome sequencing industry, and we are keeping a library of all the variants so that we are ready to respond - whether in the autumn or beyond - to any challenge that the virus may present and produce the next vaccine," Zahawi said.VACCINE RACEThe Covid-19 pandemic has killed 2.268 million people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019, according to a Reuters tally.Israel is currently far ahead of the rest of the world on vaccinations per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, the United States and then Spain, Italy and Germany.Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca are combined in a two-shot schedule. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.The trial will examine the responses to an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca's, as well as vice versa, with intervals of four and 12 weeks.The trial will be the first of its kind to combine a mRNA shot - the one developed by Pfizer and BioNtech - and a adenovirus viral vector vaccine of the type developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca's shot is separately being trialled in combination with another viral vector vaccine, Russia's Sputnik V.The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of vaccine could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility, and might even increase immunity.Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said mixing different shots had proven effective in Ebola vaccine schedules, and though the new trial mixed vaccine technologies, it could also work."Ultimately, it all comes down to the same target - cells making the spike protein - just using different platforms," he told reporters."For that reason we do anticipate that we'll generate a good immune response with these combinations."Public Health England's head of immunisation, Mary Ramsay, said there was a lot of precedent for such work, as vaccines against Hepatitis A and B were interchangeable from two different manufacturers, and similar work has been undertaken for human papillomavirus (HPV).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-explores-mixed-covid-vaccine-shots-as-variants-threaten-101612453557798.html

But now people above 60 years would have to wait for some other vaccine to get protection against the coronavirus.China has said that it is currently conducting field trials for 16 vaccines, while it has so far granted conditional approval to Sinopharm, even as it began supplying the shot to a number of countries, including Pakistan.Pakistan has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for use -- China's Sinopharm vaccine, Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and the Covishield vaccine developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca.Planning Minister Asad Umar said last week that the global COVAX initiative would provide 17 million doses of the Oxford-Astra­Zeneca vaccine to Pakistan in the first half of 2021. Officials said it would be used for elderly people.COVAX, formally known as the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, is a global initiative, which aims at ensuring that middle and lower-income countries get timely access to coronavirus vaccines.Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan on Thursday reached 550,540 after 1,508 new cases emerged in the last 24 hours, according to the ministry of National Health Services.Another 31 people died in this period, taking the COVID-19 toll to 11,833 while 1,971 patients were in critical condition.The ministry said that 505,818 people have recovered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-says-china-s-sinopharm-vaccine-not-effective-for-people-over-60-years-101612451470795.html
04-02-2021||World||Iran receives its first batch of foreign coronavirus vaccine||Iran on Thursday received its first batch of foreign-made coronavirus vaccines as the country struggles to stem the worst outbreak of the pandemic in the Middle East.The shipment consists of 500,000 doses of Russian-made Sputnik V vaccines which arrived at Tehran’s Imam Khomeieni International Airport from Moscow, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.Also Iranian state TV quoted Tehran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, as saying that Iran has ordered 5 million doses from Russia. The next batches are to arrive on Feb. 18 and Feb. 28, said Jalali.Last month, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned Iran from importing the American Pfizer-BioNTech and Britain’s Astrazeneca vaccines, a reflection of mistrust toward the West.The coronavirus has so far infected over 1.4 million people in Iran and killed more than 58,000.In December, Iran began testing an Iranian-made vaccine in humans and said it expects to distribute it in spring, an extremely aggressive timeline. Before this year’s fast-tracked development of coronavirus vaccines, the usual methods of testing a vaccine for safety and efficacy with mass trials could take up to a decade.The country has also began working on a joint vaccine with Cuba. It is also planning to import some 17 million doses of vaccine from COVAX and millions from other countries. But Iran is struggling to transfer some $220 million held in South Korean banks to pay for the Covid-19 vaccines through COVAX, an international program designed to distribute coronavirus vaccines to participating countries.The government in Tehran has touted Iran’s domestic vaccine research, repeatedly alleging that tough American sanctions undermine its efforts to purchase foreign-made vaccines and launch mass inoculation campaigns like those underway in the U.S. and Europe. While U.S. sanctions do have specific carve-outs for medicine and humanitarian aid to Iran, international banks and financial institutions hesitate in dealing with Iranian transactions for fear of being fined or locked out of the American market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-receives-its-first-batch-of-foreign-coronavirus-vaccine-101612449631673.html
04-02-2021||World||Jobless claims in US decrease for third consecutive week||Applications for US state unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since the end of November, a sign that job cuts are starting to slow as Covid-19 infections ebb.Initial jobless claims in regular state programs decreased by 33,000 to 779,000 in the week ended Jan. 30, the third straight decline, Labor Department data showed Thursday. On an unadjusted basis, applications dropped to 816,247.Continuing claims -- an approximation of the number of Americans filing for multiple weeks of state benefits -- decreased to 4.59 million in the week ended Jan. 23. Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast 830,000 initial claims and 4.7 million continuing claims.The figures, while still elevated, indicate that layoffs related to the pandemic are starting to ebb after jobless claims picked up in December and early January. In the coming months, as more Americans get inoculated and virus cases fall, economic activity is poised to resume and job cuts may decline further.Stock futures ticked higher and bonds extended their recent slide as economic data and corporate earnings continued to roll in.Policy makers are starting to lift some of the most stringent business restrictions, which should also help to stabilize the labor market. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said indoor dining can reopen in New York City on Feb. 14, and California Governor Gavin Newsom lifted the state’s stay-at-home order on Jan. 25.Jobs ReportThe jobless claims data precede Friday’s monthly jobs report, which is forecast to show the labor market added about 100,000 jobs in January after a 140,000 decline in December. Data from ADP Research Institute Wednesday showed company payrolls increased by 174,000 in January.On Tuesday, Senate Democrats put President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on a fast track to passage, increasing the likelihood it eventually passes on a party-line vote. The bill text has not been drafted yet, but Biden’s proposal includes an extension of expiring federal unemployment programs through September and an increase of supplemental benefits from $300 to $400 per week.Separate data Thursday showed productivity -- or output per hour -- fell in the final three months of 2020 by the most since 1981. The decline was a result of a larger jump in hours worked than in output, as more Americans headed back to work.Other Details||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jobless-claims-in-us-decrease-for-third-consecutive-week-101612446845739.html
04-02-2021||World||Russia revives draft law to grant police access to citizens' geolocation data||Russia has revived a draft proposal allowing law enforcement to access citizens' mobile location data without a court order, according to a document seen by Reuters, a move that comes amid nationwide protests in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.Thousands of protesters have been held during recent weekend rallies and more than 1,000 people were detained in Moscow on Tuesday after a court sentenced Navalny to three and a half years for parole violations he said were trumped up to sideline him.The law, first put before parliament in 2019 and now updated by the digital development ministry, makes it easier to search for missing people, according to the draft.The ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment as to whether the return of the bill was in any way linked to the protests, and the bill itself makes no mention of them.The new draft of the law clarifies that a citizen's consent or a court order would be needed for authorities to access the content of messages or conversations but not for geolocation data, which would only be provided by the telecom operators' own equipment. The ministry said the proposal breached no privacy rules."The bill complies with legislation on personal data because geolocation coordinates are not personal data," Oleg Ivanov, deputy digital development minister, told Reuters.The ministry is yet to hear back from other domestic state institutions, a required step before the draft can be resubmitted to the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.Should the law be passed, law enforcement agencies would easily be able to trace who a particular person was with, at what time and for how long, said Artem Kozlyuk, head of Roskomsvoboda, a website monitoring internet freedom Russia."It also creates the risk of people's data being leaked on the black market," he added.

04-02-2021||World||UK regulator revokes Chinese TV licence, Beijing complains about BBC 'fake news'||Britain's media regulator on Thursday revoked a Chinese TV licence after it concluded that the Chinese Communist Party had ultimate editorial responsibility for the channel while Beijing lodged an official complaint over the BBC's Covid-19 coverage.Britain and China have been exchanging barbs for months over Beijing's crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, concerns over the security of Huawei technology and the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China’s remote Xinjiang region.After an investigation, the British regulator Ofcom concluded that China Global Television Network's (CGTN), an English language international Chinese channel, was ultimately controlled by the Communist Party."Our investigation showed that the licence for China Global Television Network is held by an entity which has no editorial control over its programmes," Ofcom said."We are unable to approve the application to transfer the licence to China Global Television Network Corporation because it is ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, which is not permitted under UK broadcasting law."Within minutes of the Ofcom statement, China said it had lodged "stern representations" to the British Broadcasting Corp over what it said was "fake news" coverage of Covid-19, and urged the broadcaster to publicly apologise.China's foreign ministry complained about coverage broadcast on Jan. 29 about the coronavirus, saying that the BBC had recently "linked the pandemic to politics" and "rehashed theories about covering up by China".It said the publicly funded BBC used a clip to say the Chinese virus prevention department had used violence to enforce the law, when it was actually a clip about an anti-terrorism exercise."China urges the BBC Beijing bureau to take China’s position seriously," the ministry said. The BBC, it said, should "stop harbouring ideological bias, stop smearing China, uphold professional ethics, and do objective, fair reporting on China."The BBC said it stood by its "accurate and fair reporting of events in China and totally rejects these unfounded accusations of fake news or ideological bias"."The BBC is the world's most trusted international broadcaster, reporting to a global audience of more than 400m people weekly without fear or favour," its statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-regulator-revokes-chinese-tv-licence-beijing-complains-about-bbc-fake-news-101612449584500.html
04-02-2021||World||Hunter Biden's announces memoir 'Beautiful Things', out in April||Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden and an ongoing target for conservatives, has a memoir coming out April 6.The book is called “Beautiful Things” and will center on the younger Biden's well publicized struggles with substance abuse, according to Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. Acquired in the fall of 2019, “Beautiful Things” was kept under wraps even as Biden's business dealings became a fixation of then-President Donald Trump and others during the election and his finances a matter of investigation by the Justice Department.“Beautiful Things” was circulated among several authors and includes advance praise from Stephen King, Dave Eggers and Anne Lamott.“In his harrowing and compulsively readable memoir, Hunter Biden proves again that anybody — even the son of a United States President — can take a ride on the pink horse down nightmare alley," King writes in his blurb. "Biden remembers it all and tells it all with a bravery that is both heartbreaking and quite gorgeous. He starts with a question: Where’s Hunter? The answer is he’s in this book, the good, the bad, and the beautiful.”In a snippet released by Gallery, Biden writes in his book, “I come from a family forged by tragedies and bound by a remarkable, unbreakable love."During one of last fall's presidential debates, Joe Biden defended his son from attacks by Trump.“My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem," the Democratic candidate said. "He’s overtaken it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it, and I’m proud of him. I’m proud of my son.”Hunter Biden, who turned 51 Thursday, is the oldest surviving child of the president, who lost his first wife and 1-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a 1972 car accident, and son Beau Biden to brain cancer in 2015. The title of Hunter's book refers to an expression he and his brother would use with each other after Beau's diagnosis, meant to emphasize what was important in life.Hunter Biden is a lawyer and former lobbyist whose work helped lead to the first impeachment of Trump. Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then U.S. vice president, was helping conduct the Obama administration’s foreign policy in that region. Trump and others have insisted that Biden was exploiting his father's name, and they raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption. The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump in 2019 after learning that he had pressured Ukraine's president to announce it was investigating the Bidens. Trump was acquitted by the Senate.Last December, Hunter Biden confirmed that the Justice Department was looking into his tax affairs, and The Associated Press subsequently reported that he had received a subpoena asking about his interaction with numerous business entities. Though Trump made clear publicly that he wanted a special counsel to handle the investigation, then-Attorney General William Barr did not appoint one. Biden has denied any wrongdoing.Financial terms for “Beautiful Things," which was written in collaboration with the author and journalist Drew Jubera, were not disclosed. Biden and his publisher likely will face criticism from Republicans for his memoir, although books by presidential family members are nothing new. During Trump's presidency, son Donald Trump Jr. released two books, “Triggered” and “Liberal Privilege.”New York publishers often take on authors with a wide range of political viewpoints, and Simon & Schuster has released books by Trump and Sean Hannity, along with such anti-Trump bestsellers as former National Security Advisor John Bolton's “The Room Where It Happened” and presidential niece Mary Trump's “Too Much and Never Enough.”The publisher signed up a book last fall by a leading Trump supporter in Washington, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, but dropped it in the wake of Hawley's support for the Jan. 6 protest that led to the violent siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who wrongly believed that the president had been reelected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunter-biden-s-announces-memoir-beautiful-things-out-in-april-101612446993572.html

China has so far approved one domestically made coronavirus vaccine for commercial use. At least four more are undergoing late-stage trials, though the vaccination drive carried out since July has been sanctioned under an emergency rule.CoronaVac has made progress in phase three clinical trials overseas, showing a good level of safety after inoculation, official news agency, Xinhua reported, quoting a company statement.“Fourteen days after the inoculation of two doses of CoronaVac, the effectiveness of the vaccine in protecting against diseases caused by Covid-19 has met the relevant technical standards laid out by the World Health Organisation and the requirements of (China’s) National Medical Products Administration,” the statement added.The NHC said on Thursday that the mainland reported 30 new Covid-19 cases for February 3, up by five cases from a day earlier.The health authorities said that 17 of the new cases were locally transmitted infections while the remaining were imported cases. Both local and national governments are advising citizens not to travel during the upcoming holidays – the most important ones in the Chinese calendar – beginning February 11.Lockdowns, restrictions on travel and mass testing appear to have prevented the latest wave of the disease from spreading throughout China, even as the country endured its worst period of Covid-19 infections since March 2020.The total number of confirmed mainland Covid-19 cases now stands at 89649; the death toll remained unchanged at 4636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gives-31-2mn-covid-shots-as-second-firm-applies-for-license-101612446968480.html

He did not elaborate but said there was no evidence to suggest it emerged from a lab.The origin of the coronavirus has become highly politicised following accusations, especially by the United States, that China was not transparent in its early handling of the outbreak. Beijing has pushed the idea that the virus originated elsewhere.Daszak was involved in research into the origins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, tracing its roots to bats living in a cave in southwest Yunnan province."Similar research needs to be done if we are going to find the true wildlife origin" of Covid-19, said Daszak, president of the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance."That sort of work to find the likely bat source is important because if you can find the sources of these lethal viruses you can reduce the contact with those animals," he told Reuters in an interview.It is unclear whether China is currently sampling its many bat caves, but viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 had previously been found in the southwest province of Yunnan.He said the team in Wuhan had been receiving new information about how the virus led to a pandemic, but did not elaborate."I'm seeing a picture coming through of some of the scenarios looking more plausible than before," he said.One scenario being scrutinised more closely by the team is the possibility that the virus could have been circulating long before it was first identified in Wuhan."That's something our group is looking at very intensely to see what level of community transmission could have been happening earlier," Daszak said."The real work we are doing here is to trace back from the first cases back to an animal reservoir, and that's a much more convoluted path, and may have happened over a number of months or even years."The investigators have visited hospitals, research facilities and the seafood market where the first outbreak was identified, although their contacts in Wuhan are limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts.Daszak said Chinese authorities had not refused any of the team's requests to visit facilities or meet with key figures."It is of course impossible to know what you are not being told, but what I am seeing in China, and what this group is seeing in China, is that what we asked for, we are being allowed to do," Daszak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bat-caves-need-exploring-in-search-for-covid-origins-who-team-member-says-101612436121204.html

04-02-2021||World||Fears raised over facial recognition use at Moscow protests||Russian authorities are deploying facial recognition cameras to identify protesters during rallies in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in Moscow, human rights groups said, warning that the technology is being used to stifle peaceful dissent.With more than 105,000 cameras, Moscow boasts one of the world's most comprehensive surveillance systems - which authorities say has helped cut crime and enforce coronavirus lockdown restrictions.Yet, since the system became fully operational last year, rights activists have noted that cameras have been used to monitor political demonstrations, with a lack of clear rules allowing for abuse of the system.Those concerns were renewed this week, after two straight weekends of nationwide protests.Alexander Karavaev, a lawyer with Moscow-based human rights group Agora, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that several of his clients were brought in for questioning on Jan. 31 after being picked out by cameras in Moscow.Among them was Mikhail Shulman, the husband of renowned political scientist Yekaterina Shulman, who was stopped at a metro station after he and his wife approached officers to inquire about transportation closures, said the lawyer."They (police) explained that the 'face control' system installed on the subway cameras had worked," he said, adding police told him the system was normally used to identify people who have committed a crime."To my arguments that the Shulmans were definitely not criminals, they could not answer anything, saying that they were just (doing their job)," the lawyer said.Authorities have said that the police's heavy-handed response to the demonstrations, which saw thousands of arrests across the country, was justified because the protests were illegal and unauthorised.Anastasiia Zlobina of Human Rights Watch, said that "while the authorities continue to deem peaceful unsanctioned protests illegal, the evolving technology at their disposal will keep facilitating the crackdown against such protests.""Using such technology to prosecute peaceful protesters at the opposition rallies violates the freedom of assembly and amounts to a discrimination based on political views," said the coordinator for Europe and Central Asia.Moscow's Department of Technology, which manages the surveillance system, said in an emailed statement it operates in strict accordance with Russian laws and referred questions on the use of cameras to law enforcement agencies.Moscow's police did not reply to a request for comment.Shulman was held for three hours and questioned about the rallies as a witness, before being released with no charges brought against him, Karavaev said.The case was not isolated, said the lawyer, adding he also represented a 21-year-old woman who was detained after being spotted by cameras at a metro station.Similar accounts have been shared on social media.Photojournalist Georgy Malets wrote on Facebook last month that he was held at another metro station after receiving a call from police warning him that he had been registered as a "political figure" for taking part in an earlier rally he attended for work.Earlier this week, TASS news agency quoted a law enforcement source saying facial recognition had been used to detect participants at a rally on Jan. 31 and detain people who took part in earlier unauthorized demonstrations ahead of the event.Privacy concernsDigital rights activists say that current regulations do not clearly define how and when police can access the cameras nor do they establish mechanisms for judicial or public oversight."Opaque" rules opened the door for possible rights violations, said Karavaev, adding that the Shulman case suggested cameras were used for purposes that went beyond tackling crime.Last year, a Moscow court ruled that the city's facial recognition system does not violate the privacy of its citizens, dismissing a lawsuit brought by activists seeking to ban the technology's use at mass events and protests.The case is now with the European Court of Human Rights."Collection and storage of protesters' unique biometric data in itself raises serious privacy concerns," said Zlobina.Navalny, 44, was arrested on Jan. 17 after returning to Moscow from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Russia last summer. He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies.On Tuesday, a Moscow court sentenced Navalny to three and a half years in jail for parole violations he said were trumped up to sideline him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fears-raised-over-facial-recognition-use-at-moscow-protests-101612443180772.html
04-02-2021||World||Red Cross to help 500 million get Covid shots||The Red Cross launched a plan Thursday to help vaccinate 500 million people against Covid-19 in over 100 countries, warning that leaving out the world's poorest could seriously backfire.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it would throw its weight into the distribution and acceptance of vaccines among some of the hardest-to-reach communities.The Geneva-based IFRC said it would spend 100 million Swiss francs ($111 million, 92.5 million euros) on the push and was already working with governments in more than 60 countries to see where its help could be the most effective."The current lack of equity in the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is alarming and could backfire to deadly and devastating effect," IFRC secretary general Jagan Chapagain told reporters.He said nearly 70 percent of vaccine doses administered so far had been in the world's 50 richest countries while only 0.1 percent had been deployed in the poorest 50."It could prolong or even worsen this terrible pandemic," Chapagain said, noting that if the virus continued to circulate and mutate in large areas of the globe, even those who have been vaccinated in wealthier countries would not be safe.He called for richer countries to share vaccines once they had immunised their most vulnerable populations.Otherwise, "the emergence of variants in far-away low-income countries will shatter the illusion of safety in wealthier countries," said Chapagain.Also read| Canada: Hong Kong graduates can apply for work permits, slams China on rightsThe IFRC, which calls itself the world's largest humanitarian network, said it will bolster national vaccination efforts, including supporting logistics and countering misinformation about vaccine efficacy.IFRC health director Emanuele Capobianco it was already supporting vaccination campaigns in Austria, Brazil, Morocco and Kuwait, among other countries.It is also aiming to reach refugees and undocumented migrants.On Wednesday, the Covax programme to ensure equitable worldwide access to Covid-19 vaccines published its first distribution list.Some 145 countries are set to receive an initial 337.2 million doses -- enough to immunise 3.3 percent of their collective population by mid-2021, with first deliveries expected in late February.For many poorer countries, the scheme will be their only way of accessing vaccines."The equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines between and within countries is more than a moral imperative: it is the only way to solve the most pressing public health emergency of our time," said Chapagain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/red-cross-to-help-500-million-get-covid-shots-101612441230757.html

About 300,000 Canadian passport holders live in the city.Under the new visa rules, unveiled last November, any Hong Kong resident who has graduated from a Canadian university in the past five years can apply to work for up to three years. Those with equivalent foreign credentials are also eligible.Visa recipients will also be offered a way to transition more easily to permanent residency."Canada continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Hong Kong, and is deeply concerned about the new National Security Law and the deteriorating human rights situation there," the government said in a statement.Also read| Myanmar's military coup: What led to Aung San Suu Kyi’s detention?After China imposed the law, Ottawa moved quickly to suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and banned the export of sensitive military items.Hong Kong residents currently in Canada temporarily, including visitors, students and workers, can apply online for the visas. Eligible spouses or common-law partners, as well as dependent children, can also apply for a study or work permit.The measures apply to residents who hold a Hong Kong special administrative region or a British National Overseas passport, created under British law in 1987 that specifically relates to Hong Kong.

04-02-2021||World||WHO: Discussions open, meetings frank in Wuhan||World Health Organization investigators looking for clues into the origin of the coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan said that the Chinese side has provided a high level of cooperation, but cautioned against expecting immediate results from the visit.“I keep saying that we need to be realistic, a short mission like this one will not have all the answers but it helps advance the understanding of the #virusorigin #wuhan," Hung Nguyen-Viet, co-leader of the Animal and Human Health Program of the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, said in a tweet Thursday.In an earlier tweet, zoologist and team member Peter Daszak praised Wednesday’s meetings with staff at the key Wuhan Institute of Virology, including with Deputy Director is Shi Zhengli, a virologist who worked with Daszak to track down the origins of SARS that originated in China and led to the 2003 outbreak.“Extremely important meeting today with staff at WIV including Dr Shi Zhengli. Frank, open discussion. Key questions asked & answered.,” Daszak tweeted.The team on Thursday spent around two hours meetings with managers and residents at the Jiangxinyuan community administrative center in Wuhan's Hanyang District. No details were given.Official statistics shows that there were at least 16 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the community last year among nearly 10,000 people living there when the virus broke out.Also read| USS Nimitz to be back in Indo-Pacific, holds a message for China on TaiwanEarlier, Daszak tweeted images of media outside the virology institute, saying: “Thanking the press for their patience and interest in getting this news out to the world. The work is moving ahead & we look forward to being able to talk about the results as soon as possible."The Wuhan Institute of Virology has collected extensive virus samples, leading to unproven allegations that it may have caused the original outbreak by leaking the virus into the surrounding community. China has strongly denied that possibility and has promoted unproven theories that the virus may have originated elsewhere.Along with the institute, the WHO team that includes experts from 10 nations has visited hospitals, research institutes, a traditional market tied to the outbreak and other sites.Members of the team have met with institute researchers and management, experts, vendors, residents and media representatives, the spokesperson for China's National Health Commission, Mi Feng, told reporters at a briefing Thursday.It is likely to take years and multiple investigations in many parts of the globe to confirm the origins of the virus because of the exhaustive research, including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies required to pin down an outbreak’s animal reservoir. One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan but that has yet to be proven.The first clusters of Covid-19 were detected in Wuhan in late 2019, prompting the government to put the city of 11 million under a strict 76-day lockdown. China has since reported more than 89,000 cases and 4,600 deaths — the bulk of them in Wuhan — with new cases largely concentrated in its northeast and local lockdowns and travel restrictions being imposed to contain the outbreaks.New cases of local transmission fell to just 17 on Thursday as Chinese heed government calls to skip family visits and stay put during the Lunar New Year holiday later this month.China has also pushed ahead with a plan to vaccinate 50 million people for Covid-19 by the middle of this month. As of Wednesday, more than 31 million doses had been administered, Mi told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-discussions-open-meetings-frank-in-wuhan-101612433913576.html

04-02-2021||World||World food price index rises in January, at highest level since July 2014: FAO||World food prices rose for an eighth consecutive month in January, hitting their highest level since July 2014, led by jumps in cereals, sugar and vegetable oils, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 113.3 points last month versus an upwardly revised 108.6 in December.The December figure was previously given as 107.5.The Rome-based FAO also said in a statement that worldwide cereal harvests remained on course to hit an annual record in 2020, but warned of a sharp fall in stocks and signalled unexpectedly large import demands from China.FAO's cereal price index climbed 7.1% month-on-month in January, led higher by international maize prices, which soared 11.2%, some 42.3% above their level a year ago, buoyed in part by purchases by China and lower-than-expected U.S. production.Wheat prices increased 6.8%, driven by strong global demand and expectations of reduced sales by Russia when its wheat export duty doubles in March 2021, FAO said.Sugar prices jumped 8.1%, with worries about worsening crop prospects in the European Union, Russia and Thailand, and dry weather conditions in South America, pushing up import demand.The vegetable oil price index increased 5.8% to reach its highest level since May 2012, pushed up in part by lower-than-expected palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia due in part to heavy rainfall. A rise in soyoil prices was fuelled by reduced export opportunities and prolonged strikes in Argentina.Dairy prices rose 1.6%, underpinned by heavy Chinese purchases ahead of the upcoming New Year holiday.The meat index posted a 1.0% gain, led by brisk imports of poultry, especially from Brazil, amid avian influenza outbreaks that have hampered exports from several European countries.FAO revised up its forecast for the 2020 cereal season to 2.744 billion tonnes from a previous estimate of 2.742 billion tonnes made in December, with both wheat and rice yields seen rising. The forecast for coarse grains production was trimmed because of reduced prospects for the United States and Ukraine."Looking ahead to 2021 cereal output, early production prospects for winter wheat crops in the northern hemisphere indicate a modest increase this year," FAO said.The U.N. agency said China was importing unexpectedly large quantities of maize this season, which was having a significant knock-on impact on estimates for world utilisation and stocks.The forecast for world cereal utilisation in 2020/21 was put at 2.761 billion tonnes against a previous estimate of 2.744 billion, while the forecast for world cereal stocks was pegged at 802 million tonnes down from a previous 866.4 million tonnes."At this level, the world stocks-to-use ratio of cereals would decline from 29.7 percent in 2019/20 to 28.3 percent in 2020/21, marking a seven-year low," FAO said.It said the contraction stemmed largely from "a massive downward adjustment" to maize inventories in China.The FAO forecast for world cereal trade in 2020/21 was hiked by 10.6 million tonnes to 465.2 million tonnes -- a projected 5.7% rise on the previous season's record high. Trade in all major cereals was expected to climb, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-price-index-rises-in-january-at-highest-level-since-july-2014-fao-101612431285082.html

It would be the first official visit by an Israeli prime minister. But those plans have been repeatedly postponed.Earlier this week, Israeli media reported that Netanyahu was cutting his planned visit to the Gulf from three days to just three hours because of the pandemic.Netanyahu's office said in a statement Thursday that “despite the importance of the trip to Abu Dhabi and Bahrain, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to postpone the visit at this stage because of the closed skies."Israel closed its airport to virtually all air traffic last month in a bid to halt the arrival of new variants of the coronavirus and stop the spread of the pandemic during the country's third nationwide lockdown.Israel has recorded over 671,000 cases of the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic and 4,947 deaths, according to Health Ministry figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-netanyahu-postpones-planned-visits-to-uae-bahrain-101612428369876.html

The U.S. has previously accused China of committing genocide.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Thursday that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has already been invited to visit Xinjiang “and the two sides have been in contact with each other.” China says it’s fighting separatism and religious extremism among Uighurs, and denies wrongdoing.“We welcome the foreign nationals with an unbiased view to visit Xinjiang to see with their own eyes a real Xinjiang,” he added. “In the meantime, we oppose the interference in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights and oppose the presumption of guilt or any investigation based on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-asks-for-un-probe-into-new-china-uighur-abuse-claims-101612432018044.html

This is another great step forward for British science, expertise and innovation, backed by government funding -- and I look forward to seeing what it produces,” he said.The 13-month study will monitor the impact of the different dosing regimens on patients’ immune responses, which have the potential to be higher or lower than from the same dose regimen. Initial findings are expected to be released later in the year.“Given the inevitable challenges of immunising large numbers of the population against Covid-19 and potential global supply constraints, there are definite advantages to having data that could support a more flexible immunisation programme, if needed and if approved by the medicines regulator,” said Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Senior Responsible Officer for the study.Also read| Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developers claim it reduces Covid-19 transmission“It is also even possible that by combining vaccines, the immune response could be enhanced giving even higher antibody levels that last longer; unless this is evaluated in a clinical trial we just won’t know. This study will give us greater insight into how we can use vaccines to stay on top of this nasty disease,” he said.The study has received ethics approval from the Research Ethics Committee, as well as approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Over 800 patients are expected to take part in the study, referred to as the Covid-19 Heterologous Prime Boost study or ‘Com-Cov’, across eight different sites across England -- including in London, Birmingham and Liverpool.“If we do show that these vaccines can be used interchangeably in the same schedule this will greatly increase the flexibility of vaccine delivery, and could provide clues as to how to increase the breadth of protection against new virus strains,” said Chief Investigator Matthew Snape, Associate Professor in Paediatrics and Vaccinology at the University of Oxford.Should the study show promising results, then the UK government says it could consider reviewing the vaccine regimen approach if needed, once proven to be safe and recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)."We need people from all backgrounds to take part in this trial, so that we can ensure we have vaccine options suitable for all. Signing up to volunteer for vaccine studies is quick and easy via the NHS Vaccine Research Registry,” said Professor Andrew Ustianowski, National Clinical Lead for the NIHR Covid Vaccine Research Programme.Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said a same-dose regimen is currently implemented for the UK-wide Covid-19 vaccination programme, and there are no current plans for this to change.Anyone who has received either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccination as part of the UK-wide delivery plan will not be affected by this study. They will receive their second dose from the same source and over the same 12-week interval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-begins-world-first-alternate-dosing-covid-19-vaccine-trial-101612431145947.html

04-02-2021||World||After India, Turkey rejects global criticism in domestic matters||Turkey on Thursday rejected international criticism of its crackdown on protests by students opposing the appointment of a government loyalist to head Istanbul’s top university, warning countries to stay out of its domestic issues.For weeks, students and faculty members of Bogazici University have been protesting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Jan. 1 appointment of Melih Bulu, an academic who once ran for parliament as a candidate for Erdogan’s party. They are calling for Bulu’s resignation as the university’s rector and for the university to be allowed to elect its own president.Some of the protests have erupted into clashes between police and demonstrators and hundreds of people have been detained, some taken away following raids of their homes, even as Erdogan has promised reforms to strengthen democratic standards.Officials from the United States, the United Nations and the European Union have criticized Turkey’s handling of the protests as well as a series of anti-LGBT comments that were made by Erdogan and other officials while denouncing the demonstrations.On Thursday, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement defending the Turkish security forces’ actions, saying there were attempts by terrorist organizations to infiltrate and provoke the protests.Also read| Michigan Republican Peter Meijer defends impeachment vote to upset voters“We recommend that those who ... attempt to give our country lessons in democracy and law, turn the mirror on themselves,” the ministry said. “No one has the right to attempt to intervene in Turkey’s affairs.”Tensions flared this week after a group of students were arrested over a poster, which was displayed at Bogazici University, that depicted Islam’s most sacred site with LGBT rights flags. The students were arrested over the weekend on charges of inciting hatred and insulting religious values.“We are concerned by detentions of students and other demonstrators and strongly condemn the anti-LGBTQI rhetoric surrounding the demonstrations,” said U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Wednesday.The U.N. Human Rights office urged Turkey on Twitter to stop the use of excessive force on the protesters and condemned “homophobic and transphobic comments by officials, inciting hatred and discrimination against LGBT people.”European Parliament legislator Nacho Sanchez Amor also expressed concerns over the police violence and mass detentions and asked: “does this reflect the new positive agenda and the will of reforms?”The Interior Ministry announced Thursday that police detained a total of 528 people over the protests, of whom 498 have since been released. Of those in custody, at least 22 people have links to terrorist organizations, said ministry spokesman Ismail Catakli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-india-turkey-rejects-global-criticism-in-domestic-matters-101612429564564.html

04-02-2021||World||US mulls using law designed to prosecute Mafia against Capitol rioters||The US Justice Department is considering whether to charge members of far-right groups involved in the deadly Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol under a federal law usually used against organized crime, according to two law enforcement sources.The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, enables prosecutors to combat certain ongoing racketeering crimes such as murder, kidnapping, bribery and money laundering. The 1970 statute provides for hefty criminal penalties including up to 20 years in prison and seizure of assets obtained illegally through a criminal enterprise.The sources, a current law enforcement official and a former official who recently left the federal government, said using the RICO statute to charge people involved in the Capitol violence is being debated within the Justice Department, with no final decision made. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.The siege by supporters of former President Donald Trump left five dead including a police officer. It is not yet clear if cases arising from it meet "statutory elements" necessary for a RICO charge, the former federal official said."This is something that is being mulled over in the halls of DOJ," the official added, using the department's initials.President Joe Biden's administration has warned that domestic extremism is a growing threat following the Capitol rampage, a sharp departure from the way Trump regarded extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. In a September pre-election debate with Biden, Trump told the Proud Boys to "stand back and stand by."Justice Department spokeswoman Kristina Mastropasqua declined to comment about the potential use of the RICO statute beyond pointing to prior statements by the senior federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, that he would charge people based on what the evidence showed.Sherwin has said a wide range of criminal charges are being contemplated, including trespassing, assault and seditious conspiracy.The RICO law was crafted to help prosecutors convict top Mafia leaders who ordered others to commit crimes. RICO cases are complex, often take years to develop, and require approval from Justice Department leadership."RICO was designed to address the Godfather - the person who doesn't get their hands bloody," said Jeffrey Grell, an attorney who specializes in RICO law. "You would really only use RICO to go after the kingpins or the leaders."Prosecutors have used it against other violent groups, such as one led by Omar Abdel Rahman, known as the "Blind Sheikh," who was convicted of plotting to bomb the United Nations and George Washington Bridge in New York.More than 170 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack that interrupted the formal congressional certification of Biden's election victory over Trump and sent lawmakers into hiding for their own safety.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, tapped to become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is advocating possible RICO charges. A Durbin spokesperson said, "There are multiple statutes currently available for federal prosecutors to use to hold the perpetrators behind the Jan. 6 attack accountable, including RICO, and prosecutors should appropriately evaluate potential charges."'Racketeering activity'Obstructing an official government proceeding, the charge some Oath Keepers and Proud Boy members are currently facing, is considered a "racketeering activity."Prosecutors in a RICO case would need to show that the far-right groups qualify as a "criminal enterprise" and that members of the enterprise engaged in a pattern of two or more related crimes beyond the Capitol riots.That could mean looking at whether these groups engaged in similar actions at other events, such as the violent 2017 "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, or other violent activities such as storming state capitols."Whatever theory they're pursuing requires looking at the group and kind of zooming out so they can capture a pattern of racketeering activity more than just what happened on that day," said Kamal Ghali, an Atlanta attorney and former federal prosecutor.In a RICO case, prosecutors must show a pattern of related racketeering crimes and a threat of continuing criminal conduct.A Washington grand jury last month indicted three Oath Keepers members on charges that they conspired to forcibly storm the Capitol. Two Proud Boys members were indicted on charges they conspired with others to obstruct law enforcement from protecting the Capitol.In a sworn statement, an FBI agent said Thomas Caldwell, a defendant in the Oath Keepers indictment, sent messages after the attack urging others to keep fighting."We need to do this at the local level," Caldwell was quoted by the FBI as saying. "Lets storm the capitol in Ohio. Tell me when!"Federal prosecutors in Ohio convinced a judge to detain Caldwell's co-defendant Donovan Crowl by citing recent writings by the group's leader Elmer Stewart Rhodes. After the riots, Rhodes urged members to begin organizing in "friendly red" counties - jurisdictions that lean Republican - saying the Biden administration represents an "illegitimate regime."The three Oath Keepers have not yet entered pleas, though Caldwell has previously said in court that "every single charge is false." Rhodes did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mulls-using-law-designed-to-prosecute-mafia-against-capitol-rioters-101612428944773.html
04-02-2021||World||Super-rich and punctual Switzerland is also behind on Covid-19 vaccines||Being famously wealthy, a model for efficiency and punctuality and having a big pharmaceuticals industry is no guarantee of success when it comes to the coronavirus vaccination drive.The European Union’s procurement saga has dominated headlines, but neighbouring Switzerland is facing a similar predicament. With shops, theaters and restaurants closed and a public desperate for respite, authorities in the capital of Bern weren’t offering Covid-19 immunization appointments at the weekend. There simply wasn’t enough vaccine.The Swiss often refer to their country as a “Musterschüler,” or “model student” because of its ability to get things done in time. On Wednesday, the government announced it had ordered more batches, including from two new suppliers. Yet like the EU, a bloc it never joined in order to maintain in control over all its affairs, Switzerland is suffering from acting too late. About 3.7% of the population has been inoculated, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker. That’s marginally more than the average for the 27-member EU, though a fraction of the U.K. on 15%. It’s also less than continental frontrunner Serbia, a country beyond the EU with a gross domestic product per capita that’s less than 10% of Switzerland’s.Also read| UN climate chief urges world 'in a tough spot' to keep fighting warming“The government’s vaccination plan has failed,” said Marco Chiesa, head of the Swiss People’s Party, the nationalist group that has the most seats in parliament’s lower house. “We’re not used to such unreliability.”Officials say delivery shortfalls are due to be recouped in March. Interior Minister Alain Berset, whose department oversees vaccine procurement, said on Feb. 1 the country may miss its target of inoculating over 75s by the end of the month. All adults, though, would be vaccinated by the end of June, he said.Frustration with the slow rollout escalated when ministers were secretly immunized while senior citizens have to wait. “The government is putting its credibility on the line,” newspaper Tages-Anzeiger wrote on Jan. 15. Government advisers reckon delays to vaccines cost as much as 110 million francs ($122 million) for each day the economy can’t operate normally. The issue might simply be that Switzerland isn’t set up for the swift decision-making that the vaccine procurement needed. It also eschews state involvement in commercial business. Business lobby Economiessuisse on Wednesday called for a national crisis response group that reports directly to the government and is able to act quickly.Despite healthcare spending second only to the U.S. and having two of Europe’s biggest drugmakers, the country that hosts the World Health Organization didn’t provide funds for vaccine development.“The EU supported the financing of production facilities and we didn’t do that,” said Andreas Faller, a former health ministry official who now works as a consultant. “And in relation to the size of our population, we are the biggest Pharma producer in the world.”Also read| Covid-19: When lawmakers turned lawbreakersThe Health Ministry’s initial purchases from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc. covered only 75% of the population, though it since has more than doubled the Moderna order and announced deals with CureVac N.V. and Novavax Inc. this week.The Moderna contract was announced in August, but the Swiss didn’t agree to take Astra’s shot until mid-October, in a deal that piggy backed on the EU agreement that’s caused so much controversy in recent weeks. Switzerland also is now requiring more data before it can follow the UK and EU in approving the vaccine for use.Pfizer’s delivery delays, meanwhile, have forced officials in the cantons of Zurich and Zug to postpone appointments, and the campaign has additionally been marred by faulty statistics on how many vaccines had been administered and a tussle between federal and local officials over allocation.Anne Levy, director-general of the Federal Office of Public Health, said on Feb. 2 that Switzerland just faces the same problems as the rest of the world. “We were very successful in the choosing and procurement of vaccines,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/superrich-and-punctual-switzerland-is-also-behind-on-covid-19-vaccines-101612418493745.html
04-02-2021||World||Michigan Republican Peter Meijer defends impeachment vote to upset voters||Michigan Rep. Peter Meijer, one of just 10 Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump over the deadly attack on the Capitol, defended his decision while taking pointed criticism from voters Wednesday night.“What we witnessed at the Capitol — the attempted insurrection, the involvement of a sitting American president propagating the falsehoods that led up to that — required a significant response,” he said during his first town hall, a virtual event that 400-plus people watched on Zoom or Facebook. The freshman lawmaker spoke from his office in Washington, D.C.Two constituents who asked questions said they were deeply disappointed with Meijer, a 33-year-old Iraq War veteran who represents the 3rd District in western Michigan.“Why aren't you doing what your constituents wanted you to do?” said Cindy Witke. “I went against people who said not to vote for you because I believed in you. I've lost that belief.”Nancy Eardley accused Meijer, the only first-term legislator to back impeachment on Jan. 13, of betraying the district within two weeks of taking office.“I don't know that there's really much you can say that will ever change my mind and not work toward primarying you out after two years,” she said, claiming no court looked at evidence of election fraud.There was not widespread fraud, as was confirmed by a range of voting officials and by former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee.Meijer said Trump told “two fundamental lies” after losing to Democrat Joe Biden — falsely stating that the election had been stolen and that Jan. 6, the day Congress counted electoral votes, was a chance to “stop the steal.” Trump, who had exhorted his supporters to “fight like hell” shortly before they swarmed the Capitol, took close to 2 1/2 hours to issue a video urging them to go home despite the riot having turned deadly, Meijer said.“This was a moment when we needed leadership and the president, in my view, did not show that,” he said.One participant, Kim Reeder, thanked Meijer for his vote.“I didn't vote for you, but right now I'm sure glad you're my representative," she said.Trump is the first president in American history to be impeached twice. His Senate trial will start next week.Impeachment took up half of the hourlong forum. Other questioners asked about the next federal COVID-19 relief plan, student debt forgiveness, gun rights and the role of pharmacy benefit managers in drug costs.At least one Republican has already vowed to challenge Meijer in the 2022 primary: Tom Norton, who finished third to Meijer in a five-way primary last year.Meijer in November won the open, longtime GOP-held seat by nearly 6 percentage points over a Democrat, a larger margin than Trump’s 3-point victory there.Meijer acknowledged that a majority of Republicans in his district, "maybe a strong majority," are upset with his impeachment decision.“That weighed on me.

04-02-2021||World||Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developers claim it reduces Covid-19 transmission||As per a report by developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine on Sunday, claimed that it can reduce the transmission of Covid-19 virus, reported The Washington Post.In a preprint of an article under review at the Lancet medical journal, the Oxford University vaccine developers report that was based on follow-up studies of their clinical trials found the vaccine safe and effective, there is also "the potential for the vaccine to reduce transmission of the virus".Many vaccines developed against the virus have produced evidence that they are effective at reducing the number of people who experience symptoms or suffer severe illness or die, but much less is known about whether any of the available vaccines can prevent asymptomatic infections that can pass from one person to another.The study of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developers found that after people received two doses of the vaccine, they were 54% less likely to have an infection confirmed by a nasal swab, regardless of whether they had symptoms, reported The Washington Post.In addition, the researchers also said that a single dose of the vaccine was 76% effective against symptomatic virus infection, for up to three months - reducing the need for social distancing and allowing a return to a more normal life.Independent scientists who were not involved in the Oxford study called the data intriguing but incomplete. They warned that results were preliminary, that the sample size was too small to make bold claims, and that there could be alternative explanations for the findings, such as that the group receiving a single dose included more women, younger people and health workers, reported The Washington Post.Meanwhile, British officials on Wednesday hailed the report on the homegrown vaccine. They promoted the findings as a vindication for their controversial decision to delay second doses -- from four weeks to 12 weeks -- while trying to get first shots to as many people as possible.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the research results were "absolutely superb."Pfizer-BioNTech scientists have warned that they do not have evidence to support the British dosing strategy for their vaccine, also in wide use in Britain.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the report by the Oxford researchers seemed to support the idea that the efficacy of the vaccine was improved by having a long stretch between first and second doses."Taking all this evidence together, the 12-week gap between first and second dose is clearly the better strategy, as more people can be protected more quickly and the ultimate protective effect is greater," Hunter said.Andrew Pollard, the chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said the results support the British government's decision to give one dose followed by a second booster shot 12 weeks later. Pollard called it "an optimal approach" that "reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose of the vaccine."Natalie Dean, a biostatistics expert at the University of Florida, said "If you think about the way that vaccines work, they can work in two major ways: one is by preventing infection entirely and the other by taking someone who is infected and preventing them from getting symptoms."Oxford is eager to further establish the credibility of its vaccine, after inconsistent dosing in its clinical trials muddied assessments of its effectiveness and a lack of data on the efficacy in people 65 and older have given some public health officials pause, reported The Washington Post.Britain has one of the highest per capita coronavirus death tolls in the world. More than 108,000 people have died after being diagnosed with the virus, with a more contagious variant propelling the latest wave, reported The Washington Post.The vaccine manufacturers have said that their formulas are effective against the variant.The European Union's regulator of medicines has authorized the vaccine for use in all adults, but officials in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden and Belgium have cautioned against using it in older populations. Switzerland on Wednesday rejected the vaccine, saying it wanted to see more data. The United States, too, is waiting for more clinical trial data before an authorization decision, reported The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxfordastrazeneca-vaccine-developers-claim-it-reduces-covid-19-transmission-101612427160683.html

McCain (DDG 56) conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit Feb 4 (local time) in accordance with international law,” Lt Joe Keiley, the 7th Fleet spokesperson, said in a statement.“The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,” Keiley said.The warship is forward-deployed to the US 7th Fleet area of operations in support of security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, the US Navy said.Taiwan’s defence ministry confirmed the passage without identifying the vessel.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China was “closely monitoring” the situation. Wang said China would “…continue to be on high alert at all times, respond to all threats and provocations at any moment, and will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity”.It is hoped that the United States will play a constructive role for regional peace and stability, not the other way around, he added.Beijing views any ships passing through the strait, off its southern coast, as a breach of its sovereignty; the US and many other nations view the route as international waters open to all.The development happened a day after the Pentagon announced that the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was “…departing the Central Command area of responsibility and moving into the US Indo-Pacific region”.“It is now in the 7th Fleet area of responsibility and can be called upon for operations, training, or humanitarian exercises there,” the Pentagon added.Taiwan has been a major point of dispute between the two countries.China claims the democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory and has repeatedly expressed anger as Washington stepped-up support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait.On December 31, two US warships including the same guided missile destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, drawing protest from Beijing.It was the second such mission in the last month of 2020 and came almost two weeks after a Chinese aircraft carrier group used the same waterway.China’s defence ministry had criticised the trip as “provocation” and “a show of force”, adding Chinese ships and aircraft trailed the US ships.The latest passage of the US warship comes two days after China’s top diplomat called for Beijing and Washington to put relations back on a predictable and constructive path, saying the US should stop meddling in China’s internal affairs, like Hong Kong and Tibet.“The United States should stop interfering in Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang and other issues regarding China’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” Reuters news agency quoted Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China, as saying.Yang was the highest-ranking Chinese leader to speak on China-US relations since President Joe Biden took office.Yang added China never meddles with US internal affairs, including its elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warship-sails-by-sensitive-taiwan-strait-as-us-navy-deploys-carrier-to-indopacific-101612426622649.html

Around a quarter of the population inside Syria is displaced, many in camps.The GAVI alliance, the group that co-leads COVAX with the WHO, said last week it aimed to deliver 2.3 billion vaccines worldwide by the end of 2021, including 1.8 billion free doses to lower-income countries."I am really hopeful it will (begin) in April but it might take even longer depending on so many factors," Magtymova told Reuters in a phone interview from Damascus, of the plan to roll out the vaccine programme in Syria."We have to juggle with so many unknowns."Also read| Why Israel can't celebrate its vaccine success yetLike other countries that are awaiting vaccines through COVAX, Syria can also obtain supplies directly from companies. But so far it has yet to announce any such bilateral agreements. Health officials say Damascus has been engaged in talks with Russia and China over vaccine supplies.Apart from the logistics of arranging vaccinations across combat frontlines, Syria faces the additional hurdle of international financial sanctions.Medicines are generally exempt from sanctions, but UN sources said the sanctions have left Damascus without much financial clout to negotiate deliveries, and have slowed the process by creating additional legal risks.Magtymova said any supplies of safe and effective vaccines Syria could obtain would help make vaccines more available. The WHO has no role in such bilateral deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-preparing-to-deliver-vaccines-across-syria-from-april-despite-conflict-101612423357147.html

More than 20 remained in a hospital, complaining of breathing difficulties, eye and skin irritation and other illnesses.Hundreds of residents near the ice plant fled to safety after smelling the pungent fumes Wednesday but started to return when the leak eased hours later, officials said.Tiangco said investigators were trying to determine if ammonia leaked from a pipe or was set off after a half-filled tank exploded. He apologized to the victims, saying the company, which is partly owned by his mother, would shoulder all medical and burial expenses.The plant has been ordered closed and won't reopen until it puts in place additional safeguards. Safety checks in other ice plants and cold storage warehouses in Navotas, one of Asia’s largest fish ports, will be taken to avoid a repeat of the accident, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippine-ice-plant-ammonia-leak-leaves-2-dead-90-sickened-101612424595763.html
04-02-2021||World||Crime, conflict, chaos crushing Afghan hopes for tomorrow||Every morning when Khan Wali Kamran left for work, he was afraid his children might be killed in Kabul’s streets before he got home in the evening. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore, and a month ago he sent his four children to live with his parents in his home village.He’s not the only one afraid. Afghanistan is supposed to be moving toward peace after decades of war, but to the people of the capital Kabul, turmoil only seems to be getting worse.Frequent bombings have everyone on edge. It’s not just dramatic attacks like one that killed dozens at a university last year. There’s also been a string of targeted killings, like the bomb planted on the car of a prominent cleric that detonated Tuesday in the middle of busy morning traffic, killing him and his driver — one of four such bombings that day.The tensions are increased because it's not clear who is behind the attacks. Some are claimed by the Islamic State group or the Taliban. But many go unclaimed, raising suspicions that militias run by prominent warlords both allied with and opposed to the government are creating chaos.Also read| Taliban on diplomatic blitz after Afghan peace talks stallThen there’s the surge in crime. Armed robbers brazenly rob shops or even mug people in broad daylight in public parks crowded with people, stripping them of money and phones at gunpoint. Cars stuck in traffic can be ransacked by thieves.In one case, organized thieves robbed three branches of the same supermarket in different parts of the capital at almost the same time on the same day. Kidnappers are known to snatch children and adult men from the streets, demanding ransoms from their families, anywhere from $50 to $5,000. Residents of Kabul have stopped going out after dark.“We are afraid when we get in our car, go to the office, when we are near our home, in the mosque,” Kamran said. “Life has become hell.”Fear so dominates Kamran’s world that he asked that The Associated Press not identify the village where he sent his four children, including his youngest, a 2-year-old son. Others who spoke to AP asked to be identified only by one name, afraid of drawing the attention of criminals or armed factions.Last year, hope was high that a peace deal reached by the Taliban and US government would lead to an end to more than four decades of relentless war and finally bring peace to Afghanistan. But subsequent talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government have been excruciatingly slow.Also read| US, NATO allies slam Taliban for destroying vital infrastructure in AfghanistanMany Afghans fear that the deteriorating security is a sign that, rather than peace, what is coming is yet another phase in the war, reminiscent of the chaos of the 1990s when warlords’ armed factions battled for power. That fighting came after the Soviets withdrew and before the Taliban took power. Now the Americans, who helped oust the Taliban nearly 20 years ago, are pulling out, their numbers down to 2,500 troops after former President Donald Trump accelerated the withdrawal.Analysts say there are participants on both sides of the conflict who have more to gain from war than peace.“The war is about power, not even about religion,” said Torek Farhadi, a former Afghan government adviser. “Some of the killings are by the Taliban, some by circles in Kabul who stand to lose wealth, power and status should peace come to Afghanistan.”Ferdaws Faramarz, Kabul police spokesman, accused the Taliban of carrying out attacks in order to “create a gap between the people and government.”Afghans say the deep corruption that permeates the government and security agencies has crippled their capacity and made them incapable of keeping Afghans safe.Despite the billions of dollars spent in Afghanistan since the 2001 ouster of the Taliban, more than 72% of the country’s 32 million people live below the poverty level, which is a daily wage of less than $1.90.Also read| US wants India to resolve farm protest through dialogueLawlessness has accelerated in the past few years as gangs and militias grow bolder and poverty worsens. Local TV reported recently that in the past 100 days, more than 177 people in Kabul were killed and 360 wounded in suicide attacks, bomb blasts and crimes, a figure police officials confirmed to the AP was accurate.Malik, 22, runs a small barbershop in Kabul’s posh Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood, where diplomats and powerful government officials live. He used to stay open until 10 p.m., but now he shuts down by 7 most nights, ever since he was robbed last year.The thieves were heavily armed and showed no fear. While two waited outside, two others entered his shop, demanded the cash and walked out with 30,000 Afghanis, the equivalent of $380, as well as two mobile phones.“We were in shock,” Malik said, asking to be identified by just one name. He waited for months for police to do something, but no one was arrested and the stolen goods never recovered.“They just told us we should be careful,” Malik said.Amir, another Kabul resident, said that when he goes to the mosque for prayers, he leaves his money and phone at home. “I know there are robbers everywhere when I step outside my door.”Also read| US, Australia discuss China and Myanmar in first leaders call, White House saysBut Amir, a Shiite, is particularly afraid of the Islamic State group, which has targeted the minority community in brutal bombings. Some attacks have been particularly horrific, including one on educational center that killed at least 25, many of them students waiting to take university entrance exams, and another at a maternity hospital last May that killed 24.IS claimed it carried out 82 attacks in Afghanistan in 2020, killing or wounding 821 people, including 21 assassinations. Most of the victims in its attacks were either security personnel or Shiite Muslims.But the perpetrators of many of the targeted killings are unknown. Often carried out by sticky bombs planted on the victim’s car, assassinations have struck young intellectuals and professionals, including journalists, activists, lawyers, judges.The violence is taking its toll on Afghans’ mental health, said psychologist Sharafuddin Azimi, who estimated tens of thousands of Afghans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.His practice has increased each year, and he said many of his clients are in deep depression, without hope for tomorrow and fearful of death at any time.“Many of our loved ones, the youth, women, men and children are terrified,” he said.“All the time they expect there can be an explosion ... or they feel somebody is following them and they might get stabbed or shot by a thief and get killed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crime-conflict-chaos-crushing-afghan-hopes-for-tomorrow-101612419525138.html
04-02-2021||World||Recovered Covid patients may need only one shot of mRNA vaccines: Report||People who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection may need only one shot as opposed to the recommended two jabs if they are taking the Moderna or Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines, according to a study which suggests ways to minimise doses when supplies are limited.The yet-to-be peer-reviewed study, posted in the preprint repository medRxiv, assessed the antibody responses in 109 individuals with and without documented pre-existing immunity to the novel coronavirus.According to the researchers, including Florian Krammer from the Icahn School of Medicine in the US, a single dose of mRNA vaccine elicits very rapid immune responses in individuals already possessing antibodies against the coronavirus from previous exposure to it."For individuals with pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 the first vaccine dose likely immunologically resembles the booster dose in naive individuals," the scientists wrote in the study.In the research, the scientists analysed mRNA vaccines which use segments of the viral genetic material to enable human cells to make the coronavirus spike proteins.These proteins train the immune system of vaccine recipients to fight the actual infectious coronavirus when their body encounters the pathogen.Also read| Got vaccinated against Covid? Here’s a list of countries you can travelThe scientists said the post-vaccine antibody levels in recovered Covid-19 patients are comparable to, or exceed levels, found in those without prior exposure to the virus who received two vaccinations.Another yet-to-be peer-reviewed study in medRxiv also studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in healthcare workers who had previously recovered from the infection.It found that their antibody levels started peaking at seven days since immunisation, and achieved higher titers and neutralisation in 14 days compared to volunteers exposed to the vaccine for the first time."Although we did not have peak titers for these individuals after natural infection, the titers developed after single vaccination was higher than peak titers in inpatients and outpatients with Covid-19, similar to what has been described in primary vaccination after two doses of the spike-based mRNA vaccines," the researchers wrote in the study.According to the scientists from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the US, the secondary response occurs through activation of the immune system's memory B cells.Based on the findings, the researchers recommend a strategy of single dose vaccination for patients who have already had laboratory-confirmed Covid-19.They said those who have recovered from the disease can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.Also read| Pandemic pulverizes Spain's tourism as arrivals plunge 77%Commenting on the two studies, Eleanor Riley, Professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh in the UK, said the findings are "very reassuring", adding that the vaccines are "very effectively boosting the immunity induced by infection."While the two studies suggest that people who have had laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection may only require one dose of the vaccine, Riley, who was unrelated to the studies, said incorporating this into a mass vaccination programme may be logistically complex.He believes it may be safer to ensure that everyone gets two doses.The preprint platfrom, medRxiv, also cautions that the posted reports are preliminary in nature and have not been certified by peer review."They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior," it adds.Lawrence Young, Virologist and Professor of Molecular Oncology, University of Warwick in the UK, believes this question can be resolved with further studies."...we should be doing further studies which look at giving previously infected individuals one dose of an mRNA vaccine," said Young, who was also unrelated to the two studies."If future work can confirm this high level of immunity post a single mRNA vaccine in this group of individuals, this could become a viable option when there are concerns around vaccine supply," he added in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recovered-covid-patients-may-need-only-one-shot-of-mrna-vaccines-report-101612418945327.html
04-02-2021||World||Why Israel can't celebrate its vaccine success yet||Israel should be celebrating. More than 20% of its population has been fully vaccinated. Another 15% have been given the first of two jabs and will be protected by mid-February. The government plans to have vaccinated 5 million citizens -- well over half the adult population -- by mid-March, just before Israel’s next election will take place on March 23rd.Never has a candidate had better talking points on the key issue of the day. Last week the Maccabi health maintenance organization – one of the four HMOs under which Israeli health care, and the vaccine, is administered -- announced that of 163,000 patients who received the full two-shot protocol, 92% were Covid-free after 10 days (and the remaining 8% showed only mild symptoms). Members of a control group of unvaccinated Israelis were found to be 11 times more highly infected.And yet while Israel has been an undisputed vaccine leader, it is still struggling to contain the virus. This isn’t because the vaccine isn’t working, but because many Israelis still refuse to follow restrictions imposed to limit infections.Israel began its vaccination program by inoculating the oldest members of the population and those with serious underlying conditions. In cities with high levels of vaccination, there is a 50% drop in confirmed cases, a 40% decrease in hospitalisations and there are 15% fewer serious patients. Also read| Gulf nations impose more restrictions to fight virus spread'The vaccine's effect is profound,' says Professor Eran Segal of the Weizmann Institute. The virus’ basic reproduction rate is under the magic number of one, meaning infection rates should continue to decline.Even so, January has been a cruel month in which Covid-19 claimed 1,400 victims, about a third of total deaths since the start of the pandemic. Most of these were elderly patients for whom the vaccine did not arrive in time. If Israel is bending the curve, it isn’t doing it as fast as it could be.Why so many new infections? One big factor is Haredim and Arab Israelis who often flout the social-distancing guidelines and become infected at mass communal events like weddings and funerals. Coronavirus wards of Israel’s hospitals have been filling up with unvaccinated younger patients. Experts here believe that Israel cannot achieve full herd immunity until there is a vaccine that can also be given to children.For the past three weeks, Israel has, in theory, been under an internal lockdown, scheduled to end this weekend, though that is a matter of political negotiation between the warring coalition partners. In any case, compliance with current measures is poor.Also read| Why are Covid-19 cases falling? Are vaccines the main driver? Experts answerEven the proponents of the lockdown concede that it isn’t doing much to slow the spread of the virus (the vaccine has presumably had the bigger impact on infection rates). But it has played a part in poisoning the atmosphere. This is primarily the fault of a refusal by large segments of the ultra-Orthodox Haredi community to accept government restrictions unless they are approved by senior rabbis.Recently Netanyahu was reduced to calling Chaim Kanievsky, a 93-year-old Haredi rabbi with influence over a vast network of ultra-Orthodox schools, to ask for his compliance with the nationwide school shutdown. The Prime Minister was informed by Kanievsky’s grandson, that the rabbi would consider it. The classrooms, after a very brief pause, are still open.On Sunday morning, another nonagenarian rabbi was buried in Jerusalem. Despite strict rules against large gathering, upwards of 10,000 Haredi men and boys accompanied the casket through the capital. Police spokesmen said the police were powerless to resist. For ordinary citizens watching on television, it was a chilling spectacle.The resurgence of infections is partly blamed on the new British and South African variants. To protect against new variants found abroad, Israel has completely sealed itself off. The Ben Gurion airport is closed to all but emergency travelers and cargo, and will likely remain shut for several weeks. Land entry from Egypt and Jordan (from which Israeli tourists from Dubai had been returning home) are now blocked.Also read| US wants India to resolve farm protest through dialogue“North Korea and Israel are the only two countries whose citizens can’t get in,” has become a common lament by frustrated Israelis stuck abroad. Netanyahu remains focused on the threat from outside, telling the World Economic Forum that “statistically, it’s just a question of time before there is a strain that the current vaccines do not work with.”It is the challenge within Israel that is the bigger problem for now. Being a vaccination leader is great. But a country that can’t enforce its own most basic public health measures will take longer to defeat the virus. It also bodes poorly for the future. It may well eventually have to face challenges that can’t be met with a needle.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Zev Chafets is a journalist and author of 14 books.

04-02-2021||World||China conducts most sophisticated repression abroad: Report||The Chinese government conducts the most sophisticated and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression, targeting religious minorities like the Uighurs, political dissidents and former Communist party members who have fled abroad, a new report said on Thursday.Applying tactics ranging from co-opting foreign governments to detain them to digital threats and coercion by proxy, the Chinese government’s transnational repression is “unparalleled”, the Freedom House report said.“Freedom House’s conservative catalogue of direct, physical attacks since 2014 covers 214 cases originating from China, far more than any other country,” the report titled Out of Sight, Not out of Reach, said.Freedom House is a US government-funded and Washington-based advocacy group for democracy and human rights.“Members of ethnic and religious minorities, former insiders of the Chinese Communist Party, human rights defenders, and increasingly, people from Hong Kong—all have been subjected to serious forms of transnational repression, including assassination attempts and renditions,” the report said.The group pointed out that the Chinese authorities’ 2015 kidnapping of Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen who was later forced to renounce his citizenship while in Chinese custody, was a striking example of Beijing’s “…disregard for nationality, sovereignty, and human rights”.The Chinese foreign ministry is yet to react to the report but it has earlier dismissed the group’s findings, saying the US NGO looks at China through “coloured glasses”.Freedom House was among US NGOs sanctioned by China in December, 2019, over what Beijing said were efforts to interfere in its internal affairs.China, however, continues to be a major focus in Freedom House’s global reports on democratic, human and media rights.“These egregious and high-profile cases are only the tip of the iceberg of a much broader system of surveillance, harassment, and intimidation that leaves many overseas Chinese and exile minorities feeling that the CCP is watching them and constraining their ability to exercise basic rights even when living in a foreign democracy,” the report said.The new report also focused on China’s global “anti-corruption” campaign.The campaign has escalated since 2014, when the CCP announced a global anti-corruption drive under the banner of “Fox Hunt”, and later, 2015, under “Operation Skynet.”“Despite its cultivation of an image of legality and careful references to international law, at its core the CCP’s anti-corruption campaign reflects its domestic context, in which the preferences of the party-state stand above all other considerations.”The other key findings of the report said: “At least 31 origin states on every inhabited continent have carried out such acts against victims in 79 host countries, for a total of 160 unique pairings between origin and host countries. The latter include the United States, the United Kingdom, and other established democracies.”An estimated 3.5 million people have been affected by either direct attacks or secondary tactics of intimidation and coercion that ripple through communities around the world.The report added Russia, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and Iran have also carried out transnational repression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-conducts-most-sophisticated-repression-abroad-report-101612421822472.html

04-02-2021||World||Australian PM Morrison says had 'constructive' meeting with Google chief Pichai||The Australian prime minister said he had a “constructive” meeting on Thursday with the head of Google after the tech giant threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over plans to make digital platforms pay for news.Prime Minister Scott Morrison also welcomed the support of Google rival Microsoft, which has touted Australia’s proposed laws that would make Google and Facebook pay as an example for the rest of the world.Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google, initiated the online meeting with Morrison to discuss the draft laws that were introduced to Parliament in December.“I thought it was a constructive meeting,” Morrison said. “I think I’ve been able to send them the best possible signals that should give them a great encouragement to engage with the process."Google regional director Mel Silva told a Senate hearing last month that the company would likely make its search engine unavailable in Australia if the so-called News Media Bargaining Code forced Google and Facebook to pay for Australian news.Google has not explained how Australians would be excluded or from what services.A Senate committee will report to the government on its review of the draft legislation on Feb. 12.Morrison said he was clear with Pichai that “Australia sets the rules for how these things operate.”“We discussed some of the specifics of elements of the code and they raised those matters, I think, very respectfully,” Morrison said. “But I think we’ve been able to get that into a much more positive space about the ability to continue to provide services here in Australia."Google declined to comment on the meeting.While Google and Facebook have condemned the legislation as unworkable, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his business would be willing to pay for news if its search engine increased Australian market share.The law would initially only apply to Google and Facebook, but the government could add other platforms in the future if Google abandoned Australia.Although Bing is Australia’s second most popular search engine, it has only a 3.6% market share. Google says it has 95%.Smith said Microsoft would invest in Bing in Australia to improve its quality so that it would be on par with Google as it was in North America and Britain.“This is an opportunity, whether people use Bing or not, to put a stake in the ground to support the importance of news and publishing and rectify what is ... a real imbalance, say, between search and technology and traditional news,” Smith told Australian Broadcasting Corp.“We applaud the government for taking this kind of step. I think it’s needed, not just in Australia but in other places too,” he added.Technology was having two “adverse effects on the health of democracy” -- spreading disinformation and sapping the economic foundation of news media, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-morrison-says-had-constructive-meeting-with-google-chief-pichai-101612420149653.html
04-02-2021||World||Indo-Canadian groups ask Canada PM to condemn farmer protest violence on Jan 26||An umbrella group of several Indo-Canadian organisation has called upon Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to “denounce” violence perpetrated by elements among those protesting farm laws in New Delhi on Republic Day just as he did with rioters in Washington DC a few days earlier in January.In a letter to Trudeau, Azad Kaushik, president of the National Alliance of Indo-Canadians said he was writing to the PM to “reflect” the sentiments of the Indo-Canadian community which was “concerned” over previous comments he had made with regard to the farmer protests in India during a virtual event to celebrate Gurpurab.Referring to Trudeau’s description of the attack on Capitol Hill in January as “an assault on democracy by rioters”, he pointed out that “similar violence and assault on Indian democracy happened on its Republic Day, by “extremist elements in the guise of farmers” but Canada “did not denounce it.”Calling upon Trudeau to make such a statement of denunciation, he noted, “This would help avoid perception in the Indo-Canadian community and Canada at large of tacit support to extremist elements in the guise of farmers.”An executive in the PMO acknowledged receipt of the letter and said, “Please be assured that your comments have been carefully reviewed.” The PMO official also said the missive had been forwarded to Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau for “information and consideration.”Trudeau made the contentious remarks regarding the protests unprompted while joining a virtual celebration of Gurpurab, the 551st birth anniversary of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak. He had commented: “I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognising the n ews coming out of India about the protests by farmers. The situation is concerning.” He added, “Canada will always be there to defend the right to peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.” Those comments drew a sharp reaction from India and had an adverse impact on bilateral relations.Meanwhile, in an open letter to Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde, former premier of the Canadian province of British Columbia Ujjal Dosanjh has urged him to take suo moto cognisance of the events on Republic Day in New Delhi and “order the investigation of the same by a Special Investigation Team monitored by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court.”In the letter, Dosanjh said, “It is quite evident from the publicly available information that the disturbance at the Red Fort was caused by rogue elements illegitimately claiming to represent the peaceful and disciplined” protesting farmers and their organisations.He also asked the chief justice to take into account “the probability of the criminal conspiracy including the probable involvement of high officials of the government in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-groups-ask-canada-pm-to-condemn-farmer-protest-violence-on-jan-26-101612420020853.html
04-02-2021||World||Why are Covid-19 cases falling? Are vaccines the main driver? Experts answer||After being ravaged by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for over a year, the world is now witnessing a fall in the number of cases. The World Health Organisation (WHO) welcomed this development, calling it encouraging news."For the third week in a row, the number of new cases of Covid-19 reported globally fell last week," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference on Monday."There are still many countries with increasing numbers of cases, but at the global level, this is encouraging news," he added.The WHO chief also warned against showing complacency, saying "we have been here before."Leading the drop in cases is United States, the worst affected country. According to Johns Hopkins University, 110,679 new cases of the disease were recorded in the US on Wednesday, down from 215,805 three weeks ago.Europe's new cases have declined from about 250,00 to 180,000 a day, according to reports from various health ministries as quoted by other publications. The UK, which is under lockdown, saw its daily tally plummet to 23,355 from nearly 60,000 on January 9.So what is the reason for this drop in number of cases? Many say that the pro-active approach adopted by various governments in vaccinating their populations has led to this day. But experts say vaccination alone can't be credited for this.Dr Ali Mokdad, a professor of Health Metrics Sciences at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said inoculation programmes can't alone be responsible for this positive milestone. He said that there is a combination of vaccines, the development of antibodies and weather which is leading the decline.In the US, more people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine than have tested positive for the virus. As of Monday afternoon, 26.5 million Americans had received one or both doses of the current vaccines, according to Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.The US has been administering shots at a faster daily rate than any country in the world, giving about 1.34 million doses a day. Still, only 7.8 per cent of Americans have gotten one or more doses, and 1.8 per cent are fully vaccinated.More than 26.3 million people have tested positive for the disease, and 443,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.In the UK, more than 10 million people have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the government. A further 498,962 have had a second dose.The UK's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Wednesday that the country has passed the peak of its latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set a target of vaccinating 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February.India too has been witnessing a decline in the number of cases. On Thursday, 12,899 new cases were recorded. There are 155,025 active cases, which accounts for 1.49 per cent of the total caseload.India started the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme on January 16. So far, 44,49,552 health and frontline workers have been vaccinated in the world's largest immunisation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-are-covid-19-cases-falling-are-vaccines-the-main-driver-experts-answer-101612418485139.html

04-02-2021||World||Canada designates Hizbul Mujahideen a terrorist group||Canada has designated the Pakistan-based, Kashmir-focused Hizbul Mujahideen as a terrorist group.HM was among 13 new groups added to the list, including several neo-Nazi organisations like Proud Boys, which was also alleged to have taken part in the violence at the Capitol in Washington DC last month.Public Safety Canada said HM was formed in 1989 as a militant group as violence escalated in the Kashmir valley and its “primary goal is to unite the Indian and Pakistan administered parts of Kashmir, which would then join with Pakistan.”“HM has launched attacks on Indian security forces, politicians, military targets and critical infrastructure within the newly formed territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. HM’s tactics include using assassinations and armed assault. The group has also abducted and killed police officers and informants.”The list of terrorist groups on the Canadian register has now grown to 73 and includes several that are engaged against India including the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. Also listed are Khalistani outfits Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation, as well as Indian Mujahideen.Canada’s Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said, “Violent acts of terrorism have no place in Canadian society or abroad. Today’s additions to the Criminal Code list of terrorist entities are an important step in our effort to combat violent extremism in all forms.” “Canadians expect their Government to keep them safe and to keep pace with evolving threats and global trends, such as the growing threat of ideologically motivated violent extremism. The government of Canada will continue to take appropriate actions to counter terrorist threats to Canada, its citizens and its interests around the world,” he said in a statement.Once an entity is formally listed, banks and financial institutions freeze its assets and it becomes a crime to deal with the assets of such a proscribed group. In its release, Public Safety Canada noted that such listings “also help obstruct assistance from sympathisers and supporters in Canada by criminalising certain support activities, including those related to terrorist travel, training and recruitment.”Neo-fascist, white supremacist groups are recent entries into the list, with the latest additions including Proud Boys, Atomwaffen Division and the Base. The new listings also feature three more affiliates of the al Qaeda, five more of the Islamic State including its presence in Bangladesh and the Russian Imperial Movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-designates-hizbul-mujahideen-a-terrorist-group-101612418460734.html
04-02-2021||World||US wants India to resolve farm protest through dialogue||The United States has said it encourages the resolution of ongoing farmer protests in India through “dialogue”.This was the Biden administration’s first response to a major Indian crisis. And although gently proposed, it marked a definitive departure from the hands-off “internal matter” approach favoured by the Trump administration to previous flashpoints, the 2019 abrogation of Article 370 altering the constitutional status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which fast-tracked Indian citizenship for Hindus fleeing persecution in neighbouring South Asian countries.“We recognise that peaceful protests are a hallmark of any thriving democracy and note that the Indian Supreme Court has stated the same,” a state department spokesperson said in response to a request for comment from US media on Wednesday, an abridged copy of which was provided to Hindustan Times.The spokesperson added, “We encourage that any differences between the parties be resolved through dialogue.”The brief three para comment — four paras in versions to US media — was likely worded carefully to prevent any impression the US was seeking to intervene in an internal disagreement, in the light of the strong pushback from the Modi government and its allies and supporters following comments from pop star Rihanna, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg and US vice-president Kamala Harris’s niece Meena Harris.Harris, to be sure, has kept at it. “If this is what it means to be pro-democracy and pro-human rights, then let’s go,” she wrote in a tweet on Wednesday, responding to a twitter post pitting her and Rihanna against the external affairs ministry spokesperson’s statement denouncing outside comment on an internal matter.The state department seemed supportive, however, of the reforms introduced by the Modi government that the farmers have been protesting for weeks now. “In general, the United States welcomes steps that would improve the efficiency of India’s markets and attract greater private sector investment.”Milan Vaishnav, a South Asia expert at Carnegie, tweeted approvingly of the above comment, saying it “suggests support for the farm reforms”. He added, “Pretty balanced overall.”Farmer are protesting new laws that allow the sale of agricultural produce in open market at market-determined rates. They fear they could lose the support thereby of a government procurement programme that guarantees them a basic return on their investment undiminished by market reverses.In the longer version of the comment, the state department spokesperson added a fourth para, which was said to be in response to a specific question: “We recognise that unhindered access to information, including the internet, is fundamental to the freedom of expression and a hallmark of a thriving democracy.”This was a reference in all likelihood to the temporary suspension — 12 hours or so — of dozens of accounts on Monday by Twitter as demanded by the government on grounds that they were being used to incite violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-wants-india-to-resolve-farm-protest-through-dialogue-101612417501082.html
04-02-2021||World||UK’s major companies falling short on climate risk disclosure: Report||Most of the largest UK companies are getting away with “woefully inadequate” disclosure of the risks they face from climate change, according to an analysis of annual and audit reports by environmental charity ClientEarth.Just 40% of FTSE 250 companies clearly referred to climate change when discussing key risks and uncertainties in their most recent annual reports as of June 2020 said the group, which is headquartered in London. “There are very general statements being made, but very little in the way of accountability,” said Daniel Wiseman, a lawyer at ClientEarth who co-authored the report. “Currently, the financial regulators aren’t adequately doing their job in ensuring financial markets have the climate-change information they need.”Investors are increasingly demanding more transparency to help them evaluate companies’ strategies for dealing with threats from climate change on business areas such as supply chains and hard assets. In November, the UK became the first major economy to commit to introducing mandatory reporting aligned to guidelines by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. While these rules aren't yet in force for all listed companies, UK law has long required that they identify significant risks to the value of significant assets or their underlying business model.Just 4% of the company financial accounts and audit reports ClientEarth examined clearly referred to climate change. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP audited 73 of the 250 companies examined in the report, but clearly referred to climate change in just one of its audit reports, the analysis said.“Ensuring accurate information is provided to investors on climate-related risks is a critical issue and is something we're raising with the organizations we audit,” said Hemione Hudson, head of audit at PwC UK. “We expect to see increased reporting from the organizations we audit and in our audit opinions in the future.”ClientEarth’s report also highlighted discrepancies in reporting standards. Some rules, such as reporting greenhouse-gas emissions, don’t apply to companies which are listed in Britain but registered abroad. The UK’s Financial Reporting Council, which regulates corporate governance, hasn’t sanctioned any auditors for failures to ensure adequate reporting on climate issues by the companies they audit, it said in an emailed statement. The body “is paying particular attention” to auditors’ work on climate change going forward after an internal review found auditors’ assessments to be inadequate, it added.The Financial Conduct Authority, an independent regulatory group that oversees financial services and markets, also says it hasn’t taken any enforcement actions against companies for failing to disclose climate risk. “If we suspect serious misconduct in relation to a listed company’s failure to ensure adequate risk reporting related to climate change, we will investigate, and take enforcement action if appropriate,” a representative said, adding that it will work closely with FRC to enforce the new reporting rules.The ClientEarth report contained several recommendations, including that investors exercise stronger accountability, and that action be taken by FRC and FCA when companies and auditors omit material climate-related information. It also advocated that the UK explicitly require firms to disclose their strategies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which would put them in line with the national goal to reach net zero by the same year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-major-companies-falling-short-on-climate-risk-disclosure-report-101612415812584.html
04-02-2021||World||Moon, Biden agree to boost US-South Korean alliance||South Korea's leader said Thursday he and President Joe Biden have agreed to further bolster their countries' alliance and work together to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula.After his first phone talks with Biden since the U.S. president's Jan. 20 inauguration, President Moon Jae-in tweeted that “I just had a great conversation with President @JoeBiden @POTUS” and that he welcomed “America's return” in the midst of global challenges such as COVID-19, climate change and economic polarization.Moon said he and Biden “pledged to further upgrade the ROK-US alliance, an alliance that is anchored in shared values.” ROK refers to Republic of Korea, South Korea's formal name.“We will always stand together as we work for peace on the Korean Peninsula and tackle global challenges,” Moon said.Moon, who took office in 2017, was once a driving force behind now-dormant diplomacy between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former President Donald Trump. The Kim-Trump talks collapsed in early 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korea's calls for extensive sanctions relief in return for limited denuclearization steps.Moon, who still wants to resume the nuclear diplomacy, said last month that Biden could learn from Trump's successes and failures in dealing with North Korea though he acknowledged Biden was likely to try a different approach.Biden has called Kim a “thug” and criticised Trump for seeking made-for-TV summits with Kim. Experts say Biden won't likely sit down for one-on-one talks with Kim unless working-level officials sort out details and confirm North Korea's sincerity in denuclearisation. Last month, Kim said at a major political conference that the fate of his country's relations with the US depends on whether Washington abandons what he calls its hostile policy on the North. He disclosed an array of high-tech nuclear weapons systems under development in an apparent effort to apply pressure on the United States. The US, which stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea, regularly stages military drills with South Korea. North Korea views such training as an invasion rehearsal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moon-biden-agree-to-boost-us-south-korean-alliance-101612415994807.html
04-02-2021||World||Got vaccinated against Covid? Here’s a list of countries you can travel||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, which has been prevailing for more than a year has affected several business sectors severely. The tourism industry- whose basic requirement is the movement of people from one place to another- has also been badly hit due to lockdown restrictions, cancellation of flights for domestic and international travel, closure of resorts and other tourist attractions etc.However, with the commencement of administering Covid-19 vaccine doses to people globally, countries are allowing or are in the process of allowing inoculated travellers to visit them. As long as people have been administered two doses of their country’s respective vaccine and can produce documentary evidence to prove that they have been inoculated, they are allowed to travel.Here are some of the countries that are allowing travel for all vaccinated passengers:Seychelles:According to an official statement on January 17, the government opened Seychelles for tourism for those people who have been administered vaccine doses and also have a negative report from the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) test 72 hours before the journey.Earlier, the government had announced that it was opening the country in a two step-approach. Under the first step- passengers are allowed to enter the country 14 days after taking both doses of the vaccine along with a negative report from a test done 72 hours before the journey. While under the second step which will be in force from mid-March, the government expects to vaccinate a significant section of its population -- when non-vaccinated people would be able to enter the country with just a negative report from a test done 72 hours before the journey.Also Read| Global coronavirus vaccine trust rising, but France, Japan, others scepticalPhuket, Thailand:The country’s resort island of Phuket is formulating a plan to fully reopen to vaccinated visitors by October this year with the view to revive the tourism industry which has been hard hit by the pandemic. The plan which will need permits from the government also seeks to waive a mandatory 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers.“This will allow thousands of vaccinated Europeans who usually spend their winter months in Phuket to visit,” Bhummikitti Ruktaengam, president of the Phuket tourist association told news agency Bloomberg. The island is also working towards providing private Covid-19 vaccinations for 250,000 residents.Georgia:Georgia, which is situated at the intersection of eastern Europe and West Asia, is the first country to remove entry restrictions for all vaccinated passengers, according to a report by the Independent. This means that there is no quarantine , no testing on arrival or pre-departure.The report by Independent also added that since February 1, all international tourists have been allowed to enter the country as long as they have been administered both doses of their respective coronavirus vaccines and can also present requisite proof.Also Watch| Covid update: China competes with India on vaccine; IMA vs govt on doctor deaths﻿Iceland:Iceland issued its first Covid-19 vaccination certificates on January 26 to ease travel for all those people who have been inoculated against the disease.

04-02-2021||World||Marine Le Pen staging comeback against Macron in French election||Far-right leader Marine Le Pen is currently standing out as the only serious rival to Emmanuel Macron in the upcoming presidential election.The National Rally party chief is neck-and-neck with Macron for the first round of the 2022 ballot with up to 26.5%, and would lose by 12 percentage points in the second round, according to an Ipsos poll commissioned by L’Obs and Franceinfo published on Wednesday.Le Pen lost to Macron in the 2017 presidential election by a margin of 32 percentage points, in what was her second failed attempt to make it to the Elysee palace. Now, with the French leader’s handling of the Covid crisis facing criticism and the country’s traditional two-party system in tatters, she’s trying her luck again.The daughter of party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen is tapping into anger over economic inequality and the dominance of Paris over the regions, key drivers of the Yellow Vest protests that spread across the country in 2018. She’s lashed out at Macron for not having closed borders early enough to prevent the arrival of dangerous Covid-19 variants, as well as for the slow start to France’s vaccination campaign.“Why didn’t the government take advantage of the last lockdown, which required a lot of sacrifices from the French people, to test massively and get ahead of the epidemic,” Le Pen said in a recent interview on Franceinfo television. “The government is on top of nothing.”Back in 2017, Le Pen lost to Macron with 34% of the votes in the second round, compared to 66% -- after a disastrous performance during a live television debate in which she made factual errors and focused on attacking Macron rather than explaining her plan for the country.While Le Pen’s electoral base is very different to Macron’s -- her message resonates especially with the unemployed and rural populations while he attracts more highly educated and wealthier pro-Europe voters -- she’s been working to widen her appeal. She reversed from her aim of exiting the euro, condemned anti-antisemitism and moved to ban racism within her party.Shaky FinancesEven so, among big cities in last year’s municipal elections, Le Pen only secured Perpignan in the south. And her National Rally has actually been losing ground, according to an IFOP-Fiducial poll for Sud Radio. A third of the French said they considered the party the main opposition to Macron in the most recent IFOP poll, down from about half in July 2019. Latest available data also show Le Pen party’s finance as shaky.Ipsos surveyed 1,000 people on the electoral role online January 27 and 28. It reviewed seven scenarios based on potential runners in the first round and didn’t give a margin of error. The poll comes after a Harris survey that showed Le Pen leading Macron in the first round by up to 4 points, and Macron leading Le Pen in the second round by the same margin.There are already seven declared candidates, including Le Pen and far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon. Neither Macron nor Paris Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, described by government officials privately as another threat to the president, have publicly said they’d run -- though their teams are working on their platforms.Meanwhile Macron, broadly a centrist, is also trying to widen his appeal. He’s concentrated on reaching out to right-wing voters who might choose him over Le Pen, pushing through legislation to protect “Republican values” and fight Islamism and terrorism. He’s also pledged to spend “whatever it costs” to save the economy, and workers, from the pandemic, seizing a key platform of the left.Yet in trying to win support from both sides, Macron’s making himself vulnerable -- the results of the vaccination campaign will be a key barometer of voter sentiment, as well as the outcome of regional elections scheduled for June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/marine-le-pen-staging-comeback-against-macron-in-french-election-101612413809926.html
04-02-2021||World||Britain to test combining Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines in two-shot regimen||Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc are combined in a two-shot schedule.The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of coronavirus vaccines could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.The trial will examine the immune responses of an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca's, as well as vice versa, with intervals of 4 and 12 weeks.Both the mRNA shot developed by Pfizer and Biontech and the adenovirus viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are currently being rolled out in Britain, with a 12-week gap between two doses of the same vaccine.It is expected more vaccines will be added to the trial when they are approved and rolled out.Recruitment for the study starts on Thursday, with over 800 participants expected to take part, the researchers said. That makes it much smaller than the clinical trials that have been used to determine efficacy of the vaccines individually.The trial will not assess the overall efficacy of the shot combinations, but researchers will measure antibody and T-cell responses, as well as monitor for any unexpected side effects.Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said initial results could inform vaccine deployment in the second half of the year."We will get some results through, we expect, by June or thereabouts that will inform the use of booster doses in the general population," he told reporters.The trial is looking to recruit people over the age of 50 who may be at higher risk than younger people and have not been vaccinated already.AstraZeneca's shot is also being tested in combination with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, and British drugmaker's research chief has said more studies on combining vaccines should be done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-test-combining-pfizer-and-astrazeneca-vaccines-in-two-shot-regimen-101612411624501.html
04-02-2021||World||Health workers start anti-coup protests in coronavirus-hit Myanmar||Medical workers across Myanmar began a civil disobedience protest against Monday's coup, wearing red ribbons and declaring they won't work for the new military government.The army takeover that ousted the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi over allegations of fraud in November's elections could not have come at a worse time for a country battling a steady rise in COVID-19 cases with a dangerously inadequate health system.“We want to show the world we are totally against military dictatorship and we want our elected government and leader back,” said Dr. Zun Ei Phyu, who lives in Yangon, the biggest city and commercial capital. “We want to show them we will follow only our elected government. Not the military.”Health workers in government hospitals and facilities issued a statement Wednesday opposing the coup. Photos were shared on social media showing workers with red ribbons pinned to their clothes or holding printed photos of red ribbons. Others used a three-finger salute that has become a symbol of pro-democracy protests in neighboring Thailand, where a former general has led the government since a 2014 coup.Some medical staff went on strike while others who continued work in government-run clinics made public their opposition to the new military rulers.Some of those on strike have begun to volunteer at charity health clinics, many of which were shut down as a precaution against a surge in COVID-19 cases. The clinics that have remained reopen are extending their working hours so people can still receive care during the protest, Zun Ei Phyu said.“We give free treatment and medicine to anyone who is in need," she said, adding the clinics often operate with donations from charities and local communities.Myanmar's early response to the pandemic mirrored that of many countries: borders were nearly completely closed, lengthy quarantines were imposed on travelers, and daily life slowed with stay-at-home orders.It seemed to work until early September, when cases exploded from less than 1,000 to some 14,300 a month later. Now with more than 140,600 confirmed cases and 3,100 deaths, Myanmar's fragile health system faces the perfect storm of the pandemic and the coup.“You could expect the military to take full advantage of COVID-19 as a political opportunity, not as a health care responsibility to the people of Myanmar,” said Ronan Lee, a visiting scholar at Queen Mary University of London’s International State Crime Initiative.History shows those concerns are not without merit.In 2000, decades after the former military junta took control, the World Health Organization ranked Myanmar's health system as one of the worst. According to the World Bank, Myanmar's health expenditure was around 1.87% of GDP in 2010, the year before democratic reforms began.In March 2020, Myanmar reported just 0.71 intensive care unit beds and 0.46 ventilators per 100,000 population, which was insufficient to deal with even a moderate outbreak, according to data from the World Bank and WHO.Donations of medical equipment have since arrived and the government has increased bed capacity with new quarantine centers, clinics and hospitals. But experts cite a lack of medical staff as a continuing problem.Myanmar's small health care force had just 6.7 physicians per 10,000 people in 2018, significantly lower than the global average of 15.6 in 2017.The coup comes just days after Myanmar launched its vaccination campaign with some 1.5 million doses of a two-shot vaccine donated from India. Last week, Suu Kyi observed vaccinations at a hospital in the capital, Naypyitaw, and told reporters that the process must proceed carefully because the government does not have all the supplies it needs.The military has its own medical corps and medical facilities across the country. But Sharon Bell, a researcher who previously studied the health system in Myanmar, said she doesn't anticipate the military will have the ability to control outbreaks or conduct sufficient vaccination programs.The military released a statement saying “prevention of the current outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will be efficiently carried out with momentum.”According to Lee, when the military talks about getting the virus under control, it means “locking down the community and preventing opportunities for public expressions of opposition to their rule.”“I expect they’ll use the pandemic as a shield to defend them from scrutiny,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-workers-start-anti-coup-protests-in-coronavirus-hit-myanmar-101612406532715.html
04-02-2021||World||UK Parliament to consider debate on farmers issue as e-petition attracts thousands of signatures||British Parliament's Petitions Committee will consider a Westminster Hall debate in the House of Commons complex on the issue of farmers protests and press freedom in India after an online petition attracted over 106,000 signatures.While the list of signatories for the e-petition also reflects a signature of Boris Johnson, in his capacity as a west London Conservative Party member of Parliament, Downing Street on Wednesday categorically denied that the UK Prime Minister had signed the petition.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and organisations on protests by farmers as "ill-informed" and "unwarranted", asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi issued a statement on Wednesday to highlight that the Parliament of India had passed "reformist legislation" for the agricultural sector, which "a very small section of farmers" have some reservations about and therefore the laws have been kept on hold while talks are held.Emphasising that the protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, the MEA in its statement said some vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against the country."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken."The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible," the MEA statement said following some high-profile celebrities tweeting over the agitation by farmers.In London, a UK government spokesperson said, "Media freedom is vital for the protection of human rights and journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence.""Free press plays a crucial role in our democracies and the government are putting their full weight behind this including through our membership of the Media Freedom Coalition," the spokesperson said.The petition on the official Parliament petitions website, entitled ‘Urge the Indian Government to ensure safety of protesters & press freedom’, calls on the British government to make a public statement on the "#kissanprotests & press freedoms".All e-petitions on the Parliament website that cross the 10,000 signatures mark require the UK government to make an official statement and any petitions that cross 100,000 signatures must be considered for a debate. The House of Commons said the government's response to the petition is expected later this month and the debate is under consideration."Petitions that receive 100,000 signatures will be considered for a debate in Parliament. Debates in Westminster Hall – where petitions debates take place – are currently suspended, but Committee will make an announcement on scheduling this debate as soon as possible," a House of Commons spokesperson said.Some of the signatories of the petition reflect names of cross-party parliamentarians including Indian-origin Opposition Labour Party MPs Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi and Preet Kaur Gill, who have been particularly vocal over the issue on social media and most recently raised concerns over the blockage of "water, electricity and internet" to protesting crowds.Meanwhile, the Indian Journalists’ Association (IJA) in the UK joined other international media organisations to express concern over the arrest of journalists covering the farmers’ protests and urged the Indian government to ensure the safety of journalists in the country."The freedom of press is an important pillar of any democracy and authorities must ensure that journalists are able to do their jobs – reporting accurately and without bias – however challenging the circumstances,” it said in a statement.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November last year, demanding the government to repeal the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.Defending the three contentious agri laws, the MEA said,"these reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliament-to-consider-debate-on-farmers-issue-101612406593544.html

The state department said the US first wanted to be "in lockstep" with allies and partners before engaging with China."The secretary (Secretary of Defense Lloyd J Austin III) was mindful of the larger geostrategic picture when he approved the movement of the carrier strike group from the Central Command area of responsibility to the Indo PACOM area of responsibility," Pentagon Press Secretary John F Kirby said.Kirby declined to reveal details about USS Nimitz’s next deployment in the US Indo-Pacific region.China watchers in New Delhi said the Biden administration’s decision indicates that the US could increase its presence around the South China Sea to shore up the confidence of the 36 countries in the Asia Pacific region, many of whom have boundary disputes with Beijing.The Biden administration has already reaffirmed its “rock-solid” commitment to Taipei, signalling that it will continue with Trump’s policy of engagement with Taiwan that is under intense pressure from President Xi Jinping’s China to accept that it is part of “One China.”Another aircraft carrier group USS Theodore Roosevelt reached the South China Sea last month to promote "freedom of the seas". The entry of the supercarrier into the South China Sea through the Bashi Strait, sailing between Taiwan and the Philippines, coincided with China flying more than a dozen military aircraft including strategic bombers into the Taiwan Strait.During this incursion into Taiwan’s air defence zone on January 23, according to the Financial TimesChinese military aircraft simulated missile attacks on the US aircraft carrier. The bombers and some of the fighter aircraft involved were conducting an exercise that used the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group as a mock target.Some analysts had interpreted China’s incursion as an attempt by President Xi’s China to ascertain how the new administration will respond to such Chinese behavior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uss-nimitz-to-be-back-in-indo-pacific-holds-a-message-for-china-on-taiwan-101612405862334.html

I did not participate in this decision," Matze said in a memo sent to Parler staff."Over the past few months, I've met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed."He told Reuters that Parler now has an "executive committee" consisting of Matthew Richardson and Mark Meckler.Mercer, Richardson, Meckler and Parler did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Parler remains largely offline after being dropped by Seattle-based Amazon's cloud-hosting division and the app stores of Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google following the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol.The companies cited Parler's record of policing violent content, after far-right groups spread violent rhetoric on the platform ahead of the unrest in Washington.Parler, which was founded in 2018 and has claimed it has over 12 million users, has styled itself as a "free speech-driven" space.The app has largely attracted U.S. conservatives who disagree with rules around content on social media sites like Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc.Matze told Reuters on Jan. 13 that Parler may be offline for good, but later pledged it would return stronger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-101612405071563.html

He will have plenty of time to do that," she said, lowering down the expectations.Biden's trip to the Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State Department is seen as an effort to boost the morale of the American diplomats. During his interaction, the president is expected to underscore the role of diplomacy in American leadership overseas.After winning the November 3 presidential polls, Biden has spoken with over 20 world leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 17. However, among the notable absentees is President Xi Jinping of China. In a little over a week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reached out to more than two dozens of his counterparts, including India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-talk-about-foreign-policy-during-his-maiden-visit-to-state-department-101612404772549.html
04-02-2021||World||US nominates Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement for Nobel Peace Prize||Washington [US], February 4 (ANI): A bipartisan group of US lawmakers has nominated Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, to honour the demonstrators' struggle against the Beijing imposed draconian national security law.This move by the lawmakers would surely anger Beijing, which has repeatedly received condemnation from the West for its imposition and undermining the region's sovereignity."We are nominating a movement that has peacefully advocated for and maintained human rights and democracy in Hong Kong since 1997 and continues to fight against the erosion of these rights," Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, Representative James McGovern, a Democrat, and seven other lawmakers, wrote to Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Nobel Peace Prize committee as quoted by South China Morning Post."A number of democracy advocates are already in jail, some in exile, and many more awaiting trials where they are expected to be convicted and sentenced in the coming months for the sole reason of peacefully expressing their political views through speech, publication, elections, or assembly," the signatories, all members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, wrote in the letter dated Sunday and made public on Wednesday.Dimitar Gueorguiev, an assistant professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University said that with five Democrats and four Republicans backing the nomination, the effort "underscores that US pressure on China is not letting up"."It is important to remember that this development follows on recent Chinese sanctions against US officials, who had criticised China's human rights record, announced during the twilight moments of the Trump administration... Optimists in Beijing might have thought that a new administration would offer an opportunity for some sort of reset. That seems increasingly unlikely," Gueorguiev said.Millions of Hongkongers demonstrated peacefully against the extradition bill in June 2019, but over weeks and months, some subsequent protests became more violent as the administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam refused to acknowledge the demands of the opposition."In response to public opposition and protests, the Chinese government issued the National Security Law, which was passed and implemented without any input or participation from Hong Kong residents," the nomination letter said as quoted by South China Morning Post. "This law is being used to actively suppress voices for human rights and democracy," it added.The media outlet further reported that the lawmakers behind the Nobel Peace Prize nomination have since sponsored or co-sponsored other anti-China bills.The draconian security law imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong that criminalises any act of secession (breaking away from China), subversion (undermining the power or authority of the central government), terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, with punishments of up to life in prison. It came into effect from July 1, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nominates-hong-kong-s-pro-democracy-movement-for-nobel-peace-prize-101612404180404.html

It could take months to confirm the total and the new record, though.The snowfall report came from a trained weather observer, and officials note there's no reason to doubt its veracity. If confirmed, it would top the record of 34 inches that fell during a blizzard Feb 11-Feb 14 in Cape May County in southern New Jersey in 1899.Mount Arlington, in Morris County, is about 43 miles (69 kilometers) west of New York City.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/122yearold-snow-record-may-be-broken-just-short-of-3-feet-101612401422980.html

Reuters reported that Myanmar’s Ministry of Communications and Information posted a letter saying access to Facebook and its services will be unavailable until Feb. 7 in order to maintain “stability” in the country.“We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with their families and friends and access important information,” the Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement.The move comes after residents in Yangon on Wednesday night protested for a second straight evening, singing songs, banging on pots and honking car horns in protest of the military coup. Earlier yesterday, authorities filed criminal charges against former leader Aung San Suu Kyi for possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies, an apparent violation of an import-export law. She faces as many as three years in prison if convicted.Suu Kyi has called on supporters to resist Myanmar’s generals, who seized power on Monday after claiming without presenting evidence that her landslide victory in November’s election was tainted with fraud. The military has pledged to hold elections after a yearlong state of emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-orders-facebook-blocked-as-protests-emerge-after-coup-101612401066993.html
04-02-2021||World||House GOP grapples with Greene, Cheney as it defines itself||House Democrats planned a showdown vote for Thursday over stripping Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments for her endorsement of racist and conspiratorial views, as the chamber's top Republican signaled he would not bow to bipartisan demands to punish her.The decision by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., came Wednesday as Republicans also grappled over what to do about Rep. Liz Cheney, their No. 3 leader, after she backed Donald Trump's impeachment. The decisions over how to handle the two Republican lawmakers subjected the GOP to a politically agonizing test of its direction as it moves beyond Donald Trump’s presidency.Democrats increased the pressure by planning a House vote on removing Greene from her committees for her embrace of calls to violence against Democrats and bizarre fictions about faked school shootings.But shortly after the Democratic-led House Rules Committee cleared the way for Thursday's vote, McCarthy released a statement saying Democrats were “choosing to raise the temperature" by attempting a “partisan power grab."He condemned Greene's past endorsements of conspiracy theories — after weeks of saying little critical of her — and said the first-term Georgia congresswoman had recognized in a private conversation that she must meet “a higher standard" as a lawmaker.“I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward," McCarthy said.Separately, House Republicans were meeting privately Wednesday about an effort by Trump loyalists to push Cheney out of her leadership post. That move was sparked after Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a fixture of the party establishment, became one of just 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump last month.“I won't apologize for the vote,” Cheney told her colleagues, according to a person familiar with the session who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.During a break in that closed-door session, McCarthy told reporters he'd defended Cheney inside.“People can have differences of opinion. That’s what you can have a discussion about. Liz has a right to vote her conscience," said McCarthy, who'd previously given no clear signal about whether he'd support his lieutenant.At the earlier Rules Committee meeting, Chair Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said lawmakers would send “an awful message” if they took no action on Greene. “If this is not the bottom, I don’t know what the hell is,” McGovern said.McCarthy tried to push blame onto Democrats, criticizing them for taking no action against their own lawmakers whom he didn't name, including one he said “spread anti-Semitic tropes.” Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., made comments critical of Israel in 2019 and apologized.The closed-door GOP meeting was likely to discuss the political fates of both Cheney and Greene, and touch on McCarthy's performance. He is having to guide the House GOP through one of its most contentious periods, but his favored approach of avoiding ruffling feathers has been criticized by some Republicans who think he needs to be more decisive.That meeting was also expected to become an emotional debate over whether the GOP should follow Trump's norm-busting divisiveness or embrace the party's more traditional, policy-oriented conservative values.The internal GOP fight over how to handle Greene and Cheney underscored the hold Trump and his voters still have on much of the party. But it's not uniform.Around two-thirds of House Republicans voted to back Trump's effort to overturn his November election loss — just hours after his supporters' deadly storming of the Capitol that led to his impeachment for inciting insurrection. Yet Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP senators have lambasted Greene, reflecting worries that her wing of the party cannot win statewide Senate races.House Republicans have faced bipartisan pressure to punish Greene, including from McConnell. A House vote was expected to be a political ordeal for many Republicans, forcing them to go on record defending or punishing the unapologetic, social media-savvy Greene.She burst onto the national political scene after just a month in office and with enthusiastic support from Trump. Even during the effort to punish her, she has lashed out at Democrats and raised money on the controversy.Republicans appointed Greene to the Education and Labor Committee, a decision that drew especially harsh criticism because of her suggestions that mass school shootings in Connecticut and Florida could be hoaxes. Greene is also on the Budget Committee.McCarthy said Democrats turned down his offer to move Greene onto the House Small Business Committee instead.It's unusual for party leaders to strip lawmakers of committee assignments, which can help them address their districts’ needs and raise campaign contributions.In 2019, House GOP leaders removed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who had a history of racist comments, from the Agriculture and Judiciary panels after wondering aloud in a New York Times story about when the term “white supremacist” became offensive. He lost the Republican primary for his seat in 2020 and is out of Congress after serving nine terms.In online videos and through supportive “likes” on social media, Greene has voiced support for racist beliefs, calls for violence against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama, and other false theories. She’s also endorsed fictional QAnon claims that Trump was trying to unearth secret child trafficking rings run by Democrats.The handling of Greene and Cheney presented a tricky balancing act for McCarthy. The eight-term lawmaker is hoping to become speaker should Republicans capture the House majority in the 2022 elections, and he has little interest in antagonizing any GOP colleagues.Penalizing Cheney for what she called her “vote of conscience” on impeachment would be awkward without also punishing Greene. Action against either risked angering the GOP’s numerous Trump supporters or its more traditional conservative backers.Cheney foes have said they have enough votes to force her removal from leadership. But it was unclear whether GOP lawmakers would vote on that during Wednesday's meeting or if McCarthy would somehow delay that showdown.The Senate plans to begin its impeachment trial of Trump next week. In a procedural vote last week, all but five GOP senators voted to scuttle the proceedings, indicating that his conviction is unlikely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-gop-grapples-with-greene-cheney-as-it-defines-itself-101612400077284.html
04-02-2021||World||Canada designates Proud Boys as a terrorist entity||The Canadian government designated the Proud Boys group as a terrorist entity on Wednesday, noting they played a pivotal role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.The Proud Boys have faced increased scrutiny after seizing on the former Trump administration’s policies and the group was a major agitator during earlier protests and the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. The Proud Boys is a far-right, male chauvinist extremist group known for engaging in violent clashes at political rallies. Canada is the first country to designate them as a terrorist entity.During a September presidential debate, Donald Trump had urged the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” when asked to condemn them by a moderator.Senior officials speaking on a technical briefing said authorities had been monitoring and collecting evidence about the Proud Boys before the Capitol Hill insurrection, but confirmed that the event provided information that helped with the decision to list the organization.Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said they revealed themselves.“Their intent and their escalation toward violence became quite clear," Blair said.Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of Proud Boys, called the terrorist designation “ridiculous.”"There is no basis for it. It's infringement of free speech rights. All the Canadian Proud Boys have ever done is go to rallies,” Tarrio said in a phone interview.“They used what happened at the Capitol to push for this."Tarrio said the Canadian chapters are very quiet compared to their American counterparts. He estimated there are between 1,000 and 1,500 Proud Boys in Canada.Tarrio was arrested in Washington shortly before the Capitol riot. He was accused of vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church during an earlier protest in the nation’s capital.U.S. Federal authorities, meanwhile, arrested Wednesday a man who describes himself as the “Sergeant of Arms” of the Seattle chapter of the Proud Boys after he was charged in connection with the riot at the U.S. Capitol. He is at least the eighth defendant linked to the Proud Boys facing federal charges after thousands of pro-Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden’s presidential winAsked whether the U.S. will follow Canada and designate Proud Boys as a terrorist entity, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. has a domestic extremism review underway. “We will wait for that review to conclude before we make any determinations,” Psaki said.The terrorist designation in Canada means the group may have assets seized and face harsher terrorism-related criminal penalties. A government official said just because they are a member doesn't mean they will be charged with a crime, but if they do engage in violent acts they could be charged with terrorist crimes.Sending money to the organization or buying Proud Boys paraphernalia would also be a crime.“The group and its members have openly encouraged, planned, and conducted violent activities against those they perceive to be opposed to their ideology and political beliefs,” the Canadian government said in briefing materials.“The group regularly attends Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests as counter-protesters, often engaging in violence targeting BLM supporters. On January 6, 2021, the Proud Boys played a pivotal role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.”The government calls the Proud Boys a neo-fascist organization with semiautonomous chapters located in the United States, Canada, and internationally. It said it engages in political violence and that members espouse misogynistic, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, and white supremacist ideologies.“Since 2018 we have seen an escalation towards violence for this group,” Blair said.Blair said four right-wing groups including a white supremacist group called The Base that espoused using violence to accelerate overthrowing the U.S. government and Neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division were also designated as terrorist entities. They are a part of 13 additions to the list which also include three groups linked to al-Qaida, four associated with the Islamic State group and one Kashmiri organization.The Proud Boys were formed in 2016 by Canadian Gavin McInnes, who co-founded Vice Media. Tarrio said McInnes is no longer a member.Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said Trudeau's Liberal government is trying to attach their star to the anti-Trump sentiment prevalent in Canada.“Since the Proud Boys are identified with Trump, they are an easy target. Had Trump won the election, I’m confident the Liberals would not have gone after the Proud Boys,” Wiseman said.“There is right-wing extremism in Canada but much, much less than in the U.S."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-designates-proud-boys-as-a-terrorist-entity-101612399179934.html

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian riot police were justified in using harsh methods to break up protests against the sentence, saying illegal protest activity needed to be stamped out.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the ruling was “far from any rule of law”.France’s President Emmanuel Macron called it “unacceptable”, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the ruling was “pure cowardice and fails to meet the most basic standards of justice”.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov rejected Western demands as “arrogant and improper”, asserting that Moscow will not be moved by the West’s “hysterics”. He argued that the Russian police response to the protests was milder than in Western countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-shrugs-off-fury-over-navalny-s-prison-sentence-101612398863441.html

This most recent survey ran from Jan. 4-24.It found that most people trust vaccines, with two-thirds expressing strong or moderate confidence and only 12% reporting no trust at all. It also found that two-thirds of people believe getting vaccinated is important for their health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-vaccine-trust-rising-but-france-japan-others-sceptical-101612398652603.html

The army also appointed four new ministers, for a total of 18 positions so far.Medics first to protestMyanmar has started to see some protests emerge, with doctors vowing to shut hospitals across the country. A “Civil Disobedience Movement” started by pro-democracy activists including medical professionals announced on Wednesday that more than 70 hospitals and medical departments would stop work in protest of what it called an “illegitimate” government.The army has “ruthlessly” staged a coup and is “putting their own interests above our vulnerable population who have been facing medical, economic, and social hardships during this global pandemic”, reads a statement posted to the Civil Disobedience Movement’s Facebook page, which has gained more than 160,000 followers since it was started on Tuesday.Another campaign initiated by lawmakers saw residents in Myanmar’s commercial capital, Yangon, bang pots and honk car horns on Tuesday evening to show their opposition to the coup. Thousands of Burmese demonstrators gathered outside Japan’s foreign affairs ministry demanding Tokyo join its allies in taking a harder stance against the coup in Myanmar.UNSC action stallsChina on Wednesday said it was opposed to any strong resolution by the UN Security Council condemning the coup and insisted that any action by the international community shouldn’t escalate tensions.China, along with Russia, reportedly blocked efforts by the UNSC at its consultative meeting on Tuesday to issue a strong statement condemning the coup.The Group of Seven countries on Wednesday condemned the coup and said it was deeply concerned about the fate of detained political leaders.“We call upon the military to immediately end the state of emergency, restore power to the democratically-elected government, to release all those unjustly detained and to respect human rights and the rule of law,” the G7 said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-suu-kyi-charged-as-calls-to-oppose-coup-grow-101612398539484.html

The four organisations are Greenpeace France, Oxfam France, the Nicolas Hulot Foundation and Notre Affaire a Tous (Our Shared Responsibility).In its ruling, the Paris administrative court recognised ecological “deficiencies” linked to the climate crisis and held the French state responsible for failing to fully meet its goals in reducing greenhouse gases.The government said in a statement that it “took note” of the decision, and provided a list of actions in the pipeline to “allow France to respect in the future the objectives it set”.“The government remains fully engaged to take up the climate challenge and leave no one on the side of the road in this indispensable transition,” added the statement, which was signed by Barbara Pompili, the minister for ecological transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-government-held-liable-for-inaction-on-climate-crisis-in-landmark-case-101612398310221.html
04-02-2021||World||Quarantine worker at Melbourne hotel tests positive for Covid-19||After enjoying 28 straight days of no locally-acquired Covid-19 case, Melbourne has again gone back to harsher restrictions following a quarantine worker of Grand Hyatt, one of the hotels used by Australian Open, testing positive for the viral disease.The 26-year-old man, who was serving as a resident support officer as part of the Australian Open quarantine programme, has tested positive for the coronavirus.At a late night press briefing, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the worker had attended a social function in his capacity as a volunteer firefighter.He said authorities were "assuming the worst" and acting as though the man had the highly infectious UK strain of the virus.Genomic sequencing to identify the strain will be completed in the coming days."We have to assume that this person has in fact infected others," Andrews said."We are confident that people will get the information they need as quickly as possible," he added.Victoria's Covid-19 testing commander Jeroen Weimar said contact-tracing work was on throughout Wednesday night.The Grand Hyatt is one of the three hotels used by the Australian Open to quarantine more than 1,000 players and support staff ahead of the tournament.Andrews said there would be an impact on some of the Grand Slam's players and staff."There is a number of about 500, 600 people who are players and officials and others who are casual contacts," he said, adding, "They will be isolating until they get a negative test."Tennis Australia has cancelled all matches at the Melbourne Park on Thursday in the Australian Open lead-up events while players are tested.Andrews said tennis was not the most important issue."I must say that is important to us but the issues are much broader and that is about public health and public safety," he said.The announcement affects the ATP Cup, two other men's events and three WTA tournaments with more than 600 players and officials now considered casual contacts."Health authorities have advised us that a hotel quarantine worker has tested positive for COVID-19," a Tennis Australia statement read."Those associated with the Australian Open who quarantined at the hotel now need to be tested and isolated until they receive a negative test result," it said.Almost 1,200 players, coaching staff and officials arrived in Australia since last month for the competition and took the mandatory 14-day isolation.As of Thursday, Victoria has reintroduced mandatory mask rules, reduced the cap on visitors in homes and paused an increase on the number of people allowed in offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quarantine-worker-at-melbourne-hotel-tests-positive-for-covid19-101612398219936.html

"This time around, just lay low and cool it."Major US parties are an annual habit around the Super Bowl, with friends and families gathering to socialize and watch the telecast for unique advertisements as well as who wins the NFL championship."Every time we have something like this, there's always a spike, be it a holiday, Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving," Fauci said on NBC."Super Bowl is a big deal in the United States. Enjoy the game. Watch it on television. But do it with the immediate members of your family, the people in your household."A crowd of about 25,000 at the Super Bowl will include 7,500 vaccinated health care workers, but Fauci doesn't see the NFL championship showdown at Raymond James Stadium as a super-spreader event."I believe that they are trying to keep people separated enough in the stands, wearing masks, so they don't have that proximity," Fauci said on ABC's Good Morning America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-warns-americans-to-skip-super-bowl-parties-this-year-101612397928434.html
04-02-2021||World||Democrats set up showdown on Greene as GOP signals no action||House Democrats moved to oust controversial Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from two committees as GOP leader Kevin McCarthy condemned her past statements but indicated he’ll take no action to punish her.The Rules Committee of the Democratic-controlled House on Wednesday sent a resolution revoking Greene’s committee assignments to a floor vote on Thursday. No Republican sought a roll call to put their opposition on record and it was approved by the panel on a voice vote.The move was initiated by Democrats to pressure Republicans to take action against Greene, but McCarthy said they instead were creating a distraction that risked raising political tension.McCarthy said he offered to reassign Greene, who represents a district in northwest Georgia, to the Small Business Committee rather than the Education and Labor Committee, but that Democrats rejected it.In an earlier statement, McCarthy said that Greene’s past remarks “on school shootings, political violence, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories do not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican Conference.”He said he had told Greene that members of Congress have to hold themselves to a higher standard of conduct and that her past comments carry greater meaning.“Marjorie recognized this in our conversation,” McCarthy said. “I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward.”Greene’s fate and another festering controversy involving Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 GOP leader in the House, reflects the struggle within the Republican Party over its future direction and how much influence former President Donald Trump will continue to have.Greene, 46, has closely aligned herself with Trump and touted his support as she’s come under scrutiny. At the same time, some Trump loyalists are seeking to remove Cheney from her leadership post because she was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.Both were discussed by House Republicans Wednesday during their previously scheduled conference meeting.McCarthy said he defended Cheney during the meeting, but gave no details. “People can have differences of opinion that the we can have a discussions about,” he added. “Liz has the right to vote her conscience.”Several Republicans said they were unsure of whether there would be a vote on keeping Cheney in leadership.“My sense was that she wasn’t shying away from a vote,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas.Brady and Representative Jim Banks of Indiana said they hoped the House GOP would emerge more unified.Banks called some of the things Greene has said or tweeted “despicable.”“At the same time,” he added, “we had several Democrat members of Congress who’ve said despicable anti-Semitic things since they’ve been members of Congress, without making any attempt at apologize or scrub their comments from the public record.”Greene has come under harsh criticism from some fellow Republicans, including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who said “loony lies and conspiracy theories” are a “cancer” for the party and the country.Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said Tuesday that Greene “doesn’t represent the party.”“I don’t want her as the face of our party. I think it’s a great time for us to really talk about what we want to see in the upcoming years and continue to build,” Ernst told reporters. “We don’t need people that are promoting violence or anything like that.”Greene has promoted QAnon conspiracies. She’s also questioned whether a plane actually hit the Pentagon in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and whether some mass shootings in the U.S. were staged or carried out for political purposes.Greene has been using the criticism she’s facing to raise money.“I need all the support I can get so I can defend myself in the public sphere. And I won’t get any help from the Establishment wing of the Republican party,” one fundraising email said.Some Republicans have threatened to retaliate against Democrats. Republican Brian Babin of Texas has been pushing a revised version of the Democratic resolution to remove Greene from her committee seats, replacing her name with that of Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar and calling for her removal from the Foreign Affairs Committee for past comments that have used anti-Semitic tropes.“If the Democratic majority wants to go down this road, they should start by dealing with their own members who have been at this before and AFTER their election to Congress. And there is no worse offender than Ilhan Omar,” Babin said in a statement.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had addressed Omar’s remarks with her at the time and she has not said anything similar since.“There’s no such analogy to be made, there’s no comparison to be made, there’s no parallel situation,” he told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-set-up-showdown-on-greene-as-gop-signals-no-action-101612397299229.html
04-02-2021||World||Joe Biden flexible on who gets aid, tells lawmakers to 'go big'||President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers Wednesday to “act fast” on his $1.9 trillion Covid rescue plan but also signaled he's open to changes, including limiting the proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which could draw Republican support.Biden told lawmakers in private comments he's "not married" to an absolute number for the overall package but wants them to “go big" on pandemic relief and “restore the soul of the country.”“Look, we got a lot of people hurting in our country today,” Biden said on a private call with House Democrats. “We need to act. We need to act fast.”On the direct payments, Biden said he doesn’t want to budge from the $1,400 promised to Americans. But he said he is willing to “target” the aid, which would mean lowering the income threshold to qualify.“I’m not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to the American people," he said.Biden spoke with House Democrats and followed with a meeting of top Senate Democrats at the White House, deepening his public engagement with lawmakers on his American Rescue Plan. Together the virus and economic aid is his first legislative priority and a test of the administration’s ability to work with Congress to deliver.Biden’s remarks to the Democratic House caucus were relayed by two people who requested anonymity to discuss the private conference call.While Biden is trying to build bipartisan support from Republicans, he is also prepared to rely on the Democratic majority in Congress to push the package into law. Democrats moved ahead with preliminary steps, including a House budget vote Wednesday largely along party lines, to approve it on their own, over Republicans objections. A group of 10 Republican senators offered a $618 billion alternative with slimmer $1,000 direct payments and zero aid for states and cities, but Biden panned it as insufficient, though private talks with the Republicans continue.At the start of his meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and 10 top Senate Democratic committee chairmen in the Oval Office, Biden sounded confident he could still win over GOP support.“I think we’ll get some Republicans,” Biden said.With a rising virus death toll and strained economy, the goal is to have COVID-19 relief approved by March, when extra unemployment assistance and other pandemic aid measures expire. Money for vaccine distributions, direct payments to households, school reopenings and business aid are at stake.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the president fully recognizes the final package may look different than the one he initially proposed.She said further targeting the $1,400 payments “means not the size of the check, it means the income level of the people who receive the check." That’s under discussion, she said.As lawmakers in Congress begin drafting the details, Biden is taking care to politically back up his allies while also ensuring that the final product fulfills his promise for bold relief to a battered nation.House Democrats were told on the call with the president that they could be flexible on some numbers and programs, but should not back down on the size or scope of the aid.“We have to go big, not small,” Biden told the Democrats. “I’ve got your back, and you’ve got mine."As the White House reaches for a bipartisan bill, House and Senate Democrats have launched a lengthy budget process for approving Biden’s bill with or without Republican support.“We want to do it bipartisan, but we must be strong,” Schumer said after the 90-minute session at the White House. Democrats are “working with our Republican friends, when we can.”The swift action follows Tuesday's outreach as Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen joined the Democratic senators for a private virtual meeting, both declaring the Republicans' $618 billion offer was too small.Both Biden and Yellen recalled the lessons of the government response to the 2009 financial crisis, which some have since said was inadequate as conditions worsened.Earlier in the week, Biden met with 10 Republican senators who were pitching their $618 billion alternative, and told them he won't delay aid in hopes of winning GOP support even as talks continue.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell criticized the Democrats for pressing ahead largely on their own as the GOP senators try to provide bipartisan alternatives.“They’ve chosen a totally partisan path,” McConnell said. “That’s unfortunate.”The two sides are far apart. The cornerstone of the GOP plan is $160 billion for the health care response — vaccine distribution, a “massive expansion” of testing, protective gear and money for rural hospitals, similar to what Biden has proposed for aid specific to the pandemic.But from there, the two plans drastically diverge. Biden proposes $170 billion for schools, compared with $20 billion in the Republican plan. Republicans also would give nothing to states, money that Democrats argue is just as important, with $350 billion in Biden’s plan to keep police, fire and other workers on the job.The GOP's $1,000 direct payments would go to fewer people — those earning up to $40,000 a year, or $80,000 for couples. Biden's bigger $1,400 payments would extend to higher income levels, up to $300,000 for some families.The Republicans offer $40 billion for Paycheck Protection Program business aid. But gone are Democratic priorities such as a gradual lifting of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.The Delaware senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons, both Democrats from Biden's state, were at the White House earlier Wednesday and discussed with the president the need for state and local aid and the possibility of narrowing who qualifies for another round of direct payments.Coons said he's in conversations with Republicans “about on what terms are they willing to increase the amount significantly for some state and local aid.” Without that, he said, it's a “nonstarter.”Winning the support of 10 Republicans would be significant, potentially giving Biden the votes needed in the 50-50 Senate to reach the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation. Vice President Kamala Harris is the tie-breaker.But Democrats pushed ahead with votes on a budget resolution that provides groundwork for eventual approval under the reconciliation process. That would allow the bill to pass with a 51-vote Senate majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-flexible-on-who-gets-aid-tells-lawmakers-to-go-big-101612396960761.html
04-02-2021||World||UK is past peak of Covid-19 surge, with 10 million people vaccinated||The UK has passed the peak of its latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said, as the country reached the milestone of vaccinating 10 million people, about 15% of the population.“We are on a downward slope of cases, hospitalizations and deaths,” Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said at a televised press conference on Wednesday. “This peak, at least, we are past.”But Whitty, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said infections are still widespread and the state-run National Health Service would be “back in trouble extraordinarily fast” if social restrictions are lifted.Britain’s immunization program -- the most successful so far in Europe -- puts the country on track to provide shots to 15 million citizens and carers at greatest risk from the disease by Feb. 15. Johnson said it will only be possible to begin easing the lockdown three weeks after that date, once those vaccinated have received the benefits of the immunization.Johnson, who will publish a plan for relaxing the curbs on Feb. 22, said there are “signs of hope” but warned the number of people with the disease is still “alarmingly high.” A further 1,322 deaths were reported on Wednesday.InfectionsJohnson is under mounting pressure to ease restrictions from lockdown skeptics in his own party who fear shutting up businesses and schools will inflict lasting scars on the economy and society. News that vaccines are effective at cutting transmission of the disease has fueled their argument.“With better and better news by the day on the vaccination roll out and its effectiveness, the government has got to start addressing its mind to the harms caused by the measures we’re putting in place,” said Mark Harper, chairman of the so-called Covid Recovery Group of Conservative members of Parliament. “Lockdowns and restrictions cause immense damage to people’s health and livelihoods and we need to lift them as soon as it is safe to do so.”Johnson has promised to review the pandemic response after the priority groups have been given vaccines. Schools will be the first facilities to reopen in England, starting no earlier than March 8 under the government’s plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-is-past-peak-of-covid-19-surge-with-10-million-people-vaccinated-101612379086247.html
04-02-2021||World||WHO probe team visits high-security virus lab in Wuhan||A team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) visited China’s most advanced virus research lab in Wuhan on Wednesday as part of their ongoing probe into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, reports from the central Chinese city said.Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) research on some of the deadliest pathogens found in the world including the bat-hosted coronavirus.One theory – so far unproven and consistently rejected by China – says that the initial outbreak in Wuhan may have been triggered by an accidental virus leak from the bio-safety lab.Questions also remain about a possible spillover – or a zoonotic event – where the virus could have jumped from an animal host to humans.“I am looking forward to a very productive day, meeting the key people here and asking all the important questions that need to be asked,” team member Peter Daszak, who is the president of the EcoHealth Alliance, said from his car as it drove into the institute, a Reuters report from Wuhan said.Also read: China’s Covid comeback is bad news for climate as emissions risePeter Ben Embarek, a scientist leading the WHO team, told the tabloid Global Times that the international experts will meet Shi Zhengli, a leading Chinese virologist.Shi has been dubbed as China’s “bat woman” because of her intensive research on bats and the viruses they host.In a social media post on Tuesday, Daszak said the WHO experts met “with key staff in charge of livestock surveillance in Hubei Province”, and toured lab facilities and held in-depth discussions on Tuesday when the team visited an animal health facility.On Sunday, the WHO team went to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which was linked to the first cases of Covid-19 in late 2019, described by Daszak in a tweet as a “critical” stop.Meanwhile, China on Wednesday reported the fewest number of new Covid-19 cases for a single day in more than a month, the national health commission (NHC) said.A total of 25 cases were reported in the mainland on February 2, the NHC said, of which 15 were locally transmitted infections.The total number of Covid-19 cases reported in mainland China now stands at 89,619, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,636.Single dose of Oxford jab good for 12 weeks: StudyBritain’s health chief said on Wednesday that a new study suggesting that a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine provides a high level of protection for 12 weeks supports the government’s strategy of delaying the second shot so more people can quickly be protected by the first dose.Britain’s decision was criticised as risky by other European countries, but health secretary Matt Hancock said the study “backs the strategy we’ve taken and it shows the world that the Oxford vaccine works”.UK says 10mn people have been vaccinatedTen million people in the UK have been given the coronavirus vaccine, as the government’s programme to immunise the most vulnerable groups makes rapid progress. The UK is on track to provide shots to 15 million citizens and carers at greatest risk by February 15.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-probe-team-visits-high-security-virus-lab-in-wuhan-101612328149549.html
04-02-2021||India||Vizag Steel Plant staff preps for agitation against move to privatise company||Thousands of employees belonging to the Rasthtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), one of the largest state-run steel plants in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam, will take out a huge rally in the port city on Friday in protest against the NDA government’s decision of privatisation of the mega steel plant.A tweet by secretary of Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) Tuhin Kanta Pandey on Wednesday stating that the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) has cleared the privatisation of RINL, popularly known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant or Vizag Steel, has triggered an uproar among the employees on Thursday.“Whatever we have been fearing all these days has finally happened. We have been left with no option but to fight it out till the Centre withdraws the proposal,” D Adinarayana, a trade union leader of the steel plant said.Pandey tweeted that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on January 27 had given in principle approval for 100% strategic disinvestment of the Government of India shareholding in RINL along with management control by way of privatization.The employees have formed an umbrella organisation in the name of joint action committee (JAC) comprising the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) and have decided to step up the agitation in protest against the privatisation move.“We shall begin with a massive rally in Visakhapatnam with thousands of employees on Friday. Later, we shall tour all parts of the state to highlight our cause,” Adinarayana said.Though having an installed capacity of 21 million tonnes per year, the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant has presently been operating with a production capacity of only 7.3 million tonnes.“The basic reason for this underperformance of the plant is lack of raw material. Unlike Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and other such plants, the VSP does not have its captive iron ore mine. We have been depending on the supplies from Bailadila mines being run by the National Mineral Development Corporation and importing coking coal from Austria,” another senior employee VM Naidu said.He said because the other steel plants have their own captive mines, they are able to get the iron ore at a cost of ₹1500 per tonne, whereas the RINL was spending ₹7,000 per tonne. “We require 20,000 tonnes every day and that is resulting in huge losses to the company,” Naidu said.Established in 1988 after massive agitations, the RINL has been witnessing several ups and downs in the last two decades. “In 2003-04, the company was referred to the Board for Industrial Finance and Reconstruction (BIFR) for winding up due to losses, but we agitated then, too. We assured the government that we shall work hard to make the company turnaround and within two years, we proved it,” J Ayodhya Ramu, president of CITU, Vizag Steel, said.The RINL has been incurring losses over a period of time, but occasionally, it has also been making profits. In 2017-18, it incurred net losses worth ₹1,321 crore, but the next year, it bounced back with a net profit of ₹96 crore. “However, due to a slump in the market and later the Covid-19 pandemic, the production has come down resulting in losses in the next two years,” he said.“Even now, if the Central government allocates captive iron ore mines to the steel plant, we challenge that we can bring the plant back on profits and also make it run to full capacity,” Ramu said.According to Naidu, there are around 17,000 permanent employees in the RINL, besides another 16,000 contractual workers. Another 40,000 people are depending on the steel plant indirectly in the allied activities. “All their lives will be in jeopardy if the government privatises the steel plant,” he said.The employees’ unions are apprehensive that the Centre is planning to dispose of the steel plant along with lands and machinery to South Korean giant POSCO. “In fact, last year itself, the Union steel ministry signed an agreement with POSCO to set up a joint venture with RINL in the available land. But we strongly resisted. Now, they are coming through the backdoor method,” Ramu alleged.Vizag Steel has around 22,000 acres of land, acquired by the state government for the steel plant. “At the present market value, each acre costs around ₹5 crore. So, the land value itself is more than ₹one lakh crore. The Centre is likely to sell this prime property to private parties for a song, which we will strongly resist,” the trade union leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-steel-plant-staff-preps-for-agitation-against-move-to-privatise-company-101612461992531.html
04-02-2021||India||Andhra govt to buy 14,000 million units of power from 10 solar power producers||The Andhra Pradesh government on Thursday finalised the power purchase agreements with 10 solar power producers with a total installed capacity of 6,400 megawatts of power that would supply 14,000 million units of power to the state at the lowest-ever tariff of ₹2.48 per unit.Out of these 10 solar power projects, four would be set up in Kadapa, three in Anantapur, two in Prakasam and one in Kurnool districts. The bidders who won the projects include big players like National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Adani group, an official statement from the chief minister’s office said in the evening.The official note said the average tariff at which these power plants would supply to the state is ₹2.48 per unit, which is significantly lower than the tariff at which power distribution companies in the state are procuring power from other power generators.“The state will now procure 14,000 million units of power every year at this tariff from these power plants whose total installed capacity would be 6,400 MW. This additional power purchase will help the state meet the demand for uninterrupted power supply requirements of farmers free of cost,” the official note said.Every year, the state has to bear a burden of ₹10,000 crore on free power supply in the form of subsidy to Discoms. “The purchase of power at cheaper tariff from these solar power plants would reduce the subsidy burden to a large extent,” the note said.The present tariff of Rs. 2.48 would result in a savings of nearly ₹3,800 crores in the very first year and this saving is likely to increase over the years as the tariff would remain the same.“The present value of benefit accruing to the Andhra Pradesh Government exchequer over the life of this project can conservatively be estimated at ₹50,000 crore. Since these solar power projects are Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) projects, they would be transferred to the state government after 30 years,” the note said.It reminded that during the previous Telugu Desam Party regime, power purchase agreements were signed with various solar power companies at exorbitant tariffs, ranging from ₹5.25 to ₹5.90 per unit. “The developers got unreasonably high returns on their investments and the State government and the Discoms had been subjected to a very huge financial burden,” the CMO note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-to-buy-14-000-million-units-of-power-from-10-solar-plants-101612462023913.html
04-02-2021||India||Govt has empowered farmers: Modi||LUCKNOW Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday listed out all that his government has done to empower India’s farmers in the 2021 Budget and in prior years, in another outreach to protestors demanding the repeal of three contentious farm laws aimed at opening up agricultural markets..For one thing, the government has decided to connect at least 1,000 mandis (agricultural markets) to the eNAM online agricultural trading platform to turn the markets into centres of profit for farmers, the prime minister said in a speech by video link to mark the centenary of the Chauri Chaura event, a landmark moment in the history of India’s freedom struggle. “Now, when farmers go to mandis to sell their produce they will be able to do so with ease at any place across the country,” said the Prime Minister, who released a stamp to mark the centenary.In addition, Modi noted that the Centre had allocated ₹40,000 crore for the development of rural infrastructure in the budget for financial year 2021-22, which has been described by many economists as a growth-oriented package aimed at boosting the pandemic-ravaged economy.”Farmers will directly benefit from investment in the infrastructure sector,” the PM said. “The decision of the Centre will make farmers atmanirbhar (self-reliant). Agriculture will turn into a profitable venture for farmers.” February 4 marks 100 years of an event that took place in Chauri Chaura, a village in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh, known as United Province in British India, when a large group of protesters participating in Mahatma Gandhi’s non-cooperation movement clashed with the police, who opened fire. In retaliation, the protestors set fire to a police station. The incident left three civilians and 22 policemen dead. Days later, a saddened Gandhi halted the non-cooperation movement. Modi said the fire lit by the protestors was not confined to the police precinct. It reached the hearts of the people of India, infusing them with the desire for achieving independence from colonial rule. Modi’s speech has come amid protests by thousands of farmers massed on the borders of the national capital demanding the repeal of three contentious laws pushed through by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.The laws aim to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce by setting up free markets, which will co-exist with regulated markets, allow food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements.Farm unions say free markets under the laws will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices and make them vulnerable to exploitation by corporate giants. The Supreme Court put the three laws on hold on January 12.In his speech, Modi said farmers had contributed record foodgrain production during the pandemic year, and become the base of progress achieved by the country. Modi said the Swamitwa Yojana (Ownership Scheme) launched by the government in Uttar Pradesh last year will also benefit farmers, who will receive documents of ownership of their land and houses. The ownership document will not only raise the value of their property, but they will also get loan from banks with ease, Modi said.“Efforts of the government are changing the scenario in the Gorakhpur region, known as the land of revolutionaries. Earlier, factories were closed, roads were damaged and hospitals remained closed. Now, the Gorakhpur fertiliser factory is starting. Farmers will benefit and young people will get employment, :he said. Modi said the Budget will enable the country meet the challenges on the road ahead in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Before the budget was presented, several experts said the country faces a crisis and the centre will have to increase taxes, put the burden on the common man. But the centre ensured that no burden was put on the people,” Modi said. The Centre has, instead, decided to increase spending to accelerate development. “Expenditure will be on construction of wide roads to connect villages with towns, mandis and markets; construction of bridges, laying of railway tracks, starting new trains, buses; improvement of education; to provide more opportunities of employment to the young,” he said. He also mentioned India’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and its vaccination drive from which, Modi said, several countries were drawing lessons. Alongside manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines, India is exporting them to countries who need them, he said. “Now, the Centre is working to provide quality medical facilities to people in rural areas so that they do not have to go to cities for treatment of minor health problems. To ensure that they do not face any problem in getting medical services, a big decision has been taken in the budget -- now modern testing laboratories will be established in each district and people will get health services in villages too. The Centre has increased the budget allocation for the health sector,” he said. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the Prime Minister should also have paid tribute to the 150 farmers who have died in the course of the protest, accusing the government of betraying farmers. “Farmers across the country have united to launch a movement against the government, he said. Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati has demanded a repeal of the three laws in solidarity with the protesting farmers, the party’s general secretary Lalji Verma said. “Instead of talking with the farmers, the central government is trying to suppress their movement. It clearly shows the anti- farmer attitude of the central government,” Verma said. Samajwadi Party’s national president and former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said the Bharatiya Janata Party should take a lesson from the Chauri Chaura movement, and repeal the three laws.Hem Chandra Singh, president of the Purvanchal Kisan Union, said that instead of talking to the farmers, the Centre was trying to suppress their agitation, which is against the spirit of the freedom struggle and the ideals of Chauri Chaura activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-has-empowered-farmers-modi-101612462090858.html
04-02-2021||India||We’ve sought to address needs, efficiency, equity: NK Singh||The Constitution, through Article 280 to 281, provides for finance commissions every five years as a mechanism for sharing of taxes and revenues vertically between the Centre and states; and horizontally among all states, based on levels of development, demographic outcomes, prosperity and regional needs. The final report of the 15th Finance Commission for 2021-26 has now been made public. The Union government, in its action taken report on the commission’s report tabled in Parliament, has accepted most of the recommendations, and overtly rejected none. The 15th FC had the onerous task of devolving resources at a time when the pandemic has devastated the economy, shrinking the resource pie. The chairman of the 15th FC, NK Singh, spoke to Zia Haq about the report. Edited excerpts:What were the philosophical underpinnings and approach of the 15th FC? Your report states that “stability and predictability of resources is an essential component of good long-term budgeting for both Union and States”. The history of the Finance Commission is embedded in the legacy of unalloyed confidence and trust. When the Constituent Assembly in its debates was unable to come to a conclusion of how the resources were to be divided between the Union and states, various mechanisms were considered at that time. Earlier it was said that nothing was shareable, except income tax, and you know the finance commission in a sense is older than our Constitution, because the Independence was in 1947, whereas the Constitution came into play only in 1950. So, there was a period they had appointed an interim chairman of the finance commission under CD Deshmukh because the Constituent Assembly had asked him to do it. He had given a certain framework on the division of resources. Then the Constitution got adopted and the 1st FC under KC Neogi was constituted. Since then it has had an unbroken legacy, an unbroken record embedded in bipartisanship, fair play and has been totally ideologically neutral. In terms of receiving the requests, each of the states and the Union government… and then looking at what would be their expenditure, looking at their likely revenue, what would be a fair distribution of these resources between the entities of the Union and the states, and thereafter what would be a reasonable basis for allocation. And if there were obvious gaps after the revenue expenditure of the state had been calibrated in an optimum way and the revenues had been projected in a somewhat optimistic way. Now, if there were inescapable gaps, what amount of it was reasonable to fill up by taking recourse to Article 275 of the Constitution, by way of revenue-deficit grants. Thereafter, two big changes took place. One was that the third tier (urban local bodies and panchayats) was brought into play by the two constitutional amendments (73rd and 74th), which assigned responsibilities to the FCs and second, the Disaster Management Act 2005 was enacted and it became customary for assignment of resources for disaster management. Also, it gave greater latitude to the President in asking the FC’s views on any other matter which the president may choose in the interest of sound finance. Over these 72 years or so, the dynamics of the Indian economy have changed enormously. From an economy originally depended on imported foodgrains and scrambling for shortage of foreign exchange to an economy, given the liberalisation and successive crisis, that has matured and evolved, we see that the needs and obligations from the states have increased. There are two important points. One is the recognition that the Union government had obligations that went beyond the strict interpretation of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution (which specifies allocation of subjects between Union and states, containing three lists: Union list, state list and concurrent list), namely what went beyond what was assigned to the Union government in terms of taking care of national priorities of the states. The birth of centrally sponsored schemes and the central outlays… these were important changes. Second was that the number of states increased rather significantly, many states required special treatment particularly, those who have a small population, hilly terrain etc. So these transformative changes have led to the evolution of the role, responsibility and obligation of the FCs. What states look forward to most in every report is the devolution formula, which you have maintained. It’s 41%, with a 1% downward adjustment (from 42% earlier) because of two new Union territories. You assigned a weight of 12.5% for demographic performance, which is the inverse of the fertility rate. You have said the 2011 Census better represents the needs of states. Was the biggest challenge for you was to not penalise efficient states, demographically speaking, at the cost of the inefficient? When the 15th FC was constituted, there were great worries. In the terms of reference, the President asked the commission to use the data of the 2011 Census in respect of the population criteria if population was to be used as a criterion for purposes of the assignment of the horizontal distribution. Then, there were strong protests by some states, particularly the southern states, because they would be big losers because they had controlled population well. It was argued that it would result in rewarding the inefficient and penalising the efficient. It was a challenge to therefore deal with this conundrum. We had no option because use of the 2011 data was a given fact by the president. It is the president’s right to assign a particular way in which we look at the criteria. Now, what are the options we had? One option, which was a hypothetical option, was... in total neglect of any past practice to ignore population completely as a criterion and to do it on the basis of some other criterion. The Constitution doesn’t bind me to use any particular criterion. But then we came to the conclusion that let us see what else could we have used. Some suggestions were made that maybe we could do it on the basis of per capita income. The result would have been that again the states that have the lowest per capita income would have the highest population density. In effect it would have meant that those states where rates of growth had been poor would get rewarded unduly and states with higher growth rates would get penalised. So the income distance criteria would begin to also mirror this phenomenon. So we went back to the drawing board and said, why not take the bull by the horn? Why not face the problem squarely and say, yes, there’s an X amount which used to be historically given on the basis of weightage to population in the horizontal formula and now we have to use the 2011 (population data) and break that into two parts. One part you give it on the basis of population, whatever weight you assign, and two, you actively reward states that have managed their demography better; which reflects what? Namely, greater investments they have made in girl-child education, managed their health parameters better, and have got a better governance matrix. So, in many ways assigning a positive weight in demographic management embedded the investments those states had made in the social sector particularly health and education. We found that in this way we would be able to mitigate any adverse consequences to some extent of what would be the outcome. Broadly speaking, in this horizontal distribution, there are three important factors which we have pointed out in the report. We have sought to balance need, efficiency and equity. The population reflects the need; the weight given to geographical area represents the need; the income distance criterion, namely the per capita income, represents the equity part. In what way are we rewarding efficiency? By giving weightage to the demographic criteria and also giving some weightage to the fiscal achievements to the state. So in some ways therefore if you look at these, each of these criteria...the forest area also represents the need... are evenly divided in some ways. Many of the southern states were extremely nervous about what would happen to them. They feared that they would be penalised for getting their population under control. Do you think you have adequately addressed those concerns now? Adequacy is a subjective norm. The best way this would have been addressed is a situation where we hadn’t used population as a criteria at all. But then I explained you would have had other kind of choices. Instead of saying ‘adequately addressed’, let me say ‘reasonably mitigated’, or ‘responsibly mitigated’. The concern of the southern states was not only the award of the 15th FC, but they looked a bit ahead -- that if, for the purpose of the delimitation of the constituencies, this was going to be the pattern of using the most contemporary population census data, what would happen in terms of the nature their representation in Parliament and the size of their Assemblies, and therefore the number of the seats they would elect to Rajya Sabha. That was fortunately not a concern with us but I know that embedded in their minds was also this particular concern. You could say that we have tried to in some ways redressed this in a manner we considered appropriate. In spite of what we did as we had done, to mitigate this , it turned out to be that many of the states would have had a huge yawning resource deficit. That is why, ₹2.95 lakh crore given by way of revenue-deficit grants... if you look at the states who are beneficiaries of this, huge amount has gone to Andhra Pradesh, huge amount has gone to Kerala. Kerala was one of the states where the demographic management was one of the best. Some has gone to Telangana. The way we have calibrated these revenue-deficit grants, we looked at this... as you can see there’s one full volume in the report devoted to the states. We subjected each of the states to very careful scrutiny, then we worked out what would be the minimum inescapable revenue expenditure, we compressed that and calculated the maximum amount of resources that they were likely to generate on a normative basis and concluded that this is the inescapable gap between the inescapable minimum expenditure and what is likely to be the optimum revenue. We have therefore assigned revenue-deficit grants. A fair amount of that has gone to states who would have been the unaddressed factor in spite of the mitigation on account of the use of the 2011 data. Have we succeeded totally? One classic example to be honest is that we have not been able to take care of, for instance, Karnataka because it has managed its finances in a reasonable way and their expenditures have very low and their revenues have been reasonable. So I have no answer to this question. A state like Karnataka I was not able to give revenue-deficit grant. I couldn’t reinvent a formula to overcome this handicap. I did try to address the concerns of Karnataka by giving them some state-specific grants for the rejuvenation of lakes and water bodies and some important places, particularly rejuvenation of Bangalore and Mysore. Do you think some states would still have reasonable grounds to complain? Sure, I think that is quite legitimate. We must also recognise that for many FCs, the weightage given to per capita income was much more than what we have given. If we had stuck to those weightages, their injury would have been far more significant. The issue of equity would have got greatly compromised. The lowest per capita income is of Bihar. Bihar, UP and Rajasthan, these are known as the really backward states. You would recall that in the earlier government, they appointed a committee under Raghuram Rajan to come up with the multiple index on the backwardness of states. In that multiple index Raghu had done at that time, Bihar and Odisha were at the rock bottom. In this case, Odisha has also done better subsequent to Raghu’s report; Odisha has managed its demography also well; so Odisha is not too happy Maybe this will get mitigated when some of their special projects, such as the cyclone, get addressed. You have recommended a fiscal glide path whose imprint is more or less clear in the Budget. You have also recommended a committee to review the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM). What prompted this? In the FRMB committee, which I chaired, what we were aiming at then and also during the terminal period of the 15th FC, was to look at the debt-to-GDP (ratio) to be 60% -- 40 for the Central government, and 20 for the states. We had done a calibrated fiscal-deficit trajectory which would enable this level of debt to be reached. So that’s now embedded in history, and overtaken by events in a very dramatic way. We are no more in that world. The world has changed in some important respects: The pandemic permanently changed the structure of the global economy. When I chaired the FRBM committee, the focus was the central government and as far as the states were concerned the committee said this would be left to a subsequent FC. I didn’t know then I was going to head that FC. But investors look at the general government debt. FDI looks to general government. So that FRBM which had reference to the central government, where states were not in the picture, has changed. That’s why I proposed that we need to have a fundamental re-look at this overall framework, the changed global context and the changed national context in which we make the states and the central government equal partners. That is why I have not given a point (for fiscal deficit) both for the central government and the states, but a range (of fiscal deficit). Why had I suggested a fixed point in the FRBM committee? The reason is in parliamentary democracies, the tendency is to adhere to the upper end of the range given the populist pressures for public outlays.That logic doesn’t hold good anymore. Giving fixed number is to build in inflexibility and I am increasingly coming around to the view that this framework needs not to be pro-cyclical, it needs to work in accordance with the tandem of the cycle; and therefore a cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit and debt norm would be more appropriate. I have given the states a leeway to go up to 4% and taper down to 3% (fiscal deficit) much later. I have given a 0.5% leeway for purposes of reform in the power sector. Why did I select [the] power [sector]? When I visited all the states, the giant and the gorilla in the room is power. Look at any state’s finances, it is the power sector and unbridged financial gaps in the power sector that is critical. The 0.5% headroom for borrowing by states was quite in line with what we had experienced during our visit to states. If there is a shortfall in Goods and Services Tax compensation, and states have to borrow, that should not be debited against what we have proposed i.e. 4% and 0.5. The important thing I realised is that there no point in any debt framework which doesn’t involve the partnership of the states. Given the events of the last year, do you think our thinking of fiscal mathematics not just in India but the world has undergone a change? I would say yes. Who else, if you think among the global economists, write and have written continuously on this? I am not going to an extreme version like Larry Summers (former chief economist of the World Bank)... no Larry is not one who may be regarded as a fiscal fetishist, but there were others like Stanley Fischer (former vice chair of US Federal Reserve). Stan has been writing and saying that the entire literature in relation to the fiscal issue by eminent economists has undergone a rethink in terms of the importance of the role of public outlays, particularly on the need for them to play a proactive role on rejuvenating of infrastructure and more importantly employment, given in terms of what (labour-saving) technologies have done and also in terms of health and education. So I agree with you that the literature on fiscal policy has undergone a change. To give you an anecdote, I was invited to give a lecture to the finance ministers of all Commonwealth countries. The title of my lecture was fiscal forbearance. People talk of monetary forbearance. But I talked of fiscal forbearance in times of this kind, which represents in some ways the changing ethos. Similarly, in the last OECD fiscal networking conference, the thinking on this fiscal issue has been an evolving one. OECD has been one of the flag carriers with regard to adherence to fiscal policies. The Germans have had a very strong influence if you recall. So all that... I agree entirely has undergone and is undergoing a change. In our federation, it’s much more important for the states to become increasingly involved in all of this. If I were to ask you a hypothetical question, that if there was no implicit guarantee upon the charge of the consolidated fund of each individual state government, don’t you think that the market would have displayed their hesitation. For instance, if we looked anecdotally at the debt today of Punjab, it’s so high, and yet Punjab successfully borrows market development loans because there is an implicit state guarantee and unlike the US constitution, there is no such thing as federal bankruptcy. California can get bankrupt, I cannot imgaine any state becoming bankrupt. The issue of the sovereign guarantee -- that’s why I think we need to consider the states and the Centre in a holistic way. The hobbling implementation of GST has been a structural problem and the 15th FC has made key recommendations to reform it, including simplifying the inverted duty structure. Your comments. I have a feeling that there is deep realisation on the part of the finance minister, reflected in the statement I have seen by the revenue secretary on this issue of GST, and he was asked this pointed question maybe by your paper, about the 15th FC recommendation in our fairly robust chapter on resources (Chapter 5, Volume I), and what he intended to do. He said ‘these are all work in progress’ and because of the pandemic, the GST Council has not been able to deliberate on them. I think clearly on this whole story of invoice matching, you could see the budget talking on this, on invoice manipulation, and in terms of much better compliance... you see there are fundamental issues of the inverted duty structure, there are issues of moving towards a more standardised set of rates. I am not wanting to take the extreme view of one rate only but you can have one standard rate, one merit (goods) rate and one which may be called the penal rate but no more than three (rates) and we have said so. It is our expectation and sanguine belief that our key suggestions would be considered by the GST Council. It is of vital concern. I’m happy to say the finance minister and finance secretary are acutely aware of all of this and will take it as soon as things return to normalcy. You have said that the efficiency measure of the GST is around 50% and can be taken up to advanced economy benchmarks of 60%. What else will it take? The literature on how and what has been called the revenue-neutral rate and there’s been a lot of debate on this. I recall that years ago, when the idea of GST had begun to take shape and I was still the revenue secretary, we had worked out a revenue-neutral rate, which was in the region of 14-15%. The average rate what we see now is 11%. What I mean really is that these are not necessarily raising rates but these are within the entire basket that you need to recalibrate in a manner which would approximate what would be regarded by economists a revenue-neutral rate. That would mean a deeper rationalisation in many ways. So I believe that the GST Council which I had the privilege to address once also believed that future FCs should have a greater partnership with the GST Council because the two are very intimately connected. You have looked at the whole idea of defence in somewhat innovative way and recommended creation of a non-lapsable defence and security fund. On defence, we got special terms of reference. It was not, so to say, spontaneous. I had the experience of working in the ministry of home also looking after paramilitary forces. In that sense I have a little bit of hangover. I realised having been expenditure secretary that there was a huge mismatch between the expenditure cycle and financial cycle of the defence ministry. The procurements are so complicated and the need to be clear of any controversy that by the time they are ready, the finances are not there. There is this inherent mismatch with regards to capital expenditure. Also, I realised the need for predictability and stability for the capital expenditure on the defence side. Keeping pace with technology often meant that they need a resource. So I played with many ideas. The other thing was how to make states partners in this process. The issue of defence really transcends any list. I obtained many legal opinions on this. I obtained the opinion of (Kesava) Parasaran. When I had gone to the late Mr Jaitley, for whom I had great affection, I asked him that there is this complex issue which is troubling me; he said there is only one person who will know but will not give you the opinion. I said why, because he is 93 years old. Yet, I rang up Parasaran, who gave important opinions. One, he said I cannot play around what is in the divisible pool and there’s nothing I can to do to impose any condition on the resources from the divisible pool and that will have a constitutional infirmity. Second, he said there’s no question that the defence of India is of paramount responsibility. So then we were hard put to fund resources. I visited some of the defence establishments. I visited Pangong, Leh, I saw some of the stuff. We said we must create a non-lapsable defence fund and to bridge this asymmetric cycle. I had done so for the road cess. That’s how I came up with the non-lapsable fund and the funding of it. In defence funding what I have done, before the fund becomes a part of the divisible pool, you understand the gross revenue reciepts (GRR) and gross tax revenue (GTR), I calibrated the GRR by 1% and got the amount which I wanted, and added it to the monetisation of the surplus defence land, added it to the proceeds of the disinventment of defence units, and added it to the liabilities of different entities which owed to defence establishments. So four sources of income outlined towards the creation of a non-lapsable fund. Can you talk about any discomfort that states have right now with the new kind of fiscal federalist architecture that’s come in where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to sort of segregate matters of financial management of states? I think that area also needs a rethink. Do you think if I had asked you the hypopthetical question that the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution (the part which divides domains into central, states and joint Centre-states jurisdiction) has outlived its purpose, what would be the answer? In my view, yes. The Seventh Schedule decided to classify between the three categories... what would be in the exclusive category of the Union, exclusive domain of the states, and what would be in the concurrent list. There was a degree of clarity in that. Over a period of time, you have really transgressed from one end to the other. Most of the centrally sponsored schemes are subjects which are classic subjects in the domain of the states, such as employment, food, education. You have now standalone parliamentary legislation, which are justiciable, in areas such as employment like MNREGA, you have given a major boost to resources for right to education. Take for example a function number one for states, which is law and order. They have taken up a whole new centrally sponsored scheme under health. So the Seventh Schedule requires a revisit. So does the entry under Article 282 of the Constitution which has been used and misused for having all the centrally sponsored schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weve-sought-to-address-needs-efficiency-equity-nk-singh-101612462090254.html
04-02-2021||India||US says it supports reform but cautions against curbs||The US on Thursday weighed in on the ongoing farmers’ agitation at New Delhi’s borders for the first time since it began in November-end, saying peaceful protests and unhindered access to information, including the internet, were hallmarks of a “thriving democracy”, but at the same time backed reforms that would increase efficiency of Indian markets and attract more private investment.The carefully worded response by Joe Biden’s administration also encouraged a “dialogue” between farmers and the government to end the agitation that has been getting global attraction with international celebrities such as pop star Rihanna and green activist Greta Thunberg tweeting in support of the protesters. The external affairs ministry said the comments by the US must be seen in their entirety, while pointing out that State Department “has acknowledged” India’s steps towards reforms, which have emerged as a point of contention. The government also appeared to draw parallels between a farmers’ rally on January 26 that plunged into chaos and the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by Donald Trump’s supporters protesting election results that declared his defeat in the presidential race.“We recognise that peaceful protests are a hallmark of any thriving democracy and note that the Indian Supreme Court has stated the same,” a US State Department spokesperson said in Washington in response to a request for comment from US media. A version of it was provided to HT. “We encourage that any differences between the parties be resolved through dialogue.”In New Delhi, a US embassy spokesperson echoed a similar response. The State Department did not mention anything specific to three new farm laws that have triggered the agitation (now in its 71st day), but appeared supportive of reforms. “In general, the United States welcomes steps that would improve the efficiency of India’s markets and attract greater private sector investment,” the spokesperson said.“We recognise that unhindered access to information, including the internet, is fundamental to the freedom of expression and a hallmark of a thriving democracy,” the spokesperson added, a remark that came in the backdrop of internet curbs at protest sites. Asked about the US position at a news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Any protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse.” Describing India and the US as vibrant democracies with shared values, Srivastava added: “The incidents of violence and vandalism at the historic Red Fort on January 26 have evoked similar sentiments and reactions in India as did the incidents on the Capitol Hill on January 6 and are being addressed as per our respective local laws.” He said “temporary measures” on internet access in parts of the National Capital Region were “undertaken to prevent further violence”. Michael Kugelman, South Asia expert at leading think-tank Wilson Center, Washington’s comments were unlikely to trouble the Narendra Modi government.“What strikes me about these comments is their neutrality. Aside from some soft criticism that the State Department made about the internet blocks...they don’t convey anything that New Delhi would find disagreeable. Washington is essentially saying it agrees with India’s new farm laws and with any peaceful protestors that may oppose them,” Kugelman said.Milan Vaishnav, South Asia expert with Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, “I actually found the State Department statement to be quite balanced. While the statement reiterates the right of Indians to peacefully protest, it also expressed its support for the underlying motivations of the farm reform bills. In my view, I think U.S. diplomats threaded the needle very well. I would also add that the MEA seems to have also picked up on this--highlighting, in its response, U.S. support for continued market reforms in agriculture. The MEA statement also links the Jan 26th incursion at the Red Fort to the January 6 Capitol insurrection, a not-so-subtle message that the U.S. is facing its own domestic infirmities.”Tens of thousands of farmers have camped at Delhi’s borders, demanding the repeal of the three contentious laws passed by Parliament in September. Eleven rounds of talks between the protesters and the government have failed to break the impasse. Protesters say the laws will hurt their livelihood and leave them at the mercy of big corporations. The government defends the laws as necessary for long-overdue reforms in the agriculture sector.On Republic Day, violence broke out during a tractor rally by farmers after a section of the protesters veered off the routes agreed with police and resorted to vandalism. Clashes broke out in several places, including the 17th-century Red Fort and the ITO intersection. On that day, internet services were suspended, albeit temporarily, at three key protest sites — Singhu and Tikri (on Haryana border), and Ghazipur (on Uttar Pradesh border). Services were suspended again on January 29 for two days, and then extended till February 3.After the violence, authorities stepped up security at the protest sites, placing iron spikes and steel barricades to prevent the agitators from entering Delhi.The agitation landed in global spotlight after Rihanna, who has 101 million followers, tweeted a CNN news report about internet curbs on Tuesday. Meena Harris, an American lawyer and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, actor Amanda Cerny, singers Jay Sean and Dr Zeus, and US sporting icons Juju Smith Schuster, Baron Davis and Kyle Kuzma supported the farmers. They were joined by lawmakers from the UK, the US and other countries.On Wednesday, India said criticism by foreign celebrities and attempts to “mobilise international support” against the country on the government’s handling of the protests without ascertaining facts were “neither accurate nor responsible”. In a rare statement, the external affairs ministry contended that “vested interest groups” were trying to enforce their agenda, referring to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others”. It didn’t name anyone.While Indian movie stars such as Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn said citizens should focus on the government’s efforts to resolve the farmers’ crisis, others appeared to be on the opposite side of the debate. “If one tweet rattles your unity, one joke rattles your faith or one show rattles your religious belief then it’s you who has to work on strengthening your value system not become ‘propaganda teacher’ for others,” actor Taapsee Pannu posted.The tug of war continued on Thursday. Opposition parties stepped up attack on the government even as leaders of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched a counter-offensive.“The issue is not Rihanna or Greta Thunberg or any individual. The issue is the manner in which the government is countering the farmers’ protests as though they were an invading army,” senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram tweeted. “There are many Gretas among Indian women and girls, but they are shackled by poverty, social constraints and fear. Sooner than later, India’s Gretas will find their voices and speak in favour of the farmers,” he added.Late on Thursday evening, farm leader Rakesh Tikait said, “If some foreigner is supporting the movement, then what’s the problem? They are not giving or taking anything from us.”In Nagpur, BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis told reporters that there was an international conspiracy to defame India and spark chaos and unrest in the country. “How an international conspiracy is going on has been revealed with the tweets. India is being defamed using the platform of farmers’ protest,” Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Valerie Vaz, a senior MP of Britain’s Labour Party and sister of former lawmaker Keith Vaz, wrote a letter to foreign minister Dominic Raab to reiterate the concerns of her constituents regarding events related to the farmers’ protest. The Indian-origin MP was among 35 British lawmakers to take up the farmers’ protest with Raab before he visited India in December. Vaz asked Raab to contact the Indian government “as a matter of urgency regarding these concerning events”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-says-it-supports-reform-but-cautions-against-curbs-101612461910208.html
04-02-2021||India||AIADMK files police complaint after Sasikala flies party flag in her car||Tamil Nadu’s ruling AIADMK on Thursday evening lodged a complaint with Tamil Nadu director general of police, J K Tripathy against expelled leader V K Sasikala for using the party’s flag in her car after she was discharged from Bengaluru’s Victoria hospital on January 31The complaint is the latest in a series of actions by the AIADMK which is tightening its grip on the party apparatus ahead of Sasikala’s return to Chennai on February 8, a day later than originally planned.Law minister C V Shunmugam, fisheries minister D Jayakumar and other senior AIADMK leaders went to the DGP’s office to file the complaint seeing action against Sasikala.“Only AIADMK’s cadre and leadership can use the flag...Sasikala has no right to use the flag,” K Munusamy, deputy coordinator of AIADMK told reporters after submitting the complaint. He added that according to the party by-laws, once every five years existing office bearers should also renew their membership which wasn’t done by Sasiakla so she ceased to be a member.After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi in January, chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami had made clear that the party will not take back Sasikala.After Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, the AIADMK elected Sasikala as the interim general secretary. She was set to become chief minister but after her imprisonment in February 2017, the warring factions of Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam united. In September 2017, they expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran who had launched a breakaway faction - Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK). After her release from prison last month, Dhinakaran said that Sasikala remains the general secretary and her supporters will help her reclaim the AIADMK.A case is pending in the Madras high court where Sasikala has challenged the conduct of a general council meeting that expelled her. Sasikala also plans to file a curative petition to claim the AIADMK's two leaves symbol and name which the election commission allotted to the Palaniswami-led faction in November 2017.The Delhi high court and Supreme court had dismissed her petitions challenging and reviewing this order. Alluding to the fact that curative petitions rarely find success and taking a swipe at Sasikala’s family belonging to Mannargudi, Shunmugam said, “Beyond this if she wants to proceed with the case, she can go to the United Nations or the Mannargudi panchayat.”On Wednesday night, the AIADMK removed its Karnataka secretary M P Yuvaraj for planning to meet Sasikala. in the past week, the party has sacked several functionaries for putting up posters welcoming Sasikala as the 'party general secretary'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-files-police-complaint-after-sasikala-flies-party-flag-in-her-car-101612460146178.html

The Centre had already conveyed to the Delhi Police that additional central paramilitary forces are on standby if required. Currently, over 60 companies (6,000 personnel) of central paramilitary forces are assisting the Delhi Police at various borders.The home ministry has also claimed that internet has not been suspended at Delhi’s borders beyond 11 pm on Tuesday.The farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur for over two months now demanding that the Centre repeal the controversial laws, a demand rejected by the Centre.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities for farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-meets-delhi-top-cop-nsa-doval-ahead-of-chakka-jam-on-february-6-101612460196523.html

The ministry of external affairs on Wednesday in response to international celebrities tweeting about the farmers’ protests launched two hashtags #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda and claimed that vested interests were working towards maligning India’s international image.Sonakshi Sinha in her Instagram Story shared statements that said that the issues of suspension of internet and basic amenities for farmers at Delhi’s borders have now attracted global attention and one should not view the criticisms with an anti-India lens. “Journalists are being harassed. Internet has been banned. Protesters are being vilified through state and media propaganda. Hate speech (desh ke gaddaro ko, goli maro sardaro ko resurfaced) is flourishing. That is the issue that's taken global centre stage,” the statement said. The statements were posted by a handle @storysellercomics, which the Bollywood actor shared.Her Instagram story further added that the tweets made by international celebrities are to reiterate their support for human rights. “To reiterate, (the) news tonight will try to paint a picture that 'outside forces' are trying to meddle in the functioning of our country. Please don't give in to that narrative. It's human, standing up for other humans. THAT'S the narrative,” it said.“The voices raised are about the violation of human rights, suppressions of free internet and expression, state propaganda, hate speech and abuse of power,” it added.After pop artist Rihanna tweeted an article demanding a conversation of the ongoing farmers’ protests, Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg, Meena Harris, an American lawyer and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, actors Amanda Cerni, singers Jay Sean, Dr Zeus and former adult star Mia Khalifa also tweeted in support of farmers' protest.Delhi Police on Thursday registered a case against unknown persons for fomenting ‘disaffection and ill-will against the Indian government’ under the guise of supporting farmers’ unions.

04-02-2021||India||Budget 2021-22 will fuel entrepreneurial spirit among Indians: Sitharaman||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said despite the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, the Budget 2021-22 has not levied any new tax on the people, instead it has relied on non-tax resources other than just disinvestment for enhanced capital investments that will spur growth.“I underline that we have not burdened any section of Indian society with any additional demand for even an additional rupee,” the finance minister said at a closed-door virtual meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI).Sitharaman on Monday unveiled a Union Budget providing significant increase in health and capital expenditure to boost the economy that contracted by 23.9% in the first quarter of the current financial year mainly because of a 68-day hard nationwide lockdown since March 25, 2020, but quickly recovered to contract by a slower 7.5% in the next quarter ended September 30. The recently launched Covid-19 vaccination drive has given a further boost with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting 11.5% growth for India in 2021-22 and the Economic Survey estimating a real growth of 11%.“This Budget marks a clear directional change for the Indian economy and that directional change is not what the government has offered as a sudden response, but it was something that was preoccupying the Indian minds for over 30 years,” she said while addressing FICCI’s national executive committee meeting on Thursday.This Budget is trying to raise resources which are non-tax resources at a time when we need a lot of money to spend, FICCI said in a statement quoting her. “It’s a budget which raises resources but not on the back of increased taxation. There is a directional change in the budget which is so distinct that it will fuel the entrepreneurial spirit which Indians show given the right opportunities,” she added.Stating that revenue generation would improve through this year, she expressed confidence about robust collection of non-tax revenue other than just disinvestments through various other monetisation of assets.Sitharaman also urged the industry to come forward to make investments. “I hope the industry will understand the spirit with which the budget is placed before you and therefore also come forward to participate in this inevitable exercise. Industry, having cleared all its debts and finances, should now be in a position to invest money to expand and grow and clearly show signs that it is now ready to receive any joint ventures for the sake of technology that it prefers to have,” she said.For providing immediate stimulus to the economy, the government will be spending in a big way in public infrastructure and three large areas where big ticket expenditure will happen include infrastructure, health and agriculture. “Government alone, even if it brings bags full of money, cannot meet the demand of growing and aspirational India,” Sitharaman said.Speaking about the Budget proposal to set up Development Financial Institutions (DFI), the finance minister said the government will enable one DFI and the entire financing of long-term infrastructure will happen in a very market-driven way, which itself will bring in efficiency.The government has taken up a confident, trustworthy and transparent accounting statement in our budget, she said. “There is no patching up or white washing. It has made an honest attempt to give an honest statement of the government’s finances and with the reforms announced along with the stimulus. It is clear that this government is not sitting cautiously, and it is coming forward with faith in Indian industry and business leaders,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2021-22-will-fuel-entrepreneurial-spirit-among-indians-sitharaman-101612451346291.html

Suu Kyi's party swept the election while the military-backed party fared poorly.Asked about the situation in Myanmar during a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “India and Myanmar are neighbours with close cultural and people-to-people ties, bolstered by trade, economic, security and defence-related exchanges.“We are therefore monitoring developments in that country closely. We are also engaged on the issue as a member of the UN Security Council.”India, he said, has extended assistance to Myanmar in its fight against Covid-19 by providing medicines, test kits and vaccines. “We remain committed to continuing our humanitarian support for the people in Myanmar in mitigating the health and economic impact of the pandemic,” he added.The Myanmar military’s actions have undermined the country’s gradual return to democracy and sparked uncertainty about a fragile peace process to end a decades-old insurgency by more than 20 armed ethnic groups. The developments in Myanmar could also have implications for security in India’s northeastern states, as several militant groups from the region have bases in the neighbouring country.Myanmar's junta blocked Facebook and WhatsApp in the name of ensuring stability on Thursday even as street protests were reported from some cities. Activists have been using Facebook to oppose the military coup and organise protests.Suu Kyi has been charged with possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies, giving the military legal grounds to detain her for a fortnight.Soon after the coup, India had expressed concern and said the rule of law and democratic process must be upheld.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/closely-monitoring-developments-in-myanmar-says-india-101612456781774.html

According to the ministry, West Bengal has 53 on-going projects including new lines, gauge conversion, doubling projects costing ₹48,275 crore for 4463 km.He also said due to the non-availability of land as many as 34 projects in the state have received only token allotment in the Budget 2021-22.“The allocation for West Bengal is the highest ever in the history of Indian Railways. It is 2.5 times the average amount allocated between Budget 2009-2014 and 26 per cent more than last year. Projects there remain incomplete or are delayed because the state governments-- first it was the Left Front government and now the TMC-- have been unable to provide land to us. Projects which are 45 years old are pending in the state...I appeal to Mamatadidi to expedite the process and give us land,” Goyal said at a press conference.“Once someone became a minister, he would announce projects without first checking if there were funds available, if land was available and if the project was feasible. That is the reason why none of the projects which were announced then could be completed and there would be major cost overruns. So, inspired by politics this harmed the railways. Now, we have decided that we will start a project only after we have the land required for it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-got-highest-ever-allocation-in-rail-budget-piyush-goyal-101612454751870.html

He will be the first Chief Minister from a proletarian party who roams around in helicopters. The leader who stood with red flame and red flag is flying high these days,” Sudhakaran had said in Thalassery in Kannur on Wednesday while addressing a public meeting in connection with opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala’s state-wide yatra.The government had hired a helicopter last year for emergency services and the CM often travels in it.Congress MLA Shanimol Usman was first to criticise Sudhakaran and asked him to withdraw his comment. But Sudhakaran chided her asking why she was getting upset when he criticised the CM. Later, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also distanced himself from the MP’s statement.But Sudhakaran reiterated that he was highlighting Vijayan’s earlier position and his status after becoming the chief minister. He said naming one’s profession was not an insult and the CM had made it clear several times that he was proud to be a toddy tapper’s son.The ruling CPI(M) has criticised the Congress MP’s comment saying it exposed his mindset and sought an apology.“He insulted the CM by taking up his profession and caste. He even insulted a Congress leader who expressed serious reservations over his cheap comments. He should apologise,” said state law minister A K Balan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-upset-with-party-mp-s-remarks-against-kerala-cm-101612455851272.html

It contained a social media plan on farmers protest. Later, Greta deleted that link and uploaded a new toolkit.What is a toolkit?A toolkit is a document explaining the basic points of an issue. For example, the toolkit that Greta uploaded later asks people to tag Prime Minister Narendra Modi, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar.'Propose Greta's name for child bravery award': Meenakshi Lekhi on toolkit rowWhat Delhi Police saidThe Delhi Police on Thursday said the initial probe has suggested that the document is linked with a pro-Khalistan group.

Information and Broadcast minister Prakash Javadekar said it is a serious issue. "It clearly shows that some foreign elements are conspiring to defame India," he said."We knew that a conspiracy was being hatched outside the country. But we did not have any proof of that.

04-02-2021||India||SC to hear Sonu Sood's plea against HC order on illegal construction notice tomorrow||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Friday the petition filed by actor Sonu Sood challenging the Bombay HC order which dismissed his appeal against a civic body notice over alleged illegal construction at his residential building in Mumbai's Juhu area.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian is likely to take up the appeal filed by Sood, who was in the spotlight for helping migrants reach their homes during the lockdown last year.The actor has stated in his plea that his application for conversion has been approved by the Municipal Commissioner subject to Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) permission.It said the high court order of January 13, 2021 has been passed without considering the provisions of Section 43 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 and his application for conversion of residential premises into a residential hotel was submitted in 2018 before the department concerned.The plea contended that their application for conversion, which has been approved by the Municipal Commissioner subject to MCZMA, be directed to be decided by authorities concerned. “The petitioners have already stopped the work of internal renovation which require no permission as per the provisions of Section 43 of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, therefore, the respondents may kindly be restrained from demolition of the renovation work already done in the building,” the plea filed by Sood and his wife said.He further stated that if the application of the petitioners for conversion is approved, the financial loss due to demolition will not be recovered in any manner and would cause miscarriage of justice to the petitioners.The High Court, while dismissing the actor''s appeal and application, said, "Law helps only those who are diligent." Sood's lawyer had sought a time of 10 weeks to comply with the notice issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in October last year, and requested the high court to direct the civic body to not initiate demolition action. The high court, however, refused and said the actor had ample opportunity in the past and if required, he could approach the civic body.Sood had approached the high court earlier this month challenging an order of a city civil court at Dindoshi that had dismissed his suit against the BMC's notice issued over the alleged illegal construction carried out by him.The actor, in the interim application in the high court, had sought an order from the high court restraining the BMC from taking any coercive action against his residential property in Juhu area.“The petitioner (Sood) has not made any changes in the building that warrants permission from the BMC. Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done," Sood's advocate had argued in HC.As per the BMC, the Bollywood actor had carried out structural changes in the six-storey residential building ''Shakti Sagar'', and allegedly converted it into a hotel without taking requisite permissions.The BMC earlier this month also filed a complaint at the Juhu police station, seeking an FIR to be lodged against Sood for allegedly converting the residential building into a hotel without permission.The complaint letter was sent to the police after the BMC inspected the building and found that Sood had allegedly not complied with the requisitions and was continuing unauthorised construction even after the notice was served to him in October last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-sonu-sood-s-plea-against-hc-order-on-illegal-construction-notice-101612453912129.html

Both ships were carrying Australian coal, which they weren’t allowed to unload by Chinese authorities.Twenty-three sailors stranded on MV Jag Anand, which was at anchorage near Jingtang port since June 13 last year, returned home this month after a crew change was arranged at a Japanese port. Now, the 16 sailors stranded on MV Anastasia near Caofeidian port since September 20 will return as Chinese authorities have permitted a crew change.“After sustained follow-up by our embassy in Beijing, the Chinese central authorities have conveyed their clearance to the local foreign office in Tangshan and port authorities for the transfer of the crew of MV Anastasia,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“This information has also been shared with the shipping company [which owns the vessel]. The shipping company’s agent, we understand, has submitted a request to the local port authorities and is coordinating with them on the modalities for crew change at Caofeidian port,” he said.“We hope the crew change can now be effected at the earliest,” Srivastava added.India has repeatedly taken up the issue of the stranded sailors with China over the past few months. Chinese authorities had outlined detailed steps for a crew change in view of the country’s strict pandemic control and prevention measures, and insisted these would have to be complied with by the shipping companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stranded-in-chinese-waters-16-more-indian-sailors-to-return-home-101612453780368.html
04-02-2021||India||India again asks Sri Lanka to stick to commitments on developing port terminal||India on Thursday again emphasised the importance of Sri Lanka adhering to international commitments under a trilateral agreement for developing a key port terminal following Colombo’s decision to hand over the facility to a state-run entity.India, Japan and Sri Lanka had signed an agreement in 2019 on jointly developing the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo port. However, the Sri Lankan government gave in to pressure from labour unions, which are opposed to a joint venture with Indian and Japanese investors having a 49% stake in the ECT, and decided on Monday to run the terminal as a fully owned operation of the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA).India responded to the move by calling on Sri Lanka to abide by the trilateral agreement, while Japan described the Sri Lankan government’s unilateral decision as “regrettable”.Asked about the issue at a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the memorandum of cooperation signed by the three countries in May 2019 envisaged the development and operation of the ECT in a trilateral framework.“We sincerely believe that the development of infrastructure in Sri Lanka, in areas such as ports and energy, with foreign investment from India and Japan will be a mutually beneficial proposition,” he said.“Our high commissioner in Colombo is in discussion with the government of Sri Lanka, including on the importance of adhering to international commitments,” he added.The Indian envoy has held separate meetings with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and foreign minister Dinesh Gunawerdene to convey India’s position that Sri Lanka must abide by the agreement. The Japanese envoy too has met the Sri Lankan leadership to discuss the matter.India’s Adani Group and several Japanese investors were to form a joint venture to hold 49% stake in the ECT, with the majority stake in the hands of SLPA. India has also informed the Sri Lankan leadership that the decision could hit investor confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-again-asks-sri-lanka-to-stick-to-commitments-on-developing-port-terminal-101612452679976.html

One more person was arrested subsequently.The high court, in its order passed on January 28, had refused to grant him bail noting that to "promote harmony" is one of the constitutional duties.It had also turned down the bail plea of another accused in the case.In its order, the high court had said it would not comment on merits of the case, but based on the material seized, the witnesses' statements and considering the fact that probe was going on, no case was made out for grant of bail."The evidence/material collected so far suggests that in an organized public show under the garb of stand-up comedy at a public place on commercial lines, prima facie, scurrilous, disparaging utterances, outraging religious feelings of a class of citizens of India with deliberate intent, were made by the applicant," it had said.There was a possibility that "more incriminating material" would be collected, and further, a similar case has been registered against Faruqui in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, the high court had noted."That apart, there is also specific assertion by the counsel for the complainant that the applicant, along with other co-accused persons, (were) allegedly making outraging filthy jokes in social media deliberately against Hindu Gods, Lord Shriram and Goddess Seeta, hurting religious sentiments of Hindus for the last 18 months, despite protest on various social media platforms. There is nothing on record to the contrary," it had said.As per the First Information Report, the comedy show was held at a cafe in 56 Dukan area of Indore on January 1. Eklavya Singh Gaud, son of BJP MLA Malini Laxman Singh Gaud, had filed a complaint against Faruqui and others.Gaud had said that he and his associates had gone to watch the show where alleged indecent jokes were made about Hindu gods and goddesses and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.He forced the organizers to stop the show, he had said.Faruqui and others were arrested for the alleged offences punishable under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including section 295-A which deals deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class.They were also accused of holding the show amid Covid-19 pandemic without permission and were booked under other relevant provisions of the IPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-bail-plea-of-comedian-munawar-faruqui-tomorrow-101612453235348.html

She was last seen around 8:30 pm after which she went missing.“The girl went missing last night. Today her body was found from the staircase on the third floor of an adjacent building. We have started an investigation. We hope to crack the case very soon,” said Murli Dhar, joint commissioner (crime) of Kolkata Police.Sniffer dogs and forensic teams were pressed into action. Police also said that they were scanning CCTV footage from cameras installed in local shops. Police have found a knife, a few broken teeth and hair strands from the spot.“According to SOP we have collected some exhibits which would be sent to the laboratory,” said S Chakraborty, a member of the forensic team.Locals alleged that someone known to the victim committed the crime because it would be difficult for anyone to kidnap a child from the lane which remains crowded.“We have sought a report from the police commissioner. If it is proved that the girl was sexually abused, beaten and murdered, the guilty would surely get life term imprisonment. The judge may even sentence him to death,” said Ananya Chakraborti Chatterjee, chairperson of the West Bengal commission for the protection of child rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eightyearold-girl-found-murdered-in-kolkata-day-after-she-went-missing-101612451141077.html

04-02-2021||India||BJP trying to repeat Tripura-model in poll-bound Bengal, says CM Mamata||The Bharatiya Janata Party is trying to replicate the Tripura-model in poll-bound West Bengal, Trinamool Congress chief and CM Mamata Banerjee said on Monday.“Many people had abandoned the Congress and had helped the BJP to become more powerful and form the government in Tripura. The BJP think that they can apply the same formula in Bengal and form the government here with some traitors who left the TMC,” she said, while addressing a party meeting in Kolkata.At least six former TMC MLAs, who were expelled by the party, switched over to the BJP ahead of the Tripura assembly polls in 2018. The six were earlier with the Congress and had joined the TMC in June 2016. The BJP won 36 out of the 60 seats in Tripura assembly and formed the government. The TMC could not win any seat.“In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when not many MLAs from the TMC and other parties had joined us, the BJP had won 18 Lok Sabha seats. So it is clear that the people of Bengal are now against the TMC and the party will lose the elections. In Tripura the six MLAs who joined the BJP were from TMC. She is ashamed to tell the truth,” said Rahul Sinha, veteran BJP leader and the party’s former national secretary.In West Bengal, at least 23 sitting MLAs and former legislators, a majority of them from the ruling TMC, have joined the BJP since 2019. Recently, at least two former ministers and ex-TMC leaders Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee joined the BJP.The chief minister was visibly peeved and lost her patience when some women from the audience tried to approach her with a set of demands. Banerjee stopped her speech midway.“I am not God. How much do you want? I have given everything. Don’t try to blackmail me before the elections. I am a street fighter,” she said.Upping her ante against the BJP she said that many people from Tripura have migrated to West Bengal and out of fear after the BJP came to power in the north eastern state.“Those who point fingers at Bengal should first take a look at what’s happening in BJP-ruled states like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh among others. In Tripura, the residents once used to raise slogans that the CPI(M) had ruined the state. The same people now raise slogans that the BJP has devastated the state. Many people of Tripura stay in West Bengal out of fear,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-trying-to-repeat-tripura-model-in-poll-bound-bengal-says-cm-mamata-101612450436821.html

Road maintenance work earlier used to be carried out on Thursdays.“No vehicle will be allowed to move between Jammu and Srinagar especially between Nashri and Banihal on Friday,” said a traffic police officer.Last month, the highway was closed for several days at different times because of heavy snowfall and the collapse of a retaining wall of a bridge. The longest blockage lasted a week from January 2 to January 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/snow-disrupts-traffic-on-jammu-srinagar-highway-101612449238251.html

The government on Thursday issued standard operating procedures (SOP) to contain the spread of Covid19 during festivals and fairs.Principal secretary, home department, Abhay Kumar said the government is responsible for instituting measures that prevent the spread of Covid19 during religious festivals, events, fairs and ensure prompt public health response to an outbreak.“The government would widely publicise, and also convey to all other state governments that devotees with negative RT-PCR test reports shall only be allowed to enter all such religious festivals and fairs. The devotee may carry such test reports either on their mobile phones or hard copy,” said the officer.The mass gathering events, said the secretary, have the potential to facilitate the transmission of the virus and disrupt the gains made by the country in Covid19 management. The top bureaucrat said the culture of Rajasthan reflects its splendid and vibrant history with ethnic and religious diversity, different cuisines, beautiful dances, and mesmerising music. The state is also rich in flora and fauna with some of the popular wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. Its varied culture and multi-religious background attract tourists and pilgrims from all over the world, he said.The SOP directs that only vaccinated health care and frontline workers be deputed at such places for the duties. There should be registration of the devotees and a medical certification regimen on similar lines as being done for Amarnath yatra.For infection prevention and control, the public utility areas and open spaces shall be sanitised at least twice a day with 1% of sodium hypochlorite, it states.The religious event may witness a floating population of many thousands, a large number of samples may have to be tested during the event. Therefore, the number of testing centers needs to be augmented, states the SOP.The enforcement agencies should levy fines on those not wearing masks or not following physical distancing norms, reads the SOP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-makes-covid-test-mandatory-to-participate-in-religious-festivals-101612449824042.html

04-02-2021||India||To US comments on farmers’ protest, India mentions Capitol Hill violence||The US on Thursday called for dialogue to address the farmers’ protest in India and backed peaceful demonstrations and freedom of expression, prompting New Delhi to compare the January 26 violence at the Red Fort with the storming of the US Capitol earlier this month.The US described peaceful protests and unhindered access to information and the internet as indicators of a “thriving democracy”, while offering support for reforms that improve and open up India’s markets to attract private investments.The remarks by a US embassy spokesperson were the first public comments by the Biden administration on the farmers’ protest that began last November. Hours later, the ministry of external affairs said the protest must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos, and compared violence at a farmers’ rally on January 26 to the chaos during the siege of the US Capitol on January 6.“We recognise that peaceful protests are a hallmark of any thriving democracy, and note that the Indian Supreme Court has stated the same,” the US embassy spokesperson said on the farmers’ protest that has increasingly attracted attention worldwide. “We encourage that any differences between the parties be resolved through dialogue,” the spokesperson added.On internet restrictions at sites on the outskirts of Delhi where farmers are protesting, the spokesperson said: “We recognise that unhindered access to information, including the internet, is fundamental to the freedom of expression and a hallmark of a thriving democracy.”At the same time, the US backed reforms to open up India’s markets. “In general, the United States welcomes steps that would improve the efficiency of India's markets and attract greater private sector investment,” the spokesperson said.Asked about the US position at a regular news briefing, the external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Any protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse.”Describing India and the US as vibrant democracies with shared values, Srivastava added: “The incidents of violence and vandalism at the historic Red Fort on January 26 have evoked similar sentiments and reactions in India as did the incidents on the Capitol Hill on January 6 and are being addressed as per our respective local laws.”He said “temporary measures” on internet access in parts of the National Capital Region were “undertaken to prevent further violence”.Despite the external affairs ministry pushing back against support for the farmers’ protest by foreign celebrities on Wednesday and describing the agitation as an internal matter, activists and entertainment personalities reiterated their backing for the farmers, mainly on social media. They were joined by lawmakers from the UK, the US and other countries.Asked if the government believes a “motivated campaign” or an entity is behind the protest, Srivastava evaded a direct answer and said the matter is best handled within the country. “What I will say broadly is that the debate on reforming the agricultural sector is an issue best addressed by the Indian democratic polity. Those following it should have an informed and objective view,” he said.Environmental activist Greta Thunberg tweeted early on Thursday what she said was a “toolkit by people on the ground in India” to help farmers, including backing the protest on social media, contacting foreign government representatives to ask them to act on the issue, signing online petitions, and organising “on-ground action near the closest Indian Embassy, Media House or your local Govt. office on 13th/14th February”.The National Farmers Union of the US, founded in 1902, extended support to the protest in a tweet. “In India, farmers are protesting against policies that will cut into their income, give corporations more power, + erode rural communities,” the tweet said. “These issues resonate strongly w/farmers in the US, who have seen similar changes over the last several decades,” it added.Valerie Vaz, a senior MP of Britain’s Labour Party and sister of former lawmaker Keith Vaz, wrote a letter to foreign minister Dominic Raab to reiterate concerns of her constituents regarding the farmers’ protest. The Indian-origin MP was among 35 British lawmakers who had taken up the farmers’ protest with Raab before he visited India in December.“My constituents and I are horrified by widespread reports of police brutality against the farmers protesting these laws, who are asserting their right to peaceful protest...In several instances police have fired tear gas shells, used water cannons and ordered the suspension of internet connection for long periods of time,” she wrote in her letter.Vaz asked Raab to contact the Indian government “as a matter of urgency regarding these concerning events”.Happymon Jacob, columnist and associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, emphasised the need for nuance in India’s stance on global reactions to the protest. “New Delhi's sharp reactions to external criticism about its handling of the farmers' protest in the country are both ill-advised and don't befit the country's democratic traditions. In a globalised world, established democracies such as India cannot afford to push back criticism using the ‘internal matter’ argument,” he said.The farmers’ protest against three laws – Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 – began on November 26 last year.The government has defended the laws as necessary for long overdue reforms in the agricultural sector. After several rounds of unsuccessful negotiations with the government, the unions backing the protest decided to intensify their agitation and organised a tractor rally in the capital on Republic Day that descended into violence and chaos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-us-comments-on-farmers-protest-india-mentions-capitol-hill-violence-101612449434871.html

Those following it should have an informed and objective view. We are making sure through our activities that this is what happens," spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. He also referred to the Capitol violence and drew a parallel between that with the event that unfolded in Delhi on Republic Day.US wants India to resolve farm protest through dialogueOn Thursday, the US administration issued its first reaction to the ongoing farmers' agitation in which it said it encourages dialogue to resolve any differences between the parties. It also extended support to steps that can improve the efficiency of India's markets and attract greater investment. Peaceful protests and unhindered access to the internet are hallmarks of a thriving democracy, it said."The incidents of violence and vandalism at the historic Red Fort on January 26 have evoked similar sentiments and reactions in India as did the incidents on the Capitol Hill on 6 January and are being addressed as per our respective local laws," the spokesperson said adding that both India and the United States are vibrant democracies with shared values."The temporary measures with regard to internet access in certain parts of the NCR region were therefore understandably undertaken to prevent further violence," Srivastava added.The MEA spokesperson said the US state department has acknowledged the steps being taken by India towards agricultural reforms.The press conference comes a day after the ministry issued a statement condemning comments of international celebrities on farmers' protest.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taken-note-mea-refers-to-capitol-violence-reacting-to-us-statement-on-farmers-protest-101612448704663.html
04-02-2021||India||Will remove misinformation around Covid-19, false claims about vaccine: Facebook||Social media giant Facebook on Thursday said it is focused on removing misinformation around Covid-19, including false claims related to vaccines, as part of its efforts to ensure user safety protection.Facebook Product Policy Manager, Misinformation Alice Budisatrijo said while it isn't appropriate for a company to decide whether the information is true or false, it is essential that people have access to credible information."We don't believe that it's appropriate for a US technology company, or anyone to determine what is true and what is false. So, whether it's private companies, governments, if any single actor gets to decide what's true and false, this creates potential overreach and unhealthy power imbalance," she said during a virtual briefing.Also, there can be different degrees of truth or people can have different opinions about what is true or false, Budisatrijo said."However, we take our responsibility seriously...We are a service for more than 2 billion people around the world. So we know how essential it is for people to have access to credible information, and for us to remove harmful content," she said.Referring to Facebook's community standards as a "living document", Budisatrijo said these guidelines constantly evolve to keep pace with changing online behaviours."...as part of our response to the Covid pandemic, we have clarified our policy guidelines to apply our policy to harmful claims related to this global health emergency. This started since January last year at the beginning of the pandemic and it has continuously evolved," she said.Budisatrijo explained that Facebook removes Covid-19 misinformation that could contribute to physical harm, including false cures, false treatments, false information about the availability of essential services, such as hospitals, hospital beds, or the location and severity of the outbreak."We also prohibit false claims related to Covid vaccines, because especially now that we know the Covid vaccines are starting to get approved and rolled out in many countries. So claims about the safety, efficacy, serious side effects, ingredients and conspiracy theories about the vaccines, will remove them as well," she said.Budisatrijo noted that between March and October last year, the social media platform - which works with a number of third-party fact-checkers - removed 12 million pieces of Covid-19 misinformation that fall under these claims.Besides, around 167 million pieces of content had a warning label applied related to Covid-19 misinformation.The company said nearly 95 per cent of the time people who saw warning labels around Covid-19 misinformation, did not click through the links and were therefore not exposed to false information.The executive acknowledged that there is still scope for further enhancing these efforts. "Even with the combination of artificial intelligence and the human reviewers that we have all over the world, we can never 100 per cent guarantee that content that violates our policies is not on the platform," she said.On the decision to remove former US President Donald Trump from the platform, Budisatrijo said no politician was exempt from Facebook's community standards, including those on violence and incitement.She said people should be able to see content from politicians, especially in democratic societies, but if the content violates community standards and has offline risks that needs to be removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-remove-misinformation-around-covid-19-false-claims-about-vaccine-facebook-101612449011724.html
04-02-2021||India||India ready to supply weapons systems to countries in Indian Ocean Region: Rajnath Singh||India is ready to supply various types of weapons systems to Indian Ocean Region (IOR) countries, said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday.Addressing the Indian Ocean Region Defence Ministers' Conclave here, he advocated for uninterrupted access to the open seas and abiding by international laws for stability and security in the region."India is ready to supply various types of weapons systems to IOR countries. In consonance with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of SAGAR, Neighbourhood First and Act East policy, India has adopted a cooperative approach through capacity-building assistance with partner countries. This was reflected in the supply of Indian made ships, maritime aircraft and setting-up of Coastal Surveillance Radar Systems," Singh said.The Defence Minister pointed out that the negative impact of conflicting claims in some maritime areas of the world highlighted the need to ensure peace in the IOR region.Referring to India's growth in the aerospace and defence sector and its emergence as a global R&D hub with one of the world's largest start-up ecosystems, the Defence Minister said IOR countries can leverage these sectors for mutual benefit.He said the recent order from the Indian Air Force to buy 83 Advanced Light Helicopters Mk-1A from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is a milestone in India's indigenisation of defence manufacturing capabilities.Singh also pointed out that India's approach and vision to tackle global challenges was highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dynamic five 'S' vision - Samman (respect), Samvaad (dialogue), Sahyog (cooperation), Shanti (peace) and Samriddhi (prosperity)."Indian Ocean Region acts as a constant source of resources, particularly in sectors of fisheries, aquaculture, ocean energy, sea-bed mining and minerals. It provides tremendous economic opportunities to develop marine tourism and shipping activities," he added.The Defence Minister said that the Indian Ocean is a shared asset and a lifeline to international trade and transport due to its control of major sea-lanes carrying half of the world's container ships, one-third of the world's bulk cargo traffic and two-thirds of the world's oil shipments.Singh emphasised the IOR conclave should focus on security, commerce, connectivity, fight against terrorism and intercultural exchanges in line with 'SAGAR' - Security and Growth for All in the Region, the theme of Indian Ocean Policy outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015."The deployment of ships by the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast guard for maritime security and anti-piracy operations had been successful in minimising threats to commercial shipping," he said.The Defence Minister identified the capacity building, capability enhancement, cooperative engagements and collaborative efforts as the four pillars of Naval Foreign Cooperation that carry the significance in transforming India's reach and capabilities, in the near and far regions."Due to its geo-strategic location in Indian Ocean Region, maritime character, historical and cultural ties with littoral states, India considers it important to keep the maritime neighbourhood safe and secure, through unity and togetherness," added Singh.He said IOR faces a number of challenges such as piracy, smuggling of drugs/people and arms, humanitarian and disaster relief, and Search & Rescue (SAR) which can be met through maritime co-operation.The Defence Minister highlighted that Indian Navy successfully evacuated about 4,000 Indian nationals from the region under Operation 'Samudra Setu' undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic. "These missions would not have been a success without able assistance from our maritime neighbours," he underlined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ready-to-supply-weapons-systems-to-countries-in-indian-ocean-region-101612446975572.html
04-02-2021||India||TRS MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh is German citizen: Centre again tells court||Telangana Rashtra Samithi lawmaker Chennamaneni Ramesh is a German citizen and holds a passport of that country, the Union home ministry told the Telangana high court on Thursday.The ministry of home affairs submitted an affidavit to this effect, as per the earlier directions of the court. In December, too, the ministry brought to the notice of the high court in the form of a memo that Ramesh was holding a German citizenship.However, the high court directed the ministry to submit the details in the form of an affidavit along with the details obtained from Germany through Indian embassy that proved the MLA’s German citizenship.Ramesh, who has been representing Vemulawada assembly constituency in Rajanna Siricilla district for the last three terms, is the nephew of former Maharashtra governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao.The high court was hearing a petition filed by Congress leader Adi Srinivas, who had contested elections against Ramesh in Vemulawada. Srinivas contended that Ramesh had obtained the Indian Citizenship by fraudulent means hiding his German citizenship.In November 2019, the ministry of home affairs cancelled the Indian citizenship of Ramesh on the grounds that he had held citizenship of Germany and had not fulfilled the stipulated norms while obtaining the Indian citizenship in 2009.Ramesh had gone to Germany for employment in the early 1990s and obtained German Citizenship in 1993, when he surrendered his Indian passport. In 2008, he returned to India and applied for Indian citizenship which was granted to him by the MHA. He won the election from Vemulawada assembly constituency in 2009 elections.As per the Citizenship Act, a person who applies for an Indian citizenship should be present in India at least for 12 months before the date of application. But Adi Srinivas lodged a complaint with the MHA stating that Ramesh still held the German passport and had gone to Germany within this stipulated period of 12 months before being granted Indian citizenship.A committee appointed by the ministry concluded that Ramesh had obtained the Indian citizenship “by playing fraud upon the Government of India and concealing crucial material facts of his visits abroad during the last twelve months immediately preceding his application for Indian citizenship”.In September 2017, the MHA cancelled the citizenship of Ramesh. However, he filed a review petition in the MHA and later moved the high court and obtained the stay order. Subsequently, he contested the assembly elections again in December 2018 and got elected from the same constituency for the third successive term.The high court, which disposed of the case in July 1999, referred the matter to MHA again.

Around 30 staff of our department were crossing the railway track and so were the elephants when the speeding train, which was running at high speed, hit the two animals. Though our staff signaled the train to stop, it did not. It was criminal on the part of the train driver to speed up in an area where elephant movement is known," said Behera.The forest department sent the carcasses for post-mortem Thursday morning.Nishant Kumar, Assistant Railway Manager, Bondamunda, said diversion of the elephants’ movement might have led to the accident. "Restoration works have been completed and the running of trains on the route will be resumed soon. We will soon start a probe into the incident," he said.In December last year, two elephants were knocked dead by trains in Sambalpur district in two separate incidents. On December 5, the Bhubaneswar-Rourkela Intercity Express hit a tusker between Jujumura and Hatibari area of Sambalpur district killing the elephant on the spot. On December 20, another tusker was killed after the Puri-Surat Express train ran over it between Hatibari and Maneswar Railway stations under Sambalpur division.In the last 10 years, 28 elephants have been killed in Odisha after being hit by trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-elephants-killed-in-odisha-s-sundargarh-district-after-being-hit-by-train-101612446806566.html

The Congress leader attended ‘ardas (prayer)’ ceremony of Sikh youth Navreet Singh at Dibdiba village in Rampur, about 325 km north west of Lucknow.“Navreet was 25. My son is 20. You have young sons who went there to show their solidarity with farmers. He (Navreet) did not come back because of an incident. I want to tell Sardar Hardip Singh that we will not allow the loss of your grandson go waste. This agitation will continue till these black farm laws are withdrawn,” she said.Navreet Singh died after his tractor overturned during the farmers' tractor parade on January 26 in New Delhi, said police, when a section of farmers veered off agreed routes and chaos ensued.“We cannot tolerate such an injustice. It’s true. This is not a political agitation. This is an agitation of truth. This is an agitation of every Indian… Whichever religion he belongs to, every farmer is with you,” the Congress leader said.She called the BJP government ‘unjust’ to farmers and said her party would not tolerate such injustice. The Congress leader said the agitation of farmers would continue till the three farm laws were withdrawn.“This government does not want to withdraw the three farm laws. These laws have to be withdrawn. This is great injustice being done to farmers. But the greater injustice is being done to them by calling them terrorists and seeing a conspiracy in their agitation,” she said.UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhna Mishra accompanied Priyanka to the village to meet family members.UP BJP vice president Vijay Pathak said the state government was doing a lot of work to double the income of farmers and bring about an improvement in the law and order situation.“By supporting the cause of farmers, the opposition wants to target the government. It’s opposition for the sake of opposition. Instead of siding with farmers, the Congress should point out the flaws in the farm laws,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department political science, Lucknow University.Earlier, a large crowd of party men followed Priyanka’s cavalcade as she moved towards the village. Two vehicles in Priyanka’s convoy collided on a highway in Hapur. No one was hurt in the incident but some vehicles were damaged.Farmers have been camping on three Delhi border points protesting against the three farm laws enacted in September and have been demanding assurance on minimum support price for the crops. The Centre has maintained that the laws will benefit farmers and will also allow them to sell their produce anywhere in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-up-priyanka-gandhi-attends-prayer-meet-for-farmer-who-died-in-tractor-rally-101612446822093.html
04-02-2021||India||Republic Day violence is a blot on Indian history: Shahnawaz Hussain||Clearly indicating that the Centre will not budge from its stance on the three farms laws, BJP national spokesperson and former Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain said the farmers' agitation was backed by political parties like the Congress, and Communists and was allowing even anti-social and anti-national elements to take part in the agitation for the past 70 days in Delhi.Prior to paying obeisance at the shrine of Piran Kaliyar Dargah in Haridwar, Shahnawaz Hussain termed the Republic Day violence at Red Fort as a blot on Indian history alleging it was sponsored and pre-planned on the lines of the vandalism that had happened last month in Capitol Hill.Alleging that propaganda was being done to malign the image of the government at the international level too, Hussain said whether it be pop star Rihanna or Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, without trying to know and understand the three agricultural laws, they are only trying to create sensationalism through social media, hashtags and misinformation.Hussain said the Parliament passed the agricultural legislations after due discussion and debate.“There have been eleven rounds of talks between the government and farmers representatives but the onus is on them as the government won’t repeal the laws. We are open to suggestions on certain provisions but the laws can’t be repealed. The government has already given assurance on minimum support price assurance, carrying on with agricultural production committees and other aspects raised initially by protesting farmer organizations and even offered delaying these laws by one and half year,” said Hussain, a member of the Bihar legislative council.BJP district general secretary Vikas Tiwari said that party leaders and workers are trying to convince local farmers about the benefits of the three farm laws urging farmer representatives not to participate in the February 6 nationwide Chakka Jam called by farmer unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-day-violence-is-a-blot-on-indian-history-shahnawaz-hussain-101612446703658.html
04-02-2021||India||Defend or rebuke? House GOP faces difficult vote over Marjorie Taylor Greene||House Republicans will be forced to go on the record, defending or rebuking Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has drawn bipartisan condemnation over her embrace of far-right conspiracy theories, as well as her past endorsement of violence against Democrats.The politically agonizing vote expected Thursday, which will determine whether the Georgia Republican is stripped of her committee assignments, underscores tension over the best political path forward that has riven the party since Donald Trump lost the White House.Democrats issued an ultimatum earlier in the week, telling House Republicans to strip Greene of her committee assignments — or they would. Bipartisan pressure built after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called Greene’s “loony lies” a “cancer” for the party.But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Wednesday ruled out taking action. Instead, he accused Democrats of a “partisan power grab” for targeting Greene, who once suggested that a Jewish-owned financial firm may have been involved in a plot to spark California wildfires using a space laser.“If this is not the bottom, I don’t know what the hell is,” House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said before a resolution was sent to the House floor to strip Greene of her posts.McCarthy's decision to back Greene comes at a time when the party has been ideologically adrift after Trump's loss, struggling over whether to embrace his norm-busting divisiveness or the GOP's more traditional, policy-oriented conservative values.On Wednesday, House Republicans blocked an effort by conservative hardliners to oust the No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., from her leadership role. Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, had enraged Trump supporters by voting to impeach him over the riot at the U.S. Capitol.In sticking by both women, McCarthy was attempting to placate both traditional conservatives and populists, like Greene, who emulate Trump. The moves were typical of McCarthy’s preference to avoid ruffling feathers as he charts his path to someday becoming House speaker.“You know what that’s going to mean?” he told reporters Wednesday evening. “Two years from now, we’re going to win the majority. That’s because this conference is more united. We’ve got the right leadership team behind it.”But the GOP’s wings remain concerned that the other is leading them down the wrong path, and to some, Wednesday's outcome seemed more an uneasy truce than a full-on peace treaty.“This is about the direction of our party and whether or not we’re going to be a majority who’s dedicated to just one person or we’re going to be a united Republican majority,” said Rep. Jaime Herrera-Beutler, R-Wash., who with Cheney was among just 10 House Republicans to back impeaching Trump.Greene has shown support for calls to violence against Democrats, bizarre fictions about faked school shootings and unfounded QAnon theories about Democrats joining in child abuse rings.The conspiracy theories she’s embraced came up during a closed-door Republican caucus meeting on Wednesday, which attendants described as spirited with long lines of speakers at the microphones. Some said Greene apologized to her colleagues, though there were conflicting, vague versions of exactly what she’d said.“She was contrite. And I think she brought a lot of people over to her side,” said conservative Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.That's at odds with statements she's made in recent weeks on Twitter, where she has vowed to never back down or apologize and labeled her critics traitors, while using the Democratic push to punish her to raise money for her campaign.Democrats say it's politically advantageous to tie some Republicans to the far-right Greene. This week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launched a $500,000 ad campaign that attempts to link eight Republicans to her and other adherents of QAnon, which focuses on the false belief that top Democrats are involved in child sex trafficking and cannibalism.McCarthy condemned Greene’s past endorsements of conspiracy theories — after weeks of saying little critical of her — and said the first-term congresswoman had recognized in a private conversation that she must meet “a higher standard” as a lawmaker.“I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward,” McCarthy said.She burst onto the national political scene with enthusiastic support from Trump.Republicans appointed Greene to the Education and Labor Committee, a decision that drew especially harsh criticism because of her suggestions that mass school shootings in Connecticut and Florida could be hoaxes. Greene is also on the Budget Committee.McCarthy said Democrats turned down his offer to move Greene onto the House Small Business Committee instead.It’s unusual for party leaders to strip lawmakers of committee assignments, which can help them address their districts’ needs and raise campaign contributions.In 2019, House GOP leaders removed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who had a history of racist comments, from the Agriculture and Judiciary panels after he wondered aloud in a New York Times story about when the term “white supremacist” became offensive. He lost the Republican primary for his seat in 2020 and is out of Congress after serving nine terms.In online videos and through supportive “likes” on social media, Greene has voiced support for racist beliefs, calls for violence against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama and various false theories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defend-or-rebuke-house-gop-faces-difficult-vote-over-marjorie-taylor-greene-101612441786368.html

He said that the people who will be stuck in it would be provided food and water and will know what the government was doing to the farmers."There'll be a three-hour-long 'chakka jaam' on February 6. It won't take place in Delhi but everywhere outside Delhi. The people that will be stuck in it will be given food and water. We will tell them what is the Govt doing with us," Tikait said as quoted by news agency ANI.Farmers' unions have called the 'chakka jaam' as a protest against the government's decision to shut down internet services at protest sites, the police barricading and the Centre's three farm laws that the protestors want repealed.The RSS-affiliated farmers' body, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), said that they would not support the 'chakka jaam', citing that the protests had become political propaganda."Now, the protest at all the borders of Delhi is very much political and it is clearly visible that this has become political propaganda," BKS General Seceratery Badri Narayan Choudhary said as per ANI.Choudhary also noted the international support the protests had garnered and called it 'propaganda against India'.The farmers' protests had recently been shot into the global eye after pop icon Rihanna tweeted about it. The story was then shared by several eminent personalities like climate activist Greta Thunberg.Thousands of farmers have been protesting against the Centre's contentious farm laws for several weeks around the national capital. They had organised a tractor rally on Republic Day that ended in violence, after which the government cut the internet and the Delhi police set up barricades at the protest sites.Several rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmers have ended unsuccessfully with the farmers demanding a complete rollback of the three laws and the Centre refusing to do so.The three laws are Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chakka-jam-not-to-be-held-in-delhi-confirms-rakesh-tikait-101612441576279.html

It means spreading disaffection against the government of India and creating disharmony among different social, religious and cultural groups. 120(b) for the conspiracy of executing such a plan,” Ranjan said.“Delhi Police has also registered several cases against those social media handles which have been pushing either fake news or spreading rumours among citizens with the purpose of spreading disaffection and ill-will,” Ranjan said while speaking to reporters.“In the process of social media monitoring, we have come across one particular document which was uploaded on one of the social media handles on one particular platform. This ‘toolkit’ has a particular section in the document titled ‘Prior Action Plan’ and says digital strikes have to be conducted using hashtags before January 26,” he further added.Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg had tweeted a document which talked about the farmers’ protest and how one can support the agitating farmers. She later deleted the tweet and shared a link to a new document saying that the previous tweet had an outdated document.“If you go by the unfolding of events on January 26, including the violence which unfolded, it reveals a copycat execution of the action plan mentioned in the toolkit,’ Ranjan said. He also highlighted that the toolkit aims at ‘waging social, cultural and economic war against the government of India.' He also said that the Delhi Police’s Cyber Crime cell will be conducting further investigation into the case.Several celebrities like environmental activist Greta Thunberg, pop artist Rihanna and model Amanda Cerny among others have tweeted voicing their support for the ongoing protests against the farm laws by farmers’ unions representatives at Delhi’s borders. The farmers who have been protesting for more than two months are demanding a repeal of the the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The farmers’ groups believe that these three laws will affect the procurement under the Minimum Support Price system and allow private and multinational companies to make profits off farmers as it will encourage corporate farming.The government has claimed that the laws will increase farmer incomes and said that the recent social media uproar in social media claiming to support the ongoing protests are being done by entities with vested interests and aimed at maligning India’s image at an international level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-registers-fir-against-unknown-persons-for-sharing-toolkit-in-social-101612443175197.html
04-02-2021||India||Orissa HC quashes Lokayukta order on vigilance probe against former BJD minister||The Orissa High Court has quashed the Lokayukta’s order for a probe by the state vigilance department against expelled BJD MLA and former minister Pradeep Kumar Panigrahy on grounds that the complainant and investigating agency in a quasi-judicial process cannot be the same, his lawyer Pitambar Acharya said Thursday.In response to Panigrahy's petition challenging the legal validity of the Lokayukta order and alleging that the anti-corruption body had clearly acted in excess of jurisdiction and authority and purely on extraneous considerations and facts, a division bench of chief justice S Muralidhar and justice Biswanath Rath on Wednesday quashed the Lokayukta order.The Lokayukta had issued the order in December last year on a complaint filed by deputy superintendent of police (Vigilance), Ranjan Kumar Das observing that the complaint revealed how Panigrahy amassed assets disproportionate to his known source of income. While issuing the order, the Lokayukta had observed that the complaint prima facie revealed that Panigrahy by resorting to corrupt practice had amassed assets disproportionate to his known source of income. The Lokayukta had asked the vigilance department to submit a report within two months.In his petition, Panigrahy had said that Lokayukta is supposed to proceed in a manner to ascertain whether there exists a prima facie case. "However, the Lokayukta jumped to the conclusion that the complaint of the vigilance department revealed a prima facie case. In the absence of granting of opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, the finding of Lokayukta is perverse, illegal and unsustainable under law," he alleged.Panigrahy also alleged in his petition that he had already been prejudiced as a rumour was floated around that the chief minister had made a reference to the Lokayukta to initiate a proceeding against him.Panigrahy is currently in jail after the Odisha CID arrested him on December 3 in connection with a corruption case.It was alleged that Panigrahy had collected money from people on behalf of Akash Pathak, son of suspended IFS officer Abhay Pathak, with the false promise of providing jobs in Tata Motors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orissa-hc-quashes-lokayukta-order-on-vigilance-probe-against-former-bjd-minister-101612441142297.html

If the first call goes unanswered, a second call is being made in an interval of four hours. Participating in this process is not mandatory. The government sent the SMS to over 37 lakh beneficiaries, out of which 5 lakh replied and 97.38 per cent of these five lakh people expressed overall satisfaction with the process.Started on January 16, India's vaccination drive, which is also the biggest and fastest vaccination drive in the world, has already covered 44,49,552 beneficiaries.

04-02-2021||India||'Propose Greta's name for child bravery award': Meenakshi Lekhi on toolkit row||BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi took a swipe as Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and said she would propose her name for child bravery award as the 18-year-old activist has done a "huge" service to the country by uploading the toolkit which according to Lekhi proves the conspiracy being hatched to destabilise India.I propose Greta Thunberg for Child bravery Award which Govt of India should bestow on her as she has done a huge service by uploading the document providing proof about hatching of a conspiracy to destabilise India from 1/1/ & leading up to 26/1/2021"She is a kid, she is a child...we have all through this engagement knew that there was a conspiracy hatched outside the country. But we have no proof. She has given us proof. I am grateful to her for that. In her naivety, she has given us proof. We should acknowledge that. I don't despise her for this," the BJP MP said."What I despise is that her name has been prosed by some elements for Nobel Peace Prize and she is known to be an environmentalist. Now an environmentalist who does not understand sustainable farming practices, an environmentalist who doesn't understand the kind of problems that stubble burning can give, an environmentalist who doesn't understand how much water is needed for farming and an environmentalist who doesn't even understand the diversification of crops, can't be even named for Nobel Peace Prize. The prize will lose its credibility if such people are named for it. I despise that," she added.Greta Thunberg is in news for extending support to the ongoing farmers' protests. Her tweet came soon after American pop singer Rihanna tweeted a CNN article on farmers' protest and partial internet suspension. The "international support" has drawn flak as an international conspiracy to attack India's democracy. The ministry of external affairs drew a link between this with the recent desecration of Gandhi statues at various places in the world and said both are attempts to hurt India's democracy.Union ministers, BJP leaders, Bollywood and cricket personalities put their weight behind the message of India's unity and urged their follower to not believe in rumours.Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg tweeted a document which had Rihanna's name mentioned. This apparently proved that getting international figures to tweet for farmers' protest is a "bigger" plan. Greta, however, deleted the link and tweeted a fresh link of an action document which too lists similar actions but it does not mention any name.Meenakshi Lekhi said the earlier document made it clear that there have been elaborate plans to "destabilise" India since January 1.Delhi Police filed an FIR against the creators of the toolkit for criminal conspiracy. Greta, however, was undeterred and said she will still stand with the farm protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/propose-greta-s-name-for-child-bravery-award-meenakshi-lekhi-on-toolkit-row-101612439832469.html
04-02-2021||India||Rajya Sabha: Opposition raises farm laws, migrant crisis issue||Rajya Sabha proceedings went relatively smoothly on Thursday even as the Opposition MPs raised the issue of farm laws, the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis and the migrant crisis during the lockdown. Congress MP Digvijaya Singh raised the issue of farm laws and said democracy was being suppressed in the country. “We respect the mandate you have, but the way in which dissent, which is the backbone of a democracy, is being suppressed in our country is deplorable,” Singh said. “The foisting of cases against farmers, journalists, activists and such need to stop.” He was backed by TMC MP Derek O’Brien who added that the government had failed to uphold the sanctity of Parliament. “Members had asked, as is procedure, for the Bills to be referred to a select committee, but the government never did that. Political administration is the purview of the Prime Minister and the home minister. This government has failed on many counts, including handling the Covid-19 crisis and economy.” Also Read | ‘Have mercy’: AAP’s Sanjay Singh urges Centre to repeal ‘black laws’He added that he had prepared a draft bill to repeal the three farm laws. DMK’s NR Elango said the government was violating the federal structure with the farm laws. “The farm laws occupy the field of the state’s power,” Elango said, adding, “The government legislated them in tearing hurry and farmers interest was not considered.”The Ohad demanded a separate discussion on the issue of the three contentious farm bills that have led to widespread protests by the farmers at the borders of the national Capital. The Opposition has demanded a repeal of all three laws, but the government has propoed a waiver of 18 months, during which it says that the laws will be examined. Defending the government, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tackled every crisis head-on. “The mandate of the country has been vested in the PM not once but twice in the national elections. “Modi ji has worked for energy justice that the farmers will benefit from,” said Pradhan. “India is also working to develop alternate energy in the form of hydrogen fuel.”MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, who joined the BJP last year, also lauded the Prime Minister’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis and other issues since he came to power for the second time. “Jammu and Kashmir has been freed from historical chains and over 1.5 crore [15 million] people have received the benefits of Central schemes,” he said. He added that the PM had rolled out visionary reforms. “The ram mandir will be a symbol of new and strong India,” Scindia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-opposition-raises-farm-laws-migrant-crisis-101612440127749.html

Approximately ₹30,000 subsidies are to be given for 2/3-wheelers while ₹1.5 lakh for 4-wheelers. We are starting the 'Switch Delhi' campaign today to make people aware of clean vehicles," said Kejriwal in his video conference.Appealing to the people to take part in the movement, Kejriwal said, "We have to turn our EV adoption movement into a mass movement, a 'jan andolan', to form a collective commitment to decrease pollution."The government launched the campaign to inform, encourage and motivate every person in Delhi to switch from polluting vehicles to zero-emission EVs. All the hired cars being engaged by various departments of the Delhi government will switch to EVs within six months.Also read| ‘Have mercy’: AAP’s Sanjay Singh urges Centre to repeal ‘black laws'The Chief Minister said that the focus should be on the problem of air pollution which haunts the state and the health of its citizens."Over the last year, the people of Delhi have fought a courageous fight against Corona. They overcame all odds to defeat three waves of Corona. While all the people of Delhi deserve credit for this, it should not take away our focus from the long-term challenges facing Delhi. One such challenge is air pollution. To address the vehicular pollution in Delhi, in August 2020, the Delhi government notified the landmark Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy. It has been called the most progressive EV policy in India and among the best globally," he added.The Chief Minister informed that the state government has made road tax and registration fees for the EVs completely free. The policy has been created to promote the adoption of EVs on a large scale that cannot run on petrol.

04-02-2021||India||LJD MP MV Shreyams Kumar criticises govt handling of farmer agitation||In a scathing attack on the government over its handling of the ongoing farmer agitation, Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) MP MV Shreyams Kumar on Thursday said the government has remained a mute spectator while democracy is being "butchered" just a few kilometers away from the Rashtrapati Bhavan.Participating in a discussion on a motion thanking the President for his address to the joint sitting of Parliament at the start of the Budget Session, Kumar alleged that none of the constitutional values are being upheld by the current dispensation and that the country is being mortgaged to private entities."Rashtrapati (President) can see how democracy is butchered just a few km away from the Rashtrapati Bhavan -- the Singhu border (the epicentre of the farmer agitation). Our annadatas, the kisan, on whom the Rashtrapati showers praise in his speech, is silenced and traumatised with multi-layered barricading, iron nails on road, barbed wires and iron rods between cemented barricades, reminding one of the horrific Tiananmen Square," he said in Rajya Sabha.He noted that the President denouncing farmer protests was a disrespect to constitutional values.Referring to the violence during the farmers' tractor rally on January 26, Kumar said it was the BJP government which dishonoured the national monument -- the Red Fort -- by handing it over to a private party for ₹25 crore for a five-year period in the garb of adopting a heritage site."The Red Fort is today in private hands. Rashtrapati has no qualms about this. The BJP dispensation does not know that under Article 51-A (of the Constitution), it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture," he added.The government does not know the difference between a national monument and a commercial property, Kumar said."However, when some hooligans entered into the Red Fort, the dispensation first allowed them to enter and create mayhem only to raise the jingoistic fervour later," he noted.He further said, "Unfortunately, the President has not seen the sufferings of his fellow brethren, the kisan, the annadatas who are protesting just a few km away from the Rashtrapati Bhavan. They are today insulted by the BJP dispensation by terming them as anti-nationalists."The Internet is banned at the sites of farmer protest strike and this is draconian and unheard of in a democratic setup. Several international personalities have started raising their voice against this, Kumar noted.He said that Parliament is "no longer sovereign" and bills are passed for private ends.He added that the president's speech says the government holds in high esteem the values of democracy and sanctity of the Constitution and that the government has always respected freedom of expression and holding of peaceful agitations."In the 2020 World Press Freedom Index, India is ranked abysmally low at 142 out of 180 countries. Even the military junta Myanmar is ranked above India at 139. Palestine is at 137. Monarchies like Oman and UAE are ranked at 135 and 131 respectively. It is a shame for this government that no democracy is ranked as low as India at 142," Kumar said.The LJD member also attacked the government over its economic policies and said that in the name of a free market economy, the current dispensation is selling all its assets. "Rashtrapati speaks a lot about Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India). This is nothing but a catchy slogan aimed at hoodwinking the citizens. From computers to fabrics and from aircraft to toys -- everything is imported," Kumar said."Let this government know that roti cannot be downloaded from Google. It is the farmers who feed us. The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer," Kumar said while opposing the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi's border points with a demand that the Centre repeal the new agri-marketing laws enacted last September.The protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljd-mp-mv-shreyams-kumar-criticises-govt-handling-of-farmer-agitation-101612434904659.html

"It is definitely worrying that the weekly positivity rate in these eight states and union territories are more than the national positivity rate. We are in contact touch with the administrations and are sending national team," the secretary said.India likely to get 97.1 million Covid-19 doses through CovaxWeekly positivity rate is the average percentage of people testing positive in a week.

It means more people are contracting the disease and getting admitted to the hospital, probably beyond the capacity of the hospitals there. They are not getting proper treatment and that's why the number of deaths in these countries is on the rise.

04-02-2021||India||Central Vista: Govt starts work on Rajpath redevelopment||The Centre on Thursday held the bhoomi poojan for laying the foundation stone of the redeveloped and restructured Central Vista Avenue—the next phase of the Central Vista redevelopment plan.The bhoomi poojan ceremony of Central Vista Avenue was performed by Union housing minister Hardeep Puri in the presence of housing ministry secretary Durga Shanker Mishra,CPWD DG and senior officers of the ministry at India Gate, New Delhi.“With this ceremony, the work has started for the development/redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue. The 3km-long Central Vista Avenue stretches from North & South Block to India Gate, and includes Rajpath, its adjoining lawns and canals, rows of trees, Vijay Chowk and the India Gate plaza. This was originally designed to be a grand processional pathway to the Viceroy’s House during the British Raj. It was appropriated by the people of India and their government during Independence,” the ministry said on Thursday.Also Read | Parliament library to continue home delivery of books despite lukewarm responseThe redevelopment of the avenue — which comprises Rajpath, leading from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate — will involve restructuring the avenue, creating underground passes, landscaping the green areas and comprehensive maintenance and operation of the same for five years.The first phase of the Central Vista avenue redevelopment at an estimated cost of ₹502 crore will include refurbishing and landscaping the lawns; the entre has proposed that green cover be increased from 350,000 sqm to about 390,000 sqm. It will also include public amenities with toilets, drinking water facilities and vending areas that are being provided at 10 locations for visitors and tourists.It will also include underpasses at Janpath and C-Hexagon crossing with Rajpath.“Walkways across lawns and low-level bridges over canals are being provided to ensure better connectivity with parking, public amenities at 12 suitable locations. Canals are being refurbished with proper lining and aerators are being provided to keep the water clean,” the ministry said.It will also include parking spaces and foldable seating arrangement “to reduce time taken for installation and removal of temporary seating arrangement during Republic Day Celebrations.”“Government approved a proposal for development of Central Vista Avenue with estimated cost of ₹608 crore on November 10, 2020. Requisite permissions from Delhi Urban Arts Commission, Heritage Conservation Committee, Central Vista Committee, local bodies, etc. have been obtained,” the ministry said.HT on January 6 had reported that the Shapoorji Pallonji Group on Wednesday emerged as the lowest bidder for the Centre’s tender for the redevelopment and restructuring of the Central Vista Avenue after it quoted a financial bid of ₹477 crore, nearly 5% lower than the estimated cost of the project pegged at ₹502 crore.This will be the second phase of redevelopment after Tata Projects Limited was tasked with the construction of the new Parliament complex on September 29, 2020.The Central Public Works Department, nodal agency for the redevelopment project, revised the estimated cost for the project from ₹463 crore to ₹502 crore in a modified tender document released in November. Of this, ₹372.9 crore is earmarked for civil work and horticulture, ₹113.7 crore for electrical and mechanical work and ₹15.51 crore for operation and maintenance, all for a period of five years.“Adequate measures will be taken up to mitigate environment pollution during the construction/retrofitting work with focus on water conservation,” the ministry said.The tender for the redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue also mandates the firms to maintain it for five years after completion, and requires that the project be completed within 300 days. Work will also need to be carried out in sections to minimise the portion of the avenue that is cordoned off at any given time.“Some modifications were carried out in Central Vista Avenue after independence; the landscape was altered, new rows of trees were added in the 1980’s, a new road, Rafi Ahmad Kidwai Marg, was constructed to improve north-south connectivity. Annual Republic Day Celebrations (RDC) are held on this avenue every year. Other important functions… has very high footfalls. It is the most frequently visited place and important tourist attraction in Delhi. However, it lacks public amenities like toilets, pathways, designated vending zones, parking, proper lighting, signage, etc. Its lawns and water canals are in depleted condition as they were not planned for heavy public use and now become increasingly stressed.

The 11th round took place on January 22; in the 10th round, which took place on January 20, the government offered to keep the laws in abeyance for one-and-a-half-years, a proposal which the farmers rejected a day later. On January 30, in a virtual all-party meet, held four days after violence during the ‘Kisan tractor parade’ on Republic Day, prime minister Narendra Modi reiterated that the proposal to keep the laws in abeyance was still on, adding that the government was ‘just a phone call away.’The talks between the Centre and farmers’ leaders have been stuck on two major issues: legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) and a complete rollback of the laws; on the latter, the government has categorically said that it won’t withdraw the laws, and has instead offered various other options, including amendments, which have been rejected by the unions.The AAP, meanwhile, has been supporting the protests from the beginning.

Here is what has prompted the response:• The comments came after musician Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg, lawmakers in the US and UK, and several actors, activists and influencers sparked global clamour over the farmer issue.• A statement from the external affairs ministry contended that “vested interest groups” were trying to enforce their agenda on the protests to derail them and have tried to mobilise global support against India. • The statement referred to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others” but did not name anyone.• It is rare for the external affairs ministry to respond to tweets by foreign celebrities critical of events within the country, though it has, in recent weeks, pushed back against comments by leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and lawmakers in the UK and other countries supporting the farmers’ protest.Also Read | Parliament proceedings halted amid protest over farm laws: All you need to know• The ministry’s statement, for the first time, included two hashtags - #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda.• As protests against three contentious farm laws have snowballed, they have attracted attention around the world, including among celebrities and lawmakers.• Though some celebrities who aren’t well known in India have made social media posts on the issue over the past few days, singer Rihanna was the most high-profile personality to take up the issue on Twitter on Tuesday.• Rihanna has 101 million followers on Twitter and is among the highest-selling recording artistes in history• She triggered a storm on Tuesday by tweeting “why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest”, along with a link to a CNN article about the farmers’ protest that was also part of a subsequent tweet on Wednesday by 18-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg.• Thunberg tweeted: “We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India.” • The tweet was both supported and criticised by sections within India. • India’s foreign ministry said in response to these statements that it “would like to emphasise that these protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse”.• Union home minister Amit Shah wrote on Twitter: “No propaganda can deter India’s unity! No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights! Propaganda cannot decide India’s fate only ‘Progress’ can. India stands united and together to achieve progress.”• External affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted: “Motivated campaigns targeting India will never succeed. We have the self confidence today to hold our own. This India will push back.”• James Costa, a Democratic congressman who serves on the influential US house foreign affairs committee, too supported the farmers’ right to protest. • Since last month, US actor John Cusack, a group of 36 lawmakers in the UK and a spokesperson for UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres have backed the farmers’ protest and taken up the matter on social media and other forums.• Indian celebrities Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Karan Johar and Suniel Shetty said citizens should focus on the government’s efforts to resolve the ongoing farmer crisis rather than paying attention to “half truths” and those creating differences. • Former Indian cricket star Sachin Tendulkar too tweeted: “India’s sovereignty cannot be compromised. External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Let’s remain united as a nation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-celebs-support-for-farmers-protest-sparks-govt-censure-what-we-know-101612421341935.html
04-02-2021||India||BJP aims to halt BJD's temple run amid Bhubaneswar heritage demolition row||As the outrage over demolition of heritage structures in Bhubaneswar rages on, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Odisha may have chanced upon an opportunity to stall the BJD's temple politics through renovation of heritage temples like the Jagannath temple in Puri and the Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar.Last week Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), entrusted with the upkeep and maintenance of 28 monuments, with some dating back to the 8th century, found a 10th century monument close to the 11th century Lingaraj temple, the largest temple in Odisha’s capital. The ASI officials found three subsidiary shrines dating back to the 10th century near Suka-Sari temple, a 13th century temple near the Lingaraj temple. The joy of discovering an old monument soon turned into outrage as ASI officials found that the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, in its eagerness to develop the area around the Lingaraj temple, had vandalised several old monuments.Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage claims to have found evidence of blatant violations of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act by the civil body, which undertook the demolition work through mechanical devices, it said.BJP, which has been watching the BJD's growing interest in state's temples for the last two years with unease, was quick to jump into the fray. Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday wrote to Union culture minister Prahallad Singh Patel requesting him to send an expert team from the ASI in Delhi to carry out a detailed study and thorough scientific excavation of the area around Lingaraj temple."There is an urgent need to act quickly in order to salvage and preserve what remains of this priceless ancient Odisha architecture. I seek your urgent intervention for preservation of the rich cultural and architectural heritage of the country by protecting the centuries old temples in Bhubaneswar,” Pradhan wrote. Soon after, a team of BJP leaders visited the site and demanded a halt to the ongoing work till the entire area surrounding the complex is excavated.As the demolition work around the Lingaraj temple comes to a halt, political observers say the BJP may no longer be a silent spectator to BJD’s efforts to corner all the credit for development of heritage temples in what is also seenas the Naveen Patnaik government’s bid to counter BJP's Hindutva edge and growing influence in the coastal districts of the state.“BJP is aware that BJD is trying to snatch its religious card through development of old temples in a deeply religious state like Odisha. So it may be pleased at the turn of events last week as it effectively meant a hold on civil work around the Lingaraj temple for the next few months," said political science professor Gyana Ranjan Swain of GM University in Sambalpur. "But how far will it be successful in countering BJD's plan is a matter of debate."A senior BJP leader said BJD's plan to use the temple card to neutralise the BJP's vote base may not succeed. "The people have seen through the BJD's gemeplan. The people know that the government went out of its way to stall Rath Yatra last year till the SC intervened. This is a question of faith and people would not forgive the party for its misadventures. Their politics would be exposed soon," said Lekhashree Samantsinghar, BJP leader.Also Read: Bhubaneswar civic body destroys heritage structures around Lingaraj templeBJD leader and former mayor of Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, Anant Narayan Jena said it would be wrong to see the development of the area around Lingaraj temple purely from the religious angle. "The chief minister is a heritage lover and that's why he is stressing on the development of such places. It is also giving a huge boost to tourism," said Jena.Over the last 2 years, Naveen Patnaik government has taken a special interest in development of temples such as Jagannath temple of Puri, Lingaraj temple of Bhubaneswar, Baladevjew temple of Kendrapara and Samaleswari temple of Sambalpur. While it has announced projects worth ₹3,500 crore for development of Puri into a heritage city, a special act for Lingaraj temple along with the Ekamra Kshetra project for development of the area around the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-aims-to-halt-bjd-s-temple-run-amid-bhubaneswar-heritage-demolition-row-101612420062423.html

He said patriotism is speaking about the well-being of the nation. Jha criticised the government’s response to the farmers’ protest and the tendency to dub anyone with a contrary opinion as anti-national. He quoted from Macbeth: “Boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny; it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings.”Also Read | Farm debates marked relatively smoother day of Parliament: All you need to knowJha said, “The biggest tukde tukde gang [alleged sympathisers of separatists] is that which does not understand the pain of the people.” Taking a jibe at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has 303 members in the Lok Sabha, he added: “... they have 303, but numbers do not decide history. Your sensitivity decides your highs and lows.”Jha called the decision by 18 opposition parties to boycott the President’s address “painful”. He added the address was distanced from the current situation. He referred to the government’s discussions with the farmers’ representatives and added that there is a difference between a monologue and a dialogue.“A country is not a map drawn on paper. It is not the army and police and slogans but the building of relations. The government has to build bridges, “ he said. He accused the government of creating divides.He referred to the government’s response to the tweets by international pop star Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg in support of the farmers’ agitation. “...our democracy is strong. It will not be weakened by anyone’s tweet.”Swapan Dasgupta, a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, underlined that the farmers’ condition is not uniform in the country. “There are two lakh farmers in Punjab and Haryana who are in the top 8% of incomes in India. About 20,000 of them have incomes in the top 2%. This is not to berate them. This is only to admire their hard work, integrity and persistence, and adoption of technology. Unfortunately, this is not a situation that prevails in the whole country,” he said.He added in West Bengal, most are marginal farmers with land holdings that are not enough to survive and only 9-10% of the farmers secure the minimum support price.Dasgupta defended the farm laws and added the legal sanctities that they give are important for lifting communities. “I urge people to look at the whole country, not in terms of what a few successful have done.’Telugu Desam Party’s Ravindra Kumar said the government should be magnanimous to accommodate the demands of the farmers. BJP MP Jyotiraditya Scindia called 2020 a challenging year, which saw many ups and downs. He added India rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the Covid-19 pandemic. “...the President spoke about how India handled the crisis. It was an enemy that could not be seen. Our first power was PM [Prime Minister Narendra Modi]’s leadership; 36 states were brought together. A policy on a war footing was drafted...” he said.He spoke about the government’s response to the pandemic and to check the spread of the virus. He added the second wave of the infection could not even touch India. “The reason is that the government took the right decisions at the right time. The PM said Jaan hai toh jahan hai. Without worrying about financial implications, cash transfers were made to people,” he said. “There was a lockdown in 1975 when Emergency was imposed when the whole country was turned into a jail.

AIADMK has been cracking down on supporters of Sasikala, a close aide of former Tamil Nadu chief minister late J Jayalalithaa. In the past week, since Sasikala was released from jail, the party has sacked several functionaries for putting up posters welcoming her as the ‘party general secretary’. The party had expelled Sasikala in 2017. “He tried to meet Sasikala,” said a senior AIADMK leader seeking anonymity. “We got to know that he has been planning for the past two days; that is wrong.” Sasikala is set to return to Chennai on February 7. She completed her four-year prison term in Bengaluru in the disproportionate assets case on January 27 while undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at the city’s Victoria hospital. After discharge, she is under quarantine in a resort in Bengaluru.

However, their silence broke when Sasikala left the hospital in a car bearing the AIADMK flag which, they said, is illegal. After Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016, Sasikala was elected the party general secretary. She was set to become the chief minister but, after her imprisonment, the warring factions of Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam united. In 2017, they expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran who had launched a breakaway faction- Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam. The election commission also recognised the Palaniswami government as the true AIADMK which Sasikala plans to challenge on her return. AMMK cadre are planning a grand welcome for Sasikala from the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border all the way to Chennai’s T Nagar where she plans to reside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-expels-its-karnataka-in-charge-for-planning-to-meet-sasikala-101612417261106.html

To get this level ( ₹20,000 crore) increase in capital outlay, it's a huge step by government to provide that kind of budgetary support," IAF Chief told ANI on whether budget hike for modernisation would meet IAF requirements."Last year also, additional funds of ₹20,000 crores were provided. That helped the emergent procurement plans of the three forces and that really helped us. I think it is adequate for our capability building," said IAF chief.This statement comes after defence forces received an overall hike of around 7.4% over last year as ₹3.62 lakh crore were provided to them excluding pensions amid the China military standoff.Additionally, the defence forces received more than 18% hike over last year in capital outlay meant for acquisition of new weapon systems as ₹1.35 lakh crore have been provided over the ₹1.13 lakh crores last year.However, the budget documents also revealed that the Defence Ministry spent an extra amount of ₹20,776 crore for buying new weapon systems and spares for the armed forces in the present fiscal over and above the funds allocated for the purpose.The additional ₹20,776 crore has been spent on buying weapons and other spares under the special financial powers given to services under emergency and other provisions.The money has been used to acquire equipment like the Spice-2000 bombs, Spike anti-tank guided missiles, SiG Sauer assault rifles, Excalibur ammunition, multiple types of aircraft spares from Russia along with the ammunition for tanks and fighter jets.In the 2021-22 Union Budget, the Defence Ministry has been allocated ₹4,78,195.62 crore. ₹1.15 lakh crore have also been allocated for defence pensions which are disbursed to both military and civilians who have worked for defence Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-hails-increase-in-capital-outlay-of-defence-amid-pandemic-as-huge-step-101612415200370.html

She also wrote to the economic offence wing (EOW) on February 2 asking for probe in the financial irregularities after the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) and the school education department confirmed it.Kanoongo said, “This is just a tip of the iceberg. This scam is at least of more than ₹100 crores.”She said, “I made a surprise visit to an aganwadi centre in Vidisha district in March 2019 and found a list of girls, who were getting THR. As I used to know some of the girls, I called their family members and asked them to enrol the girls back in the schools. I came to know that these girls were not getting THR and were attending schools. In the name of these girls, THR is being consumed by someone else.”“Later, NCPCR sought a data from the Women and Child development department about beneficiaries under THR programme. WCD informed us in April that there were 1.71 lakhs girls, who were getting THR. I asked them to provide names of the girls to probe but they didn’t provide specific data,” she added.“NCPCR sought the same data from school education department to know the number of drop out girls aged 11 to 14 years. The school education provided data that there were 8,600 girls, who left the school. As there were huge differences in the data, I wrote to Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) to probe the data. The CAG report of four districts- Betul, Gwalior, Dindori and Singrauli revealed financial irregularities of ₹4 crore in the THR programme in one year,” said the chairperson.Also Read: BJP leaders buy alcohol with Ram temple funds, says Congress MLA in MPThe NCPCR wrote to the state government and also asked the EOW to probe the matter.Meanwhile, women and child development department reviewed the data in 2020 and the beneficiaries reduced by 56% to only 96,000. MP Women and child development department commissioner Swati Meena Naik said, “We have started mapping the beneficiaries with their Aadhar card. We are also looking into the matter of alleged irregularities in 2019.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/95-beneficiaries-of-take-home-ration-scheme-on-paper-says-ncpcr-chairman-101612414641650.html

The IAF and the army together require 160 LCHs.The LCH figures on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. Though not ordered yet, the twin-engine helicopter has been deployed in the Ladakh sector to support the IAF, in the midst of the border row with China. The deployment of the twin-engine LCH in the Ladakh sector is symbolic in nature and an acknowledgement of the potential that the platform holds but it is yet to be fully weaponised to meet the air force’s requirements.HAL has already launched limited series production in anticipation of the orders at its Bengaluru facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aero-india-hal-set-to-get-order-for-15-light-combat-choppers-101612413780626.html

Here is a recall of the proceedings:• The debate in Rajya Sabha began after all parties agreed to suspend Question and Zero Hours to allow 15 hours for the discussion.• A united Opposition demanded the repeal of the three farm laws passed in September during the debate.• Leader of the Opposition (Rajya Sabha) Ghulam Nabi Azad said the “might of the farmers is the biggest force in the country and we cannot reach any conclusion by fighting with them”.• He demanded the repeal of the laws and restoration of statehood in Jammu & Kashmir.• Azad said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present in the House, is the only person who can find a solution to both the problems of Jammu & Kashmir and the farmers’ agitation.• He condemned the violence and chaos during a tractor rally on January 26, when a section of farmers raised a Sikh religious flag at the Red Fort.Also Read | Parliament proceedings halted amid protest over farm laws: All you need to know• Speakers from the treasury benches accused the opponents of the laws of spreading “misinformation” among the farmers and “stoking fears”.• Telangana Rashtra Samithi MP K Keshava Rao pressed for minimum support prices to be written in the law, which is one of the demands of the farmers• Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP Elaram Kareem said the government policies were only intended to appease corporate firms. He added that farmer leaders were booked under fake charges for the incidents of January 26. • Biju Janata Dal MP Prasanna Acharya said the role of the police and the local administration and the farmers’ leaders needed to be questioned in the context of what happened on January 26.• Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s Thiruchi Siva said that the government came to power with a slogan of “minimum government, maximum governance but what we have experienced are minimum governance and maximum mishaps”.• Bharatiya Janata Party MP Vijay Pal Singh Tomar said those criticising the farm laws were spreading misinformation as the new laws only stand to help small and marginal farmers. • He said the laws were passed after extensive deliberations and there have been 12 expert committees in the past two decades on the farm reforms.• The government has offered that the laws be put on hold for 18 months to facilitate discussions.• Tens of thousands of farmers camped at three Delhi entry points for over two months have rejected the offer.• Modi is expected to reply to the debate in the Upper House on Monday.• In Lok Sabha, the government wanted to address the farm laws in the all-encompassing debate on the President’s speech.• Speaker Om Birla was forced to repeatedly adjourn the House as MPs trooped to the Well.

04-02-2021||India||Farmers’ protest: Remarks by global celebrities proof of propaganda, says BJP||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has called comments by international celebrities on the farmers’ agitation as evidence of global propaganda against the Narendra Modi government and an attempt to spread misinformation about the farm laws.The BJP has been carrying out an outreach on the ground and on social media to counter the accusations by the Opposition and a section of farm leaders that the three farm laws passed in September benefit big corporations. It is making a concerted attempt to project the criticism of the laws as a “conspiracy”.“There is a trend that was noticed when the Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA] was passed. Though the act does not anywhere imply that the citizenship of any community in India will be impacted, yet attempts were made to project CAA as anti-minorities. A similar conspiracy is now being seen in the attempt to create falsehoods about the farm laws,” said a BJP functionary.Also Read | One arrested for violence at Red Fort during farmers’ tractor parade on R-DayOn Wednesday, BJP leaders and ministers responded to the comments on social media made by singer Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg over the farmers’ agitation.Union home minister Amit Shah tweeted, “No propaganda can deter India’s unity! No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights! Propaganda cannot decide India’s fate only ‘progress’ can. India stands united and together to achieve progress.”On whether the accusation of international propaganda is an attempt to control the narrative, a second leader said, the BJP was hauled up for suggesting that the agitation has been infiltrated by “anti-national forces.”“Eventually what happened [violence] on January 26 [during the farmers’ tractor rally] was evidence that those who have the nefarious intentions are using the farmers. On more than one occasion, the farmer representatives were ready to call off the stir after the government agreed to make several amendments including putting the farm laws in abeyance for 18 months,” the second leader said.The Opposition has slammed the government for not accepting the farmers’ demand for repealing the laws. On Wednesday former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said India’s image has taken a beating because of the BJP. He said the BJP’s policies have shattered India’s soft power.BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav said it is wrong to accuse the government of not following the due process. He said the government is abiding by the court order and respects its viewpoint to put the laws in abeyance. “The government is ready for talks whether inside Parliament or outside,” he said.A few BJP leaders said that comments labelling the farmers’ secessionists vitiated the atmosphere for talks. “This is a very sensitive constituency [farmers]. Labelling farmers as Khalistanis or anti-national created a lot of bad blood. During our interactions with people in rural areas especially, it became clear that perhaps such statements were best avoided,” said a third functionary from Uttar Pradesh.The ongoing agitation has set off concern that the party’s electoral prospects in Uttar Pradesh could be impacted if the Jat vote bank in western parts of the state continues to support the agitation.Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Ajay Gudavarthi called the tendency to dub any opposing view as a conspiracy unfortunate. “You may disagree with a position that people have taken on a particular issue but why smell a conspiracy? It demonstrates a lack of confidence and a lack of sense of history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-remarks-by-global-celebrities-proof-of-propaganda-says-bjp-101612411440460.html

The services will, however, continue to remain suspended in five other districts of the state till 5 pm on February 4, news agency PTI reported quoting govt officials.Any person found guilty of violation of aforesaid order will be liable for legal action under relevant provisions, the order from Haryana government stated.The mobile internet services were suspended "to prevent any disturbance of peace and public order" amid a protest by farmers against three farm laws.The state government had initially suspended internet services in 17 districts, but later extended the suspension in some districts. The move was criticised by opposition parties and farmers who protested against it by blocking national highway.The issue was also raised by a group of 140 lawyers in a letter to Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde on Wednesday. They urged the CJI to take cognizance of the government's direction to impose internet shutdowns at Delhi borders where farmers are protesting against the three farm laws.The letter urged the CJI to take suo motu cognizance of the order of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).Meanwhile, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar described putting up of more barricades and suspending internet in and around agitation sites as law and order issues related to local administrations.He also said that the Centre is not holding any informal talk with protesting farmers.The last and 11th round of meeting between the government and 41 protesting unions, held on January 22, was inconclusive. The Centre had asked unions to reconsider the government's proposal to suspend new farm laws for 18 months.On Tuesday, Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) - the umbrella body of farmers' unions protesting the central farm laws - had said that there can be no "formal" talks with the government until the "harassment" of different kinds against the farmers' movement by the police and administration is "immediately stopped".(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-internet-curbs-lifted-in-2-haryana-districts-101612409293528.html

On January 26, protesting farmers conducted a tractor rally in the national capital, which turned violent as clashes broke out between the protesters and the police.Following the violence on Republic Day, security at the borders has been stepped up. The blockades at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders have restricted access to toilets, sanitation facilities, and water, agitators at the three border spots have said.On Wednesday, international figures including Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg and pop icon Rihanna had expressed concern over suspension of the internet at sites where farmers are protesting. "Why aren’t we talking about this?!" Rihanna tweeted with the hashtags #FarmersProtest.The ministry of external affairs, however, contended that “vested interest groups” were trying to enforce their agenda on the protests to derail them, and have tried to mobilise global support against India. The statement also referred to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others” but didn’t name anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peaceful-protests-hallmark-of-thriving-democracy-us-amid-row-over-farm-stir-101612409329124.html

04-02-2021||India||Bihar: Discoms propose tweaking power tariff for industries||Bihar’s power distribution companies have proposed to alter the time-of-day tariff for industries as a part of the state’s differential power tariff scheme. Under this scheme, industries would get incentives for power consumption during the day and will be charged more than the usual tariff for consumption in the evening. Industrial consumers are presently charged normal tariff during the day and the rates are lower at midnight.Senior power officers in the state pointed out that consumption peaks in the evening and goes down during the day. This is so, they say, because of increased power theft after dusk and fewer service consumers, including office establishments and industries, even as usage by domestic and agriculture consumers peaks in the evening. As a result, the demand for power begins to surge in the evening and remains high till early morning. The consumption graph then comes down and hits a trough during the day, said officials. Also Read | Power tussle on in Maharashtra: Consumers, MSEDCL both wait for reliefGiven this trend, the north and the south Bihar power distribution companies have surplus power during the day that they have to either trade or surrender, as it cannot be stored. It is to utilise this surplus power that the discoms have proposed lower power tariff for industries during the day. The discoms have proposed to change the normal tariff slab, applicable between 5am and 5pm, to 11pm – 11am, to optimise the power demand curve of the state. The existing off-peak hour slab from 11pm to 5am, when industrial consumers are charged 85% the normal tariff, will change to 11am -5pm. The existing peak hour slab from 5pm to 11pm, when industrial consumers are charged 120% the normal tariff, will remain unchanged, said officers. The existing tariff for industrial consumers ranges between ₹6.40 and ₹6.55 per unit (kVAh). “As part of time-of-day tariff, we propose to incentivise our industrial consumers by offering them lower than normal tariff for consuming power during the day, instead of late evening. It’s a win-win-situation for us as well as our industrial consumers, who do not have to pay additional wages to their employees for working at night,” said Sanjeev Hans, Bihar’s energy secretary and chairman-cum-managing director of the Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited. Officials do not perceive any problem in getting the regulator’s nod to the proposal. The new tariff will then come into effect from April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-discoms-propose-tweaking-power-tariff-for-industries-101612408740062.html

Opposing the urgent mentioning, senior advocate Rajiv Nayyar, who appeared for Amazon, said the procedure of the court should be followed. Following this, the matter was posted for hearing on Thursday.An Amazon spokesperson said contrary to reports carried in a section of the media, the company has not only been committed to an early resolution of the dispute with the FRL but had continued to be willing to support it even during the temporary financial challenges posed by Covid-19.Also Read | Police register cases against social media users for peddling ‘misinformation’In an interim order on Tuesday, Justice JR Midha ordered FRL to maintain the status quo on the assets starting at 4.50 pm on Tuesday until “the pronouncement of the reserved order”. It was passed on a petition by Amazon, which has alleged that the deal was in violation of its contract with FRL.The court said it was of the prima facie view that a Singapore tribunal order, which asked FRL not to proceed with the deal, was enforceable in India.On October 25, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre passed an interim order in favour of Amazon, barring FRL from taking any steps to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to seek any funding against them.The high court rejected FRL’s submission that Amazon’s petition was not maintainable because an Emergency Arbitrator (Singapore)cannot be considered an arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.“This court is of the prima facie view that the Emergency Arbitrator is an Arbitrator; the Emergency Arbitrator has rightly proceeded against FRL; the order dated October 25, 2020 is not a nullity; the order dated October 25, 2020 is an order under Section 17(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,” Midha said in his Tuesday’s order.Citing the Emergency Arbitrator’s order, the high court said it was subject to appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act as well because it was an “enforceable” order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-to-hear-future-s-plea-against-status-quo-on-reliance-deal-101612408439953.html

Farmer unions are opposing the BJP from holding any political or social programme, hence I am contesting as Independent,” BJP’s Bathinda district president Vinod Kumar Binta, who is contesting as an Independent from Bhucho Mandi municipal council, told HT.Of the 22 urban local bodies in Doaba, comprising Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts, the BJP has not been able to field candidates on all seats in 18 ULBs.

The remarks come after party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal's car was damaged in a clash between Congress and Akali workers in Jalalabad. The SAD terms the incident as a "murderous attack" on Akali workers and Badal by "police-backed Congress goons,” according to news agency ANI.Also Read| Protest, blockades: Locals have to take long way homeThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) stood up against the ruling Congress party alleging it was preventing AAP candidates from filing nomination papers at several places in the state.

India’s overall score fell from 6.9 in 2019 to 6.61 in the Index that provides a snapshot of the current state of democracy worldwide for 167 countries. “With mounting pressure on India’s democratic norms, India’s score fell from a peak of 7.92 in 2014 to 6.61 in 2020 and its global ranking slipped from 27th (in 2014) to 53rd as a result of democratic backsliding” under the current regime, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said.Also read: Centre defends police use of tear gas on protestersNorway topped the report titled “Democracy in sickness and in health?”, with Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand and Canada making up the top five.Out of 167 countries, the Democracy Index classifies 23 countries as full democracies, 52 as flawed democracies, 35 as hybrid regimes and 57 as authoritarian regimes.

04-02-2021||India||BJP shattered India’s global image: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday that India’s international image has taken a “massive hit” and the country’s biggest strength, its soft power, has “been shattered” by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) because of the manner in which the government has “crushed basic rights of farmers” in the course of the ongoing farmers’ agitation.In response, the BJP accused Gandhi of instigating farmers and using the agrarian stir for his political gains. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Gandhi was using the farmers’ cause to stoke fear in the country.Gandhi said, “Today, Delhi is surrounded by our farmers. They are the people who give us sustenance... the people who work for us. Why is Delhi being converted into a fortress? Why are we threatening our farmers, beating our farmers, killing our farmers?” He also said that the country is “lacking leadership”.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stirDemanding a restart to the talks with farmers, Gandhi said: “PM (Narendra Modi) is saying that the offer is still on the table to postpone these laws... what does that mean? Either you believe that you need to get rid of the laws or you don’t.”In counter, the BJP said the Congress leader was inciting people. “He (Gandhi) is trying to incite people. This is a farmers’ agitation and they are saying they are not associated with any political party, and that this is not a political movement, so why are you speaking on their behalf?” BJP’s Patra said.The Congress leader, however, refused to comment on international celebrities, including international pop star Rihanna, extending support to the farmers’ protest, saying “this is our internal matter”.“They (the government) have messed up the economy, they have messed up the harmony, they have messed up the defence and they want to keep distracting India with non-events.

Ltd, the news channel’s parent, for criminal defamation, saying the news anchor had harmed his reputation in broadcasts and Twitter posts on the investigation into the June 2020 death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.In the suit filed in the sessions court on Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, deputy commissioner of police Abhishek Trimukhe sought to prosecute Goswami and his wife under section 500 (punishment for defamation) and section 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory) of the Indian Penal Code, and sought compensation for defamation.A statement put out by a legal advisor for Republic TV on Wednesday night said the channel’s initial reading of the complaint was that the officer was referring to tweets from a fake Twitter handle impersonating as Goswami’s, and said it would respond legally, “as per due process .”Also read: Govt notice to Twitter over restored handlesTrimukhe claimed that Goswami made several defamatory statements against him during a panel discussion pertaining to the phone records of Rhea Chakraborty, an actor and Rajput’s girlfriend, in connection with the June 14, 2020 death of Rajput by suspected suicide. Trimukhe claimed that the discussion was posted on the YouTube channel of the company on August 7.The police officer alleged that the same content was also published on the microblogging site Twitter by Goswami later on. “Accused No. 1 (Goswami) has published several defamatory tweets and has essentially reiterated and re-circulated the contents of the defamatory telecast to an even larger audience by means of Twitter. The Tweets are without context and have been wilfully circulated to damage the complainant’s reputation,” states the complaint.“The accused persons are well aware that investigation into the death of late Mr. Sushant Sing Rajput (being a well-known Bollywood star) will garner significant public interest. The accused persons, instead of conducting themselves as responsible journalists (self-proclaimed) / citizens, have chosen to profit from the situation by sensationalising and scandalising the same, and using Mr Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and photograph (by tagging him) to disseminate the story to as many people as possible, all the while intending to defame the complainant,” read the complaint.Trimukhe said he sought permission from the state government to file the defamation complaint against Goswami, his wife and the company that owns the channel. Trimukhe filed the complaint only after the state government allowed him to go ahead with the suit on October 23 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-mumbai-cop-sues-arnab-goswami-for-defamation-101612395475660.html
04-02-2021||India||Praveen Sinha named acting CBI chief after Shukla’s ‘quiet’ tenure||The Centre on Wednesday appointed the Central Bureau of Investigation’s deputy chief, 1988 batch Gujarat cadre Indian Police Service officer Praveen Sinha, as the acting director of the federal agency with “immediate effect”, according to an order issued by Department of Personnel and Training.Sinha, currently additional director in the agency, will look after the duties of CBI director till the high powered selection committee led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi chooses the replacement for incumbent , Rishi Kumar Shukla, whose fixed two-year term ended on Wednesday, or “until further orders”, the order added.The decision was taken as the high powered panel comprising the PM, Chief Justice of India S A Bobde and leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury have not been able to meet to choose the agency’s next chief.Also read: What’s the value of a tree? Age multiplied by ₹74.5kHT reported on Monday that the decision could be delayed by a few weeks given the ongoing budget session of parliament, and the farmers’ protest, both of which are keeping the government busy.It is for the third time in last five years that an interim chief will head CBI. Additional director Rakesh Asthana (currently director general of Border Security Force) was appointed interim director of CBI in December 2016 for two months. Later, following an open ugly spat between former CBI Director Alok Kumar Verma and Asthana (when he was Special Director) in mid 2018, the government appointed M Nageswara Rao as interim director from October 2018 till January 2019. Shukla, a 1983 batch Madhya Pradesh cadre officer, who was brought to lead the agency at a time when it was coming out of a crisis caused by an internecine fight between its two senior most officers, took some steps to improve CBI’s image: the transfer of around 700 officers to different branches across India; keeping his doors open to hear any grievances; and avoided taking controversial decision.Described as a thorough “gentleman” by many of his subordinates and batchmates, Shukla made sure that what happened in the agency, stayed within it.The media-shy, soft spoken officer made it his policy to never interact with journalists. In fact, he didn’t give a single interview during his two years tenure.Among the few bold decisions taken by him were the arrest of former finance minister P Chidambaram in the INX Media case, raids on senior Congress leader from Karnataka D K Shivakumar, and the move to prosecute senior IAS officer Shashi Kant Sharma in the AgustaWestland case.Other than that, as described by an officer in the agency , “Rishi Kumar Shukla had a quiet tenure, which was further complemented by the Covid-19 induced lockdown”.Some of the high-profile cases he inherited from his predecessors, such as the probe into two former CBI Directors , Ranjit Sinha and A P Singh, the investigation of former ICICI Bank managing director Chanda Kochhar, and the Air India case did not see too many developments.The agency, however, tasted some successes during Shukla’s tenure in the form of securing the extradition of Vijay Mallya from the UK, currently held up due to his asylum plea, and India being selected to host the Interpol General Assembly of 2022.CBI registered record number of bank fraud cases during his tenure. It is estimated that CBI has registered bank fraud cases worth total ₹90,000 crore over the past two years, including against some big business houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/praveen-sinha-named-acting-cbi-chief-after-shukla-s-quiet-tenure-101612393613040.html
04-02-2021||India||Any ‘senior, responsible’ Facebook staff can appear before Delhi panel, SC told||The Delhi assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee’s summons to Facebook vice president Ajit Mohan is meant to call for deposition “any senior, responsible officer” of the company, the panel’s lawyer told the Supreme Court on Wednesday, during a hearing on a petition by the social media company’s executive who has challenged the move.Mohan has been summoned by the Committee to answer questions over whether the social media company’s content and how it was moderated played any role in the February 2020 communal riots in the Capital. The executive has moved the top court against the summons on September 10 and 18.In his petition, Mohan claimed the summons required him to appear and make a statement on oath with regard to the Delhi riots. Being a sensitive issue, he was not willing to go before the panel and make a statement.Also read: Govt notice to Twitter over restored handlesSenior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who opened arguments on Wednesday for the Delhi Legislative Assembly, told the judges that the only intention behind summoning Mohan was to ensure somebody responsible on behalf of the company can depose before the Committee.The three-judge bench headed by Justice SK Kaul asked Singhvi if the Assembly insisted on Mohan’s name or it was open to others appearing for the company. “The argument on behalf of Mohan is that by issuing notice to him, you are compelling him to come,” remarked the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy. Singhvi replied, “I have never said only Mr. Mohan should appear….We did not want just anybody to come but a senior, competent person.” The bench recorded this statement by Singhvi.In his prefatory statements, Singhvi told the Court that the petition by Mohan raises a larger question about powers and privileges of not just the Delhi Assembly but more than 25 State Assemblies in the country.“The petitioner cannot say I will go to some Committee but not to the other. He has not challenged the order constituting the Peace and Harmony Committee or the subsequent notification setting out its terms of reference. There are special affections when Facebook deposes before similar Committees of Parliament but refuses to come here,” Singhvi submitted.For Mohan, senior advocate Harish Salve submitted that his client had a right to remain silent under his right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a). As an intermediary for exchange of information on his platform, he cannot be compelled to come and state on oath before a non-statutory Committee, Salve argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/any-senior-responsible-facebook-staff-can-appear-before-delhi-panel-sc-told-101612391326444.html
04-02-2021||India||Both Congress and CPI(M) have lost credibility in Kerala: Nadda||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda on Wednesday came down heavily on the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and opposition Congress in Kerala, saying they were ideologically bankrupt and compete with each other in corruption and scandals.Talking to the media at the state capital, Nadda, who is on a two-day visit to kick start the party’s campaign for the assembly elections, said both were thick friends in West Bengal and in Kerala they were sworn enemies and it exposed their double standard and ideological bankruptcy. Kerala and four other states are expected to go to polls in April-May.“They are two sides of the same coin. While Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is struggling with gold smuggling and corruption cases, a sex scandal accused Oommen Chandy has been projected as the leader by the Congress. People have lost faith in both and they will go for an alternative this time,” he said. When the media pointed out that BJP national vice-president A P Abdullhakutty’s name also figured in the solar scandal he said investigative agencies were free to probe all angles.He said the CM has lost credibility and was not fit to continue in power. “Of late he has been attacking constitutional bodies like the CAG to hide his omissions and commissions. Involvement of his office in the gold smuggling case invited enough embarrassment for Malayalies world over. The role of more ministers will come to light as investigation progresses,” he said. He said central agencies came to the state after the CM invited them and it was unfair to criticise them now.This is Nadda’s first visit to Kerala after becoming the party president. Also a former Union health minister he criticised the state’s role in combating Covid-19. “It is sad that the state is the epicentre of the pandemic now. The government’s inept handling vitiated the situation. It was after publicity and it resulted in a surge,” he said adding despite strong health infrastructure the state failed to live up to its expectations. He said during the Nipah virus outbreak in 2018 he was the Union health minister but this time the state failed to heed repeated warnings of the Union government and paid a heavy price.He also ridiculed the Congress plan to rake up the Sabarimala issue. He said during the agitation three year ago, party leader Rahul Gandhi never supported it and BJP workers took the maximum brunt leading to the agitation. He said since the issue was before the apex court the Union government’s options were limited. At the height of the agitation, both Prime Minister Modi and then party chief Amit Shah had promised that the Centre will do everything to assuage hurt feelings of believers. On Thursday Nadda will go to Thrissur where he will address a public rally in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/both-congress-and-cpi-m-have-lost-credibility-in-kerala-nadda-101612381454978.html
04-02-2021||India||Opposition, Centre spar in Rajya Sabha over farm laws; Lower House still stalled||Opposition MPs stood united in the Rajya Sabha on their demand that three contentious farm laws be repealed, during a debate on the President’s speech on Wednesday, with Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad telling the government that the “might of the farmers is the biggest force in the country and we cannot reach any conclusion by fighting with them”.Speakers from the treasury benches, meanwhile, said that those opposing the laws were spreading “misinformation” among the farmers and “stoking fears”.After a day of protests and disruptions in both Houses on Tuesday, the debate on the President’s speech started relatively smoothly in the Upper House on Wednesday, with all parties agreeing to suspend Question and Zero Hours to allot 15 hours for the discussion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to reply to the debate in the Upper House on Monday.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stirLok Sabha proceedings, however, were washed out for the second day as the Congress stuck to its demand for a separate debate on farm protests even as the government wanted to address the issue in the all-encompassing debate on the President’s speech. The opposition leaders held a meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss their strategy. According to two Congress MPs who asked not to be named, party leader Rahul Gandhi also held a separate discussion with some Congress leaders on the floor strategy.Demanding repeal of the laws and restoration of statehood in Jammu & Kashmir, Azad said PM Modi, who was present in the House, is the only person who can find a solution to both the problems of Jammu & Kashmir and the farmers’ agitation.“The logjam between the farmers and the government is not for the first time; it has been going on for hundreds of years that farmers have had to struggle for their rights — sometimes against feudalism and zamindari and sometimes against the government,” Azad said.He condemned the violence and chaos during a tractor rally on January 26, when a section of farmers raised a Sikh religious flag at the Red Fort. “The whole Opposition and the Congress condemn the incident. It should have never happened; it is against democracy; it is against law and order. Those who were involved in this should be given strict punishment but at the same time those who are innocent should not be implicated,” Azad said, while also urging the PM to set up a committee to find out who are the people who had gone missing on January 26.Initiating the discussions, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Assam, Bhuwaneswar Kalita, said the farm laws were passed after extensive discussions in Parliament and the Opposition “should not make the farmers agitation another Shaheen Bagh”. His reference was to an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest that began last year in the heart of Delhi and escalated into an occupy movement that lasted for over 100 days, cutting off an important arterial road in the Capital.The ruling party has been alleging that the opposition parties have “stoked fears” about the new farm laws just as they did with CAA. The BJP leader reiterated an earlier speech by Modi and said “the benefits of these important farm laws have started reaching more than 10 crore people and small farmers” and told the House that “the doors are always open for farmers for discussion so that the issues can be resolved”.Watch | ‘Fight China & Pakistan, not our farmers’: Ghulam Nabi AzadThe government has offered that the laws be put on hold for 18 months to facilitate discussions but farmers — tens of thousands of whom are camped at three Delhi entry points for over two months — have rejected the demand. Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav criticised the government for showing “insensitivity” towards the farmers. He said had the government agreed to send the bills to a standing committee, the crisis would have been averted. He also questioned why there was tight security on the Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri borders, and said that security there was tighter than at Parliament and the India-Pakistan border. “Are the farmers going to attack Delhi?” he asked.BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, who seconded the motion, said those criticising the farm laws are spreading misinformation as the new laws only stand to help small and marginal farmers. He said the laws were passed after extensive deliberations and there have been 12 expert committees in the past two decades on farm reforms.Biju Janata Dal MP Prasanna Acharya said the role of the police and the local administration and the farmers’ leaders needed to be questioned in the context of what happened on January 26, while DMK’s Thiruchi Siva said that the government came to power with a slogan of “minimum government, maximum governance” but what we have experienced is “minimum governance and maximum mishaps”.Telangana Rashtra Samithi MP K Keshava Rao pressed for minimum support prices to be written in law, which is one of the demands of the farmers, while Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP Elaram Kareem said the government policies were only intended to appease corporate firms. He also said that farmer leaders were booked under fake charges for the incidents of January 26. Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu agreed to suspend question hour on Wednesday and Thursday, and private member’s bills on Friday, to make time for the discussion. In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Om Birla was forced to repeatedly adjourn the House as MPs trooped to the Well, raised slogans and flashed placards, and demanded that the farmers’ issue be given top priority. Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the farmers’ agitation was harming the image of the country.The Speaker insisted that the Question Hour must go on but Opposition members refused to relent, leading to the House being adjourned for the day after three attempts to begin proceedings. Modi, who customarily replies in the Lok Sabha first, is scheduled to address the Lower House on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-centre-spar-in-rajya-sabha-over-farm-laws-lower-house-still-stalled-101612380700484.html
04-02-2021||India||Government fends off global clamour on farm stir||India on Wednesday said criticism by foreign celebrities and attempts to “mobilise international support against India” on the government’s handling of the farmers’ protests without ascertaining facts were “neither accurate nor responsible” after comments by musician Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg, lawmakers in the US and UK, and several actors, activists and influencers sparked global clamour over the issue.A statement from the external affairs ministry contended that “vested interest groups” were trying to enforce their agenda on the protests to derail them, and have tried to mobilise global support against India. In this context, the statement referred to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others” but didn’t name anyone.It is rare for the external affairs ministry to respond to tweets by foreign celebrities critical of events within the country, though it has, in recent weeks, pushed back against comments by leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and lawmakers in the UK and other countries supporting the farmers’ protest.The ministry’s statement, for the first time, included two hashtags - #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda.As protests against three contentious farm laws have snowballed, they have attracted attention around the world, including among celebrities and lawmakers. Though some celebrities who aren’t well known in India have made social media posts on the issue over the past few days, singer Rihanna was the most high-profile personality to take up the issue on Twitter on Tuesday.Rihanna, who has 101 million followers on Twitter and is among the highest-selling recording artistes in history, triggered a storm on Tuesday by tweeting “why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest”, along with a link to a CNN article about the farmers’ protest that was also part of a subsequent tweet on Wednesday by 18-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg.Thunberg tweeted: “We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India.” The tweet was both supported and criticised by sections within India. Author Meena Harris, the niece of US vice president Kamala Harris, too, joined those criticising the government’s handling of the protests on Wednesday, drawing a link between the demonstrations in India and the assault on the US Capitol by supporters of former president Donald Trump.“It’s no coincidence that the world’s oldest democracy was attacked not even a month ago, and as we speak, the most populous democracy is under assault. This is related. We ALL should be outraged by India’s internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters,” Harris tweeted.India’s foreign ministry said in response to these statements that it “would like to emphasise that these protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse”.“Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken. The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” it added.Union home minister Amit Shah wrote on Twitter: “No propaganda can deter India’s unity! No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights! Propaganda cannot decide India’s fate only ‘Progress’ can. India stands united and together to achieve progress.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted: “Motivated campaigns targeting India will never succeed. We have the self confidence today to hold our own. This India will push back.”James Costa, a Democratic congressman who serves on the influential US house foreign affairs committee, too supported the farmers’ right to protest. “The unfolding events in India are troubling. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am closely monitoring the situation. The right to peaceful protest must always be respected. #FarmersProtest,” he tweeted.Since last month, US actor John Cusack, a group of 36 lawmakers in the UK and a spokesperson for UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres have backed the farmers’ protest and taken up the matter on social media and other forums.Indian celebrities Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Karan Johar and Suniel Shetty said citizens should focus on the government’s efforts to resolve the ongoing farmer crisis rather than paying attention to “half truths” and those creating differences. While Kumar said that efforts by the government to solve the issue were “evident”, Devgn urged people to be wary of “false propaganda against India or Indian policies”. Johar and Shetty, too, supported the Indian government’s statement.Watch: Akshay Kumar vs Rihanna as Bollywood backs government on farm rowFormer Indian cricket star Sachin Tendulkar too tweeted: “India’s sovereignty cannot be compromised. External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Let’s remain united as a nation.”India cricket captain Virat Kohli tweeted: “Let us all stay united in this hour of disagreements. Farmers are an integral part of our country and I’m sure an amicable solution will be found between all parties to bring about peace and move forward together.” The farmers’ protest began on November 26, and after several rounds of negotiations with the government failed to end the impasse over the three farm laws, farmer unions backing the agitation decided to intensify their stir.They organised a tractor rally in the national capital on Republic Day that descended into violence and chaos. Authorities responded by shutting down the internet at border points, digging ditches, driving spikes into roads and topping barricades with razor wire to prevent farmers from entering Delhi again.The farmers have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, and the external affairs ministry said these “reformist legislation” were passed by Parliament after a “full debate and discussion”. “These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming,” it said, explaining the government’s position on the laws.It said “a very small section of farmers in parts of India” had reservations about the reforms and the government initiated a series of talks with their representatives. Union ministers were part of the negotiations in 11 rounds of talks. “The government has even offered to keep the laws on hold, an offer iterated by no less than the Prime Minister of India,” it said.“Yet, it is unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them. This was egregiously witnessed on January 26, India’s Republic Day. A cherished national commemoration, the anniversary of the inauguration of the Constitution of India, was besmirched, and violence and vandalism took place in the Indian capital,” the statement said.The ministry said “some of these vested interest groups have also tried to mobilise international support against India”. Instigated by such “fringe elements”, Mahatma Gandhi statues were desecrated in parts of the world, and this is “extremely disturbing for India and for civilised society everywhere”.The BJP hit out at “propaganda and fake narratives” and also attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, alleging that he conspires with anti-India elements during his trips abroad. Gandhi, meanwhile, said India’s reputation has taken a “massive hit” and its biggest strength, its soft power, has been “shattered” by the BJP and the RSS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-fends-off-global-clamour-on-farm-stir-101612379873466.html

The coins were kept in a vault,” said Sahoo.Police officials said Santosh Kumar, who joined as branch manager on January 21, detected the discrepancy. Kumar lodged an FIR in this regard at Paradip Lock police station against two former bank managers, Amarjit Panda, Shiva Shankar Padhi and two employees Sangaram Kishore Behera and Saurav Soren. A case has been registered under Sections 420, 409 and 34 of IPC against them.“It is likely that the bank officials stole the coins everyday over the last 4 years. The CCTV camera feed of the bank may not be available,” said the inspector.A police team will conduct a probe into the matter. Last month, ₹2.61 crore was misappropriated from the bank’s Sadeipur branch within Balikuda police limits. The funds were allocations towards projects under Ama Gaon Ama Bikash scheme and Critical Grant Funds of the block.Senior officials from the bank’s headquarters have also started a separate probe into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coins-worth-rs-14-86-lakh-missing-from-union-bank-in-odisha-staff-under-scanner-101612380151472.html

We have the self confidence today to hold our own. This India will push back," Jaishankar said on Twitter with hastags #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda.In a strong response to the remarks made by Rihanna and other celebrities and activists, the Ministry of External Affairs earlier said the "temptation" of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments is "neither accurate, nor responsible".Besides Rihanna, Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, Meena Harris, an American lawyer and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, actress Amanda Cerni, singers Jay Sean, Dr Zeus and former adult star Mia Khalifa too voiced their support to the protesting farmers.Rihanna on Tuesday became the first global name to voice her support to the ongoing farmers agitation while criticising the Internet shutdown at the protest sites at Delhi border.In its reaction, the MEA also said some "vested interest groups" are trying to enforce their agenda on the protests and that a very small section of farmers in parts of the country have some reservations about the farm reforms which were passed by the Parliament after a full debate and discussion."Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken," the MEA said in the statement on 'recent comments by foreign individuals and entities on the farmers' protests'.Tens of thousands of farmers have been protesting at three border points on the outskirts of Delhi demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/motivated-campaigns-targeting-india-will-never-succeed-eam-s-jaishankar-101612378516214.html

The two officials noted the close cooperation between the two countries during the Covid-19 pandemic.Bhattacharyya thanked the Saudi side for taking care of the Indian community during the pandemic and hoped both sides would finalise an air bubble arrangement soon.The Saudi side thanked India for standing by Saudi Arabia during the pandemic, including on facilitating travel of Indian healthcare professionals to Saudi Arabia, and looked forward to supply of India-made Covid-19 vaccines, the external affairs ministry said.Both sides referred to Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2019 and “highlighted that the Strategic Partnership Council reflects the desire of the leadership of both sides to impart further momentum to this important relationship”, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-saudi-arabia-to-set-up-joint-working-groups-on-defence-and-security-101612377608237.html

Along with him, journalist Rajdeep Sardesai has also petitioned the top court for quashing of criminal cases. The petition was filed on Wednesday and the Supreme Court is yet to number the case for listing.In the petition, Tharoor and Sardesai have sought protection of their fundamental right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The genesis of the cases against them was a fleet of tweets in which Tharoor and Sardesai attributed the death of a protestor during the tractor rally in the Capital to police firing. Tharoor later deleted the tweet after coming to know that the reported incident was false as the death was due to an accident involving the protestor who had rammed the police barricades.On January 30, the Delhi Police lodged a case against Tharoor, Sardesai and several others for alleged misreporting and spreading disharmony. Simultaneously, cases were lodged at Gurugram in Haryana and in Madhya Pradesh under serious charges of sedition (IPC Section 124A) besides provisions of promoting enmity (IPC Section 153A), making assertions prejudicial to national integration (IPC Section 153B), among other provisions under the Information Technology Act.Tharoor and Sardesai have further stated that the multiple FIRs against them were a malafide exercise that was politically motivated as the contents of the FIRs were identical. The other people who have been named in these FIRs also have reportedly approached the top court seeking similar relief.

Age multiplied by ₹74.5k: SC panel||A tree’s monetary worth is its age multiplied by ₹74,500, a Supreme Court-appointed committee has submitted in a report, setting a guideline, for the first time in India, on the valuation of trees.The five-member committee of experts added that a heritage tree with a lifespan of well over 100 years could be valued at more than ₹1 crore -- and that the monetary value of a project, for which hundreds of trees are cut, is sometimes far less than the economic and environmental worth of the felled trees.The report was submitted before a Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, that had asked the committee members in January 2020 to determine the economic value of trees, based on cost of oxygen they release, and other benefits to the environment.Also read: Coins worth ₹14.86 lakh missing from Union Bank in OdishaThe bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, stressed on the necessity to do away with the evaluation of trees only on the basis of their timber value and rather focus on the positive impact of trees on the environment.For this purpose, the court, while hearing a case relating to cutting down of 356 trees for construction of five railway over-bridges (ROBs) in West Bengal, appointed a committee of five experts -- Nishikant Mukerji (managing director, Tiger Environment Centre), Soham Pandya, (secretary and executive director at the Centre of Science for Villages), Sunita Narain (director, Centre for Science and Environment), Bikash Kumar Maji (assistant chief engineer, ROB unit, West Bengal government) and Niranjita Mitra (division forest officer, North 24 Parganas).According to the report filed in February last year but made public on Wednesday, a tree is worth ₹74,500 a year. Out of this, the cost of oxygen alone is ₹45,000, followed by cost of biofertilisers, which are worth ₹20,000. Upon adding costs of micronutrients and compost, the report stated, living trees will more often than not outweigh the benefit of most of the projects they are felled for.Commenting on the West Bengal government’s plea to cut 356 trees, some of which were heritage trees, the committee evaluated their worth at ₹220 crore.The Supreme Court has not accepted the report yet, and sought the responses from the central government, West Bengal government and an NGO involved in the case.“The committee’s recommendation will make every government go bankrupt. So, we need to fine tune a few suggestions,” the court observed on Wednesday.The committee also suggested that instead of cutting trees for highway projects, the governments should first explore alternatives such as using existing waterways and railway lines to facilitate traffic and transport infrastructure.In case trees must be removed, the committee said, the first endeavour should be to relocate them, making use of modern technology, and if they must be felled; it also added that planting five saplings in lieu of one tree was not good enough since a 100-year-old tree cannot be equated with a few fresh saplings. It recommended that for a tree with small crown size, 10 saplings should be planted; 25 saplings for a tree with medium crown size; and 50 saplings for a tree with large crown size.Crown is part of the tree from which branches grow above the trunk.The bench, during the hearing on Wednesday, commended the committee’s efforts, adding that it was inclined to lay down certain new guidelines for all future projects which required felling trees in view of the report. It found favour with the recommendation that a developer must look to use existing waterways and railway lines before insisting on a road project that required cutting trees.The top court further expressed its displeasure at a central government notification that did away with the need for an environment impact assessment (EIA) for a road project of less than 100km.“Your notification is untenable. It is based on an assumption that no damage is done to the environment if a project is less than 100km in length. We will examine validity of your notification,” the bench told additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who appeared for the Union government in the matter.Apart from Bhati, the court also asked the West Bengal government and advocate Prashant Bhushan, who represented the NGO Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, which challenged the decision to cut the trees for the ROB project, to submit responses to the committee’s report. The bench will hear the matter next after two weeks.Speaking to HT, Sunita Narain, a committee member, said: “It is very important to identify and assess the historical and ecological significance of the heritage trees. They cannot be equated with fresh saplings, given the exceptional historical, cultural aesthetic values such trees they have because of their age or their association with an event or a person. All efforts must be made to accord them special protection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whats-the-value-of-a-tree-age-multiplied-by-74-5k-sc-panel-101612377235565.html
04-02-2021||India||TN govt fortifies places with Jaya link ahead of Sasikala’s arrival||With VK Sasikala, the close aide and confidante of the late J Jayalalithaa, set to return to Chennai on Sunday, the ruling AIADMK is ensuring that it is firmly in control of some of the physical manifestations of the former chief minister’s legacy -- her burial place and her residence.Late Tuesday, the public works department (PWD) temporarily closed entry for the public to a ₹80 crore memorial built for Jayalalithaa on Marina beach, citing unfinished work just a week after it was opened. In a massive show of strength, chief minister E Palaniswami had inaugurated the memorial on January 27 -- the same day as Sasikala’s release from prison.“The work will take at least 15 days to be complete,” said a senior PWD official who asked not to be named. Though the main structure is complete, work is on at a museum and an educational room for students. “It is difficult to complete this work with crowds thronging,” AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar said on Wednesday.Though Sasikala completed her four-year prison sentence in the disproportionate assets case in Bengaluru last week, she was being treated for Covid-19 at the city’s Victoria hospital, and is currently in quarantine.Also read: Sasikala may fight EC move on poll symbolJayalalithaa’s burial place is likely to be one of the stops for Sasikala when she returns to Chennai on February 7. Four years ago, while she was on her way to Bengaluru to surrender, she had halted here and thumped her palm thrice on the ground, taking a vow.Jayalalithaa’s sprawling residence ,Veda Nilayam at Poes Garden, is also being guarded by police barricades. A day after opening Jayalalithaa’s mausoleum, Palaniswami had inaugurated her residence as a memorial with several riders from the Madras high court including not to open it to the public.The government’s acquisition and transformation of the property is being challenged in court by Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs - niece J Deepa and nephew J Deepak. Sasikala moved in here with Jayalalithaa in 1988. She lived there permanently even after Jayalalithaa’s death, except for brief periods in 1996 and 2012 when Jayalalithaa had banished her.Sasikala was building a bungalow opposite this property before it was attached by the Income Tax department in October 2020.Sasikala will be staying in Chennai’s T Nagar near the house of her niece Krishnapriya -- whose mother J Ilavarasi is an accused in the same case and will also be released from Bengaluru prison on February 5. “From Hosur up to her T Nagar house she will receive a grand welcome,” said her nephew TTV Dhinakaran, who floated the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) with a breakaway faction of Sasikala’s supporters who want her to reclaim the AIADMK.Sasikala also plans to file a curative petition to claim the AIADMK’s name and iconic “two leaves” symbol which presently belongs to the Palaniswami-led. “In 2019 parliamentary elections and assembly bypolls, AMMK contested against two-leaves symbol and tried to divide the AIADMK so no cadre or people of Tamil Nadu will accept them,” said Jayakumar.“AIADMK wants to pre-empt the Sasikala faction from encashing on Jayalalithaa’s legacy and the memorial is a symbol of those efforts,” said political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “Sasikala may also show her strength by making a trip to the memorial to counter the AIADMK but it will be a one-day show and may not have a lingering effect.”After Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016, AIAMDK elected Sasikala as party general secretary. She was set to become chief minister, but after her imprisonment, the warring factions of Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam united and expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran from the party.Meanwhile, the AIADMK on Wednesday removed its Karnataka secretary M P Yuvaraj for ‘bringing disrepute to the party’.“He tried to meet Sasikala,” said a senior AIADMK leader seeking anonymity. “He has been trying for the past two days; that is wrong,” AIADMK has expelled several functionaries on similar lines for putting up posters welcoming her as the ‘party general secretary’. Sasikala is quarantining in a resort in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-govt-fortifies-places-with-jaya-link-ahead-of-sasikala-s-arrival-101612376995926.html
04-02-2021||India||AIADMK moves to deny Sasikala access to Jayalalithaa’s memorials||Ahead of V K Sasikala’s return to Chennai on February 7, Tamil Nadu’s ruling party AIADMK is ensuring that it is firmly in control of some of the physical manifestations of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s legacy -- her burial place and residence.Late Tuesday, the public works department (PWD) temporarily closed entry for the public at the ₹80-crore memorial built for Jayalalithaa on the Marina beach citing unfinished work just a week after it was opened.In a huge show of strength, chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami had inaugurated it on January 27 - timed carefully on the same day as Sasikala's release from prison. Though she completed her four-year prison sentence in the disproportionate assets case in Bengaluru on that day; she was being treated for Covid-19 at the city’s Victoria hospital and is currently in quarantine.“The work will take at least 15 days to complete,” said a senior PWD official not wishing to be named. Though the main structure built like a phoenix is complete, adjacent to it works are on for a museum and an educational room for students.“It is difficult to complete this work with crowds thronging,” AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar said at a press conference on Wednesday. He said that it was inaugurated because the first phase of the mausoleum was complete.Jayalalithaa’s memorial is likely to be one of the stops for Sasikala when she returns. In February 2017, while she was on her way to Bengaluru to surrender, she had halted at the memorial and thumped her palm thrice on the ground, seemingly taking a vow.The government has boosted security around Jayalalithaa’s sprawling residence ‘Veda Nilayam’ at the upscale Poes Garden. A day after opening Jayalalithaa’s mausoleum, Palaniswami inaugurated her residence as a memorial with several riders from the Madras high court including not to open it to the public.Assistant commissioner of police, KPS Devaraj said that security arrangements were made from the day Jayalalithaa's residence was turned into a memorial on January 28. "There are 20 policemen including an inspector guarding the place since its opening because of high court's order not to allow the public," said Devaraj of Teynampet police station which has jurisdiction over Poes Garden.The government’s acquisitions and transformation of the property is being challenged in court by Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs - niece J Deepa and nephew J Deepak. Sasikala had moved into the residence with Jayalalithaa in 1988. She lived there permanently even after Jayalalithaa’s death except for brief periods in 1996 and 2012, when Jayalalithaa had banished her.

Her mother, Sasikala's sister-in-law J Ilavarasi who was convicted in the same case will be released from a Bengaluru prison on February 5.“From Hosur to her T Nagar house she will receive a grand welcome,” Sasikala's nephew TTV Dhinakaran told reporters. “We will bring a major change to Tamil Nadu,” said Dhinakaran who floated Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) with a breakaway faction of Sasikala’s supporters who want her to reclaim the AIADMK.Sasikala also plans to file a curative petition to claim the AIADMK's iconic ‘two-leaves’ symbol. The AIADMK has declared that Sasikala who was expelled from the party in 2017 will not be be taken back into the fold.“In the 2019 parliamentary elections and assembly by-polls, AMMK contested against two-leaves symbol and tried to divide the AIADMK so no cadre or people of Tamil Nadu will accept them,” said Jayakumar.Political observers feel may not be able to galvanise supporters in large numbers to bring in decisive change quickly“AIADMK wants to pre-empt the Sasikala faction from encashing on Jayalalithaa’s legacy and the memorial is a symbol of those efforts,” said political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “Sasikala may also show her strength by making a trip to the memorial to counter the AIADMK but it will be a one-day show and may not have a lingering effect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-moves-to-deny-sasikala-access-to-jayalalithaa-s-memorials-101612375528903.html
04-02-2021||India||SC refuses to order probe into violence during tractor rally||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to order a probe into the violence and chaos that engulfed the national capital during the tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day, citing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that “the law will take its own course”.An SC bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde declined to entertain a bunch of three petitions that demanded an investigation either by a committee under a retired Supreme Court judge or by an agency such as the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, expressed confidence that with the government looking into the matter, the apex court did not need to wade into the issue at the moment.Also read: Govt will help find missing farmers, assures Delhi CM“We are sure the government is inquiring into it. They are investigating into it. We also read the Prime Minister’s statement on the incident that the law will take its own course, which means that the government is investigating into it and will take appropriate action,” the CJI observed.At an all-party meeting on January 30, PM Modi had referred to the violence at Red Fort on Republic Day when groups of farmers protesting against three laws aimed at opening up agricultural markets clashed with the police.He asserted that “the law will take its own course.” The PM was responding to opposition demands for a special probe of the incidents at the Fort.On Wednesday, advocate Vishal Tiwari, one of the petitioners, urged the court to order a probe by a judicial committee. He pleaded that the bench ensure the probe was not conducted in a one-sided manner.The bench retorted: “Should we assume it is going to be one-sided. Obviously, they will investigate everybody.”Another petitioner in the case, advocate Shikha Dixit, sought to highlight the problems of commuters and those who were not connected with the protests.“There is a sense of insecurity among the people. Policemen were brutally beaten up. How will a common man feel safe?” she questioned.“Sense of insecurity need not be there. We are not condoning anything, but there is already an investigation taking place. Let there be an investigation first,” added the CJI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-order-probe-into-violence-during-tractor-rally-101612376878857.html
04-02-2021||India||Global tweets energise rural, tech-savvy social media team||A surge in global support for the months-long farmers’ agitation against three agricultural pro-reform laws, led by popstar Rihanna and Swedish climate-change icon Greta Thunberg, has energised a small, rural, tech-savvy team behind the agitation’s international outreach. It has also brought fresh challenges: internet clampdowns and suspended social-media accounts.Social-media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have played a central role in the farmers’ protests going global, as supporters scattered around the world have amplified the protests.The government directed Twitter to act against about 250 Twitter accounts that posed a “grave threat to public order”.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stirTens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Sikh-dominated Punjab and Haryana, have blocked entry points into New Delhi for more than two months, demanding the repeal of three pro-reform laws passed in September last year.Farmers say the laws will allow corporate giants to take control over a vast, antiquated agricultural sector that supports half of all Indians.Farmers have tapped an array of social-media and messaging platforms – SnapChat, Firechat, Signal and so on – to spread information and disseminate videos and photos from the protests in five sites around the national capital. Social media tools have given the protesters an edge in reaching supporters globally.The idea of a digital wing, alongside the physical protests, was not among plans of the farmers until “misinformation” and “propaganda” to tarnish the agitation went viral, said Baljeet Singh Sandhu, the head of the digital team and vice-president of the Majha Kisan Committee, a farm organisation.“We have been called Khalistani terrorists and what not? We knew that we had to counter it,” Sandhu said. Khalistani is a reference to supporters of a Sikh separatist movement.Early in December last year, a team of five tech-savvy farmers went back to their villages, brought their laptops and got going under a rain-slick tarpaulin tent, known as the “hub,” at the Singhu border, a major protest site north of Delhi.The digital arm of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions leading the protests, called the Kisan Ekta Morcha, has a five-member team --: two farmers are from Punjab, two from Haryana and one from Rajasthan.The team records videos, devises hashtags, takes photographs and streams press conferences. They tweet slogans and videos in their thousands every day.Its Twitter account by the same name, ordered to be shut down by the government, has 186,288 followers while its Instagram account has 219,169 followers. The farmers’ YouTube channel is subscribed by 1.2 million people.On December 21, the Facebook page of the Kisan Ekta Morcha was gaining followers so rapidly within a span of a few hours that Facebook’s internal algorithms mistakenly flagged it as spam, leading to a shutdown.A plethora of anti-Walmarters and opposers of big corporations in the US and elsewhere, apart from independent farm organisations, have also picked up the thread.Cities where demonstrations have been held include global financial hubs, New York, Sydney and London. Protests have also been organised in other overseas towns and cities including Leicester in the UK; Sacramento, California; Houston, Texas; Melbourne, Australia; and Ontario, Canada.In November, Ludhiana-based software engineer Bhavjeet Singh launched the @Tractor2twitr Twitter account to garner global protests.“Big corporations have common global policies that hurt interests of consumers and small growers,” said Anastasia Elliot of Walmart Watch, a Washington-based NGO.“So, anti-capitalists of the world must unite to protect larger interests of society whether in developed or developing countries. We support Indian farmers,” she said in an email.Mewa Singh, the head of Non-Resident Indian Council in Punjab’s Ropar, said his office constantly coordinated with Indians abroad on making the protests global. “My son, a resident of Houston coordinated the protests there,” he said.Sikhs make up 1.4% of Canada’s population, but their close- knit community is an influential voting block. “We stand by Punjab’s farmers because that’s who our ancestors were,” said Banda Singh, a resident of Brampton, Ontario.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-tweets-energise-rural-tech-savvy-social-media-team-101612376816143.html
04-02-2021||India||Govt notice to Twitter over restored handles, warns firm of action||The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has served notice on Twitter Inc. to again block over 250 accounts and posts to which the microblogging site restored access after blocking them briefly for using a false and controversial hashtag in connection with the ongoing farmers’ protest on the capital’s borders, officials said.The notice states that Twitter, by unblocking the accounts and posts, was in violation of Section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act that carries a maximum punishment of seven years’ imprisonment , officials familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. The notice, the officials said, was sent Tuesday evening.Twitter on Monday blocked access to accounts associated with the farmers’ protest to Indian users on the government’s demand.The blocks, which only applied for viewers based in India, came after the Indian government hit Twitter with a legal demand. Many of the blocked accounts used the hashtag “ModiPlanningFarmerGenocide,” Following criticism of the move, Twitter unblocked them by late Monday.“This is a clear violation of Indian law that Twitter is supposed to follow,” said one of the officials cited above.Also read: Government fends off global clamour on farm stirAmong the handles temporarily withdrawn in India on Monday were those of Kisan Ekta Morcha, an affiliate of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella group leading the ongoing farmers’ protest. Action was also taken again the Twitter accounts of media outlet Caravan, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar (who was merely highlighting the hashtag to authorities) , activist Hansraj Meena, former Lok Sabha MP and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Mohammed Salim, and actor Sushant Singh.MeitY, in the notice, a copy of which has been seen by Hindustan Time, said: “Having considered in totality, the contents of the interim order, the oral submissions of the advocate/representative of Twitter at the Committee meeting, and also the mail from Twitter expressing its disobedience of the legal blocking orders, the competent authority is satisfied that it is necessary and also expedient in the interest of public order and also for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to public order that Twitter, as an intermediary under section 2[1][w] of the act is once again directed to block for access by the public, the said Twitter handles and also the said hashtag with immediate effect (attached as Annexure-I).”The committee meeting refers to an inter-ministerial panel’s sitting that allows a third party to seek a review of government directions.Thousands of farmers have been camping on the borders of Delhi since November 26 to demand the repeal of three farm laws that cultivators say would potentially weaken their bargaining power, leave them and the mercy of big agribusinesses and lead to the dismantlement of a system of minimum support prices for foodgrains.“You are aware of the prevailing situation, which not only has the potential, but has in fact, resulted into a major public order issue on 26.01.2021,” the MeitY notice said, referring to the violence that took place in Delhi during a tractors’ rally on Republic Day. “The statutory authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that no adverse public order situation takes place and no cognizable offences are committed.”“In light of these developments and as apart of due process, and as per the settled practice, an order was passed under Rule 9 of the Information Technology [Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public] Rules, 2009,which have ensued in the exercise of powers under section 69A[2] of the Information and Technology Act, 2000.”.Under Section69(A) {2}of the Information Technology Act, the government can suspend accounts that pose a threat to public order.The notice also stated that Twitter has no “no constitutional, statutory or any legal basis whatsoever to comment upon the interplay of statutory provisions with constitutional principles or to unilaterally read down the scope of statutory provisions as per its own limited private understanding of the constitutional and statutory laws of India”.“This a is motivated campaign to abuse, inflame and create tension in society on unsubstantiated grounds. Incitement to Genocide is Not Freedom of Speech; It is Threat to Law & Order,” the notice said.The government added that it considered the submissions of Twitter but found that it is necessary to take down the accounts in public interest.Twitter declined to comment on the issue. The accounts, however, were accessible until late Wednesday night.Last week, the government wrote to the microblogging site to take down posts and accounts that ran the controversial hashtag. Twitter blocked the accounts but restored them and said that they constitute free speech and are newsworthy.“The farmer’s protest has been going on for months but the government has not blocked a single account before now,” said a second official familiar with the matter. “If such a decision was taken, it would have factored in the consequences of running a hashtag that alludes to senior people in the government planning being involved in some sort of conspiracy.”MeitY issued the directions to block the accounts under section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act after the ministry of home affairs (MHA) stepped in, the people quoted above said. “The home ministry said that the tweets could lead to an adverse law and order situation. The accounts have been withheld to prevent an escalation of violence,” an official familiar with the matter said on Monday.Raman Chima, Asia Pacific Director at Access Now, a digital rights organisation, said: “For initiating the imprisonment sentence, the government will have to take Twitter to court. Twitter can always challenge it by saying what is happening isn’t legal. This will open up a problematic can of worms because since 2005 governments have been cautious about not making tech company executives liable for content posted by users.”He added: “The government has not provided the actual 69(A) order. It is perverse in the Indian republic to censure somebody without providing the actual document. The SC, on internet shutdowns, has said that you cannot deprive anybody of their rights online without making the order public. There is no legal mandate for confidentiality with the government other than the rules they have framed themselves. These are not constitutional.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-notice-to-twitter-over-restored-handles-warns-firm-of-action-101612376755832.html
04-02-2021||India||Jind mahapanchayat adopts five resolutions on farm laws||Thousands of people thronged a mega rally of farmers in the heart of Haryana on Wednesday as leaders of the ongoing protest against three agriculture laws called on young people to join the stir and demanded the government remove restrictions around the agitation sites in Delhi and repeal the controversial legislation.The kisan mahapanchayat in Jind’s Kandela village, known as the political nerve centre of the influential Jat community, drew the participation of 50 khaps, or clan-based bodies, and more than 30 thousand people.The event ended with the adoption of five resolutions: repealing of the laws passed in September, legal backing to the minimum support price regime, implementation of the 2004 Swaminathan Commission recommendations, farm loan waiver and withdrawal of police cases against farmer protesters.The mahapanchayat was addressed by over two dozenpeople, including farm leader Rakesh Tikait, whose emotional appeal for support last week attracted thousands of people from western Uttar Pradesh to a protest site outside Delhi and rejuvenated the two-month-long stir.Also read: Increased police blockades cut protesters off from toilets, water“We have so far talked about “bill wapsi” (repealing the farm laws). The government should listen carefully. What will you do if the youth call for “gaddi wapsi” (removal from power)?” he said.Tikait, a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), also attacked the government over heavy barricading of the three main protest sites on Delhi’s outskirts: Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur. The sites have turned into fortresses with police digging trenches, putting up barbed wire fences, concrete barricades and hammering beds of nails on roads. The police action came after farmers ran riot during a tractor rally on Republic Day, storming the Red Fort and hoisting the Sikh flag from its ramparts. Since then, at least 115 farmers have been held by police.“Our khaps have decided to remove these nails and barbed wires,” he said. “Jab-Jab Raja darta hai, kilebandi karta hai (Whenever a king feels threatened, he fortifies),” he added, the crowd chanting the slogan with him.“I want to assure you that your turban will not bend before anyone and the government will have to repeal the farm laws. We are ready to protest till October and will observe this year as Yuva kranti [youth revolution],” he added, to loud applause.Tikait also called on young people to visit fields and bring soil and water to their houses. “ I urge you to visit your fields and touch the soil with your body. If you do this, no one will sell your land to anyone in extreme situations too in the next 50 years. We have to save our lands. You give me your anger and we will win this battle.”His speech was cut short when the main stage collapsed under the weight of the people standing on it. No one was seriously hurt.This was the first mahapanchayat in Haryana since the farm protests began last year and was held in the politically sensitive Kandela village, considered a rebel belt of Haryana farmers. The village shot to limelight in 2002 when nine farmers died in police firing during protests against the state government’s refusal to waive power bills. The farmers banned then chief minister OP Chautala and his family from the village, and only relented in 2019 current deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and his uncle Abhay Chautala of apologised.Tekram Kandela, head of the Kandela khap, said Tikait called him and asked to hold a mahapanchayat. “It was the people of Kandela, who blocked the Chandigarh –Hisar highway within an hour after seeing the weeping video of him on January 27 evening. Hundreds of farmers from our village reached the Ghazipur border that night. Rakesh Tikait took part in the meeting to thank the khaps and other farmers,” Kandela said in the meeting.Tikait’s brother, BKU chief Naresh Tikait, held a similar mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar last week when farmers -- many of whom hailed from the Jat community -- vowed to join the stir.In his speech, Tikait put to rest any speculation about a rift between the farm unions and said 40 leaders who are part of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body leading the agitation, will continue to hold negotiations with the government. “We will support the Punjab leadership. The Punjab leadership will head the delegation,” he added.“We will not change any of our 40 members, who are part of delegation. In this war, we will not change our horses but fight this battle with injured horses,” he added.The protest was set off by three laws passed September that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for economies of scale and lay down new contract farming rules.Farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices. The government has refuted the concerns, and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but talks are currently locked in a stalemate..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jind-mahapanchayat-adopts-five-resolutions-on-farm-laws-101612376755370.html

The vaccines will be from Pune's Serum Institute of India, which India has already bought for the first phase of vaccination that started in the country from January 16. These doses will be in addition to India's direct deal with Pune's Serum Institute of India as this is being done by Covax facility, which will also cover several other countries.India fastest nation to reach 4 million Covid-19 vaccination mark in 18 days: GovtThe amount of the doses are in proportion to population size. According to the document, Pakistan will be getting 17.2 million doses, Nigeria 16 million, Indonesia 13.7 million, Bangladesh 12.8 million and Brazil 10.6 million.Covax was set up to counter vaccine nationalism, keeping in mind the situation of the lower-income countries which might be left behind in the global vaccine race. It is backed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.Covax will be distributing Oxford vaccine and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine but India will get Oxford vaccine from the facility.According to its document, it will distribute 240 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, licensed to Serum Institute, 96 million doses of Astrazeneca-Oxford vaccine, under the advance purchase agreement between Gavi and Astrazenecam and 1.2 million doses of Pfizer vaccine.

04-02-2021||India||Parliament library to continue home delivery of books despite lukewarm response||In May last year, as the country battled with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Parliament Library came up with a novel suggestion to aid MPs in their quest for research — home delivery of books. The move, said officials familiar with the matter, was an idea floated by none other than the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. Officials added that the Speaker takes a special interest in the library, even going so far as to invite suggestions to improve the conditions of the library last year. Almost a year since, the library has issued nearly 1500 books (between June and December 2020), but only a few of these have been delivered to residences of the parliamentarians in Delhi, officials familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times. According to a bulletin circulated among the members of Parliament, the facility will continue for now.“Around seven or eight MPs [members of Parliament] requested the books be delivered to their residences,” said a Parliament official, who did not want to be named. “...others had the books collected by their personal assistants. There is no separate record maintained for the books delivered to the homes of MPs.”The official added many MPs returned to their constituencies because of the pandemic, which may be the primary reason why fewer books were requested. Former Lok Sabha speaker Shivraj Patil; Congress MPs Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary, and Jairam Ramesh; Bharatiya Janata Party lawmakers Rakesh Sinha and Bhupendra Yadav were among those who requested the books/periodicals to be either home delivered or shared online.Also Read | Parliament proceedings halted amid protest over farm laws: All you need to know“We get many telephonic queries. ...we have worked from home and worked a lot to keep up with the demands. The reading room was reopened around September and to ensure social distancing norms, we asked the MPs to keep every second seat vacant,” second a second official.The entries in the register in the reading room have gone down with Sinha’s name figuring the most.A third official, who has worked at the library for nearly 15 years, said the MPs would saunter in [frequently] during the pre-Covid times. “Now we see a lot less of them... the sessions have been very short,” said the official.The third official said around 150-200 MPs would visit the library daily during sessions before the pandemic. The library issued over 3,000 books from May 2019 to March last year when the Parliament was adjourned as India introduced the lockdown to check the Covid-19 spread.The Winter Session of Parliament was cancelled in November because of the pandemic. Parliament normally holds three sessions in a year. The Budget Session is held from the end of January to early April, Monsoon from July to August, and Winter between November and December. Last year, the Budget Session was cut short by eight days, and a shortened Monsoon Session was also reduced by the same duration due to the pandemic. The ongoing Budget Session began on January 29.The first official said most MPs sought references to add value to the debates. “Most books issued are on the subjects of economics, finance, constitution, law, debates, acts, and bills,” the first official said. “Many MPs also request newspapers. We have even shared the information on WhatsApp.”Access to foreign dailies such as The New York Times has also been granted. Last year in March, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla wrote to MPs such as Sinha and Ramesh seeking suggestions on how to make the Parliament library the best.Sinha said the library staff has been very cooperative and even helped him get many rare books. “They would purchase the books and even home deliver them,” he said. “I got a copy of [Leo] Tolstoy’s Hum Karein Kya [the Hindi translation of What Is to Be Done describing contemporary Russia] and The Indian Ideology by Anderson Perry.”Ramesh said his main suggestion was the library should be opened to students and scholars. “The present procedures are far too cumbersome. I have suggested that MPs should be able to access the library digitally from home. For instance, if I want to search the catalogue, I have to physically go to the library and do the search there. I have told the parliamentary affairs minister in the past that MPs at least should be allowed to search from their residences. In fact, anybody should be able to.”Officials, however, said that the database can be accessed from anywhere in the country. The library allows access to 1.8 million journals, periodicals, newspapers, and books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-library-to-continue-home-delivery-of-books-despite-lukewarm-response-101612342251125.html

There was widespread outrage after Delhi Police cemented nails near barricades at Ghazipur (Delhi-Uttar Pradesh) and Tikri (Delhi-Haryana) borders. Barbed wire and cement barricades were also part of the multilayered security placed by the police. One of Haryana’s prominent khaps, Kandela khap, organised a ‘Kisan mahapanchayat’ in Kandela village of Jind district on Wednesday where BKU president Rakesh Tikait and several other leaders of various farmer unions were present. The mahapanchayat demanded repeal of the three farm laws.The proceedings of Parliament on Tuesday were also affected by the farmers' protest as the opposition demanded a discussion on the agitation. Both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha faced repeated adjournments on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the government agreed to the opposition and said that the farmer protests will be discussed for 15 hours in parliament.The protest also witnessed a tremendous outpouring of support on social media as international pop star Rihanna, climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, and lawmakers from the United States and the United Kingdom tweeted about the agitation forcing the external affairs ministry to respond. A statement issued by the external affairs ministry on Wednesday contended “vested interest groups” are trying to enforce their agenda on the protests to derail them and said these groups have tried to mobilise global support against India. The statement also referred to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others” but didn’t name anyone.Follow all the updates here:'Good that Rihanna and Greta Thunberg can wake up the MEA': Congress leader P ChidambaramIt is good that Rihanna and Greta Thunberg can wake up the MEA.Come on MEA, when will you realize that people concerned with issues of human rights and livelihoods do not recognize national boundaries?Congress leader P Chidambaram, in his reaction to Rihanna's viral tweet about farmers protest, tweeted "It is good that Rihanna and Greta Thunberg can wake up the MEA.

04-02-2021||Today's||Don’t force farm laws, let states decide for themselves||Over the last six months, so much has been said and written about the farmers’ agitation consequent to the enactment of the new farm bills, that I was wondering if anything more can be said for the bureaucrats and politicians engaged in defence of the farm bills that will make them understand that they are grossly wrong. It is not understood what is it that the government will lose if these laws are not implemented. Where is the urgency to implement something whose outcome is not easy to quantify? The government has been trying to convince people that these laws will help in attracting private investment in the agriculture sector, which will increase the farmer’s income. To achieve the goal to double farmer’s income will depend on multiple factors such as the size of farm holding, nature of crop, productivity levels and marketing facilities. This can never happen by one-size-fits-all farm laws. And there are millions of farmers who are not convinced. In fact, the farmers are agitating seeking the repeal of these laws as they feel the new laws will ensure that the present system of assured minimum support price will collapse, leading to the exploitation of the farmers at the hands of the private players. Ensure MSP for oilseeds, pulses and other crops The Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act was enacted in Punjab in 1961, with a view to regulate sale, purchase, storage and processing of agricultural produce. Those were the times when India faced acute food shortages. When the Green Revolution started in Punjab, the central government was looking to build up food reserves and prevent shortages. This was followed by the minimum support price for wheat in 1966 and later for other crops. Over a period of time, the infrastructure created under the APMC Act, combined with MSP for wheat and paddy, not only reduced the shortages but created surpluses. Punjab and Haryana have been feeding the nation since the Green Revolution. In fact, paddy, which was never a traditional crop in Punjab and Haryana, has become one the main crops only because of MSP. Today, one of the undisclosed reasons for the enactment of the new farm laws is to bring down production of wheat and paddy and consequently reduce the burden of procurement. It is no secret that the central government has not been able to handle the surpluses in wheat and paddy. The new farm laws unfortunately are no solution to this. The solution lies in ensuring MSP and assured procurement for oilseeds, pulses and other crops where the government depends on imports. The farmer is willing to cultivate other crops in lieu of wheat and paddy, provided the returns on investment are assured through MSP and procurement. What is important is to understand that while there may be different views on this subject, one thing which should be clear to all policy makers in Delhi, is, that no immediate revolution is going to take place if the farm laws are implemented. The abstract concepts such as the new farm laws will open up new avenues for the farmers to increase their income, or the freedom to the farmer to sell to anyone and anywhere etc are concepts which do not ensure MSP. On the contrary, if these laws are not implemented, the policy makers can review the other options available, like devising schemes for assured MSP and procurement for crops other than wheat and paddy. The rural infrastructure created in Punjab and Haryana from income generated under APMC, has contributed to the overall development of these states, and hence should be the model. Enhance PDS, subsidise foodgrain exports India is big and diverse. Kerala does not have APMC or MSP, because it is not required in a state where most of the land is under coffee, rubber or coconut plantations, and the paddy produced in Kerala is for local consumption. The solution, therefore, is to allow the states to legislate on this subject, as agriculture and marketing are in the state list under the Constitution. The central government enacted these laws considering itself competent under entry 33 of the concurrent list which relates to trade. The Supreme Court may adjudicate, if the matter comes up before it. However, there is no reason why the states should not have the freedom to choose to follow the farm laws or not, depending on the requirements and circumstances of each state. Since MSP for wheat and paddy is mostly relevant to Punjab, Haryana and a few other states, the existing system should continue. To deal with the surpluses, the central government should enhance the public distribution system and subsidise exports of foodgrains. This will bring stability in agriculture production and allow the poor segment of society to a little better access to subsidised foodgrains. We should not forget that if all Indians had the purchasing power of citizens of western countries, there would be no surplus grain in India. Since the whole world subsidises for their farmers, let’s not deprive our farmers, who in any case are the poorest in the world. Private investment in agriculture welcome In the long run, private investment in agriculture is welcome. However, the final test of any policy is determined by the outcome in terms of who gains and who loses. In the present scenario, while the government claims that the farmer will gain, it is the farmer who thinks the opposite. Why should then the government force a law, particularly in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, where it has been seen that there are no takers for these laws. Let the states decide for themselves. That is the only solution. brbajaj@gmail.com The writer is a retired Punjab-cadre IAS officer.

04-02-2021||Today's||Covid-19: Opportunities, challenges and growth for the edtech sector||Few events in recent history have caused as much disruption, across spheres, as Covid-19. This rupture was most acutely felt in the realm of education. While e-commerce took seven years to pick momentum in India and billions of dollars to change consumer behaviour, this occurred almost overnight for the education technology (edtech) sector. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital education with the indefinite closure of educational institutes across the world. With prolonged lockdowns, people had little choice but to adapt and move their activities online. Unlike the resourceful information technology (IT) and IT enabled-services sectors, which could afford to adjust to the new normal, the Indian education system was ill-equipped and unprepared to move teaching and instructions online.Eventually, urban India caught on, after instituting new methodologies for conducting online classes. The story remains incomplete for semi-urban and rural India, as schools in large swathes of the country struggled to host sessions due to a paucity of resources. Nevertheless, the pandemic has opened up space, giving educational start-ups the opportunity to expand their businesses and reach.Receiving over $2.2 billion of funding, the Indian edtech sector dominated headlines through 2020. The edtech ecosystem has seen multiple players catering across different verticals — from supporting schools for K-12 education to after school learning, from the massive test preparation market to, now, the adult lifelong learning segment.One of the key reasons for the resounding growth of this sector has definitely been the “local first” approach of the players, where they have embraced vernacular languages as well as taken into account regional disparities while implementing solutions. Though global in approach, this sector has been able to use both India’s demographic dividend to its advantage and leveraged the Indian consumers’ price elasticity for quality education.While issues of access were, at some level, resolved by select service providers, the real opportunity lies in the huge numbers that this sector has the potential to cater to. India continues to have the largest number of young people in any country, and they need to be skilled and trained for the next decade.Both audio and video content are now being delivered live and on demand, allowing students and participants to work at their own pace, as need be. There have also been huge advances in tech as well as curriculum design to minimise the use of internet bandwidth, given that this remains a constraint for most of our country. The learning experience has evolved to become more holistic, by adding gamification, communities, flip classrooms and discussion forums. There is a greater possibility and ability to personalise feedback for students and allow for assessments and reinforced learning. With learning on the go a possibility, corporates and adults alike see this as a renewed option to upskill themselves while not compromising productivity.But there are real challenges too.The widening gap between the haves and have-nots, and the lack of affordable access to quality teachers, rank high among the challenges faced online or offline in the education space. In addition, given that sustenance is a significant issue for emerging edtech players, maintaining quality is a tough task, considering that there is a dearth of qualified teachers who are digitally literate.While the National Education Policy 2020 lays emphasis on maximising online education opportunities through virtual labs, meeting teaching standards will be a long and arduous task that will take years to accomplish. The language proficiencies of teachers and students, lack of motivation to participate wilfully, and limits in allocations on education in annual budgets, are some of the other glaring challenges.However, a developing economy such as India must aspire and continue to dream about achieving higher levels of literacy, quality education and integration of technology into the sector. Periodic assessments, redressal mechanisms, stakeholder consultation, and timely policy changes can prepare us in facing the challenges posed by the education sector in the future.Divya Jain is the founder and CEO of SafeducateThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-opportunities-challenges-and-growth-for-the-edtech-sector-101612444940062.html
04-02-2021||Today's||The new avatar of the encryption wars||The government has proposed a new bill to regulate mathematics. The bill envisages that certain mathematical operations such as multiplication, division, LCM and GCD would be banned, if they are prime numbers and have more than 309 digits and a licensing regime, which would only allow licensed entities to perform these operations.If the above reads like a parody, it may soon cease to be and become reality.An Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull declared in 2017 that, “The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia”.In a joint communique issued on October 11, 2020, the Five Eye nations (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada), along with Japan and India, stated, “Particular implementations of encryption technology... pose significant challenges to public safety, including to highly vulnerable members of our societies like sexually exploited children” and called upon technology companies to enable “law enforcement access to content in a readable and usable format where an authorisation is lawfully issued, is necessary and proportionate, and is subject to strong safeguards and oversight”.The specific implementation of encryption technology that has worried governments the world over is the Signal protocol (E2EE), which guarantees that even intermediaries who provide these services will not be able to decrypt these messages in transit. It also guarantees plausible deniability, where if someone receives an encrypted message from you, they can be absolutely sure you sent it (rather than having been forged by some third party), but can’t prove to anyone else that it was a message you wrote.A variation of their anxieties played out in India, in the “WhatsApp traceability debate”, where the government pushed for traceability (Tell me who the sender is), but also said that it does not want to break end-to-end encryption, an impossible request, as sender deniability is at the heart of the end-to-end encryption. When repeatedly rebuffed by WhatsApp, an attempt was made to resolve the matter through the judicial system to compel the intermediaries (WhatsApp) to stop deploying messaging systems that use E2EE.Given this background, the use of children in the statement to build a case for banning E2EE is interesting because it uses a propaganda technique called Pedophrasty, where children are invoked to prop up an argument, and make the opponents against the argument look like unprincipled savages and make everyone else suspend all rational and critical thinking, and agree to the argument.But we must not agree to this dangerous set of proposals, as they are a continuum to the encryption wars, which started in the 1970s, where Western governments tried to limit use of encryption technologies by using export controls and ultimately failed.In the 1990s, the National Security Agency in the US proposed the use of “Clipper Chip” in every phone, which implemented encryption but gave backdoor access to the US government. After Matt Blaze showed how rogue applications can use the chip to access data without the government backdoor, this attempt was abandoned.In 2010, Google published a blog post, detailing how Chinese state backed hackers, attacked Gmail to spy on Chinese human rights advocates via a backdoor, installed by Google at the behest of the US government in Gmail to comply with search warrants on users. When Ericsson put backdoors into Vodafone products and deployed these in Greece for aiding law enforcement, these backdoors were used to spy on the Greek prime minister, by unknown perpetrators, who were never found.All these incidents point out two fundamental realities. The first one is that backdoors are always dual-use and can be used by anyone and, hence, they don’t keep anyone safe. The second is that E2EE is safe and easy enough for anyone to use and hence has achieved mainstream adoption. This has made the usual approach preferred by law enforcement agencies of coercing intermediaries to put backdoors irrelevant and obsolete.Outlawing E2EE deployment and forcing intermediaries to comply with these proposed rules or leave the country by threatening to shut down their business operations, hence, may become the preferred policy response. But these rules, even if they become the law everywhere, are doomed to fail, in the same way, the discovery of irrational numbers (square root of 2) could not be suppressed by drowning its inventor Hippasus, in the sea, as it takes only a rented computer at ₹700 a month to run a back-end service implementing E2EE.If existing intermediaries are forced to abandon it, others like EncroChat (popular among drug cartels) will step in and fill the void. The busting of EncroChat, when law enforcement agencies successfully penetrated the drug cartels by putting a “tool” in its servers, also indicates that it is possible to work around E2EE in some cases, using offensive technical measures by compromising endpoints. It would also be a far more proportionate measure than attempting to ban mathematical equations.Anand Venkatanarayanan researches disinformation, cyber weapons and data security and is a privacy advocateThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-new-avatar-of-the-encryption-wars-101612444931535.html
04-02-2021||Today's||India’s long game with the Generals||There was no diplomatic soft talk in India’s response to the military coup in Myanmar. Among the first countries to react, India’s statement was crystal clear, expressing “deep concern” about the future of democracy and the rule of law.Such harsh words are not just out of moral solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi and other democrats detained. They reflect India’s long-held understanding that democracy is the only model for Myanmar to achieve political stability, internal security and sustainable development. This is why India went out of its way to support Myanmar’s democratic transition since 2011 with economic assistance and capacity-building programmes. And when National Security Adviser Ajit Doval visited Myanmar in 2015 to attend the signing of a peace deal with insurgent groups, he was also expressing India’s support for a democratic process to end the country’s many armed conflicts.It may be often tempting to describe India’s Myanmar policy as suffering from a dilemma between values and interest. There is no such confusion in practice: India’s interest in Myanmar has always been guided strategically by the centrality of democracy to ensure deeper ties. However, as former diplomat IP Khosla observed, India has also learned to accept that “the liberal democratic paradigm will not automatically come about” in Myanmar, nor in any other part of India’s politically volatile neighbourhood.So while Indian policymakers have always been clear about their democratic endgame in Myanmar, they also recognise that pragmatic adjustments are sometimes necessary to engage with the military, which remains the ultimate guarantor of internal stability and order. This is similar to 60 years ago, when the Burmese armed forces, also known as Tatmadaw, first took over power to end a decade of democratic reforms in the 1950s. The coup of March 1962 was a severe setback for India’s investment in a federal, democratic Burma under the leadership of Nehru’s great friend U Nu. However, with the democratic regime in deep crisis, it made sense to engage General Ne Win to protect Indian interests, including cross-border insurgencies, China’s influence and the safety of the larger Indian diaspora.A young Indian diplomat then posted at the embassy in Yangon, Eric Gonsalves, recalls that “we were fairly confident that the Generals were going to remain and there would be no return to the democratic set-up.” Despite his personal distress at the imprisonment of his friend and the end of Burmese democracy, Nehru gave the green light for India to become one of the first countries to recognise the military regime, even before China. Sixty years later, the situation is strikingly similar. It is likely that this week, the ministry of external affairs would have, at least internally, shared Gonsalves’ realistic assessment. For the time being, New Delhi will, therefore, say what it can and do what it must — in public, India will push for democracy but in private it will pivot to engage with Myanmar’s new military regime.This marks a return to India’s dual policy of the 2000s, when it built a relationship of high-level trust with the Myanmar military while also nudging and supporting the Generals to embrace democratic reforms. This approach was first crafted in the late 1990s by Shyam Saran, then India’s ambassador in Yangon, and executed in 2000 with a rare display of successful defence diplomacy led by Army chief VP Malik.This was no easy task. Western analysts criticised India for blindly engaging Myanmar. At the United Nations (UN), India came under attack for not supporting sanctions and condemnatory resolutions, especially during the failed 2007 democratic uprising. And in his 2010 address to the Indian Parliament, President Barack Obama openly expressed American disappointment that India had “shied away” from its democratic responsibility towards Myanmar. Despite such pressure, India stood firm and also paid a price for it. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, for example, declined two invitations and only visited Myanmar in 2012, after the democratic opening.The carefully calibrated policy of the 2000s will serve India well today, where circumstances are even more favourable. Thanks to the rise of China, the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) are now more wary of isolating Myanmar. Under the Act East and Neighbourhood First policies, India has deepened its relations with Myanmar across political, military, security, diplomatic and economic tracks. And the Tatmadaw is now also less enamoured of China and keen to deepen relations with India.But New Delhi will still have to work hard to pursue its democratic realist policy in Myanmar. Two main challenges arise. The first will be to preserve trust with the Generals even while keeping up the pressure to restore a democratic order. Delhi will have to keep the relationship going at the highest level to ensure that the Generals respect India’s core concerns. This includes the Naga peace process, keeping an eye on China’s activities, and cross-border connectivity initiatives.The second challenge will be for India to coordinate its position internationally and buy itself manoeuvring space to engage Myanmar. The US and the EU are still likely to be less understanding of India’s position than the Association of South-East Asian Nations and Japan. Especially at the UN Security Council, India could play an important role to bridge differences and develop a common platform to nudge Myanmar back on to the democratic track.Constantino Xavier is a fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-long-game-with-the-generals-101612444928293.html
04-02-2021||Today's||In Bengal, the salience of Jai Shri Ram||Jai Shri Ram has become a mudradosh (a catchphrase) for us”, said a voter, belonging to the Matua community, in Thakurnagar, West Bengal. “We started using it to tease the Trinamool, but now it has become as natural as saying good morning in English.” When asked how Jai Durga or Jai Kali — associated more deeply with Bengal — hadn’t, instead, become the rallying cry, he responded, “Ram is as familiar to us as you.”As West Bengal heads to the polls, it is at the intersection of changing cultural contours, shifting political dynamics and contested identity claims. Identity is always a two-way process. A particular mode of recognition by a group requires others to endorse it. Thus, the claim that Bengal is the intellectual-heartland of India is shared by a vast section of non-Bengalis, thereby constituting the image of the state being different. Irrespective of the changing political context in the last four decades, from the Left Front to Trinamool Congress (TMC) rule, the Bhadraloks (the cultural elite) have been fierce custodians of Bengal’s sense of exceptionalism and guarded it passionately. For instance, a quintessential Bhadralok would condemn and lament the rising assertive religiosity in other parts of the country while defending Durga Pujo in Bengal primarily as a social gathering.However, since 2018, political shifts and social changes, particularly among the subaltern sections in rural and mofussil Bengal, have raised questions about the Bhadralok sense of entitlement in representing and speaking for the state. What Bengal is witnessing is a new wave of subaltern assertion, using the instrument of Hindutva to push the narrative.The growing political and cultural salience of the Jai Shri Ram slogan in Bengal was reflected in three key moments — first, during the 2018 communal riot in Asansol on the occasion of Ramnavami; second, as chanted by people when chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s motorcade passed through Chandrakona in West Midnapore and Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas in May 2019; and, finally, on January 23, when the slogan was raised in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Banerjee during the celebration of Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary in Kolkata.The Bhadralok response to the slogan has been one of unease. It claims that the slogan has never been a part of Bengal’s religiosity and is almost alien to the land, and therefore, those invoking must be the migrants from neighbouring states. These incidents are also seen as the handiwork of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, a closer look would reveal that this argument, defending the specificity of Bengali religiosity and shifting the blame entirely to the BJP and migrants is not only untrue, but also fails to take into account the role played by the TMC. It also ignores ground realities.After having travelled through all 294 assembly constituencies in the state, four ground realities become apparent.One, the BJP, outside Kolkata, is organisationally weak and, even after a spree of defections from the incumbent, lacks strong local leadership. Two, an overwhelming majority of Hindus are polarised against the TMC, allegedly on account of rampant corruption and systemic violence by the ruling party’s rank and file in connivance with the state police. Three, it is primarily the erstwhile supporters of the Left who have been at the receiving end of the TMC’s excesses, and are now clamouring for “revenge”. And, finally, barring few pockets such as parts of Murshidabad, Malda and Dinajpur, both the Left and the Congress are not considered as credible alternative by pro-change voters. Thus, the BJP has become the default beneficiary of the existing resentment against the TMC.Even a cursory look at the intersection of these facts shows that the salience of the slogan has deeper roots. If the BJP is so weak outside Kolkata, crediting it, albeit negatively, with the ability to provoke citizens in different parts of the state to mock, challenge, and finally bear the brunt of the chief minister’s anger, by chanting Jai Shri Ram, doesn’t add up. The search for the underlying forces behind the slogan should be directed at the social realm and the role played by the TMC itself.Travels on the ground, primarily the interiors of south Bengal, reveal the everydayness of Jai Shri Ram greetings, chants and sloganeering among a vast section of Bengalis who are opposed to the TMC.For instance, respondents across castes at Chowkbazar in Balrampur assembly constituency in Purulia defended the slogan as a way of getting back at the TMC supporters — and alleged that the district president of the TMC ridiculed their sentiment by asking who is Ram. A school teacher at Bishnupur claimed Ram to be an integral part of everyday life, and argued how Ramayana is inscribed even in the world famous Baluchari silk sarees. At Habra in N orth 24 Parganas, a group of respondents expressed their anger at the government arresting some people for using the slogan. Ironically, in most of these places, then same people lamented the poor organisational profile of the BJP.The story of Jai Shri Ram goes beyond the BJP in Bengal. It has become a code of solidarity, a way of greeting, and a signal of anti-TMC consolidation. And it has become an everyday tool of political demarcation not only against the TMC but also against the patronising attitude of the old elites who privilege ideology over the everyday precarious experience of the subalterns. It signifies the fusion of the subaltern with Hindutva against the worldviews of Bhadraloks.Sajjan Kumar is a political analyst associated with Peoples PulseThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-bengal-the-salience-of-jai-shri-ram-101612363734119.html
04-02-2021||Today's||A budget for a ‘project finance economy’||This year’s budget revealed the mindset of a confident and unapologetic India. In this newspaper, on January 22, I had argued for the need for developing economies such as India to view themselves as “project finance” economies and not “working capital” economies of the developed West. While a developed economy has good infrastructure, near full employment and high per capita income so that it has the revenue base to meet its expenditures, a country with low per capita income, high disguised unemployment and poor infrastructure needs to borrow to meet its required expenditures.Project finance economies need to build the infrastructure lacking in their nations so that they can increase the productivity of their economies. Sustainable growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) cannot be achieved without plugging the gap in hard and soft infrastructure. What is important is to ensure that the borrowing is well-directed and spent on the right things. It is in this context that I applaud this year’s budget.Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman was not coy in signalling to the world her intent to spend to grow out of the pandemic. She was not cowed down by the constraining orthodoxy of neo-classical economic thinking that inhibited action in the past. The budget was bold and unafraid in a crisis year. It combined pragmatism in some areas, with a bold attack on the traditional holy cows of old and did not fall prey to ineffective symbolism and needless populist tinkering.Sitharaman broke with the constraint imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. It transparently accounted for expenditures and openly stated the true deficit this year at 9.5% and targeted a deficit of 6.8% next year. She was clear that critical spending on infrastructure, health and education could not be delayed if India was to recover its old growth path. Revenue expenditures and some subsidy allocations were reduced, but capital expenditure was sharply increased. All this was done without tinkering with direct taxes and only some minor adjustments in tariffs and indirect taxes. Policy signalled consistency and an attempt was made at reducing tax harassment by reducing the time frame within which tax cases could be taken up and tried.The outlay for hard infrastructure was increased to ₹5.54 lakh crore from ₹4.39 crore spent this year. The allocation was spread on roads, rail, urban infrastructure, ports, shipping, waterways, and airports. Another important area which continued to attract focus was water ( ₹2,87,000 crore allocation over five years) — a key requirement for the population, a basic human need which brings important side benefits in respect of health and hygiene. State power distribution companies were, at the same time, asked to get ready for competition to shake up this vital sector.The pandemic had put a focus on India’s crumbling health care system. The finance minister increased allocation for health care to ₹22,3846 crore as against ₹94,452 crore this year, a 137% increase, with ₹35,000 crore of that amount earmarked for vaccines. The signal here is very important but we all recognise this to be a multi-year journey. Perhaps some more could have been done for education and skilling, but one hopes it is recognised as a critical area for coming budgets.The measures for the financial sector were long-overdue. The finance minister announced the reversal of the policy on development finance institutions by setting aside ₹20,000 crore to establish one to supplement the needs of India’s infrastructure. She also announced the setting up of a bad bank to facilitate the resolution of bad loans and cleaning up of bank balance sheets to spur credit growth in the economy.But the announcement of privatisation, yes privatisation, of two public sector banks in addition to IDBI Bank, one general insurer, the listing of Life Insurance Company and allowing 74% foreign investment in insurance, were pathbreaking. To raise resources for these expenditures, the government wants aggressive disinvestment and asset monetisation. In addition to providing resources, these actions increase the efficiency of the sectors and signal a return to the maxim of maximum governance minimum government.My two concerns on the budget relate to implementation. First, we must ensure the divestment targets are met unlike in the past. Divestment is always political, complicated but vital. Second, the government should earmark a certain minimum spending on soft infrastructure and target outcome goals it monitors and share these with the nation in Parliament. Outcomes in health and education are as important as sharing the fiscal deficit figure. The government should focus on the level of monitoring required — a monthly FM-led review and a quarterly prime minister-led review — to ensure the programme stays on track.This budget boldly espoused a project finance economy mindset — based on spending with confidence on hard and soft infrastructure to improve the productive capacity of the country. FM Nirmala Sitharaman deserves high praise for betting on unlocking India’s full potential and setting it on a path to growth.

04-02-2021||Today's||Does the budget meet India’s defence requirements?||Until 2019, defence spending made headlines around just two events in a year. The first was when the Union budget was tabled in Parliament, and the second was when the Swedish thinktank, SIPRI, released its formidable comparative military expenditure report.That scenario changed in FY 2020-21. China’s incursions in Ladakh highlighted the urgent and long-term need to prioritise defence. It brought home the point that the central focus of military planning should be China, not Pakistan. This need for prioritisation came even as the pandemic caused a drop in both economic activity and government revenue. Given this backdrop, the government had a challenging task on its hands. There are four key takeaways from the Union Budget 2021-22 for defence.One, despite the China challenge, there seems to be no proportional increase in the priority accorded to defence spending. Although defence minister Rajnath Singh was quick to thank the Prime Minister and Finance Minister for increasing the defence budget to ₹4.78 lakh crores, the reality is less encouraging. This number represents a mere ₹7,000 crore increase over the FY 2020-21 budget number. Moreover, if we account for the revised spending estimate of FY 2020-21, defence spending is set to reduce by 1.35%.Two, the capital outlay on defence services, of which defence modernisation expenditure is a part, doesn’t seem to have factored in the urgency either. While the defence minister highlighted that capital expenditure of ₹1.35 lakh crore was an increase of 19% over the last budget, the situation is less reassuring when one looks at the fine print. The government ended up spending nearly ₹0.21 lakh crore more on capital outlay in FY 2020-21 than it had initially planned. In FY 2021-22, it merely seeks to continue spending at the same levels.This increase would still be good news if the higher spending was on account of new schemes, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The largest component of the increase in capital expenditure (nearly 40%) is on the line item “other equipment—Air Force”. It is unclear whether this is for new acquisitions or for meeting committed liabilities since budget documents do not make this distinction. This issue is crucial because the Standing Committee on Defence, in 2019, had observed that the budget allocation for modernisation covering both committed liabilities and new schemes did not meet committed liabilities itself. It is likely that the higher capital outlay is on account of payments for committed liabilities such as the payments for equipment purchased before recent events on the Ladakh border.Three, the budget allocated for defence pensions is lower by nearly ₹0.18 lakh crore compared to the FY 2020-21 budget. Pension expenditure cannot fall by 13% without a decrease in the number of retirees or a reduction in each retiree’s amount. While reducing pension expenditure over the long-term is an important goal, going back on existing commitments made to retirees would be counterproductive. It is likely that the government is trying to spread pension commitments over multiple years in light of the fiscal situation. Some reports suggest that this reduction reflects the government’s proposal to increase the retirement age of officers. However, this alone would still not explain the fall. It could also be that previous years’ payments included arrears that have been compensated for already.Four, the defence ministry’s plan for raising revenue on its own is unclear. There was no mention of the sale of assets of ordnance factories, defence public sector units, or surplus defence land. The Fifteenth Finance Commission has recommended the creation of a non-lapsable fund for modernisation, a long-standing demand of the ministry. Whether the government will put this recommendation into action starting FY 2021-22 remains to be seen. Until then, the government plans to meet existing defence requirements by borrowing from the market.The key lesson from the budget is that sudden increases in defence spending are unlikely in the post-pandemic recovery phase. Military planning for the future needs major doctrinal shifts to counter the threat posed by China and Pakistan. Hopes of a quantum jump in defence expenditure should be laid to rest.Pranay Kotasthane is a researcher on strategic public finance at The Takshashila Institution, BengaluruThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/does-the-budget-meet-india-s-defence-requirements-101612360493530.html
04-02-2021||Editorials||The power of nationalism | HT Editorial||After tweets from a set of global figures expressing solidarity with the farm protests, and a strong ministry of external affairs statement defending the farm laws and rebuking “vested interest groups”, the battle over the narrative on the farm protests escalated on social media. The hashtag wars, in essence, saw those who oppose the government and its perceived crackdown on liberty leverage global support to push a narrative of India’s democratic backsliding. On the other side, those who were sympathetic to the government’s views framed it as an issue of national sovereignty and expressed their opposition to any external view on the matter. The Twitter battle actually throws up a larger question for India’s liberal political stream and critics of the government. At a time when they — rightly or wrongly — feel that the rules of the game have become skewed in favour of the ruling regime domestically, they end up seeking or leveraging international support as a way to enhance pressure on the government. This can be viewed in two ways. For those who believe in the idea of absolute national sovereignty, the prospect that external players should be participants in a domestic issue is unacceptable. For those who believe that democracy and human rights are universal values and override sovereignty, the idea of external participants raising their voice is entirely acceptable. This is a tricky terrain. Yes, international support — even if it is from private citizens, irrespective of whether it is spontaneous or encouraged — can help in magnifying internal weaknesses. And yes, in these times of interconnectedness, despite the anarchy that exists in the international system, any State, including India, has to take into account global conventions and norms. At the same time, as the social media pushback against this external display of solidarity showed, it is easy for this to become a tool of nationalist mobilisation for the government. Once again, irrespective of whether the tweets by Indian celebrities backing the government’s narrative were orchestrated or not, it adds to the narrative that a “foreign hand” is out to weaken India — which suits the political regime just fine in consolidating its domestic base and deflecting blame. The bottomline is simple. There are limits to external engagement, and India’s internal battles will have to be fought internally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-power-of-nationalism-ht-editorial-101612446250118.html
04-02-2021||Editorials||In states, don’t curb the right to protest | HT Editorial||The Bihar government has decided that those who engage in “criminal activities” during law and order incidents, protest demonstrations and blocking of roads and have been named in chargesheets will not get government jobs, government contracts, assistance for grants and bank loans and passports. This comes soon after the state government said that “offensive” social media posts against the government, ministers, parliamentarians and legislators will be treated as a cyber crime. Separately, the Uttarakhand government has said that the process of police verification before passports are issued will take into account comments made on social media, with an eye out for “anti-national posts”.This is disturbing. It is, of course, the duty of the State to maintain order. But, the State also has a duty to abide by the democratic Constitution — a key tenet of which is the right to free speech and assembly, including the right to dissent and protest peacefully. In both cases, the states seem to be backtracking on this democratic commitment.At a time when criticism of the government is often interpreted as being “anti-national”, there is a high risk of Uttarakhand’s move being used to silence inconvenient voices and impose an arbitrary punishment on them. Bihar’s case is even more striking. This is a state with a long history of political mobilisation, and an entire generation of the state’s leadership was socialised during the Emergency. For this state to then create legal room for any protest to be criminalised, and any protester to face a series of excessive and disproportionate government actions in the form of denial of rights and services, will have the impact of curtailing the space for dissent. Both state governments must step back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-states-don-t-curb-the-right-to-protest-hteditorial-101612445947510.html
04-02-2021||Editorials||On global criticism, tread with caution | HT Editorial||The farm protests have captured global attention, with a set of political, cultural, and environmental figures — including the popular artiste, Rihanna, the fourth-most followed person on Twitter — tweeting their solidarity with the protests. This has led the ministry of external affairs (MEA) to issue a statement, blaming “vested interest groups” and pointing to the evolution of the farm laws, the need to see protests within the framework of India’s democratic structure, the efforts made to reach an agreement with farm groups, and the violence on Republic Day. This is unusual simply because the government usually ignores comments from non-State actors.There are two distinct issues here. The first is the international solidarity that the movement has been able to generate, either due to the Sikh diaspora’s network, the larger mobilisation by liberal, left, and human rights groups, or the nature of the international media’s coverage of the protests. At a time when it is not unusual for narratives to be controlled through influencer networks and IT cells — and India is no stranger to either — it is entirely possible (no matter what the probability) that at least some of these displays of solidarity have been engineered.But irrespective of the causes and the merits of the criticism (or the merits of the underlying protest), the fact is that it erodes India’s soft power and image as a democracy. The government will have to recognise the intricate ways in which domestic developments intersect with global politics, especially at a time when social media has disproportionate power in shaping perception. The most substantive and effective way in which the Indian State can respond is by strengthening its own democratic framework and reiterating its commitment to individual liberty and the right to dissent, in principle and practice. Rihanna, for instance, with over 100 million followers on Twitter is unlikely to be cowed down by a troll army, or fears of falling sales of her music in India.The second issue is the ability of this criticism — confined at the moment to private, even if influential, citizens in the West — to become a matter of inter-State deliberations. This is where the MEA’s statement comes in. It can be read as an attempt to both counter what the government sees as “propaganda” to discredit India, and an effort to pre-empt foreign governments from being guided by the social media storm. It is unlikely that foreign governments, particularly the US, will, even if they issue token statements, make it a top diplomatic issue. But what is clear is that India, because of the ideological and economic shifts underway in the country and the subsequent polarisation, will face questions.This requires ensuring that these transformations are democratically managed internally, and smarter strategic communication about the nature of these changes externally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-global-criticism-tread-with-caution-ht-editorial-101612363126065.html
04-02-2021||Editorials||The significance of Chauri Chaura, 1922||On February 4, 1921, in Chauri Chaura in the wider Gorakhpur region of the then United Provinces, the non-cooperation movement — Mahatma Gandhi’s first national agitation against British colonial rule — took a turn towards violence. A group of protesters, in the wake of tensions with local authorities which escalated into a police crackdown, burnt down the local police station. Three civilians, and 22 policemen, died. A week later, remorseful about the use of violence despite his avowed commitment to ahimsa, the Mahatma called off the non-cooperation movement, overruling many of his close associates who believed that one incident should not lead to a retreat from the wider struggle.As India approaches the centenary of the Chauri Chaura incident, there are abiding lessons it. The first is the significance of Gandhi’s principled commitment to non-violence. This was tactically astute — Gandhi bet on the moral power of peaceful protests against the coercive machinery of the colonial empire — but it went beyond that to a recognition that violence undermines just causes. At a time when India is witnessing a spate of social movements, this is a principle that protest organisers must internalise. If Gandhi could pull back against a colonial power because violence was unacceptable, surely, non-violent methods should be sacrosanct when opposing the policies of a democratically-elected government.At the same time, as subaltern historian Shahid Amin has shown in his seminal work on Chauri Chaura, the incident reflected the nationalist impulse of the local peasantry — and depicting it as criminal discounts the local roots of political discontent. But there is a way to reconcile the differing schools of thought, for all three things can be right at the same time: Chauri Chaura violence had roots in local discontent; the violence was wrong; and Gandhi displayed tremendous moral conviction in pulling back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-significance-of-chauri-chaura-1922-101612363134634.html
