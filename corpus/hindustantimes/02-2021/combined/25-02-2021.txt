The police, however, clarified that the material found was not an assembled explosive device.Police sources said that around 20 gelatin sticks were found in the vehicle, which was also clamped by the traffic police as it was parked illegally. The number plate of the car was allegedly fake, and according to police, several other number plates were found inside the vehicle.A threat letter has also been discovered, however, police have not shared the details of its content.The car was suspiciously abandoned on Carmichael Road the previous night. After the police control room was informed about it on Thursday afternoon, police rushed to the spot and were soon joined by the bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS).“Two explosive detector labrador dogs of BDDS – Oscar and Moti – detected suspicious explosives and alerted their handlers. The bomb squad personnel were then called in and scanned the articles found in the vehicle. They identified these as gelatin. The material was taken out and moved to a safe place, following standard procedures. In all, 20 gelatin sticks were found,” said a police officer.Police sources said the car’s driver had used the same registration number as a car driven by security personnel of Ambani and owned by Reliance Industries Limited.The person who parked the car at 1am on Thursday, has been captured on CCTV of a nearby Vijay general store. Police have already collected the CCTV footage and will enhance its quality to identify the suspect.“I opened my shop at 8am. In the afternoon around 2pm, when I was going to have lunch, I saw police standing and checking the vehicle. Police inquired with me about the CCTV camera I have installed outside my shop,” said Rajesh Singh, 45, the owner of the store.“Police then checked the footage and found that two vehicles were seen coming around 1am from Pedder Road and heading towards Altamount Road. One car did not stop but the driver of the other vehicle stopped and parked opposite my shop, in front of Shikhar Kunj building. After checking the footage, it was found that the driver was clearly seen sitting inside the vehicle. He did not come out at least two hours,” said Singh, adding that the police took the DVR for further investigation.“A suspicious vehicle was found on Carmichael Road today (Thursday) evening under the limits of Gamdevi police station. The police were alerted. The BDDS team and other police teams reached the spot immediately, examined the vehicle and found some explosive material (gelatin) inside. It is not an assembled explosive device. Further investigation is going on,” said Chaitanya Siriprolu, Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police.“A letter has been found inside the said vehicle. The registration number displayed on the said vehicle matches the registration number of a vehicle in Mukesh Ambani’s security detail. The said vehicle has been seized by police for investigation,” Siriprolu added.Later, state home minister Anil Deshmukh released a video statement and confirmed that a car with gelatin sticks was found near Ambani’s house.Minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai said, “[The matter] has been taken very seriously, and the police will unearth the plot and nab the people behind it. Since the investigation is underway, it would not be appropriate to speak more on it. If the need arises, there will be additional security cover given to the Ambani family.”After detection of the explosives, the Mumbai Police force, anti-terrorism squad (ATS) and other intelligence and security personnel involved in anti-terrorism operations swung into action. Senior crime branch and ATS officers visited the spot along with a team of forensic experts.Following the incident, a city-wide alert was sounded, and security was stepped up around important establishments, especially in south Mumbai. Checking was increased at entry and exit points of the city.At the time of going to press, the police were in the process of registering a case under the Explosives Act.No statement has been issued by Reliance yet.(With inputs from Surendra Gangan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/explosive-threat-letter-found-in-a-car-near-ambani-house-in-mumbai-101614277674906.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||Will take action based on probe report, says Shiv Sena on allegations against Sanjay Rathod||Amid mounting pressure to take action against Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Rathod, the party has adopted a wait-and-watch stance. Sena ministers said that allegations of flouting Covid rules are being probed and action can only be taken after the report is submitted.A day after Rathod briefly met chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray at his official residence Varsha, senior party leaders said that action against the minister is likely for flouting Covid preventive rules.Senior Sena minister Anil Parab on Thursday said the director general of police (DGP) is inquiring into the crowding at Pohradevi in Washim on Tuesday, and added that there would be no half measures in taking action against the ones found guilty.Parab said the CM has already given orders to take action wherever rules have been flouted and against anyone who has flouted them. “Today the DGP has said that inquiry is on in this matter. Based on the report, action will be taken… The inquiry is to find out who were there [at Pohradevi]. Before arriving at any conclusion, an inquiry is being made in detail. The CM has already said that action will be taken against whoever is found guilty,” he told reporters.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) has launched an attack on the Sena-led government over Rathod’s alleged involvement in the death of 22-year-old Pooja Chavan. BJP leaders questioned as to why the minister has not been booked for violating Covid norms for organising a show of strength at Pohradevi temple in Washim.BJP legislator Ashish Shelar said, “Why has the minister not been booked yet based on the pictures we saw in Pohradevi temple complex? The police failed to prevent crowding there. Who organised the programme? The minister made a speech there. The messages through social medial [platforms] were sent out on the minister’s behalf. So why is he not booked yet? The intention of the Thackeray government is clearly to support the minister. They do not care about the people who fall prey to Covid-19.”Parab, however, dismissed the opposition’s charges and added that action would be taken only after the inquiry is conducted. “Apart from looking at what the Opposition is saying, we have to see how the law works. We believe in following the process. Once the process of inquiry is over, only then action can be initiated. There will be no half measures in taking any action nor will there be any wrongful action,” Parab said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-take-action-based-on-probe-report-says-shiv-sena-on-allegations-against-sanjay-rathod-101614277495878.html

Earlier, the MMRDA had stated that the trial runs will begin in January 2021 and commercial operations will begin in May 2021.Officials said that dynamic testing is a procedure undertaken before actual testing begins. “The functionality of various systems will now be tested, which will take a month, after which connectivity to the main route and trial runs will begin. We expect the next train set also to arrive in March,” an official from MMRDA said.The earliest deadline for the two corridors was December 2019. However, it has been delays owing to various issues, followed by the pandemic that slowed down major infrastructure projects in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmrda-to-begin-pre-trials-for-mumbai-s-metro-trains-101614276774493.html

The move will come into effect from March 1."Our economic condition is not very good and the previous government left a huge financial burden. We could not give allowances due to financial constraints despite the new pay scale being implemented on October 1 in 2018. During the Covid-19 pandemic, only West Bengal in the entire country gave allowances to the employees," Nath told the media.The estimated expenditure for providing allowances is ₹320 crores.The state has 110,517 regular employees and 67,809 pensioners besides 12,000 fixed pay employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-3-years-in-power-tripura-govt-to-give-first-allowances-to-employees-101614275956602.html

Singh also asked Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran(HSVP) to work out modalities so that sites meant for public amenities, such as health centres, community buildings, etc, can be developed by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). He also asked the agencies to identify vacant plots and prepare project plans so that those too can be developed. Officials from HSVP, MCG, Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Limited (HSIIDC) and district administration were present in the meeting, which was held at the PWD guest house in Civil Lines. During the meeting, Singh emphasised increasing the pace of development works, which had got stuck due to lockdown and expedite projects such as the auto market, transport market, markets in HSVP sectors, parking projects, apart from utilising land and plots owned by civic agencies across the city. “There are a number of plots in various sectors that are earmarked for basic facilities but due to a number of reasons these have not been developed. I have asked the civic agencies to work out the modalities so that they can work together and develop these plots,” said Singh. Singh also asked the agencies to conduct a survey for setting up old age homes as there is a paucity of such facilities despite the rising population of the city. He also directed that a plan should be made to improve the condition of sector markets, community centres and arrangements for proper parking facilities. “There are multiple civic agencies working in the city and the meeting was held today to ensure that everyone is working in alignment,” said Singh. He also called for creating better health care facilities for city residents and asked MCG officials to work in tandem with the health department. It was also decided in the meeting that boundary walls would be constructed on all plots owned by HSVP and trees would be planted on the land to increase greenery. During the meeting, Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP stated that the process to set up a transport market and auto market has already been initiated by the authority. He also said that work on developing a market in Sector 45 and improvement works in other sector markets is also going on. Vinay Pratap Singh, MCG Commissioner, said that work on multi-level parking in the city has already commenced and other works related to improving conditions of sector markets are also going on.

The office of the company, Minsara Gold Private Limited, located on the ground floor of Rapid Metro Station In DLF Phase-1 deals in exchange of old gold and pays money online. The office does not deal in cash, said the police. Raju Thomas, manager of the company who handles the office, said that he and an office boy were present in the office when three masked men, including one wearing helmet, entered the premises around 3.15pm and took them at gunpoint and asked to hand over gold and cash. “There was no gold in the office and I told him that we did not deal in cash. They thrashed me and took us to the other room and snatched cash of ₹29,000 and our mobile phones,” he said. The trio told them not to raise alarm and threatened them for life. Fearing for their lives, they remained silent and came out of the room after a few minutes. Thomas said there was no CCTV camera installed in the office and they were not sure if they had used any motorbike or car to reach the spot. “They were aggressive and kept on asking us to put all the gold and money in their bag. All the while, they kept abusing us and threatened to kill us,” he said adding that they couldn’t even shout for help. After the suspects have left the premises, the employees came out and looked for them. Later, they informed the police control room, following which a team of DLF Phase 1 police reached the spot and recorded their statement, said the police. Autorickshaw drivers and neighbours said they didn’t come to know about the incident immediately. “We were busy. We did see three masked men leaving, but at that time, we thought someone might have come to sell gold. We came to know about the incident when the police reached the spot,” said Amit Yadav, one of the drivers. Ajay Kumar, station house officer (SHO), DLF Phase 1, said “We have registered a case under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code. We are scanning the CCTV footage to trace the suspects. We have recovered several footage from nearby area but we are yet to identify the motorbike registration number,” he said. The shopkeepers said they were in panic after the incident and said that their safety is at risk in the city as criminals with weapons are freely targeting people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-men-rob-29k-cash-from-a-gold-exchange-office-in-dlf-phase1-101614275816166.html
25-02-2021||Gurugram||Kant Enclave ruling: Proposal to restore 425 acres of Aravalli forest in Faridabad gathers dust||A proposal to rehabilitate nearly 425 acres of the Aravalli forest land in Faridabad, tabled by the forest department a year ago, has been gathering dust despite Supreme Court directions calling for the restoration of the area.Forest department officials confirmed that the proposal, which was drawn up in line with the apex court’s Kant Enclave ruling of 2018, has been awaiting the state government’s approval for over a year, despite funds for the same being available.Officials also said that there has been no correspondence between the forest department and the Haryana government on the matter since February 2020, when the proposal was first sent for approval. They attributed the lack of correspondence to the Covid-19 induced lockdown and a subsequent administrative reshuffle within the forest department.“We have not started any plantation work in Kant Enclave because the restoration plans are yet to be approved. The matter has been pending for a year now. There has been no communication to us from the head office, or the state government, about the same since the proposal was sent,” said Raj Kumar, district forest officer, Faridabad.Senior officials at the state level, including Haryana’s principal chief conservator of forests, said they will take up the matter on priority to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court’s judgement.When asked whether there are any immediate plans to proceed with reforestation in Kant Enclave, Tajinder P Singh,‎ secretary to the government and chief conservator of forests, Haryana, responded that he is not aware of such a proposal. “It is probably with the head office. I am not aware of it in the secretariat,” Singh said, suggesting that inquiries instead be directed to the principal chief conservator of forests, Haryana.VS Tanwar, the principal chief conservator of forests, Haryana, said, “I was not aware of this proposal since it was submitted before I took charge. During my tenure, there has not been any communication with the state government on the matter, but I will send across a reminder so that the work can be taken up in compliance with the Supreme Court’s judgement.”In September 2018, the Supreme Court had ordered the demolition of structures in the erstwhile Kant Enclave colony, developed near Anangpur village in Faridabad’s Surajkund area, ruling that it had been built on Aravalli forest land in illegal collusion with officials of the then Haryana government. In its judgement, the court had also observed, “The damage caused to the Aravalli hills, as already noted, is irreversible. However, perhaps some of the damage could be remedied - at least we hope so.”On the court’s directions, R Kant & Co — the developer found to be in violation of forest law — had already deposited a sum of ₹5 crore with the Aravalli Rehabilitation Fund “for rehabilitation of the damaged areas.”Accordingly, in December 2019, the forest department drew up a plan to reforest Kant Enclave’s 425 acres over a period of five years, using only native species of trees and shrubs. This land, as previously reported by HT, is accorded legal “forest” status by virtue of a notification under special sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (1900).“The plantation work was to be done on a budget of ₹5 crore. The developer had already deposited the penalty amount in the ARF sometime in 2018. We made the restoration plan in December 2019 and it was sent for approval sometime in February 2020,” said Suresh Punia, former district forest officer of Faridabad.At least 33 illegal structures in Kant Enclave were demolished in October 2019, more than a year after the apex court’s ruling. An HT team visit to the site on Thursday found that the area is overrun with the fresh growth of Prosopis Juliflora (colloquially known as vilayati kikkar), leading to significant densification of the green cover.HT also observed multiple packs of stray dogs on the premises, as well as several peafowls and a jackal, which are protected under the Wildlife Act.While rubble from the demolitions of privately owned structures is still lying at over a dozen sites scattered throughout the complex, other constructions, including at least two overhead water tanks, pavements, power lines and roads, are yet to be removed. Forest department officials said they plan to use these utilities to facilitate restoration work, when it eventually begins.It was also noted that the area is frequented by locals from Anangpur village, which abuts the rear boundary of Kant Enclave. Three young men, who did not reveal their names, said they often come to the area to race motorcycles, while another local from Anangpur said he prefers to do his morning jogs and exercises over there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/kant-enclave-ruling-proposal-to-restore-425-acres-of-aravalli-forest-in-faridabad-gathers-dust-101614275757705.html
25-02-2021||Gurugram||Haryana yet to submit plan to conserve Najafgarh Jheel, matter with state technical committee||The Haryana government, even two months after the deadline, is yet to submit an environment management plan to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for the protection of Najafgarh Jheel, as sought by the green court last September.However, officials from the state environment department said that technical committees have been formed to look into the matter and study the reports concerned.On September 17, 2020, the NGT, hearing a petition filed by the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH) for protection of the water body, had said, “In view of the fact that there is a large transboundary water body which partly falls in Delhi and partly in Haryana, it will be appropriate that an environment management plan is prepared jointly by the State of Haryana and NCT of Delhi. The MoEF&CC may steer the proceedings for preparation of environment management plan with the assistance of the Central Pollution Control Board. Central Pollution Control Board may coordinate as a nodal agency. Such plan may be prepared within three months.”The petitioners in the case are of the view that protection of the water body is important to maintain groundwater level in Gurugram district.Akash Vashishtha, the advocate for the petitioner, said, “It is well known that the water situation in Gurugram is grave with heavy reliance on a water table which is almost exhausted. The petitioners, INTACH, has estimated that if the water body is protected, then a regular and sustainable groundwater withdrawal is possible to support a population of half a million, based on rainwater harvesting as well as recycled water. The Delhi government has already submitted an environment management plan to the union ministry, but the Haryana government is delaying.”Vashishtha further said that the Haryana government, in February 2017, had submitted to the NGT acknowledging the presence of a Jheel (lake) and that the government would notify and protect it.Manu Bhatnagar, principal director of Natural Heritage Division of INTACH, said, “Apart from being an ecologically sensitive site for birds, Najafgarh Jheel is crucial for (solving) water woes of Gurugram region if it is protected properly. This waterbody is equivalent to 5,000 ponds area wise, which can act as a huge aquifer to recharge groundwater. Along with this, the lake being situated on seismic zone IV and highest zone of soil liquefaction, it is a hazard zone if buildings are constructed there. Destroying the Jheel will greatly worsen the flooding of Gurugram.”Meanwhile, the member secretary of the State Wetland Authority of Haryana on January 22 wrote a letter to the additional advocate general of Haryana regarding the matter, a copy of which was accessed by HT. The petitioners confirmed that this letter was submitted by the state government to NGT in the last hearing on January 27.The letter mentions that the divisional commissioner of Gurugram submitted a report to the State Wetland Authority considering issues related to the Najafgarh water body, which was placed before the authority on October 19, 2020, at its second meeting held under the chairmanship of the chief minister.The State Wetland Authority has decided that, “The revenue department shall examine temporary discontinuation of registry of sale deed of land falling below contour level 211 and only agricultural and allied activities be permitted in the said contour level till the final notification of the Wetland or till further orders. Change of land use shall not be further permitted in the area by the Town & Country Planning Department till further orders.”The letter further mentioned that based on the decisions taken in the second meeting of the State Wetland Authority, “reminders were issued to the quarters concerned on January 6, 2021, for taking action on the relevant points, but till date, no action take reports from any quarter concerned has been received in this office.”RK Chauhan, the joint director of state environment, said, “Before forming the environment management plan, we have to first identify or designate the area which falls under the ambit of the lake. The state government has formed technical committees for studying this matter. The State Wetland Authority is also regularly monitoring this issue, with two meetings already conducted. At present, we are following all rules of the union environment ministry and will soon be able to submit the environment management plan to NGT.”Yash Garg, who recently took charge as the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said, “A committee under the previous divisional commissioner was formed earlier and it had sent its recommendations to the state government. The environment department of the government is assessing the report and will submit a plan accordingly.”According to an RTI reply given by the irrigation and water resources department of Haryana, the Najafgarh Jheel, located near Kherki Majra village, is spread across 120.80 hectares. Depending on the mean sea level, the size of the water body differs; with 120 hectares at 209 metres, 300 hectares at 210 metres and 450 hectares at 211 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-yet-to-submit-plan-to-conserve-najafgarh-jheel-matter-with-state-technical-committee-101614275756692.html
25-02-2021||Gurugram||Developer of Malibu Towne booked for violating fire safety norms||The police have booked the developer of Malibu Towne — a residential township on Sohna Road — for alleged violations of fire safety norms on the premises of Maple Club based on the complaint of the city’s fire department, which found several shortcomings in the club’s fire fighting system. Earlier, on February 17, the fire department sealed the Maple Club after inspections were carried out. A case was registered at Sadar Police station on Monday under sections 336 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 30, 31 and 32 of the Haryana Fire Service Act of 2009, said the police. Fire department officials said that they had conducted multiple inspections of the club after a complaint was lodged by a colony resident, named Raman Sharma. An inspection was conducted on January 7 and a notice was issued to the developer to get a fire-fighting system installed, failing which the fire safety NOC (no-objection certificate) would be cancelled, said the police. “On February 12, another inspection was conducted and we found that no corrective measures have been taken. The smoke detectors were missing on the premises and the developer has not taken an NOC for the basement. Also, the occupancy certificate for the basement has not been acquired. Only a few fire extinguishers were present, most of which were non-functional. The Maple Club is an assembly building and such violations can put the lives of residents in danger,” said Isham Singh Kashyap, assistant divisional fire officer, adding that they sealed the club on February 17 and recommended that a case be registered by the police. Kashyap also said that notices were given to the developer to take corrective action, but nothing was done, which forced them to recommend that a criminal case be registered against the developer. Raman Sharma, who had lodged complaint against the developer in this matter, said that the developer has carried out several violations, which would come out during the police probe. “All the violations would be revealed and those responsible for these violations would be exposed,” said Sharma. Subash Raghav, vice president, Malibu Estate Private Limited, the developer of Malibu Towne, however, maintained that they did not violate any fire safety norms. The deficiencies that were flagged by the fire department were corrected. “We have installed fire-fighting equipment, taken corrective measures and also closed the basement for which occupancy certificate was not obtained as directed by the department of town and country planning. We have a partial occupancy certificate for the club that we were using,” said Raghav. Subash Boken, spokesperson, Gurugram Police, said that a case has been registered on the complaint of fire department. “The matter is under investigation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/developer-of-malibu-towne-booked-for-violating-fire-safety-norms-101614275756086.html
25-02-2021||Gurugram||First pedestrian refuge island constructed at Sector 44 intersection||The city’s first pedestrian refuge island has been constructed at the Sector 44 intersection near Huda City Centre (HCC) by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), Raahgiri Foundation and World Resources Institute (WRI). A pedestrian refuge island is a wide and elevated median that allows pedestrians and cyclists to safely wait on the structures and continue to navigate intersections according to the signal changes.The Sector 44 intersection witnesses a consistently high volume of traffic throughout the day, as it leads to major road network and junctions of Subhash Chowk, Sohna Road, Golf Course Road through Kanhai Chowk, Signature Towers and Iffco Chowk through the Huda City Centre and the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway via the Sector 30/31 crossing. Prior to the redesign, there were no pedestrian-friendly amenities at the intersection despite a high volume of cyclists using the intersection.The islands at Sector 44, set up on all three sides of the intersection, are also unconventional, said experts. Usually, a pedestrian refuge island is 2.5 metres wide. However, to account for the cycle track running through the intersection, it has been widened to four metres for the ease of cyclists and for ensuring that they rejoin the track seamlessly.In October last year, the city’s first cycle track was constructed along the Netaji Subhash Marg, between HCC and Subhash Chowk.“Across the city, refuge islands have been used for placing utilities or landscaping purposes. Its role, however, is entirely different as it is meant to ensure that pedestrians and cyclists have a safe place to wait rather than being stuck on a conventional median against fast speed traffic and wait for the signal to turn red,” said Priyanka Sulkhlan, manager, cities and transport, WRI India.Sulkhlan said that the wider crossings, with the extra 1.5-metre width, have been provided to ensure that the high volume of cyclists on this intersection also have adequate space to both cross and wait safely alongside pedestrians.Sarika Panda Bhatt, Raahgiri Foundation’s co-founder, said that the redesign will not just be a one-off experiment in Gurugram. “The redesign of the Sector 44 intersection is a pilot project to showcase and acquaint the city with the concept of refuge islands. The GMDA has now decided to implement this concept at all intersections, which they will be redesigning or constructing afresh. Different models of refuge islands are being analysed according to the need of each intersection or junction,” said Bhatt.Bhatt also highlighted that the redesign not only ensures the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, but also addresses traffic management issues. “As there are no safe places to wait, often cyclists and pedestrians try to cross a carriageway against moving traffic and inadvertently, cause congestion. A refuge island will address this issue and reduce snarls as well, along with its safety feature,” said Bhatt.The Sector 44 intersection was one of the four intersections across the city shortlisted by the GMDA for a redesign, as part of Road Safety Month. The other intersections to be selected are at Bristol Chowk, Kanhai Chowk, and Ambedkar Chowk. The GMDA’s office is located adjacent to the Sector 44 intersection.Jitender Mittal, chief engineer, GMDA, said, “We will be adding pelican crossing lights at the Sector 44 intersection as well. It will be an added safety feature to the redesign. These will be synced with all the traffic signals. When all the traffic signals at the intersection are red than the pelican crossing lights will turn green. This will provide an added safety layer to cyclists and pedestrians.” Mittal also said that GMDA will make the pedestrian refuge island a standard feature across all junctions and intersections in the city. “At the beginning, we will be prioritising the installation of pedestrian refuge islands at all those stretches where GMDA is building cycle tracks as well as where new intersections or junctions are being created. Subsequently, the rest of the city will be covered,” said Mittal.He further said that the next pedestrian refuge island will be constructed at the Sector 70/75 crossing, where a new intersection is being engineered by the GMDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/first-pedestrian-refuge-island-constructed-at-sector-44-intersection-101614275755415.html

25-02-2021||Gurugram||City hospitals to administer vaccine to public from March 1||Over 360 private hospitals and 170 government hospitals empanelled under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) in Haryana will administer Covid-19 vaccine doses to people above the age of 60 or people above 45 who have co-morbidities from March 1, said officials. As many as 27 hospitals, including 7 empanelled government hospitals and 20 private hospitals, are located in the city, as per the data available on the state health department’s website.“A two-day training of hospitals empanelled under Ayushman Bharat will begin in the state. The staff to be deployed by private hospitals as vaccinators and different vaccination officers, who will be involved in verification of beneficiaries to their inoculation and observation, will be trained by the district-level health staff,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, state health department on Thursday. For the roll-out of vaccines to the public, the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Thursday held a meeting with states, advising them to expand sessions to public healthcare facilities and PMJAY empanelled hospitals. “So far, the Central government has not conveyed any directions related to the distribution and delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine as well as their cost in private set-ups,” said Arora. According to the Covid-19 vaccine guidelines, every vaccination site is mandated to have four vaccination officers — Vaccination Officer 1 to check registration, Vaccination Officer 2 to verify ID proof, and Vaccination officers 3 and 4 to monitor the recipients of the jabs for 30 minutes for any side effects. Ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive The turnout for the Covid-19 vaccination picked up on Thursday, with 3,823 healthcare workers turning up for the second dose inoculation, exceeding the target of 3,200 set by the health department for the day. The inoculation of front-line workers, however, remained slow with only 45.8% of the 1,650 taking the vaccine jab, even as the union ministry of health and family welfare on Thursday, in a review meeting with the states, directed them to focus on improving the pace of vaccination. “Front-line workers have to be motivated further as many of them are still unwilling. They want to wait and confirm that the vaccine is safe or are concerned about adverse reactions,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. “In the case of healthcare workers, there is no longer any reluctance. They responded well to the drive on Thursday after they were communicated that they couldn’t wait for a long time after 28 days of the first dose,” he said. From this week, the health department has started administering vaccines only thrice — on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday – with a target of covering almost 5,000 people every day. Private hospitals were also directed to ensure timely inoculation of the second dose. Elaborating of their efforts to raise the turnout of front-line workers, Yadav said that he has reached out to officials of the police department, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), revenue department and panchayati raj institutions, asking the heads to motivate their employees to take the vaccine jabs on designated days. As per the data available with the district health department, 24,739 health workers out of nearly 28,000 registered as vaccine beneficiaries have taken the first shot of the vaccine. Among them, at least 12,761 have taken the second shot too. As per the data, 15,046 of over 18,000 registered front-line workers registered on the Co-WIN portal have received the first dose of the vaccine shot.Officials said that increasing the vaccination coverage is crucial to ensure the immunity of enough people to ensure that the virus cannot spread. In Gurugram, 269 cases are currently active, with 36 new cases of infection reported on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/city-hospitals-to-administer-vaccine-to-public-from-march-1-101614275754253.html
25-02-2021||Gurugram||18 landowners booked for developing illegal colony in Farrukhnagar||The police on Wednesday registered two cases against 18 landowners for allegedly developing an illegal colony in Farrukhnagar after a complaint was filed by the officials of the enforcement wing of the department of town and country planning (DTCP). RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that the land on which the colony was being developed falls within the controlled urban area. This means that on any land that falls within the limits of a municipal area or notified area, no construction can be carried out without the necessary permission. Also, subdividing the land is prohibited without approval. The landowners are accused of carving out an illegal colony in Farrukhnagar by sub-division of agricultural land and constructing an unauthorised road network in violation of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Area Act, 1975. “The land on which illegal colony was being developed falls within urban area limit of Farrukhnagar and it is under the ambit of Farrukhnagar Municipal Committee,” said Batth. Bhath added that despite notice from the department, the landowners were deliberately continuing with the development of the colony in contravention of the law. Violation of these laws is punishable with jail up to three years and penalty. The department has requested the police to keep an eye on any unauthorised development carried out across the city. Bhath said they have been taking action against illegal colonies and multiple demolition drives have been carried out in the last few months. “We had demolished many such structures and recommended the registration of FIRs against land owners,” he said, adding that they are conducting demolition drives on a regular basis to tackle the mushrooming of illegal colonies across the city. In order to make a quick buck, several landowners in Manesar, Bhondsi, Sohna, Farrukhnagar and Pataudi had set up unauthorised colonies in more than 50 villages without seeking mandatory permissions from the government agencies. According to norms, the tehsil office cannot carry out registration of any property without procuring a no-objection certificate from the DTCP office, said the police. Two cases were registered under sections 7A and 10 of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 against the land owners. “Following the complaint of DTCP, FIRs were registered against landowners and we are investigating the case,” said KK Rao, commissioner of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/18-landowners-booked-for-developing-illegal-colony-in-farrukhnagar-101614275753601.html

The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has banned all gatherings of more than 50 people given a fresh surge in coronavirus cases in Vidarbha. Rathod had visited the Pohradevi temple on Tuesday amid tight security, during which, many of his supporters thronged his vehicle creating a commotion.The chief temple priest was present during the minister’s visit and around 25,000 of his supporters from different districts including Yavatmal, Jalna, Amravati, Washim and Nanded gathered there to boost the morale of the minister, who was on the defensive after the opposition attacked him and demanded his arrest and removal from the Thackeray cabinet, linking him in the death of a 22-year-old woman. A large majority of those present flouted social distancing norms and did not wear masks. The Washim district collector, Shanmugarajan S informed that the temple priest and his family members had undergone a Covid-19 test two days ago. The test later established that he and his five members were infected with the virus. “We have set up testing camps near the temple to detect coronavirus infection among the temple staff and nearby villagers, particularly those who had attended the temple on Tuesday when the minister visited there,” the collector said. After the minister’s visit, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray took a serious note of the Poharadevi temple gathering and directed the district and police administration to immediately take action against those who flouted Covid-19 norms. The district administration had registered offences against around 10 people, but no offence was registered against Rathod. “We are trying to identify others in this connection and will certainly book them,” the collector Shanmugarajan said. Meanwhile, as many as 229 students at a residential school at Degaon, near Washim, have tested positive for Covid-19, district health officer Avinash Aher said. Four teaching and non-teaching staffers have also been found to be infected, he added. “Necessary treatment is being given to the patients. Two doctors and other health workers have been deputed to treat the students,” said Aher and added that almost all the students are asymptomatic. District collector Shanmugarajan also visited the school and instructed the district health department to provide care to the students and school staff. “Assistant collector Vaibhah Waghmare has been appointed as the nodal officer to coordinate the healthcare,” he said. Ruling Shiv Sena lawmaker Bhavna Gawli, who represents the Yavatmal-Washim Lok Sabha constituency, runs the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/washim-pohradevi-priest-229-students-test-positive-for-covid19-101614275514262.html

The resolution appears to indicate that they will face the Assembly elections in April-May alone.It was one of the 14 resolutions passed by the fledgeling party which was floated by Dhinakaran in 2018 with a breakaway faction of Sasikala’s supporters after the duo was expelled from the AIADMK in 2017.The AMMK also resolved to reclaim the AIADMK from ‘the wrong hands’ which is currently in the dual leadership of chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his deputy O Paneerselvam.Also read: Pakistan stays in FATF ‘grey list’, given June deadline to implement action planSasikala, late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide, returned to Chennai earlier this month after serving a four-year jail term in the disproportionate assets case in Bengaluru. She briefly held the reins of the AIADMK before her conviction and on her return has called for the ‘loyal cadre of Jayalalithaa’ to be united to fight their common enemy the DMK.Sasikala has positioned herself as Jayalalithaa’s true heir and continues to identify herself as the AIADMK's general secretary and uses the party flag. The AMMK wants Sasikala to take back her post in the AIADMK and merge the factions. The AIADMK, however, has stonewalled Sasikala and her family and has categorically rejected taking her back and the idea of a merger with the AMMK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-sasikala-s-blessing-ammk-vows-to-make-dhinakaran-tamil-nadu-cm-101614275232690.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai college to start certificate course in hip-hop from March||Almost 14 months after the course was approved by the University of Mumbai (MU), a suburban college is all set to start the first batch in Introduction to Hip-Hop Studies. Vile Parle’s Usha Pravin Gandhi College (UPG College) will be starting the first batch in March this year and registrations for the same have already begun.Yatindra Ingle, a professor with the college said, “While hip-hop has been practised as a performing art, now having it into academics will add in the in-depth knowledge of the subject, for those who wish to study it as a culture. It’s important not only to art but also history and even contemporary life.” Ingle has helped design the curriculum and will now be coordinating the course at UPG College. “Due to its cultural relevance and its tendency to promote through its connection with students—an increased social and cultural awareness can be created in an academic setting through this course.”The 60-hour certificate course, originally meant to be launched in the year 2018, was under review by an expert committee and the final approval came through only in 2019, making it the first course of its kind to be offered by a university in the country.The approval process for the course faced some hiccups, and a committee had to be set up to make sure that a subject like hip-hop could be taught. The final approval came through in June 2019.Ingle, who himself has been rapping for more than a decade and also emcees rap battles in and around the city, said the course will teach hip-hop as a medium of communication and take students back to the roots when African Americans and other oppressed groups in the US used hip-hop to make their voices heard. “The course will take students back to the days when hip-hop first was introduced on the streets of the US as a platform to speak out against oppression, violence, identity, culture as well as power,” added Ingle.Sanjay Ranade, associate professor, department of communication and journalism, MU, was also part of the formulation of this course along with Ingle and will now be part of the course at UPG College. “My focus will be on lyrical development in the Indian hip-hop scenario, especially in Indian languages. I feel this will be unique to India,” he said.The 60-hour certificate program will take students from a basic introduction to the art form to the politics attached to it, women in hip-hop and the art form that goes beyond borders and the economic status of the performer. Along with weekend classes where students will be introduced to the concept with the help of experts from the industry, students will also be part of practical sessions and will then go through a written exam to pass the course. “The course will take students on a virtual global trip to understand the concept,” added Ingle.Not only will this course bring together artists from India, but the institute is also trying to rope in international hip-hop artists. Ambarin Kadri aka Am-B, a Hip-hop artist and faculty of this program said, “Hip-hop in academics would work as a good bridge between the real HipHop community and the younger generation that’s interested in learning in-depth about hip-hop from scratch. We as hip-hop artists get the opportunity to impart the right knowledge and pass on our life-changing experiences first hand with the younger generation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-college-to-start-certificate-course-in-hip-hop-from-march-101614275394725.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||45.3% Mumbai university students passed after re-evaluation in 2018: RTI data||Almost 45.3% students, who applied for re-evaluation at the University of Mumbai (MU), passed after getting their results re-evaluated in 2018, shows data received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. This means that almost three in five students passed the exams after re-evaluation. Vihar Durve, a city based RTI activist said that these students had been erroneously marked fail in their exams. Data from the board of examinations and evaluation shows that 87,567 students applied for re-evaluation in the first and second half of 2018. Of these, 39,652 students passed the exams after re-evaluation. “Almost 45.3% of the students, who had been marked ‘fail’, were able to pass. This means they had been wrongly failed in the exams by teachers. This has been a recurring trend and no action has been taken by the university so far,” said Durve. In the first half of 2019, a total of 43,630 students applied for re-evaluation, of which 11,626 passed after getting their paper re-evaluated, finds the RTI. An earlier RTI query had revealed that more than two lakh students had applied for re-evaluation of papers between April 2014 and August 2016. Almost 73,000 students found out that they passed after re-evaluation. This means almost 30% students passed a paper after being marked “fail” in their papers. “Students passing the exam after re-evaluation does not necessarily mean than they were erroneously failed in the exam. Re-evaluation is a natural justice option available to students where the paper is looked at with a fresh perspective,” said a spokesperson for the board of examination.Applications for revaluation and photocopy remain a large source of income for the university which charges ₹500 for every revaluation application and an additional ₹100 for a photocopy of answer sheets. Yet another of Durve’s RTIs found that the university raked in ₹5 crore in 2016-17, ₹3.62 crore in 2017-18 and ₹2.46 crore in 2018-19 from re-evaluation alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/453-mumbai-university-students-passed-after-re-evaluation-in-2018-rti-data-101614275094796.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body gears up to vaccinate senior citizens, comorbid citizens above age 45||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is gearing up to start the Covid-19 vaccination drive for senior citizens, and citizens above age 45 years who have co-morbidity, by conducting training sessions for hospital staff. The Central government had announced on Wednesday that the third phase of the vaccination drive will begin country-wide from March 1.In a meeting on Thursday, BMC decided to contact the hospitals in the city, empanelled under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana and Central government insurance scheme, which qualify for administering the vaccine to citizens. Training sessions for the hospital staff who will administer the vaccines will take place, along with logistically readying their premises for the vaccine drive.Approximately 3,000,000 Mumbaiites will qualify as beneficiaries for the third phase of the vaccination drive, according to data collected by the civic body during its My Family, My Responsibility campaign. However, BMC is still awaiting instructions from the government on how the registration of these beneficiaries will take place, and what documents will be required.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department said, “We are awaiting guidelines from the Central government regarding this phase of the vaccination drive. The training module for staff who will administer the vaccine is yet to be activated by the government because it is Co-WIN app-based training. We are also awaiting clarity on whether we will register beneficiaries on the Co-WIN app, or they will register themselves.”Once the registration process is complete, BMC will have clarity regarding the number of beneficiaries who qualify for vaccination. Kakani said, “It may prove challenging. Due to the lifestyle in a city like Mumbai, almost everyone has co-morbidity. Everyone has blood pressure or hypertension. What documents beneficiaries above age 45 years will have to submit to prove they are co-morbid, remains to be examined.”BMC is examining if a simple doctor’s certificate will suffice for those with co-morbidities, or patients will have to submit their medical history. A senior civic official said, “We may run into another challenge if we say a simple doctor’s certificate regarding co-morbidity can qualify a beneficiary to get vaccinated. I may have high blood pressure today and may not record it tomorrow. Those who are in the highest risk groups should be prioritised.”Whether Mumbai will be able to start phase three of the drive, by March 1, as scheduled by the state government will depend on the amount of time it will take for beneficiaries to get registered. The actual drive may take two or three days more to kickstart, authorities said. A senior civic official said, “It may be logistically difficult for a person to walk in for a vaccine shot, the same day he or she gets registered. We also have to decide the charges for vaccination, in the case of private hospitals.”More meetings of the BMC’s public health department will take place on Friday and Saturday to chalk out all details of the drive.Presently, BMC is vaccinating healthcare workers from the first phase that began on January 16, and frontline workers from the second phase that began on February 4, across 36 vaccination centres in the city. Until Wednesday, BMC has vaccinated a total of 186,158 beneficiaries, of which 83,241 are frontline workers. 13,754 healthcare workers have also received the second shot of their vaccine, administered 28 days after the first shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-gears-up-to-vaccinate-senior-citizens-comorbid-citizens-above-age-45-101614274974444.html

On Thursday, the city recorded 1,145 new cases and five deaths, taking the case tally to 322,844 and the death toll to 11,463. According to state health department data, active cases in the city has increased by around 64% in the last two weeks.On February 11, Mumbai had reported 4,197 active cases and the same has gone up to 6,900 active cases, as of February 24, in the period of nearly two weeks. The city has been reporting over 500 cases since the past 10 days, compared to the range of 300 to 500 cases being reported daily two weeks ago.As of Thursday, 302,930 patients have been recovered, taking the recovery rate to 93.82%. The mortality rate in Mumbai is 3.55%. The number of active cases jumped to 7,583 on Thursday.Similarly, on Wednesday, Mumbai reported 1,167 cases in a single day. The 1,000 mark was crossed by Mumbai for the first time after November 28, 2020. In terms of active cases going up, the biggest spike is observed in areas like Bandra, Khar, Santacruz, Andheri, Ghatkopar, Mulund etc. However, the highest number of active cases are currently in areas including Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Jogeshwari, Andheri and Mulund, according to BMC’s data.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, earlier this week said, “We are hoping for the best and are reactivating beds at quarantine facilities incase the cases go up further. At the same time, citizens need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and not lower their guard.”The BMC has attributed several factors to be behind the increase in the number of cases. BMC said restarting of local trains for all, increased gathering at marriages and other social events, followed by non-compliance of Covid-19 norms by citizens, restaurants and night clubs owners. Earlier this week, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a review meeting, directed BMC to prepare for the September peak, and increase testing, tracing and quarantining.Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician said, “Considering the situation in Mumbai since the last ten days, I feel that complete lockdown is not the solution, but the government can think of several restrictions. This may include focusing on tweaking timings for nightclubs, bars etc. However, for now, the government should wait and watch for the next five to six days to go ahead with further restrictions keeping in mind the economic factor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-1-145-cases-active-cases-increase-by-64-in-2-weeks-101614274795204.html

So it creates an atmosphere to take on this fascist force (of) BJP. He is the best person who can take them on. That is fundamentally what we are bringing to the table.” Another senior Congress leader also added that Gandhi’s visits would work to their advantage.The DMK-led alliance swept the 2019 parliamentary elections winning 38 of the 39 seats in Tamil Nadu. The DMK had won all 20 seats it fought for and Congress eight out of nine. However, the combine has been out of power since 2011. In the assembly elections in 2011, Congress contested 63 seats and won five in the wake of the 2G spectrum scam. Their vote share was 9.3 per cent that year which further dwindled to 6.4 per cent in 2016.Congress held meetings with its state leaders on Wednesday night and again after the seat-sharing talks on Thursday. From the party’s end, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi would take the final call. Meanwhile, the three DMK leaders apprised their party president MK Stalin about their discussion. Both sides said that their talks were amicable and will go for a few more rounds.“We spoke regarding our alliance with politeness and happiness. We exchanged our opinions. We will speak with our respective parties and have the next round of talks," Alagiri told reporters after the meeting.The other allies in DMK-led alliance are Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), CPI, CPI(M), Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK), Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and smaller partners such as Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK) and Tamilaga Valvurimai Katchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-poll-bound-tamil-nadu-congress-dmk-begin-seat-sharing-talks-101614274239300.html

The BJP condemns such a move, hence we walked out of the meeting," the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly said.This government does not want to be questioned on any issue, the former chief minister said."There is rampant corruption in the state, but it does not want any scrutiny," Fadnavis alleged.He also said that the election of the new Assembly Speaker was not on the agenda of the meeting.The post fell vacant with the resignation of Nana Patole, who has taken over as chief of the state unit of the Congress.Fadnavis also criticised the MVA government for its "double standards" over the coronavirus situation in the state."Political parties (in power) are holding large meetings and organising rallies, but they are asking the opposition parties not to demand a longer budget session," he said.On a query over state forest minister and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rathod, whose name is being linked to the death of a woman in Pune, he said, "This government is hiding him...The incident had taken place several weeks back, but there was no complaint filed by the police. They are not even taking any initiative to probe it."State parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab has announced that the budget session will be held from March 1 to 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-mva-govt-trying-to-curtail-budget-session-citing-pandemic-bjp-101614260594714.html

Earlier, he had opposed the same proposal when he was the chief minister.Sandeep Khardekar, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson, said, “Many housing societies are in favour of redevelopment. Earlier they were unable to do it as there would be less construction on the existing plot. BJP leader Devendra Fadnvis and state unit president Chandrakant Patil have expressed the same views.”Another BJP leader Ujwal Keskar said, “While framing uniform development control rules, state government has already allowed additional FSI on same plots. There is no need for the additional proposal, but some developers want more FSI so they are pushing for road widening.”Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “Those people who live in bungalows will be affected by this move. The city houses a lot of old and traditional bungalows. Even there are chances that at some places developers would force citizens to redevelop plots.”Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)leader Nitin Kadam said, “Many citizens from the Sahakarnagar area have opposed the road widening proposal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/political-parties-in-pune-divided-over-pmc-s-road-widening-proposal-101614267053022.html

As detailed instructions are awaited, officials noted that the process may take time to start.Speaking on the issue, Dr Archana Patil, director, state health department, said “Details about how the beneficiaries will register and how many centre will be vaccinating beneficiaries above the age of 60 will be given to us soon. As soon as that comes to us, we will lay out the plan and start the process.” Talking about the registration of beneficiaries, Dr Archana Patil added that the process is unclear as of now. The registration of healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers (FLW), was done through the CoWin app. Sources from the health department said that the registration for the public may be done in a similar way. Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer, also said that since there has been no information from the centre yet, the entire process may take time to start.“From March 1, the process of vaccination is to start.

Dr Ashish Bharti, chief of the health department at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said the PMC is ready to set up for the vaccination of those aged 60 years and above, and beneficiaries with co-morbidities.“We can vaccinate 100 beneficiaries per vaccinator. In some centres where there are more beneficiaries we have two vaccinators. We are likely to follow the same pattern for the third phase as well,” said Dr Bharti.Beneficiary registration through the CoWin app had a lot of glitches earlier.

25-02-2021||Pune||PMC to float fresh tender for cat sterilisation||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to float fresh tender for cat sterilisation after the last year’s plan did not take off due to the Covid-19 situation. According to PMC, only on agency had shown interest in the previous tender and it did not have the mandatory certificate from the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) for cat sterilisation. The civic body estimates the cat sterilisation plan will cost around ₹1.50 crore. PMC had floated the tender in September 2019 as per the state government’s directives to all local bodies to curb population of cats with the help of sterilisation. The time period to submit the tender was extended following poor response. Later, the civic body received response from an agency, Getmoksha Environmental Foundation, but it did have the AWBI certificate for cat sterilization. PMC gave the agency six months, as per the tender conditions followed by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), to get certificate from the animal welfare body. However, the process was halted because of the Covid-19 outbreak. Dr Prakash Wagh, assistant medical officer (veterinary), PMC health department said, “Last year, we got response from one agency. We had floated tender for cat sterilisation for the first time.” Civic officials said that sterilisation of cats is carried out in a similar manner like dogs, but cages are used instead of pounds. “Permission from cat owners or caretakers are sought before carrying out sterilisation as cats are mostly seen in housing societies, homes and bungalows,” a civic official said. The Maharashtra government’s May 9, 2019 order reads: “Generally, a cat gives birth to four to five kittens every three months, thereby increasing their population immensely. There are many incidents of kittens dying on roads, gutters and drainage pipes. Hence, it’s imperative that cats are sterilised to curb their population and by extension, put an end to cruelty on them”. PMC issues show cause to dog sterilisation agency The Pune civic body has issued a show cause notice to Universal Animal Welfare Society of Beed to end its contract with PMC. The civic administration took the step after BMC stopped the agency from working under its jurisdiction. The decision was taken based on allegations and complaints of one of the animal activists over ill-treatment and death of animals. Universal Animal Welfare Society of Beed, Blue Cross Society of India, Animal Welfare Association of Navi Mumbai and Society for the Provision of Cruelty of Animals of Latur have been given contract to carry out sterilisation within PMC limits. Dr Wagh said, “We have issued a show cause notice to Universal Animal Welfare Society of Beed, but the agency has already stopped their sterilisation work in PMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-float-fresh-tender-for-cat-sterilisation-101614261712728.html

On Thursday, D-Mart on Satara road allowed only a limited number of people at a time, a rule which was in existence during the April-May lockdown. As a result, long queues were once again witnessed outside the mall. “When I went to purchase groceries, D-Mart told me to wait till crowd inside clears. I had to wait for almost two hours to get entry,” said customer Sadanand Sontakke. Several hotels and restaurants, too, have made seating arrangements that ensure social distancing, after the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) began taking action against owners for flouting Covid norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/malls-begin-to-restrict-customer-entry-to-ensure-no-overcrowding-101614260632612.html

25-02-2021||Patna||Bihar saw 8-fold growth in budget size under both RJD and NDA: Tejashwi Yadav||Tejashwi Yadav, the Leader of Opposition in Bihar, Thursday sought to dispel the perception among a section of the people that the state's budget size increased eight times only under the NDA government and claimed that it had increased as many times during the 15-year regime of RJD, his party.Participating in a debate in the assembly on the 2021-22 Bihar budget in the assembly, Yadav said its size was ₹3000 crore in 1990 which increased to ₹24,000 crore, a growth of eight times, in 2005 when RJD was in power.Similarly the budget size increased from ₹24000 crore in 2005-06 to ₹2.11 lakh crore in 2019-20, again a eight fold growth under NDA rule in the the state, he said.RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, Yadav's father, was the state chief minister in 1990. Rabri Devi, his mother later donned the mantle till Nitish Kumar assumed power in the state in November 2005."Thus, it is established from the data that the state's budget size increased by eight fold during 15 year regimes of both RJD and NDA," he said.The growth was also the same for the union budget during the 2005-20 period, he said. It increased from ₹4.53 lakh crore in 2005-06 to ₹35 lakh crore in 2021-22.This fact nullifies the propaganda and perception that have been created that the RJD regime under Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi was 'Jungle Raj' and had nothing to do with development of the state, Yadav said.Claiming that the NDA government in thes state has been indulging in "jugglery of figures", the RJD leader said that Bihar had in fact witnessed decline of two per cent in revenue collection during 2005-06 to 2021-22.The state government could barely spend ₹70,000 crore out of the ₹2.11 lakh crore of the sanctioned budget expenditure for 2020-21, he said and wondered whether the Nitish Kumar government will be able to spend ₹1.43 lakh crore in the remaining one month of the current fiscal."This will lead to March loot," he alleged.Citing Transparency India International (TII) data, Yadav said Bihar ranks second in the list of most corrupt states of the country. As per the TII 75 per cent of work is done only after paying bribes to government departments.On the human development index front, the state ranked 32 during the Rabri Devi regime, but now is in the 36th position, Yadav, a former deputy chief minister said.Hitting out at the NDA government of Nitish Kumar, he said it per the 2021-2022 budget that it will provide 20 lakh employment opportunities but it has not explained how it will be done. THe NDA had also promised this during its election campaign for the 2020 state poll."Chief Minister (Kumar) says that he will never compromise on three Cs (crime, corruption and communalism). But he has reduced his party (JD-U) to a C grade party by compromising on his three Cs," he said.Continuing his criticism, the RJD leader said the state's finance minister Tarkishore Prasad's budget speech was "nothing but a bunch of lies" and there is no governance in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-saw-8-fold-growth-in-budget-size-under-both-rjd-and-nda-tejashwi-yadav-101614258082792.html

He had also said that Delhi government will change its fleet of hired cars to electric vehicles (EVs) within the next six months.The Delhi EV policy, announced in August last year, envisages that 25 per cent of all new vehicle registrations should be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) by 2024.The policy gives a subsidy of ₹10,000 per kWh to the first 1,000 e-cars or electric four wheelers, with a capping of ₹150,000 per vehicle. A subsidy of ₹5,000 per kWh of the battery capacity up to ₹30,000 is also to be given on the purchase of each electric two-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, rickshaw and freight vehicle. To push people to shift to EVs, the policy also has a “scrapping incentive” for those who make the switch.The government is also planning to float a tender to set up the first 100 charging stations across the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-announces-key-decision-on-evs-kejriwal-says-every-indian-is-proud-101614255333487.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Year on, demand to cancel cases against Covid-19 guideline violators in HP||Nearly a year since the nationwide lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19; there is growing demand to revoke the cases against people for violating pandemic guidelines. More than 2,500 people were booked under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and the National Disaster Management Act for offences ranging from jumping the quarantine period to not wearing masks or adhering to social distancing. Though the state government is undecided on the issue, it is learnt that the demand will come up in the budget session of the assembly, beginning on Friday. “The government booked many people for violating Covid-19 lockdown guidelines last year, but it’s strange that no action was taken against a frontal organisation that held a yagya (community prayer) in Shimla to ward off the virus. The prayer meeting was attended by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur when the pandemic was at its peak. In public interest, the government should withdraw the FIRs registered for such violations,” said Congress leader and Nadaun legislator Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu. Many among those booked for curfew violation are traders. One such shopkeeper from Chotta Shimla, Ankur Chadha, said: “I got a notice for opening my shop during curfew hours. The situation at that time was such that we couldn’t have shut shop as our daily customers were demanding the supply of essential commodities.” Most curfew violation cases in Kangra A total of 2,271 cases of curfew violation were registered in the 13 police districts of the state during the pandemic last year. Most of the cases were registered under Sections 188, 269 and 270 of the IPC and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act. The curfew was imposed in March last year and continued through April and May, while night curfew remained in force as late as the beginning of this year. Police data shows that of the total curfew violation cases, the maximum of 355 were registered in Kangra district, which also happens to be the state’s biggest district in terms of population. As many as 301 cases were registered in Shimla district and 229 in Mandi, while 221 cases were registered in Kullu and 206 in the police district of Baddi. The least number of such cases was registered in the tribal Lahaul-Spiti district, where only eight instances of curfew violation were reported, while 62 cases were registered in Kinnaur. Ninety cases were reported in Hamirpur, which has the highest population density in the state. ‘Police implemented orders, up to govt now’ State director general of police Sanjay Kundu said: “The law will take its own course. The police had strictly enforced the government’s orders.” He said the police challaned nearly 48,000 people for not wearing masks and collected ₹2.26 crore as fine from them. When contacted, Kangra superintendent of police Vimukt Ranjan said the cases that were registered under Section 188 (curfew violation) of the IPC have been forwarded to the district magistrate as his permission is required to proceed further in such matters. The cases where more sections were imposed have been put up in court. “It is up to the government whether to withdraw or continue with the proceedings,” he said. Kangra district magistrate Rakesh Kumar Prajapati said the administration is in talks with the government on what should be the further course of action, particularly in the cases related to curfew violations under Section 188 of the IPC. 250 cases for violating quarantine norms At least 250 cases were registered against people who violated quarantine. Police data showed 209 cases were registered against people who jumped home quarantine and 41 against those supposed to be in institutional quarantine. The maximum of 73 such cases were reported in Kangra, 44 in Chamba and 26 in Mandi. No person jumped quarantine in Lahaul-Spiti, where the community had imposed strict quarantine rules besides the local administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/year-on-demand-to-cancel-cases-against-covid-19-guideline-violators-in-hp-101614253793052.html
25-02-2021||Dehradun||In Uttarakhand, police to reward brides who say no to booze at their weddings||The Devprayag police in Tehri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand has taken a noble initiative to discourage cocktail parties in the weddings in rural areas under its jurisdiction by rewarding brides who object to such parties at their wedding events.Under the initiative named Bhuli (sister in Garhwali language) Kanyadan, the brainchild of Devprayag station house officer Mahipal Singh Rawat, the police station will offer a reward of ₹10,001 to the bride for objecting to booze parties at her wedding functions. The reward money would be pooled in by the staff of the police station.Explaining the reason behind the initiative, Rawat said, "Of late it has been observed that people in the rural areas in the hills, just like people in the urban areas, are also organising cocktail parties which has now become a trend. It often causes arguments, quarrels and fights at weddings. To stop such things, I decided to take the step."Rawat said that the move will spread awareness against promoting alcohol during weddings which "was not always a trend in the weddings in hilly areas.""In weddings in hilly areas, it was more about celebrating culture and rituals with love and affection. But now that has been replaced with these cocktail parties which is not a good sign. We hope this initiative will curb the trend and people will focus more on celebrating the rituals and culture," he said.Also read: 'Money laundering charge established' - UK judge clears Nirav Modi's extraditionThe police officer informed that the cocktail parties have many implications on society, including unnecessary pressure on the economically weaker families to hold such events."It becomes a sort of societal pressure on poor families. They feel like others in the village, they should also hold such parties for their daughters' wedding. We hope the move will curb this. Rewarding the brides would set an example and make others feel that should not hold such parties to get the reward," said Rawat.To inform the village heads in the area, Rawat held a meeting with them a few days ago who too "appreciated the idea and promised their support to make it a success.""I held a meeting with about 20-25 village heads at police station premises wherein they all supported the idea and said they will urge the residents of their villages not to hold cocktail parties in weddings. This will also save many families which are being destroyed due to the menace of alcoholism," said Rawat.He added that the village heads have been asked to also verify the claims by the brides under the initiative to ensure they genuinely objected to booze and are not lying to get the reward money.Social activists have also appreciated the move saying it will help in curbing the practice in hills.Social activist Anoop Nautiyal said, "If a bride objects to cocktail parties in her wedding, then it will be a symbolic act with high impact on the society which could further motivate others to do the same."On the question of any possible discord by the bride's act he said, "it is unlikely to happen as such acts by women in Uttarakhand have led to significant changes and movements in the society in the past.""Also, it also important to stop the cocktail parties in weddings considering the present economic hardships," said Nautiyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/in-uttarakhand-police-to-reward-brides-who-say-no-to-booze-parties-at-weddings-101614250727903.html

25-02-2021||Mumbai||As Covid cases spike, CM threat of lockdown sees Mumbai events being cancelled||Hotels and banquet halls in Mumbai are reporting last-minute cancellations this week, said a hotels’ association. This comes in the wake Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray telling the authorities to put curbs on weddings and other such social functions because of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state.Thackeray even warned that he would be forced to order another lockdown if people failed to comply with the Covid-19 guidelines. He also issued instructions that any banquet hall violating the guidelines be sealed.For social events, the state has mandated a maximum of 50 persons at a time in the banquet hall; they should be wearing masks along and maintaining social distance.But such strict guidelines and the fear of another lockdown have seen events like award functions and conferences also being postponed.The Hotels and Restaurants Association Western India (HRAWI), a Mumbai-based association of hotels, confirmed that hotels have reported a large number of cancellations this week. “People are not comfortable celebrating in such an environment and so, are cancelling their events. They also fear that a lockdown may be imposed,” said HRAWI senior vice-president Pradeep Shetty.Radisson Blu Mumbai International Airport Hotel has not been getting new bookings ever since the lockdown fear has gripped the city. “We had three conferences scheduled but they have been postponed by the organisers. In addition, we are not getting new bookings,” said hotel general manager Pankaj Saxena.Jay Shah, owner of Popular Hospitality, which manages seven venues in the city, said people are worried because of the lockdown scare. “The next two months are the peak seasons for weddings and people are not sure if they will even be able to hold their events. This has affected our bookings,” said Shah.Shiv Sena leader Vinod Ghosalkar cancelled his youngest son Saurabh’s wedding which was scheduled at Sahar Star Hotel at Vile Parle on February 28. Ghosalkar, who is the chairman of the repair board of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority, booked 55,000 square feet Sapphire hall which could have accommodated 2,500 guests. Thackeray and the entire Cabinet was expected to grace this wedding.Ghosalkar said, “Based on Uddhavji’s appeal and the rising Covid-19 cases, I have decided to cancel the wedding.” The idea of capping the number of guests to 50 hasn’t gone down well with all. The Bombay Caterers Association spokesperson Lalit Jain said, “The very rule of maximum 50 people itself is ridiculous and it should be based on the size of the hall. We had hardly recovered from months of lockdown and this rule has ruined our businesses.” Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has intensified its drive against those stepping out without masks and also large gatherings. The civic body has also decided to shut Oval Maidan from Friday. Recently, it lodged an FIR against the parents of a newly-wed couple after it was found that they had breached the guidelines of 50 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-covid-cases-spike-cm-threat-of-lockdown-sees-mumbai-events-being-cancelled-101614250972672.html
25-02-2021||Other||Transgenders seek meeting with district authority to push for right to be “identified”||PUNE The transgender community in Pune is pushing for implementation of the provision in the Transgender Person (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, which allows for a transperson to get an identification as a “transperson”. Sonali Dalvi, a city-based trans-rights activist who has been in the forefront of the fight, is hoping to get a meeting with the Secretary of District legal service authority (DLSA) to begin the process in Pune and effectively in Maharashtra. The Transgender Person (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 was passed by the Parliament in November 2019. It acquired Presidential assent in December 2019 and was notified by the Law and Justice Ministry of India in January 2020. “I’m thankful to the Social Justice Ministry that has accepted 85% of our suggestions while bringing in the Trangender Person (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. In other states, the certification process has begun based on affidavits submitted. It should begin for us too. We are going to meet the head of DLSA for it,” said Sonali Dalvi. Dalvi had raised strong objections to the rule about having a psychologist to certify whether a person is transgendered or not. The medical examination added a factor of doubt and resultant shame to it, she pointed out. The transgender community has long been demanding benefits like employment, opportunity to get admission in educational institutions, health benefits, In Pune, the community has been demanding a separate ward in Sassoon General Hospital dedicated to transpeople. The cause of a ward at Sassoon has garnered support from some progressive politicians, but has yet to see any documentation. The demand for public toilets for transpeople is also long-standing in Pune. “With the identification in place, we can at least ask for things like reservation, health benefits like money for sex reassignment surgery, and a seat at the table in other walks of life,” said Dalvi. In April 2014, the Supreme Court accepted transgenders as the third gender along with male and female. That was a major achievement for the community. How to register yourself as a transperson? A form is prescribed in the the Trangender Person (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 under the title “Form-1” The form, with state emblem, will be issued at the District court of each of the states and districts Along with the form, a self-declaration/affidavit needs to be attached while submission The affidavit should be made on a non-judicial stamp paper of ₹10 and then notarised by a competent authority For successful completion of the form, a government issued identification will be required The IDs could be any one of the following: birth certificate, Aadhaar card, PAN card, voter ID, ration card, passport, bank passbook, MNREGA card,or caste certificate In case of a minor person, the parent of legal guardian can be the applicant There are extra sections in the form for those who have undergone sex reassignment surgery and want to register either as male or female||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transgenders-seek-meeting-with-district-authority-to-push-for-right-to-be-identified-101614249652019.html

25-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi to face water crisis due to closure of Nangla hydel channel: Raghav Chadha||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice chairman Raghav Chadha said on Thursday that the Delhi government body had written to the Centre, Haryana government and BBMB (Bhakra Beas management board) urging them to postpone the repair of Nangal hydel channel. Due to the repair work, the water supply to Delhi will have to be stopped, which will lead to an unprecedented crisis in the national capital, Chadha said in the letter.The closure of Nangal hydel channel for one month for repair work is expected to affect a quarter of water supply of Delhi."The blind closure of the channel will affect supply of 232 MGD (million gallon per day) of water supply from the Beas river to Delhi for one month in March-April. It is 25 per cent of water supply in Delhi and could lead to an unprecedented water crisis and even law and order situation," he said.He also urged Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to convene a meeting of all the stakeholders to discuss the issue.Chadha added that the Delhi government is in constant touch with the Centre over the issue and hoped that the impending crisis will be averted.“This could lead to an unprecedented water crisis and even law and order situation,” Chadha said.Water flows from Bhakra dam which is in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh downstream Nangal dam where it is controlled and released into the Nangal hydel channel. This channel later becomes Bhakra main line after Ganguwal and Kotla power plants. The Bhakra main line mostly supplies irrigation water to the state of Haryana and the power generated at Bhakra Dam is distributed among partner states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Chandigarh and Delhi.Earlier in February, water supply in parts of south, east and north-east Delhi was partially affected as silt and debris from the flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district increased turbidity in the Ganga river forcing Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to operate at reduced capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-face-water-crisis-due-to-closure-of-nangla-hydel-channel-raghav-chadha-101614245640123.html
25-02-2021||Bangalore||Sharath B Gowda, son of senior BJP MP, extends support to Congress in Karnataka||Sharath Bachegowda, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rebel and the independent legislator from Hosakote in Kolar district, formally extended support to the Congress party in Karnataka on Thursday, indicating a total shift away from his previous party, the BJP. The Congress chose to highlight the development amid the direct political headwinds being faced by the BS Yediyurappa government in the state.“I have decided to support the Congress for the development of Hoskote taluk and its people,” Sharath said on Thursday. As an independent, Sharath cannot formally join the Congress.Sharath is the son of BN Bache Gowda, a senior BJP leader and the sitting member of parliament from Chikaballapura, about 60 kms from Bengaluru. Sharath’s move is being seen by some as a setback for the ruling BJP, which seeks influence in the constituency for its long-term plans for the southern districts of Karnataka, where it has little political representation.Sharath unsuccessfully contested the 2018 assembly elections on a BJP ticket in Hosakote against N Nagaraju (MTB) of the Congress. However, he later defeated him as an independent candidate by more than 11,000 votes in December 2019 by-polls, necessitated by Nagaraju’s defection to the BJP along with several other MLAs from the Congress and the Janata Dal(S) just after the Lok Sabha polls. Sharath’s win was seen as a setback to the BJP, which hoped Nagaraju’s defection will help it expand footprints in Kolar district.Also Read: Prime accused in Karnataka quarry blast case arrested in Tamil NaduIndicating a 180 degrees turn in his political position, Sharath on Thursday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government over issues like price rise, farmer agitation and the alleged lack of development.“I will continue to remain an independent in the assembly,” Sharath said, while adding that he will back the Congress. His supporters have joined the Congress.“People are knocking at the doors of the government.

25-02-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee rides electric scooter to protest against rising fuel prices||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday urged people across India to protest against hike in fuel prices, as she reached her office riding pillion on an electric scooter. “This (hike in fuel prices) is a very alarming situation. TMC has started a movement which would be extended across the state from Friday. I would urge everyone to hit the streets across the country,” she told media while sitting on an electric scooter outside the state secretariat. Minister Firhad Hakim rode the scooter, ferrying the chief minister from her residence in south Kolkata to the secretariat in Howrah. Both the leaders had a poster on fuel price hike hanging around their neck. “This is our protest against hike prices of petrol, diesel and LPG. There was a hike in LPG prices even last night and a cylinder now costs at least ₹800. Kerosene is unavailable the market. In Bengal, around ten million people depend on kerosene for cooking. The kitchen is the worst hit every time there is a hike in fuel prices,” she added. “Most of the people in our country work in the unorganised sector. They need at least two cylinders every month. If two cylinders cost them ₹1,600, what would they do? Even farmers, who run their tractors on diesel, are not being spared. Labourers are not being spared,” she said.She said she would use the electric scooter for her ride back home as well. The BJP sought to make light of the chief minister’s protest. “This is a unique ploy by Mamata Banerjee. The Centre has said that if petrol and diesel are brought under the purview of GST, fuel prices may drop by ₹10 to ₹15 in one go. State finance minister is the chairman of the GST council. Instead of riding a scooter, she should ask him to call a meeting of GST council and states, and take steps towards bring fuel under GST purview,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP state vice-president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-rides-electric-scooter-to-protest-against-rising-fuel-prices-101614242752249.html

The NIA made the claim in its charge sheet filed on February 9.The agency claimed that a WhatsApp group “DG Halli 45” was actively organising the mob to gather in front of the two police stations.“Analysis of the WhatsApp group revealed that more than a hundred members were present in the said group during the riot and had hidden their identity… the WhatsApp group was used for spreading incriminating messages, images, videos, audio clips etc related to the incident to instigate people to assemble unlawfully in front of both KG Halli and DJ Halli police stations for participating in the violent activities,” the charge sheet read.It further added that 18 mobile phones used for recording text messages, videos, audios and photos of the incident and sharing the same on social media platforms, have been seized.The charge sheet also claimed that administratorsof the WhatsApp group and some members have been identified during the investigation.“Analysis of the mobile/WhatsApp data of the group also revealed that the movement and activities of many rioters during and after the events were coordinated through these groups,” NIA added.Reacting to the charge sheet, Afsar Kodlipet, a senior office-bearer of the SDPI in Karnataka, said: “This charge sheet is pre-planned and prejudiced.

25-02-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka's Brahmin board to start calls for intra-caste unions soon||The Karnataka State Brahmin Development Board (KSBDB) is all set to open its online portal and other modes to invite applications for its contentious Maitreyi and Arundhathi schemes, which incentivise and promote marriages within the community.“We will call for applications from March 2,” HS Sachindananda Murthy, the chairman of the board, said.He said the board has just initiated systems through which tehisldars will visit the homes of applicants to verify their eligibility and economic credentials.Under the Arundhati scheme, around 550 poor women from the Brahmin community will be given ₹25,000 each for their marriage. Similarly, under the Maitreyi scheme, a financial bond of ₹3 lakh (over three years) will be created for about 25 women who marry Brahmin priests from poor backgrounds.Aditya Bhat, a resident of Adangadur village in Chikmagalur district, about 320 km from Bengaluru, is likely to be the first beneficiary of the Maitreyi scheme.“I had heard about the scheme and applied for it. The board took my wedding invite and asked me to apply for the grant after my marriage,” the 26-year-old, who has been practising priesthood for the last 10 years, said.He said his earnings fluctuate between ₹15,000- ₹20,000 per month to as low as ₹5,000 in lean and inauspicious periods. Bhat, who is part of a large joint family, owns about an acre of land where they grow areca nut, but the crop hasn’t fared too well due to diseases. He said the scheme would help with financial security for his future.So far, the government has identified two priests in the state.Both schemes, launched in January, have come under significant criticism from various quarters.The board was established as per the budget announcement of 2018-19 by the then HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government with an outlay of ₹25 crore for both schemes and capital expenditure. It was registered on March 1, 2019 as a move to help the community, which accounts for about 4% of the state’s population.While the setting up of the board itself has been challenged in various forums, including the courts, the two schemes, in particular, have attracted criticism for re-engraving the idea and need for castes.“As the chairman of such a board, I have made schemes that incentivise and promote the development of the Brahmins as well as those who safeguard Brahminism and cannot push for inter-caste marriages and ask them to leave the community,” Murthy said. He reasoned that if the government promoted such a scheme, it would be wrong, adding that the sole purpose of creating such a board was for the promotion of a particular community.Karnataka’s caste-centric society is no different from the rest of the country, but the incentivising of intra-community marriage, experts say, goes against the stated goals of the governments—both state and Union—that boast about bringing in more social equality.The KSBDB has so far introduced five schemes, including providing competitive exam training to youths and cash incentives for higher education. Murthy said a total of ₹21.5 crore out of the total ₹25 crore has been earmarked for various schemes of the board so far.The initiation of systems and processes for the scheme comes at a time when there have been growing calls for reservation-related demands, including increasing allocations and change of categories by dominant and politically influential caste groups like Panchamasalis, Vokkaligas, Kurubas and Valmikis, among others.“The constitutional validity of the caste-wise development corporations, which are promoted by this government, and the very policy is under challenge,” Professor Ravivarma Kumar, former advocate general of Karnataka and senior counsel, said.The case against the formation of these caste-wise boards was filed in December and the government is yet to file its objections despite being granted four opportunities, Kumar said. The case was listed for Monday, but the government has sought more time and is expected to come for a hearing in mid-March.The BS Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has established a board for Brahmins, Marathas and a corporation for the Veerashaiva-Lingayats with an allocation of ₹500 crore.A report by Kumar, who served as chairman of the backward classes commission, in 2000 to incentivise promotion of inter-caste marriages, is yet to be implemented even though a survey was conducted in 2015 based on the commission’s recommendations, he said.Kumar also referred to the socio-economic survey — better known as ‘caste census, the first anywhere in the country since 1931 — which was carried out by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2015. The survey was seen as a move to challenge the dominant caste theory in Karnataka by the then chief minister, who had stormed to power with the support of AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits).

We are cooperating with the IT teams but this seems to be a deliberate attack on Kundu for raising the farmers’ voices against the three farm laws,” he added.Former Zila Parishad chairman from Rohtak, Balraj Kundu contested the 2019 assembly election as an independent candidate after the saffron party denied him a ticket and pitched Shamsher Singh Kharkhara from the seat, but Kundu managed to defeat Shamsher Singh and also veteran Congress leader Anand Singh Dangi.Also Read: CM Khattar unlikely to accede to Vij’s demand for change of DGPAfter the BJP fell short of majority in Haryana, Kundu extended support to the BJP-JJP government. Later, he withdrew the support from the government, accusing former minister of state for cooperatives, Manish Grover, of indulging in corrupt activities and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar of not initiating a probe against Grover. He has been targeting Khattar on several issues.Kundu started a Rasoi at Tikri border for protesting farmers against the three contentious farm laws and has been taking part in Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikat’s mahapanchayats in Haryana. Kundu has been running nearly a dozen buses free of cost for girl students studying in various colleges in Rohtak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/income-tax-raids-at-haryana-mla-balraj-kundu-s-homes-offices-101614228334563.html

25-02-2021||Mumbai||Wife’s refusal to make tea no provocation for assault: Bombay high court||Observing that the notion of patriarchy wherein a man treats his wife like property and can do as he wishes unfortunately still persists in the majority mindset, the Bombay high court rejected the appeal of a man who was convicted for assaulting his wife with a hammer which resulted in her death in 2013.The man who was convicted and sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment approached the court seeking reduction in his sentence on the grounds that the refusal of his wife to make tea for him resulted in grave and sudden provocation that made him assault her.However, the court held that as the man after assaulting his wife had wasted precious time in destroying the evidence before taking her to the hospital, there was no infirmity in the sentence and hence rejected the man’s appeal.Also Read | Bombay HC raps ACB Thane police for delay in FIR against contractorJustice Revati Mohite Dere, while hearing the appeal filed by 36-year-old Santosh Atkar against his conviction and sentence by additional sessions judge, Pandharpur, on July 1, 2016, was informed by advocate Sarang Aradhye that the man was sentenced for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under sections 304 (10-year rigorous imprisonment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 201 (2-year rigorous imprisonment for causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code.Aradhye submitted that as the conviction was based on the extra-judicial confession of the man and the trial court had discarded the witness of the daughter, and as the man had been in prison since 2013, the appeal seeking reduction of the sentence to the time he had already served in prison should be allowed.According to the complaint registered by the maternal uncle of the deceased woman on December 19, 2013, when he reached Vitthal Hospital, he was informed by the husband that he had assaulted his wife Manisha. The man repeated the same confession to the mother of the deceased woman. The police investigation revealed that the couple used to quarrel frequently.On the day of the incident, a quarrel ensued between the two and when the woman refused to make tea for him, he assaulted her with a hammer. Rather than rush his bleeding wife to the hospital, the man bathed her and cleaned the blood and took her to the hospital after an hour of the assault. The couple’s six year-old daughter was a witness to the entire incident.As the woman was not responding to treatment, the man was asked to shift her to Civil Hospital in Solapur. The woman who could not talk due to the assault succumbed to the injury at the hospital on December 25.After hearing the submissions, Mohite Dere observed that the daughter was a natural witness and the delay in recording the daughter’s statement which was recorded after almost 11-12 days of the incident was condonable as she must have been in trauma during the initial few days, hence it should not have been disbelieved at the time of trial.The bench also rejected the argument that the assault was a result of grave and sudden provocation as the woman refused to make tea for the man and observed, “It would not be out of place to observe that a wife is not a chattel or an object. Marriage ideally is a partnership based on equality. More often than not, it is far from that. Cases such as these are not uncommon. Such case, reflect the imbalance of gender – skewed patriarchy, the socio-cultural milieu one has grown up in, which often seeps into a marital relationship.”Referring to a study, “Man Who Mistook His Wife For Chattel” by Margo Wilson and Martin Daly, the court said, “This medieval notion of the wife being the property of the husband to do as he wishes, unfortunately, still persists in the majority mindset. Nothing but notions of patriarchy. Thus, the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the deceased by refusing to make tea for the appellant offered grave and sudden provocation, is ludicrous, clearly untenable and unsustainable and as such deserves to be rejected.”While rejecting the appeal, Mohite Dere observed that the conviction and sentence did not suffer from any infirmity and said, “The appellant not only assaulted his wife, but also after assaulting her, wasted precious and crucial time i.e. around one hour, in covering his act by destroying evidence, by wiping the blood from the spot and bathing Manisha before taking her to the hospital. If the appellant had rushed Manisha to the hospital, soon after the incident, possibly her life could have been saved and [daughter of the couple] would not have lost her mother.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wifes-refusal-to-make-tea-no-provocation-for-assault-bombay-high-court-101614224091073.html
25-02-2021||Patna||Bihar: Minister promises action against officers delaying land mutation||Bihar revenue minister Ram Surat Rai on Wednesday promised action against officers found deliberately delaying mutation of land beyond the 15-day timeframe in the state. Rai was responding in Legislative Council to leaders across party lines alleging land mutation process in the state to be tardy.The minister’s response was followed by a debate over RJD MLC Ramachandra Purbe’s allegation that the majority of land mutation applications, nearly 80,000 out of 1.50 lakh, were pending for disposal at 23 circle offices in Patna, leading to harassment of people. “Intermediaries are actually calling the shots in the mutation process,” alleged the RJD member.Supporting Purbe’s contention, Sanjeev Shyam Singh of the JD(U) said that the application for mutation of his own land was pending for disposal in Ara for the past eight-nine months. Another JD(U) member Neeraj Kumar said the web-based application, Parimarjan, meant to facilitate mutation was not working properly.Responding to the members’ concerns, the minister assured the house that he would personally look into the issue and take the officers, found guilty of delaying the process on one pretext or the other, to task.Poor spending on Smart City missionBihar deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, who holds the charge of urban development department, assured the legislative council that the department will conduct a survey of dilapidated water pipelines in Patna and order their replacement to ensure safe potable water to residents.Also Read: Bihar board matric exam 2021 concludes, cheating cases reduced by 44%The assurance came following a short-notice question by Congress member Prem Chandra Mishra, who alleged that Patna residents were condemned to drink contaminated water owing to old, rusting and leaking pipelines.

Kanpur and Lucknow occupied sixth and ninth positions on the chart, according to the CSE analysis.Also Read | Most of northwest India sees summer-like temperatures“Winter is a special challenge when inversion, and the cool and calm weather trap and spike daily pollution. While the northern Indo-Gangetic Plains is the most affected, other regions also experience a rise, but with lesser intensity. But this year, even though the average level of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) during summer and monsoon months was considerably lower than the previous year, due to the summer lockdown, the winter PM2.5 concentration rose in many cities across regions as compared to 2019,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, CSE’s executive director and the in-charge of research and advocacy.She further said, “This bouncing back of pollution, post-lockdown, unmasks the high impact of local and regional pollution. This demands quicker regional reforms to curb pollution from vehicles, industry, power plants and waste burning to curb the winter pollution.”This analysis by CSE took into account data from 99 cities across the country, where data availability for two consecutive winters meets the minimum criteria for 75% of days between October 1 and January 31.The analysis also showed that in Delhi, the levels of PM 2.5 showed a “stable trend”. Delhi, along with 14 other cities, showed a less than 8% change in pollution levels this winter season as compared to the previous winter.“This analysis has helped to understand the regional differences in winter pollution. Even though there is considerable regional variation, peak pollution episodes increased and synchronized within the regions during winter. At the same time, uneven rise across monitoring locations and contiguous cities pointed to the impact of local pollution,” says Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager at CSE’s urban lab team, sustainable cities programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/eight-of-10-most-polluted-cities-this-winter-were-in-ncr-up-cse-study-101614222470877.html

25-02-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Delhi, Ghaziabad face heavy traffic during peak hours||The Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu borders, where farmers are continuing their agitation demanding withdrawal of the three new farm laws, continue to be completely blocked for traffic on Thursday. The Delhi Police have diverted the traffic near these areas, which they say, may possibly lead to heavy traffic jams in parts of the Capital during the peak hours.Delhi Traffic Police officers said Delhi and Ghaziabad are facing heavy traffic jams in peak hours as the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border has remained completely closed. All the six lanes of Delhi-Meerut, NH-9 and NH-24 are closed because of the UP Gate border blockade and vehicles entering Delhi from Ghaziabad are being diverted to the alternate border routes such as Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra, Loni, Kondli, Chilla, New Ashok Nagar, DND, and Kalindi Kunj, they said.However, they said, NH-24 road is kept open for traffic going to Delhi from Ghaziabad through Ghazipur roundabout. So, those entering Delhi from Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar or Apsara border may take a right turn from the Ghazipur roundabout and take NH-24 road from there to move towards south and central Delhi via Sarai Kale Khan and the Ring Road.“Also, commuters can take Vikas Marg after taking a right turn from under the Patparganj Industrial Area flyover from Anand Vihar-Ghazipur road. No traffic is being allowed on Delhi-Meerut expressway while NH-9 is kept open only during morning and evening peak hours when traffic remain heavy,” a traffic police officer said.Apart from the UP Gate border, Singhu, Tikri, Saboli and Piau Maniyari borders are also closed. Traffic police officials said that Jharoda and Auchandi borders are opened only during morning and evening peak hours while Lampur, Safiabad, Singhu school and Pall toll tax borders are open for traffic.As traffic is expected to remain heavy on GT Karnal Road, Outer Ring Road and NH-44, the traffic police have asked commuters to avoid these routes and take the alternate or diverted routes.Chilla border between Noida and Delhi remains open on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-delhi-ghaziabad-face-heavy-traffic-during-peak-hours-101614221570828.html

25-02-2021||Delhi||Daily Covid-19 cases up to 200 in Delhi||The Capital on Wednesday reported 200 new infections of Covid-19, the highest single-day increase in cases in 26 days, or since January 29, according to government data.The seven-day average of new cases (also known as the daily case trajectory of a region) now appears to be slowly inching up again — it now stands at 151, the highest in 20 days. For the week ending February 12, this number had dropped to an over 300-day low of 125 new cases a day.Though minor, this spurt in cases in the city is concerning as it comes at a time when at least five states across India — Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Chhattisgarh – have seen what appear to be the start of fresh waves of infections. To be sure, the increase in cases in these five states is much more significant compared to Delhi’s.The number of tests in the city, meanwhile, has seen a considerable dip from peak levels over the past few weeks. For the week ending Wednesday, 57,699 samples were tested every day in the city (56,168 on Wednesday itself), compared to the peak capacity of 83,151 average tests a day exhibited by the government for the week ending December 23, a month after the city brought its third Covid-19 wave under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/daily-covid-19-cases-up-to-200-in-delhi-101614210939860.html
25-02-2021||Delhi||Transport dept readies command centre to track govt buses in real-time||The Delhi transport department has built a command-and-control centre in Kashmere Gate to track and monitor all Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses in real-time.The centre has been built at the interstate bus terminal (ISBT) in Kashmere Gate and will soon be inaugurated by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Wednesday after he inspected the facility.“Apart from the command-and-control centre (CCC) at Kashmere Gate, there is a disaster recovery centre, a data centre and separate viewing centres in all depots. The live footage can also be monitored by all depot managers. The CCC shall be manned 24 hours for real-time monitoring of all activities on buses,” Gahlot said.Each bus is now fitted with three cameras, GPS devices, 10 panic buttons, one display panel for the driver, hooter, strobe lights and 2 sets of two-way audio communication devices, one each for the driver and conductor.“All newly inducted buses and to-be inducted buses already have all these systems installed on them which will be integrated with the CCC at Kashmere Gate,” the minister said.All depot managers, drivers, conductors and marshals on board buses have completed their training related to the operation of the installed systems.Delhi currently has around 6,750 buses -- 3,760 DTC and 2,990 cluster buses-- as against the Supreme Court-mandated requirement of 11,000 buses.In case of an emergency, a passenger or driver or conductor can press the panic button. The alert will automatically be sent to the CCC at Kashmere Gate in real-time. The operator at the CCC will filter the alerts and forward the alert to the respective stakeholder such as police, fire and ambulance for a quick response with the GPS coordinates of the bus. An SMS and an email alert will also be sent to the authorities concerned in synchronization with these panic alerts, the government said in a statement.“The objective of the project is to ensure the safety and security of passengers, especially women passengers through IP-based CCTV surveillance cameras, panic button and GPS on the buses of DTC and those under the cluster scheme. After the inspection, I also held a meeting with transport officials to discuss issues related to the functioning of the CCC. I have instructed officials to submit a daily report about data monitoring and operation,” Gahlot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/transport-dept-readies-command-centre-to-track-govt-buses-in-realtime-101614204584514.html
25-02-2021||Delhi||Govt introduces contactless tickets on all DTC buses||The Delhi government on Wednesday, for the first time since its inception, expanded its ambitious contactless ticketing service to all its Delhi transport corporation (DTC) buses. The ticketless scheme was introduced by the government in May-June last year during the lockdown in order to cut down on physical human interaction that increased the chances of spread of Covid-19.Passengers can make use of this service through the ‘Chartr’ app. Almost all the buses now have QR code stickers pasted on the back of each seat which can be scanned to make payment through the app. Several buses, though not all, also had posters explaining in Hindi how one should proceed with the online ticket purchase by using the app. HT hopped onto a few buses and , however, found that most passengers still preferred to pay cash and coins and take paper tickets.On Day One of the complete roll-out of the system, at least 1,601 contactless general tickets and 5,015 pink tickets -— the free tickets for women passengers — were issued till 10pm on Wednesday, government record showed.“Till 9pm, the total collection through online transactions of tickets was ₹18,829. As many as 114 daily passes were issued on Wednesday through the contactless ticketing system amounting to a total collection of ₹ 5,150,” said RS Minhas, deputy general manager (PR), DTC.He, however, said the service is currently being run on a trial basis with an aim to fix technical glitches or physical problems faced by passengers or the conductors. Delhi has at least 3,700 DTC buses and prior to Wednesday, the trials were going on only in 128 DTC buses.A similar trial run is also going on in the city’s cluster buses. A senior official of the Delhi integrated multi-modal transit system (DIMTS) limited said at present, trials of the contactless ticketing service is being carried out in 497 of the 2,990 cluster buses in the Capital.“The plan is to formally launch the contactless ticketing system in all the 6,750 state-run buses — 3,760 DTC and 2,990 cluster — from March,” a senior transport official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-introduces-contactless-tickets-on-all-dtc-buses-101614204329186.html
25-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: His mundane security job||There is no subtle way of putting it. Subodh’s day job looks terribly boring. He is stationed at a road barrier—a side-lane really—in a south Delhi neighbourhood, and all day long he makes the metal barrier slide on its wheels to open way for the approaching vehicles. “And not let any gaadi (car) enter from the wrong side, because this is a one-way road,” he points out.On the seemingly drab texture of his routine, he shrugs and says, “This is work... majboori (no choice)... I don’t think of jobs as boring or interesting, one just has to do it.”In his early 30s, Subodh has been working this 9-5 shift for three years. A native of Arwal in Bihar, this is his first and so far only job in the Capital. “I know it is not easy to get a duty in a city like Delhi, where so many people are looking for work. It actually was my elder brother’s job… he decided to return to our village to take care of our agricultural land, and he helped me get it so that it stays within the family.”Now a biker stops by, asking Subodh directions for an address, which he very politely explains in minute detail.With his arm instinctively holding onto the wheeled metal barrier, ready to slide as soon as another car appears, Subodh explains his arrival from his countryside home to this smoggy metropolis. “I wanted to see the world... to see how people live... to see how customs are in those big cities that one has only heard of and never been to.”Now another biker stops by, asking Subodh directions for another address, which he again explains in detail. Such interference recurs almost every other minute during the course of this meeting.In all, Subodh seems to be impressed with Delhi—“Very nice people, very good behaviour... society, very good... I myself have made many friends... some of them are in security line like me, some are in drivery (sic).”But Subodh doesn’t see himself in this city five years from now. “You can’t live here forever... I will go back to my village... that place has my family, my land, my mother, my father...”And now yet another biker stops by, asking Subodh directions for yet another address, which he again very patiently explains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-mundane-security-job-101614204008184.html
25-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Civic bodies stop taking event bookings for parks after NGT prohibits it citing environment loss||All three municipal corporations of Delhi have stopped taking event bookings for parks, including the Ramlila Ground, in the wake of a recent order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) citing environment loss to parks due to the holding of mass public functions such as cultural and religious events, weddings and political rallies.Civic authorities said they are exploring possibilities to “challenge” the order.The Ramlila Ground is a popular venue where major political rallies and religious programmes are organised. It is the ground where social activist Anna Hazare started the India Against Corruption movement in 2011.The NGT earlier this month had directed civic bodies to strictly enforce orders prohibiting weddings, cultural, commercial and other functions at parks. The order was issued while hearing an application that said wedding functions being held in west Delhi’s Vikas Puri Dussehra ground were flouting environment norms.According to civic officials, the bookings for parks and grounds are one of the important revenue sources of civic bodies and the move would adversely affect revenue generation of cash-strapped municipalities.Civic authorities projected a cumulative loss of around ₹3.5 crore a year to the three corporations.Municipal officials said prior to that order, as many as 129 parks and grounds across the three municipal bodies used to be booked for religious, cultural and political events throughout the year.Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said there are nearly 47 parks and grounds, including the Ramlila Ground, under its jurisdiction where public and cultural functions used to be organised, generating revenue for the civic body. The NGT order has put paid to bookings this month, he said.“This decision is going to adversely impact our revenue generation. We are eying a loss of around ₹1 crore to ₹1.2 crore a year. We are examining the NGT order and are taking legal advice on whether it can be challenged,” Prakash said.He has also directed the chief legal officer of the civic body to check if Ramlila Ground can be kept open for bookings as, being a ground, it does not fall under the category of “parks”.Similarly, bookings have been stopped at the 64 parks of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and 18 parks of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC).Narendra Chawla, leader of the house in SDMC, said before granting permission to anyone to hold functions or events in SDMC parks, the civic body takes an undertaking from the applicant that the ecology of the park is not be disturbed, apart from which a maintenance charge is also realised from the applicant. “We always ensure that there is no permanent digging in the park and no garbage is left behind. There might have been violations in one or two cases, but imposing a blanket ban on all events at parks is not right. With this decision, we are going to witness a loss of at least ₹1.5 crore annually. We are exploring options on whether the order can be challenged,” Chawla said.Nirmal Jain, mayor, EDMC, said, “The civic body is already facing an acute financial crunch and this order will further limit our revenue generation resources. We are looking at a loss of at least ₹80 lakh annually if parks are not leased out for events.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-delhi-parks-to-be-booked-for-events-101614202924803.html
25-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal slams BJP over corruption in civic bodies||New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of corruption and blamed them for the poor financial condition of the municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) during a roadshow in north Delhi’s Bawana, where he also promised to sanction ₹100 crore for a sewer project in the area.Kejriwal, who is also the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led two roadshows on Wednesday in Bawana and Shalimar Bagh campaigning for candidates of the party ahead of municipal bypolls in five wards scheduled on Sunday. Hundreds of AAP supporters participated in the roadshow navigating the localities in two-wheelers and trucks, playing music.“I got to know that people have been demanding sewer line in Bawana. It is my promise that I will sanction ₹100 crores for the sewer project here,” said Kejriwal. He added, “The AAP has been actively campaigning against the corruption by the BJP. The MCDs are in a shambles because of their corruption.”“Together, the people of Delhi have defeated Covid-19, the pandemic has created havoc in the lives of the people. We have elections on Sunday, you all must go and vote for AAP. How many of you receive zero electricity bills? 24x7 free electricity has happened only in Delhi. We have worked to make Delhi better in the last six years by improving schools, hospitals, availability of electricity, and water. It is your responsibility to make AAP victorious in the MCD, together we have to change the face of MCD.”While the AAP is in power in the Delhi government, BJP rules all three municipal corporations. Delhi goes to the municipal polls in 2022.The BJP dismissed the allegations as baseless.Delhi BJP general secretary Shri Harsh Malhotra said, “The AAP government has not done any development work in Bawana, Shalimar Bagh and several other areas. Their leaders were unavailable during the Covid-19 crisis. They will get appropriate response from the people of these wards in the bypolls on Sunday. The promise of ₹100 crore for sewer line at this point speaks volumes about the poor condition of these areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-slams-bjp-over-corruption-in-civic-bodies-101614195298189.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||CM Khattar unlikely to accede to Vij’s demand for change of DGP||Spelling out the correct legal position with regards to the appointment and tenure of the Haryana director general of police (DGP), the home department on Wednesday conveyed to its minister Anil Vij that as per Supreme Court directions the DGP should have a minimum and not maximum tenure of at least two years irrespective of his date of superannuation. The department has also conveyed that a 2018 amendment in the Haryana Police Act stating that the DGP shall have tenure of not less than one year extendable to one more year irrespective of his date of superannuation was rejected by the apex court on January 16, 2019 since it was not in consonance with its directions. The SC had also ruled that any legislation or rule framed by any of the states or the central government running counter to the directions shall remain in abeyance to the aforesaid extent. Vij on Tuesday had triggered a controversy by writing to additional chief secretary, home, to send a panel of officers to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to be considered for the next DGP despite the fact that incumbent Manoj Yadava has over four years of service left. While Yadava completed two years on February 20, the state government on January 7 had extended his tenure till further orders. Doors of central posting open for Yadava Top officials said that once the minimum tenure of two years comes to an end, the state government has the option of deciding whether or not to continue with the incumbent DGP. “In Yadava’s case, his tenure has already been extended beyond February 20 till further orders. However, the department will still put up the file before the government to take a fresh call on this since the Home Minister has expressed an opinion,’’ officials said. Sources in the chief minister’s office said that chief minister, ML Khattar is unlikely to seek a replacement for Yadava, a 1988-batch officer handpicked by him for the top job. The officer had a 15-year stint with the Intelligence Bureau (IB) before he returned to his parent cadre. However, since the appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC) of the Central government on February 11 approved the empanelment of Yadava along with 28 other IPS officers for holding DG rank or equivalent posts at the Centre, it has opened avenues of an assignment in the IB and central paramilitary forces for the officer and he may seek central deputation sometime later in the year. ‘Only CM authorized to take a call on DGP’s posting’ “As per the Rules of Business, the authority to appoint or transfer IPS officials vested with the chief minister. As per section 28 of Rules of Business, all proposals for appointment and posting of IAS, IPS and Class I officers have to be submitted to the chief minister before the issuance of orders,’’ said an official. Officials said as far as the home minister’s observations on sending a fresh proposal to the UPSC, containing the names of eligible IPS officers for empanelment to the DGP rank, at least three months prior to the date of retirement of the incumbent DGP are concerned, such a measure is taken if an anticipated vacancy is arising due to the retirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cm-khattar-unlikely-to-accede-to-vij-s-demand-for-change-of-dgp-101614196129077.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||4 held with ₹29 lakh drug money, weapons in Amritsar||The Amritsar (rural) police on Wednesday arrested four persons allegedly involved in the smuggling of drugs and weapons from Pakistan.The police have also recovered ₹29.32 lakh drug money, a pistol of .32 bore (China-made) and two of its magazines (with 25 live rounds), 12 mobile phones and two foreign SIM cards (one of Pakistani and another of UAE).The accused have been identified as Gurjant Singh of Nathupur village, Sukhjinder Singh of Khayala village, Mehal Singh and Tehal singh of Lodhi Gujjar village. All the villages fall near the India-Pakistan border in Ajnala sub-division of the district.Police said the arrested men were in contact with Pakistani smugglers for the supply of drugs and weapons. They said lately, the accused smuggled a consignment of 6kg heroin from Pakistan, which was recovered by the Border Security Force (BSF) along the International Border near Kakkar village.A team comprising deputy superintendent of police (DSP-Attari) Gurpartap Singh Sahota, assistant superintendent of police (ASP-Majitha) Abhimanyu Rana and DSP-detective Gurinderpal Singh was working on the forward and backward linkages about the recovery of 6kg heroin that was seized by the BSF on February 16.One of the officials said they have nominated one more accused, kingpin of the racket, in the case, who is absconding. He said their preliminary investigation has suggested that the accused had cleared the consignments of nearly 25kg of heroin from the border in the past one month. He said, “January was very challenging for the BSF due to the fog when the visibility at the border had been reduced to almost zero, and the accused had taken the benefit of this.”DSP Gurpartap Singh said they have registered a case under Sections 21-22-25-27-27A-29-61-85 of the NDPS Act, 25-54-59 of the Arms Act and the relevant sections of the Foreign Act against the accused at Lopoke police station.He said their investigation to ascertain the backward and forward linkages of the accused was still on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-held-with-rs-29-lakh-drug-money-weapons-in-amritsar-101614195829764.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Youtube channels have school pre-final question papers a day in advance||BATHINDA Ahead of the final examinations in March, chinks in the examination system of Punjab education department has come to the fore as question papers of the ongoing pre-final tests are appearing on the social media in advance. Officials said it was found that question papers and answer keys of almost all subjects for classes 6-12 of government institutes were landing daily on at least two Youtube channels. A student of a government school gets 10-20% marks in different subjects on the basis of an assessment of these examinations. Director general of education department Mohammad Tayyab confirmed on Wednesday that after getting complaints, due action is being taken. Punjab School Education Board (PSEB)’s controller of examination Janak Raj Mehrok said the top brass of the education department has given consent to lodge a police complaint. “These papers were set and sent to the schools by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT). PSEB deals only with final exams of the board classes. But it is a serious matter and the education department is initiating action to identify those behind it,” said Mehrok. Close monitoring of the said Youtube channels reveals that papers are uploaded 12-18 hours before the examination. One of the suspect channels was started on September 5, 2020, and it has 15.26 lakh viewers till Wednesday evening. As per the details mentioned on another Youtube channel, it has recorded 2.28 lakh views since its launch on February 16. Prima facie it seems to be a case where unknown persons are interested in monetising or earning money by inviting advertisers on the basis of views, says a department functionary. “There is no input that these preparatory question papers are being sold to students for money,” say sources. Classroom examination for class 6-12 started on February 15 till March 1. Uniform question papers for these classes are prepared centrally and dispatched to the school heads through email on the eve of the respective examination. School heads in various districts say the irregularities were detected even during the December tests but no action was initiated. “I was surprised to spot that most of the students attempted a couple of questions brilliantly which were not even discussed in the class. Later students admitted that they have easy access to all papers with answers on Youtube platforms,” said a biology teacher for class 12 at a government school. Another faculty member said the higher authorities were apprised of papers being ‘leaked’ on the social media platforms. “This is a mockery of the examination system and secrecy. Only school heads have access to the digital copy of these centrally prepared question papers. The authorities should revert to the conventional practice where questions are set by the schools independently,” said the head of another government senior secondary school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/youtube-channels-have-school-pre-final-question-papers-a-day-in-advance-101614195828425.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Nodeep Kaur case: Haryana Police accuse her of extortion, inciting violence before HC||The Haryana Police have accused labour activist Nodeep Kaur of extorting money from industrialists in Kondli area of Sonepat and inciting workers during a protest on January 12, in which seven cops were reportedly injured.In a status report submitted to the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday, the Haryana Police also denied that the woman activist was physically assaulted.The status report by Virender Singh, deputy superintendent of police (HQ), Sonepat, was submitted in response to suo motu plea initiated by the high court on February 12 on reports of illegal arrest of the labour activist. During interrogation she disclosed that she along with her associates Shiv Kumar and Sahil had formed the organization ‘Majdoor Adhikar Sangthan’ and they took brokerage from the labourers for providing them salary etc from the factory owners and extorted money from the owners, the police have claimed.Police say the first FIR was registered on December 28, in which there were allegations of extortion of money from the owner and gherao of his private industrial unit, in which Nodeep Kaur and Sahil are accused.On January 12 a unit in Kundli was gheraoed and staff manhandled by members of her group and here too complaint of extortion of money from the factory owner by activists under the garb of workers’ unpaid salaries were made, the report says adding that Nodeep Kaur was one of the agitators and she made a provocative speech during the protest saying that if police come to spot they will attack and beat them. Police reached the spot and tried to mediate but agitators got violent, which resulted in seven police personnel, including one woman constable, getting injured, the police told the court citing medical reports. Police have also given some videos to court, in which Kaur is purportedly shown inciting agitators and cops being beaten up.‘Took brokerage from workers’The court was further told on the day she was arrested and in her interrogation, she took names of Shiv Kumar, Sumit and Sahil as co-conspirators who along with her, took brokerage from labourers for providing them salary. Two FIRs have been registered for the incident of violence reported on February 12.On the allegations of physical assault, the police say, she was medically examined the same day. Thereafter, she was presented before chief judicial magistrate to seek her judicial remand and before the CJM too she did not make any allegation of assault, the court was told, adding that she was straightway taken to judicial custody and did not remain in police custody even for a day.“..false allegations are being made through a few social media platforms that ..(She was) falsely implicated and arbitrarily detained by the police. Further allegations (are being) made regarding her physical harassment in police custody as well in judicial custody. All these claims and allegations are baseless and have been refuted by district police,” the report says.The high court bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan, which took up the matter on Wednesday has deferred hearing for Friday in view of Haryana’s additional advocate general, Deepak Sabharwal seeking time for production of her detailed medical reports.Medical reports points to injuries on another activistThe medical report prepared by Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, on the court’s directions have pointed towards injury marks on the body of another activist Shiv Kumar, who is also accused in these FIRs.The medical examination was ordered upon a plea from his father Rajbir Singh, who had demanded that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe the three FIRs in question and medically examine his son outside Sonepat.The report says all the injuries are over two weeks old and were caused by a blunt object or weapon. He was lodged in Sonepat jail on February 2. The report says he has suffered two grievous injuries in the right foot and the nails of his left thumb and index finger show bluish black discolouration with tenderness. It also says there is possibility of his left foot and right wrist being fractured. As of injuries in lower limbs they are simple in nature, says the report, which in all lists seven injuries, further stating on psychiatric evaluation, he was suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder-like symptoms and appeared sad and distressed with occasional crying spells.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nodeep-kaur-case-haryana-police-accuse-her-of-extortion-inciting-violence-before-hc-101614195768313.html

25-02-2021||Chandigarh||‘Morning wake-up call’ order leaves govt teachers sleepless||Ludhiana The heads of government schools, teachers and mentors are sleepless over a new task at hand — to give early morning wake-up calls to students, asking them to study. The idea is to motivate the students to study well and score better in the final exams, officials say.Senior education department officials will ensure that the teachers do the job diligently. For this, the district education department, Ludhiana, has forwarded state department’s nine-point proforma to the officials concerned who have to fill details such as name of the student called, class of the student, contact number of the student, the time of the phone call etc. The same proforma has also been sent to officials in SAS Nagar, SBS Nagar, Jalandhar and Kapurthala districts.The district education department has also sent an audio message to all the school heads, conveying that all teachers, principals, district and block mentors will make morning calls to students and will send the details through the Google form.The state education department move has irked the teachers and mentors. A lecturer of a government school, requesting anonymity, said, “I am teaching Class 12 and pre-board exams are going on. Most of time is consumed in conducting the exams and rest I spend evaluating answer-sheets. Once home, I have to interact with students online to clear their doubts.”A mentor, who wished not to be named, said, “We are visiting schools daily and clearing the concepts for the students. We are in touch with the students and conduct doubt-clearance sessions. It is not feasible to call them in the morning daily. This is an unnecessary task.” Ludhiana district education officer (secondary) Harjit Singh said, “As per the directions from the state education department, teachers, principals and district mentors will make wake-up calls to the students in the morning. The idea is to interact with the students and achieve Mission Shat Pratishat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/morning-wake-up-call-order-leaves-govt-teachers-sleepless-101614195348709.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||Stagger work hours at Mantralaya, says Maharashtra chief secretary||A day after chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray directed Maharashtra chief secretary to work out shifts for Mantralaya officers and employees, the chief secretary issued an order on Wednesday, asking all secretaries of departments to adopt staggered working hours to avoid crowding and to follow social distancing norms. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar stated in a letter that staggered working hours may be initiated by allowing employees to work on alternate days or three-day shifts or weekly shifts or staggered work hours. “In the wake of the growing number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city of Mumbai and the entire State. In order to facilitate the adherence to the norms of social distancing and to ensure avoidance of crowding, staggering may be initiated in the Mantralaya… The secretaries of the respective departments can decide on what form of staggering to adopt subject to maintaining all social distancing and other Covid-19 related protocols and also at the same time ensuring that work is not affected,” wrote Kumar in his letter. He also wrote that if the secretaries feel full attendance can be maintained without observing staggered work hours but while following all Covid-19 protocols, they can do so. Employee unions and former bureaucrats have welcomed the move to have flexible working hours. Former Maharashtra chief secretary Jayant Kumar Banthia said that the idea of staggered work hours was discussed for south Mumbai earlier, but did not materialise. He said, “I am happy that this has come from the very top and the Covid-19 situation has a role to play. Not just for Mantralaya but staggered work hours should be done for all offices in south Mumbai to prevent everybody from going to one geography at one time.” Banthia said that the options given by the current chief secretary are workable. “The mindset of the people needs to change on working hours. There could be challenges in having staggered hours, such as managing timings with ministers and secretaries. Ministers and secretaries also have to adjust to this. Even in staggering, there could be a few overlapping hours a day where all the staff is available for work,” said the 1977-batch officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Banthia was the chief secretary between May 2012 and November 2013.GD Kulthe, chief advisor of Maharashtra State Gazetted Officers Federation, said, “We are deliberating on these options and we are positive about it. It is possible to work out shifts on one of these options given. A decision is expected in a couple of days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stagger-work-hours-at-mantralaya-says-maharashtra-chief-secretary-101614195288468.html
25-02-2021||Admission||DU likely to adopt combination of entrance test score and class 12 marks for admissions from this year||With the Central government likely to hold a common entrance test for admissions to undergraduate courses at all the central universities, starting this upcoming session, officials at Delhi University (DU) said they are ready to adopt it immediately in combination with the class 12 score of aspirants.The other two central universities in Delhi, the Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia, are yet to take a call regarding any change in their admission process.Last December, the Union ministry of education constituted a seven-member committee to recommend modalities for the Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) for admission to undergraduate courses across central universities in accordance with the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. The same month, higher education secretary Amit Khare also said a common entrance test for admission to all central universities will be implemented in 2021.DU vice-chancellor (acting) PC Joshi, who is also a member of the committee, said, “The modalities of CUCET will soon be finalised and it’s highly likely that it will be implemented from the upcoming academic session itself. DU is also ready to adopt it from this year onwards. We have already sent our proposal to the UGC (University Grants Commission) stating that we want a combination of CUCET and class 12 scores of students for admission to undergraduate courses,” he said.Joshi said the CUCET will be conducted online and will have two components -- an aptitude test and a subject-specific test. “DU won’t have a major issue in implementing CUCET. The National Testing Agency (NTA), which will conduct the test, has already been holding entrance exams for some of the undergraduate courses in DU over the past few years. Besides, we are planning to combine the CUCET score with the class 12 marks of students because we cannot make the Boards (CBSE, state board etc) redundant. We are yet to decide the weightage of these two components,” he said.DU currently follows the merit-based admission process for admission to all undergraduate programmes excluding nine courses for which NTA conducts entrance exams every year.“We are waiting for a nod from the education ministry before making a formal announcement,” Joshi said.In Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), officials said CUCET won’t make much of a difference since the university offers only 10 undergraduate courses in foreign languages. JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said, “The NTA is already conducting entrance exams for admission to these courses. So, it won’t be a major issue for JNU to adopt it. However, we are yet to finalise anything in this regard.”Jamia Millia Islamia registrar Nazim Hussain Jafri said the university is working on the modalities. “It’s going to be mandatory for all central universities and we will also adopt it. But we are yet to finalise our proposal. It will only be sent to the ministry after consulting our academic and executive councils. The education ministry is also conducting a conference this weekend to guide universities about CUCET,” he said.Presently, Jamia conducts its own entrance tests and interviews for admission to all courses.Meanwhile, some members of DU’s statutory bodies, the academic council (AC) and the executive council (EC), also said the varsity should have consulted them before taking any decision regarding admissions.“As per the university norms, the administration cannot send any proposal to the UGC or the ministry without consulting the statutory bodies. That is completely illegal. If the university continues to give weightage to class 12 marks, that won’t serve the purpose. The long process of document verification will still be there,” said Naveen Gaur, DU academic council member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/du-ready-to-consider-combination-of-test-class-12-marks-for-ug-slots-101614195033127.html

25-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt schools to assess students up to class 8 on the basis of worksheets this year||The Delhi government on Wednesday directed all its schools to assess students enrolled from nursery to class 8 on the basis of assignments and worksheets sent to them in both online and offline modes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Irrespective of their assessment, the students enrolled up to class 8 will be promoted to the next class, in accordance with a no-detention policy.The directorate of education (DoE), however, has not issued any guidelines for the city’s private schools. “Private schools will follow their own criteria to assess the learning levels among students up to class 8,” said a senior government official, not wishing to be named.With schools remaining closed for these classes since last March and classes being held online, government schools -- where a majority of students do not have access to smart devices and the internet -- are dependent on worksheets or assignments. These worksheets contain both notes and questions. Students can either access them on their class’s WhatsApp group, or parents can pick up hard copies from schools.In a notification issued on Wednesday, the DoE said, “Since no classroom teaching-learning has taken place at the primary and middle-school level, the formal mode of pen and paper assessment is replaced by assessment based on subject wise assignments/projects in all government and government-aided schools.”“All currently enrolled students from nursery to class 8 shall be promoted to the next class in the academic session 2021-22. However, the purpose of the assessment is to understand the impact of alternate learning approaches that needed to be adopted under the prevailing circumstances this year. Further, the data of this assessment will also help the DoE in determining the course content and learning strategies for the next session,” the DoE notification said.Under the no-detention policy, no student can be failed up to class 8.As per the DoE notification, students from nursery to class 2 will be assessed on the basis of the assignments they were given during the winter break and the responses to online or offline worksheets shared with them during the pandemic.Similarly, the assessment of students enrolled in classes 3 to 8 will be done on the basis of assignments and worksheets submitted by them during the pandemic and winter break. Also, another round of worksheets/assignments will be sent to these students between March 1 and March 15. In case students have no digital devices, assignments/projects to such students will be allotted in hard copy by calling their parents to school,” the notification added.Several private schools said they will also assess students on the basis of internal assessments and will also be conducting online exams. Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh, said, “All students up to class 8 will be promoted to the next class in view of the no-detention policy. But we will assess their learning levels on the basis of their internal assessments and final exams that the school will conduct virtually.”Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, said, “The exams of students up to class 8 are currently on in the online mode. The school will also be assessing them on the basis of their internal exams and assignments. Everyone will be promoted to the next class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nodetention-policy-to-remain-in-delhi-govt-schools-101614194575643.html

Last Thursday, Chahal had directed BMC to tighten containment zones by sealing buildings with more than five cases of Covid-19. He also directed BMC to crack down on those who do not wear mask and/ or violate home quarantine rules if they are high-risk contacts of Covid-positive patients. Chahal said the number of clean up marshals should be doubled from 2,400 to 4,800, and the target for the number of people fined daily for not wearing face masks was raised from 12,500 to 25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-1-167-mumbai-sees-second-highest-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-101614194928910.html

BJP corporator Manohar Dumbre claimed that elected representatives have not been given permission by the state government to get vaccinated yet and the immunisation process has only been granted for healthcare and frontline workers across the state. However, Mhaske said, “We have followed proper procedure before getting vaccinated. All corporators and political leaders have been on the field even when the pandemic was at the peak. We shall continue to do so and help the citizens, and to do that, it is important that we be considered as frontline workers and get immunised. Moreover, we have done this after releasing a notice to all corporators within the civic body a month ago; many have registered on the CoWIN app. We have followed all protocols and taken the jab. We also want more frontline workers to come forward and get immunised. Through us, there will be more awareness in the society about the vaccination.” Dumbre said, “In the history of this city, there would not have been a mayor like Mhaske who has broken all rules and gotten himself and others from his party vaccinated by abusing his power. He not only got himself vaccinated but also conducted a photo session afterwards.” Thane civic officials were unavailable for comment on the issue and to explain the protocol related to vaccination. Mhaske said, “Dumbre was also one of those who got themselves registered for the vaccine. Despite registering, why is he pointing fingers at us who have gone through the same process to get immunised?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-bjp-raises-objections-as-mayor-gets-covid-vaccine-101614194688591.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Sardool Sikander (1961-2021): ‘Roadways Di Laari’ comes to a grinding halt||Noted Punjabi singer and actor Sardool Sikander died on Wednesday at a Mohali hospital where was undergoing treatment for Covid-19. He was 60.Sikander, who had undergone a renal transplant in 2016, passed away at 11.55 am, sources at Fortis Hospital said. In a statement, the hospital later said Sikander was admitted on January 19 in “a very serious condition with complaints of low oxygen levels”.“Mr Sikander, who was diabetic, was recently treated for Covid-19. He had undergone renal transplant in 2016 and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 2003,” the statement said.“In spite of the best efforts of doctors and other caregivers at Fortis Mohali, his condition improved only marginally over the next 3-4 weeks. Due to his severely compromised state of health, his condition deteriorated again and had to be put on life support. Unfortunately, the patient breathed his last with his family at the bedside,” it further said.Sikander, regarded an icon in the Punjabi music industry, is survived by his singer-wife Amar Noorie, and music composer sons Sarang and Alaap Sikander. The untimely death of the singer led to condolences from various quarters, including fellow musicians, actors and politicians. The Punjab cabinet also condoled Sikander’s demise, with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh announcing that his government will clear the singer’s hospital dues of ₹10 lakh. Amarinder announced the decision after cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi informed him that the deceased’s family had no money to pay the bills, a Punjab government statement said.In a condolence resolution, the cabinet noted that with the demise of the legendary singer, the nation had lost one of its best-known Punjabi singers and the void left behind by him will be impossible to fill.Earlier, Amarinder took to Twitter and described him as a legendary singer and said he was “extremely saddened”.“He was recently diagnosed with #Covid19 and was undergoing treatment for the same. The world of Punjabi music is poorer today. My heartfelt condolences to his family and fans,” he said on Twitter. Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal also expressed his shock. “Saddened to learn about the demise of legendary Punjabi playback singer Sardool Sikander. A huge loss to Punjabi movie & music industry. Prayers for his family, friends & fans. May his soul rest in peace!” Sukhbir said in a tweet.Sikander, who acted in several Punjabi films, including “Jagga Daku”, initially came into the limelight with appearances on radio and TV during the early 1980s.His album ‘Roadways di Laari’ was an instant hit.Born at Kheri Naudh Singh in Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, Sikander belonged to the Patiala Gharana of music and his album “Husna de Malko” in 1991 sold over five million copies.He had several hit songs to his credit. These included “Sanu ishq brandi char gayi” and “Ek charkha gali de wich dha laya”. He also sang the track “Mari Koyal Ne Aisi Cook” in the 2003 Bollywood film “The Hero: Love Story of a Spy”.Punjabi singer Gurdas Maan remembered the singer as a melodious voice, life of the party and a friend like no other.Bollywood actor Ayushmann Khurrana shared Mann’s post on his Instagram story and wrote “Rest in Peace Sardool sahab.” Singer-composer Daler Mehendi said Sikander’s death was a “big loss to our family and music industry”.Actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh called the late singer the “pride of Punjabi music”.According to Bollywood music composer Vishal Dadlani, Sikander’s loss is “far too personal”. “A true pioneer, he was the soul of humility & a wellspring of music. My condolences to the family, esp. to my brothers @AlaapSikander & @SarangSikander1,” Dadlani said.Actor-comedian Kapil Sharma said Sikander had such a powerful voice that even a layman would sound melodious while singing his songs. Sharma said he was fortunate that Sikander visited his residence on the occasion of his daughter’s first Lohri. “All of us were happy, but we didn’t know it would be our last meeting. You’ll be missed a lot paaji. May God keep you close,” he added.List rites to be performed todayThe mortal remains of the Punjab singer were brought to his house in Bulepur as people from all walks of life, especially from the world of music and Punjabi cinema, kept converging at the house to pay their last respects. Sardool Sikander last rites will be performed at his native village in Kheri Naudh Singh in district Fatehgarh sahib on Thursday afternoon.Prominent among those who visited the house were singer and politician Mohd Sadique, Master Saleem, Daljit Kaur and Lehmber Hussainpuri.The family had recently shifted to a new house at Bulepur Road in Khanna.The couple, Sikander and his wife Amar Noori were last spotted together while attending a wedding in Khanna a few months ago. On January 30, the couple had celebrated their 28th wedding anniversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sardool-sikander-1961-2021-roadways-di-laari-comes-to-a-grinding-halt-101614194628380.html

25-02-2021||Delhi||What women want: A safe retail experience while purchasing alcohol in Delhi||When Sanchi Sharma left her home to pick up some alcohol in outer Delhi’s Rohini last month, she could not have imagined the nightmare that was to follow. A 26-year old public relations professional, Sharma was hosting a house party in the front garden of her ground-floor home later that evening, and needed to make a quick beer run.The local government liquor shop was about three kilometres away, and she asked a friend to accompany her in the car because the store was located in a dingy, unlit lane, and daylight was fading. When they reached the Sector 10 store, they parked a little distance away and walked to the store, but found it packed with only men.“Despite the fact that the queue was very long and only had men, the shopkeeper saw us approaching and was kind enough to give our order first, out of turn,” she said.But as soon as they left the shop, two men left the queue and started following them on foot. “Scared, my friend pretended to be on a call with one of our male friends and kept talking, indicating that we are with some male friends who are waiting for us. Only after that did the men stop following us. We then ran towards our car and zoomed out of the area,” Sharma said.Across Delhi, women say they feel unsafe and uncomfortable while trying to purchase alcohol from vends located in grimy neighbourhoods packed with louts and drunk men. In many of these stores, groups of men jostle in front of window grilles, trying to shove each other out of the way to grab a bottle, making it difficult for women customers. In addition, pervasive stigma around women drinking alcohol and judgment from store staff strip any dignity from the experience of purchasing liquor.“The areas around liquor shops need to be more inclusive. At present, a usual Delhi liquor vend is invariably crowded where people have to push their way through a large group of men. I do not know why most of these shops are allotted in dingy deserted corners and in obscure locations, whereas it should be just the opposite. Liquor shops should be in well-lit market areas where there are several other economic and leisure activities happening,” said Kalpana Viswanath, co-founder and CEO of Safetipin, an enterprise using data and technology to help make cities saferA study done in 2019 by research firms Kantar and NFX digital found many of Delhi’s liquor shops were in a run-down condition and attracted an overwhelmingly male clientele. In addition, many shops were inaccessible by car, or had groups of men who shouted, jeered or laughed at women, making it tough for female customers to buy liquor in a safe and dignified way. “Women feel uncomfortable and unsafe purchasing alcohol from such outlets,” the study concluded.Garima Sud, a Jangpura-based blogger, agreed. The 33-year-old said she faced a dilemma of “morality” each time she stepped into the local liquor store. She first went to the store five years ago but even now, she had to remind herself that she was doing nothing wrong.“The whole environment near a liquor shop is so masculine that women start doubting if they have come to a place they aren’t supposed to be in….a female customer has exactly the same right to go to a liquor shop and buy items of her choice as her male counterpart in India. But, this dilemma that we are quietly made to confront is a violation of our right to freedom and free movement,” she said.Sud felt the discomfort was a product of the taboo surrounding women drinking alcohol, and a creation of social, cultural and government influences that required broad efforts to change. She pointed to photos and videos from May 4, 2020 when the government allowed liquor shops to open: Snaking queues of almost exclusively male customers lined up outside.Experts said the situation was similar at a majority of Delhi’s 720 liquor vends, of which 460 are government-run.For a while in between, however, things had become better. Beer and wine, if not hard liquor, was available at local grocery shops that could obtain special L- 12 or 12F licences,and could be bought along with your weekly household edibles, making it a comfortable and dignified purchase.But the administration’s 2019 decision to stop department stores from stocking beer and wine -- the government said many stores were violating licence norms -- particularly hurt women customers who are forced to go to shabby shops.Official data shows that at least 18 assembly constituencies have less than five vends, increasing crowding and making it especially tough for women to access quality liquor in a safe manner.Ankita Kumar, who works with an event management company and moved from Mumbai to Delhi two years ago, said a big drawback in Delhi was the absence of home delivery of liquor.“In Mumbai, alcohol is home-delivered and the delivery persons even bring POS machines along with them for payment through cards. One call and your order - be it one bottle or a bulk order - its delivered in 30 minutes maximum. But, in Delhi one always has to physically go to a shop and purchase alcohol,” said Kumar.According to Prince Singhal, founder of non-government organisation Community Against Drunken Driving (CADD), current trends indicate more women are drinking and unlike earlier, they are no longer dependent on male company to consume or procure liquor. “In Delhi, 40% of men and 20% of women (almost 1.5 million women) are alcohol consumers. The women’s alcohol market is expected to grow by 25% over the next five years. Also, weekend outings and mid-week celebration are enticing now due to discounts and offers,” he said.A survey by CADD in 2019 found 43.7% women between 18 and 30 consumed alcohol out of habit or desire to do so. The survey, which involved 5,000 female respondents in the city, also said 41.7% women between 31 and 45 consumed alcohol as an occupational requirement or because of social norms.The problem faced by women customers pushed Madhulika Bhattacharya Dhall to try and improve the alcohol purchasing experience. In 2015, she opened La Cave in south Delhi.“One of the primary reasons La Cave Delhi happened was because I always saw my friends either sending their driver or peon to buy liquor. They would never go to a liquor store because of the whole experience. Even a good bottle of wine is wrapped in a brown paper and lots of other layers, as if it is anything forbidden to buy. It’s the same thing we experienced with purchasing sanitary napkins until a few years ago,” Dhall said.“Nearly six years after opening La Cave, about 70% of my clientele is women,” she added.A dignified retail experience needn’t only be high-end, though. Dhall suggested even stand alone liquor shops could use better-lit interiors, train staff, and place merchandise in a way so that women customers don’t feel intimidated or uncomfortable.Liquor retailer Rohit Arora took a different approach. In 2015, he opened a separate section for women in his shop in east Delhi. “We have a woman salesperson to guide our customers. In that female-only section of our store, either only single women or couples are allowed. No male person is allowed to enter the space alone. The response has been pretty good,” he said.A Delhi government spokesperson said the issue of better retail experience for women was raised by a government-appointed expert committee. “The group of ministers formed to finalise the revised Delhi excise policy is closely examining all the suggestions that have come in. The Delhi government will ensure that retail experience of liquor is made more people friendly,” said the spokesperson.But the excise policy, reviewed by HT, doesn’t have any explicit provisions to improve the dignity of purchase, especially for women. It suggests increasing the number of vends, and better distributing them to avoid overcrowding. But, as experts point out, more focused efforts are needed to help Delhi’s women feel safe and comfortable while purchasing a drink.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/what-women-want-a-safe-retail-experience-101614194220928.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Mehraj rally: Delhi Police made no effort to arrest Lakha, says Punjab Police||Chandigarh A day after Republic Day violence fugitive and gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana addressed a gathering in Mehraj village of Bathinda and disappeared, Punjab Police claims that there is no official communication from the Delhi Police about his ‘wanted’ status. “Till date, the Bathinda police neither have any official (written or verbal) communication from the Delhi Police regarding Lakha being wanted in the Republic Day violence case nor that there is a reward of ₹1 lakh for information leading to his arrest. How could we arrest him at a rally attended by hundreds of his supporters,” a top Punjab Police functionary said. Another senior police officer, who was personally monitoring the situation, said Delhi Police also follows Punjab Police rules and there is Form 12 which, as a rule, is shared with the police of the state a wanted person belongs to or is hiding, but that didn’t happen in this case. Form 12 has information about the fugitive concerned, he said. “But no such communication has been made so far with the Bathinda police by any of the police stations of the national capital,” a senior police functionary privy with the developments said. Lakha, 45, belongs to Sidhana village of Rampura-Phull sub-division in Bathinda district. Another senior Punjab Police official added that Bathinda police had no information regarding the presence of Delhi Police officials in the district to nab Lakha and there was no question of Punjab Police could have detained or arrested him on their own. “To arrest a person wanted in other states, a set-procedure is followed where the team of the state police where the case is registered comes with the arrest warrants or the case files. Delhi Police team was not in Bathinda and no such effort was made on their part on Tuesday to nab Lakha,” the police functionary said. Notably, Lakha on February 21, had also posted a live video on Facebook announcing to address a rally in Mehraaj village of Bathinda. At the rally on Tuesday, Lakha dared the Delhi Police to arrest him and also warned chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to not let Punjab Police assist Delhi Police in nabbing those accused of R-Day violence. Punjab Police also clarified that since the case against Lakha has been registered in the national capital and the gangster-turned-activist is not wanted in any case in Punjab, only Delhi Police have to take initiative to arrest him. Other accused in the Republic Day violence case were arrested as per the due procedure, the officer said. The Punjab government, meanwhile, has raised doubts over the sincerity of the Delhi Police in nabbing Lakha. “As Mehraj rally was mainly organised by the Sikh radicals, delay in Lakha’s arrest could be part of the strategy to expose hardliners’ support to farmer agitations,” said a senior Congress MLA. As per intelligence officials, around 10,000 persons attended the rally that included Lakha’s aides in Rajasthan where he had been active as a gangster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mehraj-rally-delhi-police-made-no-effort-to-arrest-lakha-says-punjab-police-101614194449496.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Wives sent abroad for spouse visa disown Punjabi grooms back home||In the craze of settling abroad and earning in foreign currency, young Punjabi grooms are ending up being cheated and abandoned by their wives on whom they spent lakhs of rupees to send abroad on study visa, in the hope of getting a spouse visa later.Around 30 such men have now approached an NGO named ‘Abbnhi Welfare Society’ in the district, and also the police, to seek help in suspending passports of their wives. Some of them have managed to get FIRs registered against them.These men sponsored expensive education of their wives, who had scored the required band on The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and also had the profile to match their desired country’s specification. The men, or their families, also paid a hefty fee on procuring a study visa for the women. The men’s wait for a spouse visa, however, has stretched indefinitely. Their wives have not contacted them since leaving, in some cases for over a couple of years.Satwinder Kaur, who runs the NGO, said usually women approached them as victims and just a week ago, they have started helping grooms. “These grooms had spent between ₹17 lakh and ₹35 lakh on study, visa filing process and other expenditure for their wives. They have lost the money and the visa is unlikely,” she added.Harwinder Singh, 21, of Ferozepur, said, “I got married to a Ludhiana-based girl on January 15, 2018. I had spent at least ₹35 lakh on her admission in Canada and other expenditure. Later, she started fighting and arguing with me on minor issues. In July 2019, I heard that my wife is staying with another person in a live-in relationship in Brampton. I lodged a complaint against her and a case of cheating was registered at the Ghall Khurad police station on February 3, 2020.”Ghall Khurd police station SHO Judgepal Singu said: “The victim’s wife is living in Canada and we cannot take action against her here. But we have filed a chargesheet against her in the local court.”Jaswinder Singh, 27, of Barnala, said in his complaint, “When I did not find any government job here, despite being masters in political science and holding a B.Pharmacy degree, I decided to go to Canada. I married a Moga-based girl with 6.5 band in IELTS in 2019. I spent ₹18 lakh on sending her to Canada on a study visa. After reaching Montreal, she stopped contacting me. I have lodged a complaint against her with the district police.”Jaswinder said even before approaching the NGO, he met other victims so as to bring them on common platform to get justice. Kripa Shankar Saroj, additional chief secretary, NRI affairs, said, “In most incidents, women get cheated by their NRI husbands. There is no specific policy for grooms who have been cheated by their wives. All such grooms who have been cheated can contact the department or me. We will help them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wives-sent-abroad-for-spouse-visa-disown-punjabi-grooms-back-home-101614194328709.html
25-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt notifies modalities of doorstep delivery of ration, cardholders may opt in or out every fiscal||The Delhi government has notified the policy document that prescribes the modalities of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, meant for the 1.75 million ration cardholders in the national capital.According to the notification document, the scheme will be optional, and beneficiaries of the existing TPDS (targeted public distribution system) may choose to enroll for the scheme or continue under the existing TPDS. Those who are not opting for the scheme shall continue to get their ration as per the existing mechanism and price.“Beneficiaries will be able to exercise the option in the beginning of every financial year,” the document, notified on February 20, said.On January 25, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said the scheme will be operational by March.A senior government official, on condition of anonymity, said, “For the full implementation of the scheme, some more documents concerning modalities of processing charges, additional fee, etc., will have to be notified.”The scheme document elaborated the entire process and said foodgrains will be collected from the food corporation godowns by agencies empanelled by the government and sent to mills where wheat will be processed into flour and packed. Similarly, there will be units for cleaning and packing of rice as well. The packets will be delivered to fair price shops and from there, they will be further delivered to residences of beneficiaries who opt for the scheme.The beneficiaries will have to register the receipt of the ration with their fingerprints on the biometric-based electronic point-of-sale (e-POS) machines, which the agencies entrusted with doorstep delivery will carry. The entire operation -- from the godown to the doorstep --- will be monitored via CCTV cameras, GPS-fitted vehicles, e-POS logs, etc, said the document.Delhi has 1.75 million ration cardholders, which translates to 7.16 million beneficiaries. Of the total ration cardholders, 1.51 million are covered under the priority household category of the National Food Security Act, 2013, while 0.17 million are covered under the priority state household category, and the remaining 0.07 million come under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, show government records.While those under the first two categories are entitled to 5 kilos of foodgrain a month, those under the third category are entitled to 25 kilos of wheat, 10 kilos of rice and a kilo of sugar every month. These items are distributed to them through 2,010 fair price shops that are currently functional across the city.The doorstep ration scheme was cleared by the Delhi cabinet in March 2018 but could not be rolled out because of legal and administrative issues. In July 2020, the cabinet gave fresh approval to the project.Shailendra Kumar, president of Delhi public distribution system welfare association, said, “In other states, provision for doorstep delivery is limited to elderly beneficiaries, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. The Delhi model will force fair price shops out of business and that will lead to unemployment. The government should be more considerate in this regard.”Saurabh Garg, secretary of the Delhi-based Sarkari Ration Dealer Sangh, echoed similar concerns: “By binding a beneficiary for one full financial year, it also deprives the person of the option to discontinue after a few months. What if beneficiaries have to go to villages and collect the ration there under the central government’s one nation one ration card policy?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-notifies-rules-for-doorstep-ration-delivery-101614193876369.html

This was not opposed by senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for Waqf Board.The court sought the response of the Centre, Delhi government and the city police after the petitioner said it had given a representation to the authorities on February 16 but no action was taken on it yet.The matter would be now heard on March 5.On March 31, the Delhi Police lodged an FIR against several persons, including the cleric and foreign delegates, on a complaint by station house officer of Nizamuddin police station for holding a congregation of Tablighi Jamaat followers in alleged violation of social distancing norms put in place to contain the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/markaz-may-now-reopen-delhi-govt-informs-high-court-101614193224239.html

25-02-2021||Delhi||Man shoots himself dead at Defence Colony home||An 81-year-old man allegedly shot himself dead with his licensed pistol at his home in south Delhi’s Defence Colony on Wednesday morning, the police said. The octogenarian, a former diplomat, left behind a one-page note in which he expressed his unhappiness over age-related health issues and wrote that he did not want to live, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the police received a call at 7.25am that a person had shot himself at his house in Defence Colony and needed an ambulance. A police team immediately reached the house and rushed the injured man to a nearby hospital, where he died during treatment.“The elderly man had some health issues for which he underwent treatment at a private hospital for nearly a month. He returned home after being discharged from the hospital on Tuesday evening. He left behind a suicide note,” said DCP Thakur.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, 2,526 people killed themselves in Delhi in 2019 and of them, 825 ended their lives because of family problems. A total of 130 suicides were due to mental health issues, critical and prolonged illness, etc.“Loneliness, health issues, lack of support system and financial crisis are some major reasons behind suicides. Instead of talking about these reasons, we should focus on the need for a support system comprising family members, friends, relatives, neighbours, residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), and others.

25-02-2021||Delhi||Travellers from 5 states may need Covid -ve reports to enter Delhi from Saturday||People arriving in Delhi from five states that have reported a surge in daily Covid-19 infections may be asked to provide a negative RT-PCR test reports from Saturday, senior government officials privy to developments said.The issue was taken up in a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting on Monday in the wake of steady rise in cases in Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Chhattisgarh, and greater curbs and checks were discussed, the people cited above added.An official order, however, was not issued till Wednesday night.“Any passenger arriving in Delhi via private or state-run buses, flights or trains may have to show a negative RT-PCR test report on their arrival in the Capital. The test report will have to be conducted not before 72 hours from the time of the person’s arrival in Delhi,” a government official said, asking not to named.It was discussed that the directions may come into force “after midnight on February 26 and stay in operation till March 15”, the official added.Airport and railway officials on Wednesday said they were yet to be informed about any such rule.Like all the Covid-19 hit states, Delhi too had travel restrictions in place. While domestic flight operations resumed in Delhi from May 25 after the nation-wide lockdown was announced on March 25, the Delhi government resumed its inter-state bus operations as late as November 3, 2020. For international flights, all passengers from the UK, Brazil, South Africa, all European countries and the Middle East arriving at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport compulsorily have to undergo an RT-PCR test. However, they need not mandatorily undergo institutional quarantine. As per the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) given by the ministry of health and family welfare dated February 17, passengers from these high-risk countries can get their tests done at the airport before proceeding for home quarantine. Transit passengers will, however, have to wait for six hours until their reports are out.Meanwhile, some of these affected states have themselves announced restrictions that amount to at least a partial lockdown in an attempt to curb the surge, even as the Centre rushes teams there to deal with a sudden spike in infections.The lockdowns and the restrictions of travellers hark back to the first half of 2020 when most states put stringent measures in place amid the first Covid wave. With cases beginning to decline from October, most states relaxed these. Now, with a second wave threatening to break out, many are reimposing them.On Monday, the Maharashtra government announced a complete lockdown in Amravati district and restrictions on assembly of people in Akola, Washim, Buldhana and Yavatmal districts. Earlier this week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has imposed restrictions on marriages, public functions and gathering at public places across Mumbai.Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand have made negative RT-PCR tests mandatory for travellers from Maharashtra. Maharashtra, meanwhile, requires travellers from Gujarat, Delhi-NCR, Goa, Rajasthan and Kerala to show negative RT-PCR tests.Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said the city administration must regulate or closely check passengers coming from states where Covid-19 cases are on the rise again.“It is especially important now because of the multiple new variants of the virus that are now emerging. Most of the new strains spread rapidly even as they may not be as severe in terms of the infection caused to the body. But some form of regulation of incoming passengers is required. On Wednesday itself, Delhi’s active cases spiked by at least 80, which could well be the start of a new gradual spike if precautions are not taken in time,” he said.A Delhi government spokesperson said the decision was taken by the DDMA and an order not he same is awaited by the authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/travellers-from-5-states-may-need-covid-ve-reports-to-enter-delhi-from-saturday-101614192666220.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||A decade on, Bombay HC grants ₹6.32 lakh compensation to family of custodial torture victim||A decade after an 18-year-old from Hingoli district died due to police brutality, Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to pay a compensation of ₹6.32 lakh to the wife and parents of the deceased.The bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar held that the deceased, Begya Pawar, died due to injuries sustained by him while in custody of Risod police in Washim district, and therefore his family was entitled to compensation.The bench took ₹4,000 as notional monthly income of the deceased and accordingly fixed the amount of compensation that his family was entitled to at ₹6.32 lakh. The bench has directed the state government to deposit the amount with the court in six months with liberty to the government to recover the amount from the erring police personnel after fixing their liability.On May 9, 2011, a team of eight police personnel led by inspector Madhav Dhande attached to Risod police station had picked up the deceased from his house and also apprehended Raju Pawar from his field. They were apprehended on the suspicion of preparing for a dacoity.Next morning, Pawar was found dead in police custody. The post-mortem report exposed brutal police torture, revealing that the deceased had sustained 44 injuries, including several fractures. It further stated that he died due to shock and haemorrhage owing to multiple contusions and multiple fractures.Following a complaint lodged by the father of the decreased, a case was registered against nine policemen. The then deputy superintendent of police investigated the case and came to a conclusion that Pawar died due to police brutalities.In this backdrop, wife and parents of the deceased had moved HC seeking compensation of ₹25 lakh for loss of their dear one.On Tuesday, HC partially allowed their petition and held that they were entitled to compensation if ₹6.32 lakh.“The factual matrix clearly indicates that the action of respondents No. 5 to 13 was in clear violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which provides that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty without due process of law” said HC. The bench added that in the case at hand, Pawar was arrested in blatant violation of Constitutional provisions. “Therefore, his fundamental right to life and personal liberty was taken away without due process of law. The subsequent event shows that B summary was filed (to close the dacoity case against the deceased) and it was sanctioned by the magistrate having jurisdiction. This clearly shows that the petitioners are entitled to compensation,” the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/a-decade-on-bombay-hc-grants-6-32-lakh-compensation-to-family-of-custodial-torture-victim-101614192889612.html

25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to begin road repairs in March||Even though the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) is ready to start the repair works of city roads, the bumpy ride is unlikely to get better this financial year. With the rise in temperature, the civic body will start the recarpeting of roads in the first week of March and might take at least three months before completing the work pending for the last two years.While MC is yet to even take up the road works for this year (2020-2021), it will attempt to complete the pending recarpeting for the previous year (2019-2020) when it starts the work next month. Dedicated funds released by the UT administration for the purpose are still to be fully utilised by the MC.MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said, “We will start the road recarpeting and repair works from the first week of March.”The MC engineering department has prepared a list of roads, which are to be carpeted, but is yet to sort them priority-wise. “The MC engineering department, along with contractors, are finalising the sector-wise priority plan. Contracts have already been given, and the work will be started as per this plan,” the chief engineer said.Residents rue bumpy ridesFor more than two years now, the condition of roads under the MC jurisdiction has been consistently deteriorating. While residents continued to suffer because of the poor road quality, civic body officials resorted to blame game, be it fund crunch, Covid-19 lockdown, or adverse season.Jagpal Singh, Sector-35 RWA president and FOSWAC adviser, said, “It has been nearly eight years since the roads in the entire sector were recarpeted. They started the work last year on two roads here, but stopped it abruptly. It was mostly just a patchwork. Then the quality was so poor that the roads have started deteriorating.”SK Khosla, general secretary, welfare association, MIG-I houses, Sector 40, said, “The condition of roads in our sector is one of the worst in the city. Most of the roads are in bad shape. Even those which were recarpeted only a few months back, like the V-5 road, are again in the need of repair.”Residents also wonder why MC is slow in starting the road repair works. “Even though weather has become conducive, the civic body is still sitting idle. MC officials say that condition of all city roads would be improved by June this year, but with this pace it is unlikely to happen,” Khosla added.Uncertainty over funds in coming financial yearIn the coming financial year too, problems with road maintenance similar to those in the past few years, are likely to be experienced.Even though the civic body has planned road works worth around ₹80 crore for financial year 2021-2022, it is not clear as to how it would fund these works. MC will start the financial year with a deficit of ₹670 crore with not enough funds to even meet its routine expenses like salaries. The revenue expenditure for the coming financial year at ₹1,197 crore is more than the total funds ( ₹971 crore), which the MC estimates to get.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-to-begin-road-repairs-in-march-101614192768264.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Two private hospitals roped in for next vaccination phase in Chandigarh||Two private hospitals in Chandigarh have been roped in to administer the Covid-19 vaccine in the next phase that kicks off on March 1.“Healing Hospital in Sector 34 and Landmark Hospital in Sector 33 have been named in the list of private centres shared by the central government with us on Wednesday evening. We will contact the two hospitals on Thursday,” said UT health director Dr Amandeep Kang.The Centre on Wednesday announced the second phase of vaccination for people above the age of 60 and those aged above 45 and having comorbidities. They can get the vaccine shot at both government and private institutes.The first phase, which kicked off on January 16, covered health and other frontline workers, who were vaccinated only at government hospitals in Chandigarh. However, in neighbouring cities of Mohali and Panchkula, private hospitals had also been roped in.While the vaccine will continue to be free at government hospitals, private ones will charge an amount that will be announced by the health ministry. Meanwhile, the UT health department is preparing to increase the city’s inoculation capacity, even though further guidelines regarding registration of beneficiaries and other modalities are awaited. The present daily capacity stands at around 7,000 at six government health institutes. “We have been told that the government is working on the online portal for the next phase. We are awaiting detailed directions,” said Dr Kang. “More vaccination sites will be set up at health and wellness centres. Community centres might also be put to use. We are in the process of identifying such places, but more than the capacity, it is the response of residents that matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-private-hospitals-roped-in-for-next-vaccination-phase-in-chandigarh-101614192708183.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||Sitaram Kunte, Praveen Pardeshi top contenders for the post of Maharashtra chief secretary||Additional chief secretary (home) Sitaram Kunte and Praveen Pardeshi are believed to be the top contender for the post of chief secretary (CS) of the state government, after the retirement of the incumbent Sanjay Kumar on February 28.Kunte was in the zone of consideration when Sanjay Kumar was appointed as CS in June last year.Kunte was believed to be the top contender for the post after his batchmate Praveen Pardeshi, took up responsibility as a global program coordinator at the United Nations Institute of Training and Research (UNITR) in Geneva, Switzerland in August last year. However, Pardeshi joined the state services recently. This would lead to the close fight between both the 1985 batch of the Indian Administration Service (IAS) officers.If appointed as chief secretary, Kunte or Pardeshi will get nine months in office before retirement on November 30, 2021.“Contrary to the precedent which has been established over the last few years, the incumbent CS will not be given an extension. He has not asked for an extension and did not move into the official bungalow of the CS opposite Mantralaya after taking charge. Kumar is vying for the post of chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, which fell vacant due to the retirement of Anand Kulkarni,” said an official from Mantralaya.A senior official from the chief minister’s office said that one of the ruling parties is in favour of appointment of Pardeshi as the next CS. Pardeshi was allegedly unhappy after he was shunted from his post as Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner in May last year. He opted for the international deputation within months of his transfer. The change in the senior state administrative posts is also expected to lead to a reshuffle of bureaucrats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sitaram-kunte-praveen-pardeshi-top-contenders-for-the-post-of-maharashtra-chief-secretary-101614192653438.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||MC to take over waste collection across Chandigarh on March 1||The Chandigarh municipal corporation will start door-to-door collection of segregated waste across the city from March 1.The decision came on Wednesday after cart-based garbage collectors started signing the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the civic body. Now, the corporation expects to get their greater participation in manning its twin-bin vehicles.“We will be starting garbage collection through MC vehicles in southern sectors from Monday (March 1). The MoU will be signed by all door-to-door waste collectors by the end of this week,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav. The project was launched in the northern part of the city on December 23 last year, with the MC deploying its 93 vehicles in Sectors 1 to 30. It had also deployed 99 vehicles for villages and some commercial areas of the city.The MC General House on February 15 approved modified terms of the MoU, days after the Door to Door Garbage Collector Society gave its consent to sign it. Most demands of the collectors, including sharing of user charges, life insurance, welfare fund and disbursal of income generated through sale of usable dry waste among them, have been incorporated in it.More manpower to address teething problemsEarlier, of 1,342 garbage collectors in the city, only 609 had enrolled with the MC and just 147 started working on its vehicles as helpers and drivers when the drive was launched. Not getting adequate number of collectors, the MC had to depute its outsourced sanitation workers as drivers. It also failed to pick garbage from the doorsteps as collectors remained non-cooperative.Residents also complain that vehicles don’t come at a fixed time and even skip their beat on some days. There are also cases of both the garbage collectors and MC vehicles coming to collect garbage, resulting in confusion among residents.“With more manpower to assist the MC, most of these issues would be resolved in the coming days. Timings of the vehicles would also be fixed in consultation with resident welfare associations. A toll-free phone number will be provided for residents to register their complaints,” said an MC official, privy to the development.The civic body will also start adding user charges to the water bill in the areas where it starts garbage collection. It has already declared that instead of garbage lifters, it would be collecting user charges in Sectors 1 to 30. Residents who fail to segregate dry and wet waste at source will also be fined. The rates and penalties have already been notified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mc-to-take-over-waste-collection-across-chandigarh-on-march-1-101614192651750.html

The grand old party has also been accusing the Jai Ram government of mishandling the Covid situation in the state, post the imposition of the countrywide lockdown. “The state’s financial health is in doldrums. Its debt burden has crossed over ₹61, 0000 crore, and the current government has borrowed ₹12,000 crore from the Reserve Bank over the last three years to pay the salaries of its employees and carry out development works. But it is still harping on the support from the Union government,” said leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri. The Congress is also likely to raise the issue of farm bills passed by the Centre. “The farmers’ issue is not just confined to the Centre; it is also a state subject as it affects the rural economy and Himachal largely runs on agriculture and horticulture. So, we will raise the issue in the Vidhan Sabha,” said senior Congress leader and five-time legislator from Shillai, Harshwardhan Chauhan.BJP to counter Cong attack with its recent victory in panchayat pollsThe saffron party is likely to cite the outcome of the recently concluded panchayat polls to counter the Congress attack. The BJP had claimed landslide victories in elections to block samitis, panchayats and zila parishads. BJP had formed zila parshads in all districts barring Kullu and Shimla, where Congress wrested the top slots of Zila parishad chairperson and vice-chairman’s posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-gears-up-to-corner-jai-ram-govt-in-hp-budget-session-101614192650224.html
25-02-2021||Delhi||Max temperature in Delhi touches 32.5°C — highest in 15 years||Delhi on Wednesday recorded the highest maximum temperature for the month of February since 2006, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 32.5 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was 12 degrees Celsius, a notch above what is considered normal for this time of the year.Before this, in 2018 and 2017, the day time temperatures had crossed the 32 degrees Celsius mark. On February 23, 2018, the maximum temperature was 32 degrees Celsius, while on February 21, 2017, the maximum temperature had touched 32.4 degrees Celsius.According to IMD, this was the warmest February day in at least the last 15 years, when the city had recorded day temperature of 34.1 degrees Celsius.IMD scientists warned that the temperature was likely to soar further in the coming days. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that there is a possibility that the maximum temperature could touch 33-34 degrees Celsius in the next two days.“The temperatures are already hovering in the 31-32 degrees Celsius range, there is definitely a chance that the mercury could rise by a few points and reach 33-34 degrees Celsius. Whether it will break the 2006 record remains to be seen,” Srivastava said.He also explained that February this year has been recording higher than normal temperatures throughout and this was primarily because of fewer active western disturbances and clear skies; that has led to sunlight hitting the surface uninterrupted.“Generally, in the month of February we get around six active western disturbances. But this year, Delhi last saw an active western disturbance was on February 4. This prolonged spell without a western disturbance has led to clear skies, causing heating of the ground,” Srivastava said.Meanwhile, the air quality remained in the ‘poor’ zone on Wednesday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 278. On Tuesday, the average AQI was 250, also in the ‘poor’ category.IMD forecast said that there is a possibility of improvement in air quality from February 26, when the AQI is likely to come down to the ‘moderate’ range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/max-temperature-in-delhi-touches-32-5-c-highest-in-15-years-101614192300955.html

With some rain likely on Friday, respite might be in the offing at the weekend.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), which had data dating back till 2009 readily available, the previous highest temperature in February was 29.6°C, recorded in 2009 and 2016. The all-time record was set way back in 1954, when maximum temperature reached 32.8°C on February 20.In fact, at the observatory located at the Chandigarh airport, maximum temperature stood at 32.8°C on Wednesday, equal to the all-time record. However, IMD considers readings taken at its observatory in Sector 39 for the weather bulletin and forecast.“The temperature has gone higher than normal owing to weak western disturbances (WDs) in the region this year,” said Surender Paul, director, IMD, Chandigarh. “Whatever WDs have come have been more active in the hilly reaches of Himachal Pradesh and brought snowfall there, but led to only partly cloudy weather here.”Paul said amid intense sunlight and clear skies, maximum temperature can go as high as 32°C. “However, it is too early to say whether the coming months, and for that matter this summer, will also record higher than normal temperatures,” he said.Meanwhile, light rain up to 10mm is expected due to WDs on Friday. It is likely to bring back maximum temperature to 20s by Saturday.While maximum temperature went up from 28.9°C on Tuesday to 31.1°C on Wednesday, minimum temperature went down from 13.3°C to 11.6°C owing to clear skies. In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain between 29 and 32 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 12 and 14 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mercury-touches-31-c-in-chandigarh-101614192288100.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray under pressure to act against Maharashtra minister||A day after Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Rathod, who is mired in controversy surrounding the death of a 22-year-old woman, emerged in public view after a fortnight in Washim district and attempted a show of strength, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is under pressure to act against the party minister. The leader of the Banjara community emerged at the community’s Pohradevi temple in Washim district on Tuesday. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar is reportedly displeased with the entire episode. Sena leader and its chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Wednesday indicated that the chief minister was considering if any action should be taken against the minister, although the reason cited was flouting Covid-19 norms. Rathod attended the state cabinet meeting and later was summoned by Thackeray to Varsha, the CM’s official residence. Party insiders present at Varsha, however, said there was no discussion on Rathod’s controversy. Speaking to reporters, Raut said, “I don’t know if Pawar saheb is upset with the issue… The chief minister of Maharashtra has already ordered action in the case of flouting of rules where thousands had gathered. The CM is strict with regards to law and rules. He would not spare even if it is one of his own. If somebody has flouted the rules, the law will take its course.” According to NCP leaders, Pawar was more upset with the crowding and show of strength at the Poharadevi temple in Washim during Rathod’s visit. “I am not aware if Pawarsaheb expressed his displeasure over the episode, but the chief minister has already ordered action for the crowding at Poharadevi temple. Rathod has resumed his official work. He will represent his department in the budget session starting from Monday,” said NCP leader and minority minister Nawab Malik. Congress leaders, too, have expressed their displeasure over the entire episode, but have tried to maintain distance from it, saying it is an internal matter of the Shiv Sena. “We do not want to be associated with such matters, as our party has no tolerance for such cases. This has been second such case after Dhananjay Munde’s controversy over allegations by a woman,” said a Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-under-pressure-to-act-against-maharashtra-minister-101614191928139.html

In a press conference on Wednesday, MbPT chairman Rajiv Jalota said that MoUs worth ₹12,000 crore more are in the pipeline.The agreements include starting water taxis from the domestic cruise terminal (DCT) in south Mumbai for ₹75 crore, introducing harbour cruise tourism for ₹15 crore, developing a Marina for ₹370 crore, and shipbuilding and allied activities for ₹1,300 crores among other agreements.In talks for decades now, MbPT is looking at starting water taxi services from south Mumbai to Belapur and Nerul soon.“We are looking at starting the services soon. Initially, we will start with 10-50 seater vessels, following which it can be increased as per the response,” said Jalota. The plan also includes services to Rewas and Kashid. A senior official from MbPT said that the charges would range between ₹300- ₹400. “The idea is that it should be in a similar range as normal taxis, otherwise people would not prefer water transport,” the official said.MbPT is also planning Mumbai’s first marina for 300 yachts at an 8.02 hectares land near the DCT. Jalota also said that MbPT will complete the Mumbai international cruise terminal project by the end of this year. MbPT aims to transform Mumbai into a cruise tourism hot spot catering to 15 lakh cruise passengers by the end of 2030.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the virtual India Maritime Summit to be held between March 2-4. Jalota said that the summit would prove to be a powerful platform to explore business opportunities in the maritime sector. Around 20,000 delegates from 40 countries are expected to take part in the summit, which will look at different themes like shipbuilding, repairs and recycling, inland water transport, coastal shipping, tourism among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/marina-water-taxis-and-more-mumbai-port-trust-signs-mous-worth-7-510-crore-101614191577988.html
25-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police arrest 4 in card cloning racket||The Mumbai crime branch on Tuesday arrested four more accused, including two store managers, in connection with the card cloning racket busted by unit 9 last week. A total of eight people have been arrested in the case and 181 debit cards, nine skimmer devices and one card reader have been seized. The accused allegedly duped several people by cloning their debit and credit cards. Police are still ascertaining the volume of the fraud committed by the gang.The four arrested have been identified as Amarjit Rajbhar, Wahid Mohammad Ayub Khan, Vivekanand Shinde and Saif Shaikh. Rajbhar worked as a manager at a branded garment store in Andheri (West), while Shinde worked as the manager of an ice cream shop in Pune. During the investigation, police learnt about Khan’s role to identify shop managers and provide them with skimmers and card readers, while Shinde and Shaikh withdrew money using the cloned debit and credit cards. The activities of the racket came to light when a bank official approached unit 9 of the crime branch about several customers being duped by fraudsters.Police acted on the information and arrested four accused on February 17, including the mastermind Mohammad Faiz Chaudhary, 27. The other accused were Yashwant Gupta, 23, Azaruddin Ansari, 23, and Ishtiaq Jamal Khan, 22, all residents of Goregaon and Jogeshwari. Chaudhary had allegedly given skimmer devices to several stores or shop managers so they could copy people’s debit and credit card details when they paid for items at the shops. Gupta worked at a Powai-based hotel as a manager and was provided with a skimmer device by Chaudhary.Gupta cloned the customers’ cards, while Ansari and Khan used to travel in Pune and Satara to withdraw money from the cloned cards, added police. The store managers were tasked by Chaudhary to secretly swipe the customer’s credit and debit cards in the card reader and noted down the PINs entered by the customer. Chaudhary paid ₹500 to the store manager for the details of each card.After collecting the data from the store managers, Chaudhary then uploaded it onto blank cards and sent other members of the gang to withdraw money in other cities like Pune and Satara, to avoid suspicion, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-arrest-4-in-card-cloning-racket-101614191576317.html

After the state government’s go-ahead to reopen theatres and multiplexes from November 5, 2020, with 50 per cent capacity, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) restricted public movement from 11pm to 6 am from Monday (February 22). The administration imposed fresh restrictions to check the spread of Covid following a reported spike in positive cases in the city. Play producers have either cancelled the shows or rescheduled it to the afternoon slot. Some have even postponed the events till March 7. Bhagyashree Desai, producer of Marathi writer Ratnakar Matkari’s popular play ‘Blind Game’, cancelled three scheduled shows in Pune and one in Mumbai this week. “It is impossible to hold the late-night show with curfew time restrictions as it will be inconvenient for artists, backstage workers and audience. I am not going to schedule any show till next month,” said Desai, who is also founder of Rasik Mohini production house. “We had bookings for Saturday and Sunday in the slot of 9.30 pm-12.30 am at Balgandharva Rangmandir. Now it stands cancelled. As political programmes are not held during the late-night hours, theatre directors book the slot,” said Sunil Mate, incharge, cultural programmes and auditoriums, PMC. Some programme coordinators have rescheduled the show to afternoon slot. “The show ‘Ayushyavar Bolu Kahi’ was scheduled to be conducted on Friday night at Balgandharva Rangmandir. It will now be held at Yashwantaro Chavan Natyagruha at 5 pm on Saturday. The show of the play ‘Yada Kadachit’ has been shifted to Sunday afternoon (Yashwantaro Chavan Natyagruha) from Saturday night (Balgandharva Rangmandir),” said Sameer Hampi, SH Enterprises. “We were hoping that theatres would get permission to operate full house from March 1, but the spike in cases has left us back to square one. Already hit by the lockdown, the night curfew restriction is another blow to the industry,” said Desai. Book launch and award distribution events have also been postponed in the light of uncertainty. Sunil Mahajan, whose group Samvad organises cultural events in the city, said, “It is not feasible to organise an event in the evening and wind it up before the curfew timings. Many residents prefer to remain indoors before the night curfew timings to avoid any confrontation with implementing agencies. Hence, I have postponed the scheduled events till March 7,” said Mahajan. Only a few multiplexes have reopened post easing of lockdown norms. “As no single screen has reopened yet, so we are anyway not affected by the night curfew restrictions,” said Arvind Chaphalkar, partner, City Pride multiplexes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/night-curfew-leaves-theatre-platforms-and-cinema-halls-empty-again-101614186467044.html

We had invited 500 guests for the reception, but after the new restrictions were announced we had to reschedule the plan,” he said.Amid the rise in Covid cases, strict restrictions are in place in the Pune district, along with curbs imposed on public gatherings. At a wedding a maximum of 50 per cent of hall capacity is allowed, with a ceiling of 200 people. Also, a permission letter from the local police is a must.“Now, we have rescheduled the date and changed the venue to a comparatively small hall at Kothrud. Only 100 guests including close relatives are invited and “Muhurat” is rescheduled to 11.30 am,” said Akshay.Similarly, Vikas Rajput, a resident of Hadapsar, who has rescheduled the wedding plan of his daughter after the new restrictions were announced, said, “My daughter’s wedding is planned on February 27 and we have called around 200 guests. But we have divided the guest list into three parts, 75 guests are invited between 7 to 8 pm, 75 between 8 pm and 9 pm slot and remaining between 9 pm to 10 pm.”“We did this so that all safety norms can be followed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-restrictions-in-pune-dist-impact-wedding-plans-101614185987073.html

The engineer would also help in installation and other repair works.This is the first time such a post is being created for medical colleges and the decision is being made amid a rise in Covid cases.During the pandemic, the district administration rushed to purchase multiple critical care equipment which was not only expensive but crucial as many lives were dependent on them.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad, said, “These equipment are critical as they save lives and a delay of minutes could be the difference between life and death. The biomedical engineer would be available dedicated to the hospital.”“ Many times the machine is past the warranty period or even if it is within the period the manufacturer is unable to send their representative and so the engineer would be able to provide help within the required time,” he said.To tackle the pandemic multiple equipment were purchased through the PM cares funds and corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds and no contract was made for repair and maintenance works for some machines.For maintenance of these machines, a biomedical engineer would be appointed on a contractual basis for about 120 days. The engineer would be responsible to ensure that the facilities run smoothly like ventilator and oxygen supply and that they are serviced properly. The engineer would inspect the machines daily and update the head of the concerned department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/govt-medical-colleges-hospitals-to-appoint-biomedical-engineers-101614181666715.html

The state had also instructed a finance committee to keep a tab on wastage of money. The committee included the additional commissioner, zonal commissioner, and chief financial officer.The then PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad had delegated power to the finance committee to take decisions to sanction development works as per the requirement of corporators.After the annual budget for the financial year, 2021-22 was drafted the new commissioner decided to scrap the financial committee.Ulka Kalaskar, chief accounting officer, PMC, said, “As per state government’s directives, the corporation had formed a committee during the pandemic to keep a tab on development works. It had approved ₹450 crore for works undertaken in civic limits.”Suresh Jagtap, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Commissioner has scrapped the committee, as last year’s financial period is almost over and a new budget is drafted.”Kunal Khemanar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Last year the committee approved works suggested by corporators at ward level. Most of the work was related to road concretisation and repair, constructing retaining walls, footpaths among others.”“Now officials have been ordered to scrutinise the development works, check before and after pictures and then pay bills to contractors,” he said.During his tenure, Gaikwad had decided to give preference to essential work such as water supply, drainage work, health and road maintenance work. After Gaikwad was transferred, the corporation announced an amenity scheme for property tax to increase revenue, and the corporation collected around ₹487.97 crore. After that, the corporation decided to sanction ward level work suggested by corporators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scrutinise-progress-on-development-works-before-clearing-bills-pmc-commissioner-101614176806494.html
25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana ex-Cong MLA faces trial in defamation case by IPS officer||Rewari additional sessions judge Rakesh Kumar Yadav has summoned former Congress legislator Jai Tirath Dahiya to face trial in a defamation case filed by Indian Police Service officer Bharti Arora, the then director-principal of Motilal Nehru Sports School (MNSS) at Rai in Sonepat in May 2017.Booked under Section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Police Code, Dahiya, who represented Rai in the assembly, was granted bail upon furnishing bail bonds worth ₹30,000 with a surety of the same amount. The court has fixed March 22 as the next date of hearing for pre-charge of evidence of the complainant.Passing the order on February 22, Yadav said, “The court has minutely gone through the contents of complaint and record produced by the complainant with regard to allegations and the same constitute prima-facie commission of offence under Section 500 of the IPC. The court is also of the opinion that at the time of summoning the accused, if prima-facie evidence is available on record, it is not necessary in each and every case to see the record meticulously and threadbare. In this case, the complaint has been filed with regard to an offence under Section 500 of the IPC in which the reputation harm pertains to a public servant and therefore, examination of the complainant and witness is dispensed with. The court comes to the conclusion that prima-facie facts alleged in the complaint and supported by records are sufficient to summon the accused to face trial for commission of offence.”Vivek Tanwar, the special prosecutor for the complainant, said Bharti is an outstanding police officer. “The harm caused by Dahiya to her reputation is irreversible. It was a deliberate attack on a public servant,” he said.The Haryana governor granted sanction to Arora to launch the prosecution under Section 199 (2) for filing a complaint under Section 202 of the CrPc and appointed Tanwar as special prosecutor for filing the case on her behalf on November 10, 2017.The complainant alleged that Dahiya’s defamatory statement, which was published in two vernacular dailies harmed her reputation in 2017.When contacted, Dahiya said he had levelled allegations against Arora on the basis of an audit report carried out by the finance department and he had apologised to her two days ago after the CAG reports gave her a clean chit.The conflict had started in 2017 after Dahiya levelled allegations of irregularities in the purchase of sports items in the Rai sports school. Arora served a legal notice on him, accusing him of a vilification and slander campaign against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-mla-to-face-trial-in-defamation-case-by-ips-officer-101614175187131.html

25-02-2021||World||Explainer: Meet the vaccine appointment bots, and their foes||Having trouble scoring a Covid-19 vaccine appointment? You’re not alone. To cope, some people are turning to bots that scan overwhelmed websites and send alerts on social media when slots open up.They've provided relief to families helping older relatives find scarce appointments. But not all public health officials think they're a good idea.In rural Buckland, Massachusetts, two hours west of Boston, a vaccine clinic canceled a day of appointments after learning that out-of-towners scooped up almost all of them in minutes thanks to a Twitter alert. In parts of New Jersey, health officials added steps to block bots, which they say favor the tech-savvy.What is a vaccine bot?Bots — basically autonomous programs on the web — have emerged amid widespread frustration with the online world of vaccine appointments.Though the situations vary by state, people often have to check multiple provider sites for available appointments. Weeks after the rollout began, demand for vaccines continues to outweigh supply, complicating the search even for eligible people as they refresh appointment sites to score a slot. When a coveted opening does appear, many find it can vanish midway through the booking.The most notable bots scan vaccine provider websites to detect changes, which could mean a clinic is adding new appointments. The bots are often overseen by humans, who then post alerts of the openings using Twitter or text notifications.A second type that's more worrisome to health officials are “scalper” bots that could automatically book appointments, potentially to offer them up for sale. So far, there's little evidence scalper bots are taking appointments.Are vaccine bot alerts helping?Yes, for the people who use them.“THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! I GOT MY DAD AN APPOINTMENT! THANK YOU SO MUCH!” tweeted Benjamin Shover, of Stratford, New Jersey, after securing a March 3 appointment for his 70-year-old father with the help of an alert from Twitter account @nj_vaccine.The success came a month after signing up for New Jersey’s state online vaccine registry.“He’s not really tech-savvy,” Shover said of his father in an interview. “He’s also physically disabled, and has arthritis, so it’s tough for him to find an appointment online.”The creator of the bot, software engineer Kenneth Hsu, said his original motivation was to help get an appointment for his own parents-in-law. Now he and other volunteers have set a broader mission of assisting others locked out of New Jersey's confusing online appointment system.“These are people who just want to know they’re on a list somewhere and they are going to be helped,” Hsu said. “We want everyone vaccinated. We want to see our grandparents.”What do health officials think?The bots have met resistance in some communities. A bot that alerted Massachusetts residents to a clinic this week in sparsely populated Franklin County led many people from the Boston area to sign up for the slots. Local officials canceled all of the appointments, switched to a private system and spread the word through senior centers and town officials.“Our goal was to help our residents get their vaccination,” said Tracy Rogers, emergency preparedness manager for the Franklin Regional Council of Governments. “But 95% of the appointments we had were from outside Franklin County.”New Jersey's Union County put a CAPTCHA prompt in its scheduling system to confirm visitors are human, blocking efforts "to game” it with a bot, said Sebastian D’Elia, a county spokesperson.“When you post on Twitter, only a certain segment of society is going to see that,” he said. Even if they're trying to help someone else, D’Elia said others do not have the luxury of people who are advocating for them.But the person who created a bot that's now blocked in Union County, 24-year-old computer programmer Noah Marcus, said the current system isn't fair, either."The system was already favoring the tech-savvy and the person who can just sit in front of their computer all day, hitting refresh,” Marcus said.D’Elia said the county is also scheduling appointments by phone to help those who might have trouble online.How do they work?Marcus used the Python coding language to create a program that sifts through a vaccine clinic website, looking for certain keywords and tables that would indicate new appointments. Other bots use different techniques, depending on how the target website is built.This kind of information gathering, known as web scraping, remains a source of rancor. Essentially, scraping is collecting information from a website that its owner doesn’t want collected, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.Some web services have taken web scrapers to court, saying scraping techniques violate the terms and conditions for accessing their sites. One case involving bots that scraped LinkedIn profiles is before the U.S. Supreme Court.“There’s disagreement in the courts about the legality of web-scraping,” Kerr said. “It’s a murky area. It’s probably legal but it’s not something we have certainty about.”What about scalper bots?The website for a mass vaccination site in Atlantic City, New Jersey says its online queue system — which keeps people waiting on the site as slots are allotted — is designed to prevent it from crashing and to stop bots from snapping up appointments “from real people.” But is that actually happening?Making a bot that can actually book appointments -- not just detect them -- would be a lot harder. And sites usually ask for information such as a person’s date of birth to make sure they are eligible.Pharmacy giants Walgreens and CVS, which are increasingly giving people shots across the US, have already said they've been working to prevent such activity.Walgreens said it is using cybersecurity techniques to detect and prevent bots so that “only authorized and eligible patients will have access to schedule a vaccine appointment.” CVS Health said it's encountered various types of automated activities and has designed its appointment-making system to validate legitimate users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-meet-the-vaccine-appointment-bots-and-their-foes-101614272844725.html
25-02-2021||World||Joe Biden revokes Trump-era ban on legal immigration||US President Joe Biden has revoked a ban on legal immigration that was ordered by his predecessor Donald Trump to protect American jobs for local citizens in an economy crippled by the Covid-19 pandemic.In a proclamation issued on Wednesday, Biden said the ban “does not advance the interests of the United States”.“To the contrary, it harms the United States,” he added, “including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here. It also harms industries in the United States that utilise talent from around the world.”The proclamation will allow people to begin applying for green cards with immediate effect, and not wait until the expiration of the ban in March.It did not revoke the ban on H-1B, L and other work visas. But they are set to lapse in March.Former president Trump had in April 2020 temporarily suspended for 60 days the entry of legal immigrants - affecting green cards - as layoffs had begun to spike. There were some exceptions, such as dependents of US citizens. In June, he had extended the suspension by another 60 days and added non-immigrants to the ban list, including holders of short-term work visas, such as H-1B and L visas used for intra-company transfers. He had further extended these bans in December for another 60 days.“Without intervention, the United States faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labour supply outpaces labour demand,” Trump had said in the April proclamation. While the stated goal was to protect US jobs for Americans, critics said the former president was using the Covid-19 pandemic to pursue his hard-line immigration agenda under the “Buy American, Hire American” policy, ordered through an executive order he issued in April 2017. Among other things, his administration targeted the H-1B visa programme, alleging it was been misused to bring foreign workers on lower wages in place of more expensive Americans.A sweeping immigration reforms legislation, which is backed by Biden, was introduced earlier this week in Congress. Since taking office in January, Biden has reversed many of his predecessor’s orders on an entire range of issues, from climate change to international engagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-revokes-trump-era-ban-on-legal-immigration-101614273474127.html
25-02-2021||World||Majority of Americans support $15 minimum wage, poll shows||A majority of Americans support the idea of more than doubling the minimum wage to $15 per hour, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Thursday as Senate Democrats await a ruling on whether they can tuck that measure into a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill.Democrats, who narrowly control the House of Representatives and Senate, are trying to pass the progressive policy without Republican votes through a maneuver known as reconciliation, which allows them to act with just a simple 51-vote majority rather than the chamber's normal 60-vote requirement.The Senate's parliamentarian on Thursday is expected to decide whether the rules will allow them to use the coronavirus spending bill to enact a sweeping wage policy.Regardless of the ruling, the idea of raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 from its current $7.25 is broadly popular, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Some 59% of respondents said they supported the idea, with 34% opposing it.When told that "raising the minimum wage should lift some families out of poverty, but government economists also expect it could eliminate some low income jobs, potentially making some families worse off," 55% of respondents said they supported it.Even if the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, rules that the minimum wage can be passed through reconciliation, it will not change the fact that the proposal faces an uphill battle in the Senate.Democrats are not united in support with two of their number - Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona - against the idea.There is broader support in the Senate to raising the minimum wage by a lesser amount, and not through reconciliation.Two Senate Republicans, Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney, on Tuesday proposed increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States between Feb. 18 and Feb. 24. It gathered responses from 4,430 adults, including 2,158 who identified as Democrats and 1,482 who identified as Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 3 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/majority-of-americans-support-15-minimum-wage-poll-shows-101614272910709.html

25-02-2021||World||UK work visas plunged in pandemic as investors stayed away||The number of work-related visas granted to enter Britain plunged 35% last year during the coronavirus pandemic, led by a drop in applications from high-value individuals.The figures released by the Home Office coincided with the worst economic slump in three centuries and a surge in unemployment, with lockdowns to control the virus shutting vast sections of the economy.“Employers have hired fewer workers from abroad during the pandemic, given that domestic unemployment is rising and many businesses are struggling,” said Madeleine Sumpton, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. “Even in the current context, there could still be some industries that face recruitment challenges such as medicine and nursing.”The total number of work-related visas declined to 125,176 last year, which was the lowest since at least 2005. Intra-company transfer visas fell 63%. The number of grants of a Tier 1 visa for those seeking to invest at least 2 million pounds ($2.8 million) dropped by 70% to 1,669.That’s likely to fuel concern about the impact on the economy and productivity if highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs continue to shun the U.K. once the crisis over.A separate analysis of government data by the British Ports Association showed arrivals by sea were the lowest since 1962. Those figures counted short sea journeys between the U.K. and countries such as France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain.The total fell 63% to 6.9 million from 2019, according to the analysis of data from the U.K. Department for Transport . The lobby group attributed the trends to a lack of public appetite to travel during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-work-visas-plunged-in-pandemic-as-investors-stayed-away-101614267676998.html

Pleyer added that Pakistan "remains under increased monitoring"."I strongly urge the completion of the action plan," he said.The FATF concluded its three-day virtual plenary meeting today, following several rounds of meetings of its working groups since February 11.Pakistan has been on the FATF's grey list since June 2018.A research paper by an Islamabad-based independent think tank estimated that Pakistan sustained a total of USD 38 billion in economic losses due to FATF's decision to keep the country on its grey list, the Express Tribune reported. It further reported that the losses are worked out on the basis of a decrease in consumption expenditures, foreign direct investment and exports.At its last plenary in October 2020, FATF concluded that Pakistan had fully complied with 21 of 27 points in the action plan but warned the country that it could not be given “forever” to address outstanding issues. As all deadlines for the action plan had expired, FATF had urged Pakistan to deliver on all 27 points by February 2021.Some European nations had supported the stance to keep Pakistan in the grey list also said that Islamabad has not fully implemented all the points of a plan of action set by the FATF.On Tuesday, a group of protesters had gathered at the FATF headquarters in Paris to persuade the anti-terror financing organisation to place Pakistan on the blacklist. The protesters said they want to highlight Islamabad's continued support to terror groups and terror financing."Pakistani courts recently ordered release Omar Sheikh, the terrorist who killed Daniel Pearl. Pakistani judiciary is compromised. It's working on dictates of Pakistani military which sponsors terrorism," tweeted South Asia Press, one of the groups which was part of then protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-stays-in-fatf-grey-list-given-june-deadline-to-implement-action-plan-101614270404068.html

The driver will still have to pay a $13,612 fine and some $925,660 to the families of the victims.The tour bus packed with foreigners was heading from Oman back to the UAE in the summer of 2019 when the driver took a wrong highway exit and veered into an overhanging steel barrier, killing 17 people, including 12 Indians. Several others were injured.The 54-year-old driver had accepted responsibility for the crash, the National reported, saying he was momentarily blinded by the sun's glare. He later appealed the verdict, arguing that the steel barrier was wrongly placed.Among the 31 people on the ill-fated bus were also citizens of Bangladesh, Germany and the Philippines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sentence-reduced-for-driver-in-fatal-dubai-tour-bus-crash-that-killed-12-indians-101614270548414.html

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Wednesday released the first 360-degree panorama taken by Mastcam-Z, a dual-camera system equipped with a zoom function.The Mastcam-Z sent 142 individual images after rotating its mast 360 degrees on the third Martian day of the mission and the US space agency stitched them together to create the instrument's first 360-degree panorama.The zoomable pair of cameras aboard the Perseverance rover has the capability of taking high-definition video, panoramic colour and 3D images of the Martian surface.The first high-definition panorama reveals the crater rim and cliff face of Jezero Crater, considered as an ancient lakebed formed billions of years ago.The two cameras of Mastcam-Z are mounted on the rover’s mast at the eye level of a 2 metres tall person and provide stereo vision. The cameras can produce colour images with a quality similar to that of a consumer digital HD camera. Another processed image of a wind-carved rock shows how much detail is captured by the camera systems. “We’re nestled right in a sweet spot, where you can see different features similar in many ways to features found by Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity at their landing sites,” Jim Bell, the instrument’s principal investigator at Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration, said in a statement.The navigation cameras, known as Navcams, aboard the Perseverance rover also captured a panorama over the weekend which provided a good look at the Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, one of the instruments on the rover’s stowed arm.The Mastcam-Z team will discuss the new panorama during a question and answer session at 2.30am IST on February 26. It will be aired live on Nasa television and the space agency’s website and social media accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highdefinition-zoomable-view-of-mars-captured-by-nasa-s-perseverance-rover-101614266700416.html
25-02-2021||World||US government revises fourth quarter GDP up slightly to 4.1%||The economy grew at a slightly faster pace in the final three months of 2020 than first thought, ending a year in which the overall economy shrank more than it had in the past seven decades.Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic health — grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the fourth quarter, up from an initial estimate of 4% growth, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.The revision does alter the nation's annual GDP which shrank 3.5%, the largest decline since 1946 when the U.S. demobilised after World War II.However, economists believe 2021 will see a significant rebound, helped by further government stimulus, more widespread distribution of vaccines and continued low-interest rate policies from the Federal Reserve.Some expect GDP growth in the current quarter could top 9% and for the year, economists are forecasting GDP growth perhaps as high as 6%. That would be the fastest annual GDP growth since the economy expanded 7.2% in 1984 when Ronald Reagan was president.The new forecasts represent a significant rebound in optimism in the past month as coronavirus cases have started to come down, sparking a big jump in retail sales.“You have massive government stimulus, low interest rates from the Fed and the vaccine supply is growing,” said Sung Won Sohn, finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. “The economy is beginning to fire on all cylinders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-revises-fourth-quarter-gdp-up-slightly-to-41-101614264800702.html
25-02-2021||World||Texas lawmakers kick off investigation into deadly power blackout||Texas state legislators on Thursday begin digging into the causes of deadly power blackouts that left millions shivering in the dark as frigid temperatures caught its grid operator and utilities ill-prepared for skyrocketing power demand.Hearings are expected to highlight that shortcomings by grid planners, electric utility and natural gas transmission operators led to billions of dollars in damages and dozens of deaths. Consumer advocates have called for more stringent regulation of utilities and a review of retail marketing plans.Up to 48% of the state's power generation was offline at times last week. Utilities were ordered to cut power to prevent a larger catastrophe, Bill Magness, chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state's grid operator, said on Wednesday.ERCOT, whose board is appointed by the state Public Utility Commission, faces lawsuits by customers and a generator claiming damages from misrepresentation and lack of planning. Six of its 15 directors resigned this week and a nominee withdrew before taking a seat.Governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday said public anger was justified and pledged proposals to increase power supplies and to protect those residents hit with enormous power bills. He blamed ERCOT, saying it should have acted faster to prevent generators from falling offline.RETAIL DEFAULTS AHEADOf the about 100 retail electric providers in Texas, a quarter are at risk of default on multi-million dollar service charges levied by ERCOT. Some may sell customers to larger firms to cover costs, stifling retail competition, said Mark Foster, an attorney and former special counsel to the state's Public Utility Commission."They call it the blood week," Foster said. One of his clients, electricity marketer Young Energy LLC, faces a $19 million bill for services that cost $37,000 the prior month, he said. "There will be a significant decrease in competition for the consumer," he said.Electricity failures from storms and wildfires are raising costs for insurance providers, compounding residential and business damages, said Andrew Siffert, a vice president at reinsurance broker BMS Group.By one count, the winter storm that hit Texas spawned $18 billion in insured losses across 20 U.S. states affected. On average, winter storms cause $3 billion in insured losses.Siffert said the storm, wildfires and hurricanes have insurers pushing for more resilient networks to stop their losses from ballooning."Time and time again we see during a disaster the long-term lack of electricity compounds the overall insured loss. The insurance industry needs a seat at the table," he said.(Reporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Christopher Cushing)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-lawmakers-kick-off-investigation-into-deadly-power-blackout-101614260632695.html
25-02-2021||World||China approves two more domestic Covid-19 vaccines, increasing number to 4||China's National Medical Products Administration said on Thursday that it had approved two more Covid-19 vaccines for public use, increasing the number of domestic vaccines approved in China to four.The two newly approved vaccines are made by CanSino Biologics Inc and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, an affiliate of China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm).They join a vaccine from Sinovac Biotech approved earlier this month, and another from Sinopharm's Beijing unit approved last year.So far, China has not approved Covid-19 vaccines developed by Western drug makers.Sinopharm's Wuhan unit said on Wednesday its vaccine had an efficacy rate of 72.51% against the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus, citing interim analysis of late-stage clinical trial data, without offering more details.It is one of two candidates from Sinopharm that have entered Phase III clinical trials overseas, and was earlier given to a limited group of people at higher infection risk.The four approved Chinese vaccines can be stored at normal freezer temperatures, making them a potentially attractive option for developing countries which might have difficulty deploying vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that require much colder temperatures for longer-term storage.China has been exporting the Sinovac and earlier Sinopharm vaccines to countries around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-two-more-domestic-covid-19-vaccines-increasing-number-to-4-101614262217830.html

US regulators announced Wednesday that Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine offers strong protection against severe Covid-19. It’s expected to be approved soon by the FDA.Fauci warns people not to hold off on getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine while waiting for the slightly more effective Pfizer or Moderna shots.He says it’s a race “between the virus and getting vaccines into people” and “the longer one waits not getting vaccinated, the better chance the virus has to get a variant or a mutation.”Fauci says public health officials are always concerned about virus variants and stressed following public health measures of wearing masks and social distancing.The predominant coronavirus variant in the United States is from Britain. Fauci says the vaccines distributed in the US “clearly can take care of that particular strain.”President Joe Biden plans to distribute millions of face masks to Americans in communities hard-hit by the coronavirus.It’s part of his effort to ensure equity in the government’s response to the pandemic. Biden is aiming to reach underserved communities and those bearing the brunt of the outbreak. His plan will distribute masks not through the mail, but through Federally Qualified Community Health Centers and the nation’s food bank and food pantry systems.The White House announced it expects more than 25 million American-made cloth masks in both adult and kid sizes will be distributed.Biden has asked everyone to wear face masks for the first 100 days of his term. He’s also required mask-wearing in federal buildings and on public transportation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-asks-americans-to-take-whatever-vaccine-is-available-101614261222924.html
25-02-2021||World||China celebrates official end of extreme poverty, lauds Xi||The ruling Communist Party is celebrating the official end of extreme poverty in China with a propaganda campaign that praises President Xi Jinping’s role, part of efforts to cement his image as a history-making leader who is reclaiming his country’s rightful place as a global power.The propaganda apparatus has been linking national successes to Xi, including fighting the coronavirus, China’s rise as a technology creator and December’s successful lunar mission to bring back moon rocks.The party announced in November, with little fanfare, that China no longer had anyone in extreme poverty. That was down from an official estimate of almost 99 million living on annual incomes of less than 2,300 yuan ($355) per person a decade ago.The full-scale propaganda campaign launched this month has filled state-controlled newspapers and airwaves with reports on the anti-poverty milestone and Xi's personal role in it.They credit Xi with launching an initiative shortly after taking power in 2012 that enabled China to beat by a decade the 2030 target set by the World Bank for eliminating extreme poverty. A report by the party newspaper People’s Daily this week on the “historic leap” refers to Xi by his full name and title as party leader 121 times.“General Secretary Xi Jinping has stood at the strategic height of building a well-off society in an all-around way and realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” the newspaper said.The event gives the ruling party a political trophy ahead of this year’s celebration of the 100th anniversary of its 1921 founding. It comes at a time when China's economy is growing again following the coronavirus while the United States, Europe and other areas are still struggling with outbreaks.The party said it reached the milestone despite having to take the unprecedented step of shutting down most of China’s economy in early 2020 to fight the coronavirus.On Thursday, Xi cited anti-poverty work as a sign of the effectiveness of the ruling party’s system.“We have finished the arduous task of eradicating absolute poverty and created a miracle that shall go down in history,” Xi said at a ceremony honoring people who worked on the initiative.Xi presented medals, certificates and plaques to 10 individuals and 10 groups honored as anti-poverty “role models.”He acknowledged the “material foundation” built up over four decades of market-style reforms that have transformed China into the world’s second-largest economy and a middle-income society but mentioned no other officials or earlier leaders by name.The event gives Xi, who has amassed more personal power than any leader since Mao Zedong, Communist China's founder, a new opportunity to assert his historical importance.Abroad, Xi is pursuing an assertive foreign policy that has increased China's diplomatic influence but roiled relations with its neighbors and with the United States and Europe.The poverty milestone gives Xi ammunition to shore up power that some foreign analysts suggested was eroded by the coronavirus outbreak that began in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019.Anti-poverty campaigns also are aimed at narrowing the politically volatile gulf between an elite who have profited most from economic reform and the poor majority.Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, and then-Premier Wen Jiabao started that process by stepping up spending on rural schools and health care to spread prosperity from the thriving, export-powered east coast.China’s official definition of extreme poverty is an income per person of 11 yuan ($1.70) per day. That is lower than the World Bank’s standard of $1.90, but the National Bureau of Statistics says that due to differences in rural living costs, the Chinese standard is slightly higher.In some areas, low-income ethnic minority communities have been moved out of remote valleys into newly built towns. In others, officials went door to door signing up poor families for job training, grants to start businesses and other aid.Nearly 10 million people moved into new homes and those of 27 million more have been renovated, according to Xi. He said the government has spent a total of 1.6 trillion yuan ($250 billion).Average income per person among the “rural underprivileged” rose from 2,982 yuan ($356) in 2015 to 10,740 yuan ($1,665) last year, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Some experts suggest China might be less successful than it claims because it is still using standards for the poorest countries long after graduating to middle-income status. The World Bank’s middle-income poverty standard is income of $5.50 per person per day.In a report in January for the Brookings Institution, former World Bank expert Indermit Gill argued China is almost as well off as the United States was in 1960 when it became a high-income country. But Gill said that based on the U.S. income standard from that era, as many as 90% of China's people would be considered poor.“If our numbers are correct, China is years — if not decades — behind schedule,” Gill wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-celebrates-official-end-of-extreme-poverty-lauds-xi-101614258069773.html

His successor, President Joe Biden, wants to rejoin the deal.But in the week since Washington offered to talk with Tehran about reviving the nuclear deal, Iran has curbed U.N. monitoring and threatened to boost its uranium enrichment. Tehran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons.An Israeli official said on Tuesday that Israel hopes to prevent personal tension between Netanyahu, who is seeking re-election on March 23, and Biden over their differences on Iran policy by delegating talks on the topic to their senior staff.Netanyahu and Khalifa both released statements about their telephone call on Thursday but only the Bahraini announcement mentioned Iran.Their conversation stressed the importance for the "countries of the region to take part in any talks about Iran's nuclear file," the kingdom's state media office said on Twitter.Netanyahu's office said he spoke with Khalifa about visiting Bahrain once coronavirus restrictions would allow it."The Bahraini regent also stated that he was interested in examining the possibility of Bahrain joining an investment in a vaccine manufacturing plant that is planned to be established in Israel together with other countries," the statement said.Netanyahu said on Wednesday he was in talks with the heads of Pfizer and Moderna to open facilities in Israel.

Reuters has not seen the letter.The Dubai government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Cambridgeshire police confirmed it had received a letter, dated February 2018, in relation to the case and that it was part of an "ongoing review".Latifa, 35, is herself the subject of international concern. In a video message filmed in a bathroom and obtained by the BBC, she said she was being held captive in a barricaded villa.The UAE last week said Latifa was being cared for at home by family and medical professionals.The two women's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, has rejected findings by a London High Court judge who said last year that he accepted as proved allegations that the sheikh had ordered the abductions of his daughters.Britain has called on the United Arab Emirates to show proof that Latifa was still alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubais-latifa-urged-uk-police-to-reopen-sister-s-kidnap-case-report-101614258779784.html

"Nobody has any idea what is actually in these vials...The best case is it's just not working, in the worst case it's a very serious issue."The official, who noted that most of the shots offered to EU governments by traders were purportedly the AstraZeneca vaccine, compared the situation to the start of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 when criminal exploited a shortage of masks and other protective equipment.A second official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Commission was worried about "ghost" vaccines."It is unclear whether these are genuine vaccine doses or if we are just talking about salt water in small vials," the official told Reuters.The EU had warned already that vaccine fraud was on the rise, with fake doses circulating on the market, but the extent of the problem has been unclear until now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fraudsters-offer-400-million-ghost-covid-vaccines-in-eu-officials-101614254344777.html

He said the new batch was ordered under an agreement between the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) of Sri Lanka and the Serum Institute of India.The distribution of vaccines will start on Friday.India gifted 500,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine which kicked off Sri Lanka’s vaccine rollout in late January. The vaccines were given to the frontline workers and the security personnel.The government has placed an order for 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India at a cost of USD 52.5 million and a further 3.5 million doses directly from AstraZeneca Institute of UK under the COVAX programme.Health officials here said the next batch of the Indian order would be coming in March.Ramesh Pathirana, who is also the Minister of Plantations, earlier said Sri Lanka is likely to go only with the AstraZeneca vaccines for the second phase of vaccination as the Chinese and Russian vaccines are not ready yet.Last month, India announced it will send Covid-19 vaccines under grant assistance to Sri Lanka and seven other countries - Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles, Afghanistan and Mauritius.India is one of the world's biggest drug-makers and an increasing number of countries have already approached it for procuring coronavirus vaccines.Sri Lanka has recorded more than 80,500 coronavirus cases so far with 450 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-receives-500-000-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-from-india-101614256611747.html

But the studies will allow the vaccine makers to be prepared if and when more protection is necessary, they said."The rate of mutations in the current virus is higher than expected," Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in an interview."It's a reasonable probability that we would end up with regular boosts. And for potent vaccines, it may be that you need to do a strain change every few years, but not necessarily every year."In the first stage of the first arm of the study, a third 30 microgram dose will be given to as many as 144 people who received the vaccine 6 to 12 months ago in the original Phase I safety trial.Assuming regulatory approval, a redesigned vaccine would also be tested, both as a booster dose in people who have been vaccinated and in people who had not yet received the vaccine, Dolsten said.The trial would not seek to measure the efficacy of the vaccine like their large Phase III trial last year. Instead it would measure the antibody response and study whether blood from recipients can neutralize the new coronavirus variants, as well as the safety of a third dose.The United States discovered its first case of the South African variant in January and it has since turned up in 14 states, according to U.S. government data. Several studies suggest it is more resistant to existing vaccines than other variants of the coronavirus.Pfizer's Dolsten said that mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and BioNTech's create a potent response. But the immune response may wane over time.He believes that a third dose of their vaccine will create a similar or better response than the second dose, and could be the logical next step for staying ahead of circulating variants."We think our vaccine is robustly active against all strains," Dolsten said, noting that the companies "want to be prepared for all options and be data driven - led by science."Dolsten said the new trial would likely be predominantly conducted in the United States.Moderna Inc said on Wednesday it is also working with U.S. government scientists to study an experimental booster shot that targets the variant first found in South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizerbiontech-testing-booster-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-in-new-trial-101614257178823.html

Insurers want cuts in capital requirements to free up cash for green and long term investments.But the Bank of England says the City must not become an "anything goes" financial centre, and that insurers hold the right amount of capital.Cross-border firms want to avoid Britain diverging from international norms as this would add to compliance costs.City veterans say Britain should focus on allowing firms to hire globally, and ensuring that regulators respond nimbly and proportionately to crypto-assets, sustainable finance, long-term investing and restructurings after COVID-19.COPYING NEW YORKLondon has fallen behind New York in attracting company flotations and a government-backed review of listing rules is likely to recommend allowing "dual class" shares and a lower "free float", perhaps for a limited period.Dual class shares are stocks in the same company with different voting rights, while "free float" refers to the proportion of a company's shares that are publicly available.The potential changes could attract more tech and fintech companies whose founders typically want to retain a large degree of control.It could also recommend making it easier for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) - businesses that raise money on stock markets to buy other companies - an area in which New York has also dominated, with Amsterdam catching up fast.UK asset managers warn that strong corporate governance standards could be diluted by tinkering with listing rules.BEYOND SANDBOXESBritain is home to one of the world's biggest innovative fintech sectors, its "sandboxes" - which allow fintech firms to test new products on real consumers under regulatory supervision - copied across the world. But Brexit means Britain has to work harder to attract and retain fintechs as they will no longer have direct access to the world's biggest trading area.A government-backed review to buttress the sector is due to report back on Friday with recommendations that could include cutting red tape for fintechs that want to recruit staff from across the world, and make listing in Britain more attractive.Other ideas could include helping fledgling fintech navigate government departments and regulators more easily, along with ways of boosting funding for start-ups.FUNDS ARE THE FUTUREBritain is reviewing how to make itself a more competitive place for listing investment funds, a core tool for bringing fresh capital into markets.UK-based asset managers run many funds listed in the EU, but this global system of cross-border management known as delegation could be tightened up by the bloc.Having more funds listed in Britain would also mean that the shares they hold would be traded in London. Billions of euros in trading euro shares have left the UK for Amsterdam since Brexit due to the bloc's restrictions on where funds can trade shares.THINK GLOBALAs the City will get only limited access at best to the EU, industry officials say it makes more sense to focus on getting better access to other markets like Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, while at the same time keeping the UK financial market open to the world, including the EU.Negotiations between Britain and Switzerland for a "mutual recognition" deal in financial rules is the way to go, industry officials say. Better global access would also keep the City ahead of EU centres like Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-things-shaping-britain-s-financial-rulebooks-after-brexit-101614255738878.html

25-02-2021||World||African Union backs India's call to waive IP rights on Covid-19 drugs||The African Union is backing calls for drugmakers to waive some intellectual property rights on Covid-19 medicines and vaccines to speed up their rollout to poor countries, the head of its disease control body said on Thursday.South Africa and India, which both manufacture drugs and vaccines, made the proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO) last year, arguing that intellectual property (IP) rules were hindering the urgent scale-up of vaccine production and provision of medical products to some patients.They have faced opposition from some developed nations, but the backing of the African Union (AU) may give renewed impetus for the push to relax IP rules.John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news conference that IP transfer was a "win-win for everybody" that would address the huge inequalities in global public health.He gave two examples where the developing world had suffered because of restricted access to medicines: the swine flu pandemic in the late 2000s and HIV/AIDS in the 1990s."In 1996, HIV drugs were available, and we saw how mortality in the developed world decreased drastically. But it would take 10 years before those drugs were accessible in Africa in any meaningful way," he said."In between, 12 million Africans died, so I just use those numbers to say: any IP transfer will be beneficial to everybody, because nobody wants to sit back and be proud of that sad event ... We want to be on the right side of history."Nkengasong added the Africa CDC's regulatory taskforce had approved two versions of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, a day after Ghana received its first AstraZeneca doses from global vaccine distribution facility COVAX.He said the developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine had submitted a "full dossier" of data to the Africa CDC and that in the coming days an expert panel would review the data and make a pronouncement."We have not received dossiers yet from China colleagues, but we remain optimistic that they will submit to us," he continued.Several countries on the continent, including Egypt, Zimbabwe and Senegal, have already started rolling out Chinese Covid-19 shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/african-union-backs-india-s-call-to-waive-ip-rights-on-covid-19-drugs-101614254509127.html

25-02-2021||World||YouTube's new feature will allow parents to choose what children can watch||Online video-sharing platform YouTube is launching a new feature that would let parents control what their children can watch.As per The Verge, YouTube's upcoming feature called 'supervised experiences', will come with a new set of restrictions that allows parents to better control what content their children can access on the video platform.According to a blog post, YouTube hopes that the filter will help parents slowly introduce their older children to age-appropriate content and features outside of the YouTube Kids app.The mode will launch first with an early beta, with a wider beta rolling out "in the coming months."Parents have three levels of strictness to choose from, which determines the content a child is allowed to view on their account.There is the 'Explore' level, which YouTube said is "generally suitable" for kids nine and up. 'Explore More', which is meant for kids 13 and up, and 'Most of YouTube', which is pretty much everything except age-restricted content.In the US, and most other countries, people over the age of 13 can make their own unsupervised YouTube accounts.It is not clear exactly what content will be allowed at which levels, but YouTube said the 'Explore' level will have "vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, educational content and more."As the name suggests, the 'Explore More' level will have a wider range of videos, as well as live streams for the aforementioned 'Explore' categories. The company said that 'Most of YouTube' will contain "sensitive topics that may only be appropriate for older teens."YouTube's 'supervised experiences' feature is still a system that relies on user input, human review, and machine learning. YouTube knows it will not be perfect, admitting that it "will make mistakes," which have been seen happen with the Kids app. As such, parents shouldn't think of it as a "set it and forget it" solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtubes-new-feature-will-allow-parents-to-choose-what-children-can-watch-101614245256256.html
25-02-2021||World||World’s top meat supplier envisions separate plant-based company||Demand for faux burgers is growing so rapidly that JBS SA, the world’s biggest meat supplier, said it will likely set up a new global company focused solely on plant-based products.Meat from animals will be a pricey luxury in the future, and people will have to turn to vegetable-derived alternatives, which will be cheaper, JBS’s Chief Executive Officer Gilberto Tomazoni told Bloomberg in an interview. In addition, the world’s population is booming and expected to reach 10 billion by 2050. The amount of meat needed to satisfy the world’s protein needs won’t be possible to produce.“Plant-based will help us to reduce this protein gap with more affordable products compared with animal protein, which will be more premium,” Tomazoni said. “We see plant-based as an independent business in the future.”Brazil-based JBS is just one of many sprawling, legacy food companies trying to up their meat-substitutes game as burgers and sausages made from plant proteins become mainstream. Consumer demand has soared after startups like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods popularized veggie burgers that imitate real beef. The likes of McDonald’s and Starbucks have added alternative meat items to their menus.JBS, like U.S. rival Tyson Foods Inc., entered the plant-based meat market in 2019, and regional teams across the globe developed products. The new company Tomazoni envisions would gather all those regional businesses in a global enterprise.The company already has a sizable footprint, with about 57% of the plant-based burger market in Brazil. In Europe, its Moy Park subsidiary supplies faux chicken burgers. It also has 10 plant-based products in more than 3,000 U.S. stores under the OZO brand, where sales rose 300% last year.It will still be a challenge to compete with companies like Beyond Meat that created the fake meat craze. Investment money has been pouring into alternative protein startups, which raised a record $2.4 billion of funding in 2020, according to market researcher CB Insights.“We have the basis to grow on plant-based: innovation capacity, investments in research, agreements with global companies for ingredient supplies, presence in retail,” Tomazoni said.For now, JBS’s focus is developing new products and trying to better understand the market, Tomazoni said. While it’s still unclear how much plant-based meat will grow, one thing is for sure: it’s not just a niche market. Even now, rising middle-class populations in Asia and Africa are clamoring for more protein in their diets. Protein production must rise 70% in 30 years to meet demand, Tomazoni said, citing UN figures.“This is a long-term race,” he said. “Consumers will have more choices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-top-meat-supplier-envisions-separate-plant-based-company-101614248919431.html
25-02-2021||World||UK companies say Brexit paperwork is biggest headache stressing supply chains||British companies say new customs forms required following Brexit are the biggest hurdle to trading with the rest of the world, official data show.About 38% of exporters and 39% of importers identified form-filling as their main hurdle, according to a survey conducted by the Office for National Statistics. While half of exporters reported no difficulties trading internationally, the concerns on paperwork exceeded those about disruption at UK borders and transportation costs.The findings add to evidence that friction at ports is weighing on Britain’s ability to trade following after the nation left the European Union’s common customs system. Importers are warning they face even more red tape when new regulations come into force in April and July.Almost a third of the companies moving goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, in the past two weeks, almost a third said volumes had fallen.Separate research by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply found that more than half of companies reported longer delays since the start of the year. Those totaled at least two to three days for imports.“Delays are continuing to get longer, putting more and more pressure on the UK’s supply chains,” said John Glen, an economist for CIPS. “The knock-on impact of these delays will trickle far down the supply chain and ultimately result in stock shortages and inflated prices for consumers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-companies-say-brexit-paperwork-is-biggest-headache-stressing-supply-chains-101614252441603.html
25-02-2021||World||More than 1.3 million Texans still grappling with water supply disruptions||More than 1.3 million people across over 200 counties in Texas still had issues with their water supply by Wednesday, but that was down sharply from recent days, a spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) said.That figure compared with Tuesday's 3.4 million, Monday's 8 million and Sunday's 9 million, or about a third of the state's population.A deadly winter storm caused widespread blackouts last week across Texas, a state unaccustomed to extreme cold, killing at least two dozen people and knocking out power to more than 4 million at its peak.As of Wednesday evening, "33 Public Water Systems are non-operational, affecting 20,689 Texans," the spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement, adding that 204 counties were reporting issues with their public water systems (PWS).He said around 853 PWSs were on a boil water notice, meaning people were being advised to boil water before consuming it, affecting 1,333,134 Texans. Some 1,176 previously issued boil water notices had been rescinded, he added.Once the current crisis is over, TCEQ plans to examine the ongoing experience to prevent such a disruption from taking place in the future, TCEQ Executive Director Toby Baker told Reuters on Wednesday.Texas Governor Greg Abbott pledged on Wednesday to overhaul the state's electric grid operator after a massive blackout left residents without heat, power or water for days.The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the flow of power to about 90% of state residents, has faced sharp criticism over its failure to prepare for severe cold. Outages caused billions of dollars of damages to homes and businesses.Six ERCOT directors have resigned and a board nominee declined a seat in the wake of sharp criticism of the group's performance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-1-3-million-texans-still-grappling-with-water-supply-disruptions-101614253620125.html
25-02-2021||World||Recent drone attack on Saudi royal palace launched from Iraq||Explosive-laden drones that targeted Saudi Arabia's royal palace in the kingdom's capital last month were launched from inside Iraq, a senior Iran-backed militia official in Baghdad and a US official said.Speaking to The Associated Press this week, the militia official said three drones were launched from Iraqi-Saudi border areas by a relatively unknown Iran-backed faction in Iraq and crashed into the royal complex in Riyadh on January 23, exacerbating regional tensions.Attacks on the Saudi capital have been sporadic amid the kingdom's yearslong war against neighbouring Yemen's Houthi rebels. Earlier this month, the rebels targeted an airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia with bomb-laden drones, causing a civilian plane on the tarmac to catch fire.The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, however, denied carrying out an attack that targeted Saudi Arabia's Yamama Palace on January 23.The comments by the senior Iraqi militia official mark the first time an Iran-backed group has acknowledged that Iraq was the origin of the attack and points to the challenge Baghdad faces in halting attacks by Iranian-backed militia factions in Iraq.It followed a responsibility claim allegedly issued by a little-known group called Awliya Wa'ad al-Haq, or “The True Promise Brigades,” that circulated on social media, calling it retaliation for a suicide bombing claimed by the Islamic State group in a main Baghdad shopping district on January 21.The militia official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly about the attack, said the drones came “in parts from Iran and were assembled in Iraq, and were launched from Iraq.” He did not disclose where along the border the drones were launched and did not provide more details about the group claiming the attack.Iran-backed groups have splintered significantly since the Washington-directed strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Baghdad more than a year ago. Both were key in commanding and controlling a wide array of Iran-backed groups operating in Iraq.Since their deaths, militias have become increasingly unruly and disparate. Some Washington-based analysts argue the militias have become splintered only to allow them to claim attacks under different names to mask their involvement.A US official said Washington believes the January 23 attack on the Yamama Palace was launched from inside Iraq. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not elaborate or say how the U.S. came to this conclusion.An Iraqi official speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the US intelligence was shared with Iraq's government.Launching a strike from Iraq would pose a challenge to Saudi air defense, now focused on threats from Iran to the northeast and Yemen from the south. Such drones also are small enough and fly low enough to the ground to not be picked up on radar.The attack comes as Iraq seeks to deepen economic ties with Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over a variety of investment projects. Last week, President Barham Salih visited the United Arab Emirates and Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein visited Saudi Arabia this week, apparently to discuss the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recent-drone-attack-on-saudi-royal-palace-launched-from-iraq-101614253054104.html
25-02-2021||World||German police commissioner charged with sharing Hitler pictures||German prosecutors said on Thursday they had filed sedition and hate speech charges against a police commissioner suspected of sharing pictures of Adolf Hitler and images showing hostility towards Muslims, and possessing illegal weapons and explosives.The 46-year-old suspect, who served at the police headquarters in the city of Wiesbaden, had shared pictures of the Nazi leader performing the Hitler salute with 30 others, including police officers, on WhatsApp, they said.German police and security agencies have faced accusations of not doing enough to unearth potentially violent nationalists in their ranks.This is a sensitive issue in a country where awareness of the World War Two genocide of millions of Jews by the Nazis under Hitler is strong.The domestic intelligence agency said in a report last year that less than 1% of Germany's police force, security agencies and military personnel espouse far-right world views and sympathies. The report was part of a wider inquiry into far-right extremism in the civil service."The suspect shared pictures showing Adolf Hitler in uniform with an arm band bearing a swastika and performing the so-called Hitler salute with an outstretched right arm as well as images that convey hostility toward people with dark skin and Muslims," Frankfurt Senior Public Prosecutor Nadja Niesen said.She said the suspect had shared the images in late 2018, and officers found firearms, heavy weapons and explosives during a search of his residence a year later. She did not say why charges against him were being filed only now or how the suspect had pleaded.The suspect's brother, who was also a police commissioner and left the force voluntarily, is due to go on trial in April on charges of sharing illegal symbols, possessing illegal weapons and sharing secret police information with civilians, the prosecutor said.A third police commissioner, who has been relieved of his duties, has been charged with sharing sensitive information from the police computer systems with civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-police-commissioner-charged-with-sharing-hitler-pictures-101614252591791.html
25-02-2021||World||Google pledges changes to research oversight after internal revolt||Alphabet Inc's Google will change procedures before July for reviewing its scientists' work, according to a town hall recording heard by Reuters, part of an effort to quell internal tumult over the integrity of its artificial intelligence (AI) research.In remarks at a staff meeting last Friday, Google Research executives said they were working to regain trust after the company ousted two prominent women and rejected their work, according to an hour-long recording, the content of which was confirmed by two sources.Teams are already trialing a questionnaire that will assess projects for risk and help scientists navigate reviews, research unit Chief Operating Officer Maggie Johnson said in the meeting. This initial change will roll out by the end of the second quarter, and the majority of papers will not require extra vetting, she said.Reuters reported in December that Google had introduced a "sensitive topics" review for studies involving dozens of issues, such as China or bias in its services. Internal reviewers had demanded that at least three papers on AI be modified to refrain from casting Google technology in a negative light, Reuters reported.Jeff Dean, Google's senior vice president overseeing the division, said Friday that the "sensitive topics" review "is and was confusing" and that he had tasked a senior research director, Zoubin Ghahramani, with clarifying the rules, according to the recording.Ghahramani, a University of Cambridge professor who joined Google in September from Uber Technologies Inc, said during the town hall, "We need to be comfortable with that discomfort" of self-critical research.Google declined to comment on the Friday meeting.An internal email, seen by Reuters, offered fresh detail on Google researchers' concerns, showing exactly how Google's legal department had modified one of the three AI papers, called "Extracting Training Data from Large Language Models."The email, dated Feb. 8, from a co-author of the paper, Nicholas Carlini, went to hundreds of colleagues, seeking to draw their attention to what he called "deeply insidious" edits by company lawyers."Let's be clear here," the roughly 1,200-word email said. "When we as academics write that we have a 'concern' or find something 'worrying' and a Google lawyer requires that we change it to sound nicer, this is very much Big Brother stepping in."Required edits, according to his email, included "negative-to-neutral" swaps such as changing the word "concerns" to "considerations," and "dangers" to "risks." Lawyers also required deleting references to Google technology; the authors' finding that AI leaked copyrighted content; and the words "breach" and "sensitive," the email said.Carlini did not respond to requests for comment. Google in answer to questions about the email disputed its contention that lawyers were trying to control the paper's tone. The company said it had no issues with the topics investigated by the paper, but it found some legal terms used inaccurately and conducted a thorough edit as a result.RACIAL EQUITY AUDITGoogle last week also named Marian Croak, a pioneer in internet audio technology and one of Google's few Black vice presidents, to consolidate and manage 10 teams studying issues such as racial bias in algorithms and technology for disabled individuals.Croak said at Friday's meeting that it would take time to address concerns among AI ethics researchers and mitigate damage to Google's brand."Please hold me fully responsible for trying to turn around that situation," she said on the recording.Johnson added that the AI organization is bringing in a consulting firm for a wide-ranging racial equity impact assessment. The first-of-its-kind audit for the department would lead to recommendations "that are going to be pretty hard," she said.Tensions in Dean's division had deepened in December after Google let go of Timnit Gebru, co-lead of its ethical AI research team, following her refusal to retract a paper on language-generating AI. Gebru, who is Black, accused the company at the time of reviewing her work differently because of her identity and of marginalizing employees from underrepresented backgrounds. Nearly 2,700 employees signed an open letter in support of Gebru.During the town hall, Dean elaborated on what scholarship the company would support."We want responsible AI and ethical AI investigations," Dean said, giving the example of studying technology's environmental costs. But it is problematic to cite data "off by close to a factor of a hundred" while ignoring more accurate statistics as well as Google's efforts to reduce emissions, he said. Dean previously has criticized Gebru's paper for not including important findings on environmental impact.Gebru defended her paper's citation. "It's a really bad look for Google to come out this defensively against a paper that was cited by so many of their peer institutions," she told Reuters.Employees continued to post about their frustrations over the last month on Twitter as Google investigated and then fired ethical AI co-lead Margaret Mitchell for moving electronic files outside the company. Mitchell said on Twitter that she acted "to raise concerns about race & gender inequity, and speak up about Google's problematic firing of Dr. Gebru."Mitchell had collaborated on the paper that prompted Gebru's departure, and a version that published online last month without Google affiliation named "Shmargaret Shmitchell" as a co-author. Asked for comment, Mitchell expressed through an attorney disappointment in Dean's critique of the paper and said her name was removed following a company order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-pledges-changes-to-research-oversight-after-internal-revolt-101614252068588.html
25-02-2021||World||LoC ceasefire outcome of ‘behind the scenes’ contacts: Pakistan’s de facto NSA||The agreement between the Indian and Pakistani armies on the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) is the outcome of “behind the scenes” contacts and “more roads will open” in future, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s key advisor on security affairs said on Thursday.Moeed Yusuf, who holds the post of special assistant to Khan on national security and strategic policy planning, said in an audio statement released in Islamabad that the ceasefire, which began at midnight on February 24, is a “very solid and positive” development and should be welcomed.“So when people ask what is the [Pakistan] government’s policy and what is it doing on Kashmir, and nothing is happening, they should realise that such things are done behind the scenes. Lots of effort is being made,” Yusuf said, speaking in Urdu.“This is our success and the success of diplomacy and, God willing, more roads will open in the future,” he added.As first reported by Hindustan Times, the joint statement by the armies of India and Pakistan on the ceasefire came months after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart Moeed Yusuf initiated back-channel conversations to ensure peace on the borders.Doval and Yusuf have been in touch directly and via interlocutors from the intelligence community, and the joint statement was the first outcome of these conversations that included at least one face-to-face meeting in a third country.Yusuf appeared to be alluding to these conversations when he spoke of things being done “behind the scenes”. He added: “Do you think that, without effort and without pressure, this thing happened that India was not agreeing to for so many months and years?”He also contended that the joint statement was a “victory for Pakistan” as India was not agreeing to a ceasefire. Pakistan, he said, was “repeatedly saying that we want peace and we want that there should be a ceasefire at the LoC” so that innocent civilians aren’t killed.“Today’s development is very solid and positive and it should be welcomed and it is the success of our policy that is being seen in this development,” Yusuf said. He added: “The problem of Kashmir that we want to resolve, and the way we want to resolve it, will happen.”People familiar with developments in Islamabad said Yusuf has been playing a key role in efforts to foster a rapprochement with India and that his work has the backing of the powerful military, including Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.Addressing a graduation ceremony at the Pakistan Air Force Academy on February 3, Bajwa had said that Pakistan is committed to peaceful co-existence and the time had come to extend a “hand of peace in all directions”. He had also said that Pakistan and India should resolve the Kashmir issue in a “dignified and peaceful manner”.Bajwa’s remarks were then perceived as an offer for talks, but the external affairs ministry said on February 4 that the onus was on Pakistan for creating an environment free of terror, hostility and violence to foster normal neighbourly relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loc-ceasefire-outcome-of-behind-the-scenes-contacts-pakistan-s-de-facto-nsa-101614251572895.html
25-02-2021||World||Explained: Why Facebook, Instagram took extreme step of banning Myanmar military||Facebook Inc. has banned Myanmar’s military from its social media platforms in the aftermath of a coup that saw the ouster of the country's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The decision to ban the Tatmadaw came amid massive protests against the military rule and subsequent crackdown on the demonstrators. Days after Facebook took down the main page of the Myanmar military, the social media company on Wednesday said that it is banning the Tatmadaw, military-controlled state and media entities from Facebook and Instagram with immediate effect.What led to the complete Facebook ban on the Myanmar military?Citing the volatile situation in the country, Facebook announced a slew of measures on February 11 to “protect freedom of expression” of Myanmar citizens and “prevent online content from being linked to offline harm”. The social media firm accused Myanmar’s military of spreading misinformation through their Facebook Pages and profiles, saying it has decided to significantly reduce the distribution of all content on such pages and profiles.The military had questioned the authenticity of nearly 9 million votes in November elections, suggesting the possibility of “voting malpractice.” The United Elections Commission (UEC), a national level electoral commission responsible for organising and overseeing elections, later asserted that there was no evidence of electoral fraud. Facebook said that it will remove all misinformation claiming that there was widespread fraud or foreign interference in Myanmar’s November election.On Wednesday, Rafael Frankel, Facebook’s director of policy for APAC emerging countries, said in a statement that the “risks of allowing the Tatmadaw on Facebook and Instagram are too great.” He said that Facebook is treating the situation in Myanmar as an emergency and events following the military coup, including the deadly shooting, have precipitated a need for this ban.Read | Myanmar blocks Wikipedia in all languages: NetBlocksHere’s are the guiding factors that led to Facebook’s decision to ban the Tatmadaw:The Facebook official noted that Myanmar’s military has a history of “exceptionally severe human rights abuses” and there’s a clear risk of violence in future initiated by the military.Frankel cited Tatmadaw’s history of on-platform content and behaviour violations as one of the guiding factors.He said that that coup greatly increases the danger posed by the behaviours of military Pages and accounts and the online threats could lead to offline harm.How has Facebook fared in the past?During the crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, the ethnic minority group in Myanmar, several reports claimed that Myanmar military personnel turned Facebook into a tool for ethnic cleansing. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims were forced to take refuge in several camps in Bangladesh after the Tatmadaw launched a crackdown on the minority group. Last year, Facebook announced course correction ahead of the November elections after admitting that it failed to prevent the misuse of its platforms to “foment division and incite offline violence” in Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-facebook-instagram-took-extreme-step-of-banning-myanmar-military-101614250102864.html

25-02-2021||World||Xi Jinping declares ‘complete victory’ over rural poverty in China||President Xi Jinping on Thursday announced “complete victory”, led by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), against rural poverty in China at an event in Beijing celebrating one of his signature policy initiatives since taking office in 2012.“Shaking off poverty is not the finish line, but the starting line of a new life and new endeavour,” Xi Jinping said at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing where he presented medals to key figures in the poverty fight. “A human miracle has been created that will go down in history,” Xi added.Chinese state media called the achievement a “miracle” and said it was under Xi’s leadership that nearly 100 million people had been lifted out of poverty. Reports called it a gift for 100th the anniversary of the party, coming up later this year.The Communist party’s mouthpiece, People’s Daily, lauded the “historic leap” led by Xi.China will not forget those 1,800 people who sacrificed their lives while fighting on the front lines of China’s battle against poverty, Xi said, adding that they represented the original aspiration and mission of CPC members.State media reports said in the last eight years, the final 98.99 million impoverished rural residents living under the current poverty line have all been lifted out of poverty.“Since the launch of the reform and opening up in the late 1970s, 770 million impoverished rural residents have shaken off poverty when calculated in accordance with China’s current poverty line,” news agency Xinhua said.China vowed to stick with its poverty alleviation policies, while making some adjustments for a five-year transition towards what Beijing calls “rural revitalisation” in a “No. 1 policy document” released on Sunday.The current rural poverty line, according to a Xinhua report in December 2020, is 2,300 yuan per person per year at the 2010 price level. “The specific figure is subject to adjustment as the country’s price levels change. In 2019, the poverty line was 3,218 yuan (about $490.61)” - the equivalent of $1.34 per day.Indermit Gill, a non-resident senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development programme at Brookings Institution, wrote last month that the World Bank believes that a threshold of $1.90 a day is appropriate for countries with per capita incomes of less than $1,000 or so, such as Ethiopia.“For lower middle-income countries such as India - with per capita incomes between $1,000 and about $4,000 - it recommends a poverty line of $3.20 a day.”“For upper middle-income countries like China, it reckons that a reasonable poverty line is $5.50 a day. In other words, the Chinese government uses a poverty line appropriate for a country making the transition from low to lower middle-income, even though China is 10 times as wealthy,” Gill wrote.The urban poverty line is also different from the rural definition of poverty in China. There is no unified standard for the whole country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-declares-complete-victory-over-rural-poverty-in-china-101614249412655.html

Diplomats and other foreigners with special status are exempted from a ban on most foreigners entering the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-subjecting-us-diplomats-to-covid-19-anal-tests-101614247351818.html
25-02-2021||World||Poorer Texans already had trouble paying energy bills, then came the storm||Cleopatra Mancha had already lost her job in the pandemic. Then the winter storm came to her home state of Texas."We had all the pipes bust in our house. It wasn't just one area - it was everywhere. In the bathrooms, our sinks, where our washer and dryer are," she said. "So we're not having to just try to pay just our electric bill - we have to pay for all these repairs, too."The 44-year-old mother of two in Arlington, Texas, choked back sobs.Energy insecurity among poor and middle-class Americans had already deepened because of the economic crisis the pandemic created, according to experts. Even before the pandemic, low-income households in Texas were spending 10% of their income on energy - compared with 2% for the better off.Energy-burdened poorer Texans have been forced to buy less food to keep the lights on one month, or put off purchasing clothes another month to keep the heat going.In Texas last week, 4 million people were without power for days and half saw water services disrupted. Across the United States, experts say, households will suffer unless energy policies are reworked, grid infrastructure improved and deep investments made to fix the 30 million housing units that have serious physical or health hazards, over one-fifth of the nation's total.Dana Harmon is the executive director of the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, which has been tracking increasingly unaffordable electric bills in lower-income communities and in neighborhoods of color. The pandemic has forced people out of work and at home for increasingly long periods - including children learning at a distance. That has increased demand for household energy consumption."Now when you put a storm on top of that," Harmon said, "you see people facing real danger."There has been much attention cast on energy bills exceeding $10,000 for some Texas customers subject to variable energy market prices. Harmon said those customers only make up about 0.2% of all consumers in the competitive electricity market. She is more concerned about the 3.5 million low-income households across Texas that have already been paying a disproportionate chunk of their income for energy and likely face higher bills as fuel costs have risen for utility companies.Harmon said a saving grace from the widespread blackouts might be that leaders in Austin who are making decisions on planning for energy systems, along with industry leaders in Houston and elsewhere, "keenly experienced what it's like to go without energy during a crisis, and I hope we would see more empathy for what energy insecurity feels like."Other advocacy groups like the Southwest Workers Union in San Antonio say landlords are finding loopholes to evict tenants behind on rent and a wider moratorium on evictions is needed.Michelle Romero - national director for Dream Corps, an environmental, technology and social justice group - said that the grid in Texas and across the United States needs to be modernized to increase energy security.Romero also said federal programs meant to help low-income households by offering funds for weatherization or bill relief badly need more funding and to be reworked so they cover more people.A study released by Dream Corps on Wednesday found 30 million homes across the United States have serious physical or health hazards, from asbestos to structural damages, making it impossible for many to properly heat or cool their homes. The damage can also disqualify the homes from obtaining federal aid in the first place.Romero said that just as the pandemic has allowed a wider public to see the intersections between race and health care disparities, she thinks the events like the Texas freeze are driving home the realities about who bears the brunt of extreme weather events."Who is impacted first and worst by events like we saw in Texas is absolutely an issue of income inequality and racial injustice," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poorer-texans-already-had-trouble-paying-energy-bills-then-came-the-storm-101614247574354.html

Imports also rose 37.7%, leaving a trade deficit of HK$25.2 billion ($3.9 billion), the government said Thursday.Exports to China have been a key driver of Hong Kong’s nascent economic recovery as the mainland continues to lead the regional rebound from the pandemic. While Hong Kong’s economy posted a record 6.1% contraction overall in 2020, a surge in exports to the mainland beginning in September helped the city to return to quarter-on-quarter growth in the latter half of the year.Hong Kong’s economy will return to growth this year and expand between 3.5% and 5.5%, Financial Secretary Paul Chan forecast in his budget speech Wednesday, although that is dependent on the global rollout of vaccines to spur a return of external demand and international travel.“We hope that from the second half of the year we will see more vibrancy in the economy,” Chan said at a press conference after announcing the budget.Chan announced more than HK$120 billion of stimulus Wednesday including HK$5,000 in spending vouchers for each resident and loans for the unemployed. He also proposed raising taxes on stock transactions to generate more revenue and narrow an expected record budget deficit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-january-exports-surge-most-since-1992-on-asia-boost-101614244504296.html

He pleaded guilty to the charge of treason, TASS said.His trial was held behind closed doors and its details were not made public because of its classified nature.Also read: Biden administration prepares to impose sanctions on Russia over Navalny stirVasilyev gathered and handed over information that constituted a state secret to China's intelligence services, TASS cited a law enforcement source as saying.The case points to the tensions behind the Kremlin's push for closer ties with China since 2014, when relations with the West collapsed over Russia's annexation of Crimea.Last year state prosecutors charged a prominent Russian scientist with treason for allegedly passing secrets to China. Another scientist was detained in Siberia last October for allegedly passing technology to China.There have been a spate of treason cases in recent months.One case in particular, that of former newspaper journalist Ivan Safronov who denies wrongdoing, has sparked anger among his supporters about the secrecy surrounding the treason allegation against him that makes it difficult to scrutinise the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-jails-man-for-eight-years-for-handing-over-secrets-to-china-tass-101614238484675.html

Five people died in the violence.More than 200 people have been charged so far for their roles in the riot, including some with ties to far-right fringe groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.An FBI warning that a protest by Trump supporters could turn violent reached the US Capitol Police the day before the assault, but top officials in charge of securing Congress that day did not see it, they told lawmakers on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-police-was-quickly-overwhelmed-during-riots-acting-chief-says-101614245204663.html

25-02-2021||World||US report on Khashoggi death expected to single out Saudi crown prince||A declassified version of a US intelligence report expected to be released on Thursday finds that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, four US officials familiar with the matter said.The officials said the report, for which the CIA was the main contributor, assessed that the crown prince approved and likely ordered the murder of Khashoggi, whose Washington Post column had criticized the crown prince’s policies.President Joe Biden, a Democrat who succeeded the Republican Donald Trump five weeks ago, told reporters on Wednesday he had read the report and expected to speak soon by phone with Saudi Arabian King Salman, 85, father of the crown prince, the country's 35-year-old de facto ruler.The report's release is part of Biden's policy to realign ties with Riyadh after years of giving the Arab ally and major oil producer a pass on its human rights record and its intervention in Yemen’s civil war.Biden is working to restore the relationship with Riyadh to traditional lines after four years of cozier ties under Trump.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday Biden would only communicate with the Saudi king and said the declassified Khashoggi report was being readied for release soon.While Biden restricts his contacts to the king, others in the Biden administration are talking to Saudi officials at various levels."We have been in touch with Saudi officials at numerous levels in the early weeks of this administration," said State Department spokesman Ned Price.The 59-year old Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist, was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, and killed by a team of operatives linked to the crown prince. They then dismembered his body. His remains have never been found.Riyadh eventually admitted that Khashoggi was killed in a “rogue” extradition operation gone wrong, but it denied any involvement by the crown prince. Five men given the death penalty for the murder had their sentences commuted to 20 years in jail after being forgiven by Khashoggi’s family.In 2019, a UN human rights investigator, Agnes Callamard, accused Saudi Arabia of a "deliberate, premeditated execution" of Khashoggi and called for further investigation.“There is sufficient credible evidence regarding the responsibility of the crown prince demanding further investigation,” Callamard said after the six-month probe.A classified version of the report was shared with members of Congress in late 2018.But the Trump administration rejected demands by lawmakers and human rights groups to release a declassified version, seeking to preserve cooperation amid rising tensions with Riyadh’s regional rival, Iran, and promote US arms sales to the kingdom.Biden's new director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, committed at her confirmation hearing to complying with a provision in a 2019 defense bill that required the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to release within 30 days a declassified report on Khashoggi's murder.Biden pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign to reassess US-Saudi ties in part over Khashoggi’s murder. Since taking office, he has ended sales of offensive arms that Riyadh could use in Yemen and appointed a special envoy to boost diplomatic efforts to end that country’s grueling civil war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-report-on-khashoggi-death-expected-to-single-out-saudi-crown-prince-101614243786663.html

China then assured the US that the tests were given “in error” as diplomats were exempt, the report said, citing an unidentified State Department spokesperson.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday told reporters that he checked with his colleagues about the report, and said it wasn’t true “as far as I know.”“China never asked US diplomatic personnel in China to go through anal swabs in Covid testing,” Zhao said.While China doesn’t have a nationwide policy on use of anal swabs, they have been used increasingly this year on everyone from schoolchildren to travelers arriving to Beijing. The method involves the insertion of a saline-soaked cotton swab about two-to-three centimeters into the anus, with the sample then tested for active traces of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-never-asked-us-diplomats-to-take-anal-swab-tests-for-covid19-101614242280192.html

He further said that the US' too much reliance on China's CDC resulted in the American health officials not getting information about the outbreak sooner.However, China's CDC was "left in the dark and even the centre's director "did not know this thing was circulating until the last day of December", said the former security while adding that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had put the PLA in charge of handling the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan.The PLA tried to "cover this thing up, to try to contain it until it was too late", he reiterated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-coverup-secret-experiments-in-wuhan-by-pla-fmr-us-security-advisor-101614230009385.html

Kim Chung Il was appointed as air and anti-air force chief and promoted to lieutenant general.The news agency did not specify their previous positions, just calling them "comrades." According to South Korean news outlets, these people are unknown to media and can be considered "new faces."Several dozen commanding officers have also been promoted to lieutenant general and major general.South Korean media stress that the promotions were given to young commanders, not the "mature" military leadership, in what may be a "generational change" to get rid of corruption in the army and improve morale and discipline.Media outlets also suggest that the reshuffle of the air force and navy command is related to the strengthening of border security after the 2020 incident, when a South Korean fisheries official who accidentally swam into North Korea's waters was shot dead by the military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-appoints-new-navy-air-force-chiefs-in-generation-shift-101614241971912.html

25-02-2021||World||Capitol police were warned of violence before riot: Chief||Capitol Police knew armed extremists were primed for violence at the iconic building on January 6 and even provided officers with assault rifles to protect lawmakers, the acting chief acknowledged Wednesday. But the wild invasion of the Capitol was far worse than police expected, leaving them unprepared to fight it off.A day earlier, her predecessor as chief testified that police expected an enraged but more typical protest crowd of Donald Trump supporters. But Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said intelligence collected ahead of the riot prompted the agency to take extraordinary measures, including the special arming of officers, intercepting radio frequencies used by the invaders and deploying spies at the Ellipse rally where President Donald Trump was sending his supporters marching to the Capitol to “fight like hell.”Pittman's testimony, submitted ahead of a House hearing on Thursday, provides the most detailed account yet of the intelligence and preparations by US Capitol Police ahead of the insurrection when thousands of pro-Trump rioters invaded the Capitol aiming to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election victory over Trump.Three days earlier, On January 3, Capitol Police distributed an internal intelligence assessment warning that militia members, white supremacists and other extremist groups were likely to participate, that demonstrators would be armed and that it was possible they would come to the Capitol to try to disrupt the vote, Pittman says.“Based on the assessment, the Department understood that this demonstration would be unlike the previous demonstrations held by protesters with similar ideologies in November and December 2020,” Pittman says in her prepared remarks.But at the same time, she argues police didn't have enough intelligence to predict the violent insurrection that resulted in five deaths, including that of a Capitol Police officer. They prepared for trouble but not an invasion."Although the Department's January 3rd Special Assessment foretold of a significant likelihood for violence on Capitol grounds by extremists groups, it did not identify a specific credible threat indicating that thousands of American citizens would descend upon the US Capitol attacking police officers with the goal of breaking into the US Capitol Building to harm Members and prevent the certification of Electoral College votes,” Pittman says in her testimony.Steven Sund, the police force's former chief who resigned after the riot, testified Tuesday that the intelligence assessment warned white supremacists, members of the far-right Proud Boys and leftist antifa were expected to be in the crowd and might become violent.“We had planned for the possibility of violence, the possibility of some people being armed, not the possibility of a coordinated military style attack involving thousands against the Capitol,” Sund said.The FBI also forwarded a warning to local law enforcement officials about online postings that a “war” was coming. But Pittman said it still wasn't enough to prepare for the mob that attacked the Capitol.Officers were vastly outnumbered as thousands of rioters descended on the building, some of them wielding planks of wood, stun guns, bear spray and metal pipes as they broke through windows and doors and stormed through the Capitol. Officers were hit with barricades, shoved to the ground, trapped between doors, beaten and bloodied as members of Congress were evacuated and congressional staffers cowered in offices.Should police have been better prepared?With the amount of information available to the Capitol Police, it's surprising that they didn't take additional steps to reinforce security and protect their officers, said Tom Warrick, a former counterterrorism official who served in the Obama administration.“On January 6, the one strategic location in the entire US national capital region that had to be defended was the US Capitol,” said Warrick, now with the Atlantic Council. “So it was really disappointing you have people testifying that we didn't know there would be violence.' When you are the target, you assume that things like that can happen even if you don't have the intel.”Even without access to secure intelligence, there were months of warning signs in public view that rioters would try to do what they did, said Bruce Hoffman, a former commissioner on the 9/11 Review Commission and a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security for the Council on Foreign Relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-were-warned-of-violence-before-riot-chief-101614241110262.html

That was well within what the company and regulators previously believed was safe, according to two people familiar with the investigation.The fan blade, apparently weakened from a growing fatigue crack, broke shortly after takeoff, raining debris onto the ground and causing minor damage to the United Airlines Holdings Inc. plane, a Boeing Co. 777-200. No one was hurt.In 2019, the US Federal Aviation Administration had required additional inspections of blades on PW4000 models with 112-inch fans following a 2018 failure on a United flight to Hawaii. The FAA order called for initial inspections starting after blades had completed between 6,500 and 7,000 flight cycles.However, Saturday’s failure appears to have occurred well before then, said the two people, who requested anonymity because they weren’t permitted to discuss details of the inquiry.Also read| FAA met to discuss more frequent engine inspections days before Denver incidentThe fan blade’s inspection history was reported earlier by Reuters.The significance of the failure after only about 3,000 flights isn’t clear. It’s possible the inspection interval wasn’t adequate, but an investigation into the 2018 failure found that inspections had missed a growing crack. After that, the company had inspected more than 9,000 blades, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.The FAA on Tuesday issued an emergency order requiring all fan blades on the Pratt & Whitney models used on the 777 be tested before planes could return to carrying passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fan-blade-same-as-united-plane-in-denver-used-in-almost-3-thousand-flights-101614233535369.html
25-02-2021||World||US Congress introduces Countering Chinese Propaganda Act||A legislation has been introduced in the US Congress for countering the Chinese propaganda by creating a new sanctions authority against state-backed disinformation networks.Republican Study Committee Chairman Congressman Jim Banks and Senator Tom Cotton on Wednesday introduced the Countering Chinese Propaganda Act.The bill requires the Secretary of State to examine whether or not the United Front Work Department meets the criteria to be sanctioned under this new authority.The legislation is based on recommendations from the Republican Study Committee’s National Security Strategy and authorises sanctions against the United Front Work Department (UFWD), which is an overseas influence arm of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).The United Front participated directly in the Uyghur genocide and the oppression of Christians in China, but its ultimate goal is to spread those persecutory tactics around the globe, Banks said."The leadership in Washington may have changed, but China’s political warfare hasn’t. It’s fallen to Congress to expose and counter Communist Party disinformation. We can’t back down now,“ he said.“The Chinese Communist Party expands its disinformation campaign each day – concealing information on the origin of COVID-19, lying about its oppression of Uighurs and other religious minorities, and infiltrating American universities and businesses,” Cotton said.“The United Front Work Department (UFWD) is just another venue for the CCP to spread its propaganda and to co-opt foreign groups to toe the CPC line. We must put an end to their tactics,” he said.Meanwhile, the Republican Study Committee Member Congressman Jody Hice sent a letter to the Carter Center in Georgia expressing concern over the group’s decision to co-host an event with the Chinese People’s Association for Peace and Disarmament, which is an organisation affiliated with the UFWD.Four Senators -- Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, Chuck Grassley and Rob Portman -- on Wednesday wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden to implement a proposed rule requiring US academic institutions to disclose their relationships with Confucius Institutes, which are funded by the CPC headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-introduces-countering-chinese-propaganda-act-101614232699528.html
25-02-2021||World||Myanmar protests: Truck drivers join movement against military coup||Thousands of striking truck drivers in Myanmar protesting the military coup have slowed delivery of imports, trapping cargo containers at ports and prompting at least one international shipping line to halt new orders.About 100 containers a day are moving out of Yangon’s four main ports, said Myo Htut Aung, joint secretary of the Myanmar Container Trucking Association, down from an average of 800 boxes before the coup. About 90% of the city’s 4,000 container-truck drivers have halted work, he said.The situation may add to a global container shortage triggered by the pandemic as government lockdowns to curb infections limit travel and consumers buy more goods. Spot rates for transporting 40-foot boxes rose 50% on average in 2020, according to World Container Index data and Bloomberg Intelligence.“The truckers’ protest has severely affected operations at container terminals,” said Myo Htut Aung. “If drivers don’t pick up goods, all the containers have to be kept at the ports.”Massive protests opposing the Feb. 1 coup have persisted in defiance of a military ban on public gatherings, with hundreds of thousands of people flooding streets across the country during a nationwide strike on Monday. The coupmakers have urged civil servants to get back to work, insisting they will hold a fresh election after a yearlong state of emergency. Three protesters have been killed in clashes with police so far.German shipping line Hapag-Lloyd AG told customers last week that while vessel operations into and out of Myanmar ports haven’t been significantly impacted, container terminals were close to full and road transportation limited. The company temporarily suspended new import bookings into Myanmar.Truck drivers have said they will transport essential food, medicine and fabrics for factories but only about 30% of normal container volumes are moving through Yangon’s ports via truck, said Kyaw Lwin Oo, vice chairman of the Myanmar International Freight Forwarders’ Association.The disruptions could impact the global textile and garment industries. Myanmar imported more than $1 billion in woven fabrics and sold about $2.4 billion in suits in 2019, according to the World Trade Organization. Apart from fuels, the country’s top purchases include medicines and motorbikes, which are typically shipped in containers.Myanmar’s top trade partners in 2019 were China, Thailand and Singapore, according to International Monetary Fund data compiled by Bloomberg.Other international shipping lines are also worried about port congestion and have cut sailings to the country or halted new bookings in anticipation of further delays, according to the Myanmar International Freight Forwarders’ Association and maritime consultant Drewry.On Tuesday, protest crowds were smaller and factories, shops and transport companies restarted activity, said Nils Haupt, a spokesman for Hapag-Lloyd. However, with many major roads still blocked by demonstrators and with some drivers still protesting, trucking availability into and out of ports remains affected, he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-truck-drivers-join-movement-against-military-coup-101614236076736.html

The UN and rights groups have reported that many of the about 90 refugees on board were suffering acute dehydration and their families back in refugee camps are worried many may have already died.UNHCR spokesperson Catherine Stubberfield said she appreciated the efforts of the Indian coast guard. "But given that the refugees are still adrift at sea, immediate disembarkation is absolutely critical to meeting their most basic human needs and ensuring that their safety is no longer threatened,” she said.Also read| Facebook bans all Myanmar military-linked accounts and adsThe UN agency said it did not know the boat’s exact location. On Monday it alerted nearby nations to look for the boat and said it was prepared to offer humanitarian assistance.The mother of a 25-year-old man reportedly on the boat said she was praying for his safety.“Oh God, save all of the people that are stuck on the boat including my son with your divine magic. Put them somewhere on the coast of the river. Please fulfill the wishes of my son to go there,” said Nasima Khatun. She spoke from Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar on the Bangladesh's border with Myanmar.“Is my son alive? Has anything happened to him because of hunger? I do not know anything about what my son is doing, how he is surviving. He only took four liters of water,” she said.Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project that monitors Rohingya Muslims who had fled persecution and violence in Myanmar for refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh, said her group heard of at least eight people who died on the boat.Also read| Pak caught in China's debt-trap diplomacy, seeks relief from 'iron ally': ReportLewa said the boat left the coast on Feb. 11 for a destination in Southeast Asia but its engine broke down. The Arakan Project has been unable to contact the refugees for several days.“We had talked to them. But now they are traceless. They have no water or food, they are drinking seawater and dying,” Lewa said by phone.Authorities in Bangladesh said they had no information about any boat that recently carried the refugees out of Bangladesh’s waters.More than 1 million Rohingya who fled Myanmar are living in crowded camps. Several attempts to repatriate them have failed because the refugees refuse to go back fore fear of more violence in a country that denies them basic rights including citizenship.Human traffickers often lure the refugees, promising them work in Southeast Asian nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unhcr-praises-indian-coast-guard-for-helping-rohingya-adrift-in-andaman-sea-101614230603428.html
25-02-2021||World||Xi Jinping trumpets 'victory' in 1.6 trillion yuan campaign to end rural poverty||Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated "complete victory" in the effort to eradicate rural poverty at a ceremony in Beijing on Thursday to mark a signature initiative of his eight-year tenure.State media credit Xi's leadership with lifting nearly 100 million people from poverty, a milestone he declared in December and framed as a birthday gift for this year's 100th anniversary of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP).In an hour-long speech, Xi hailed what he called a testament to the party's leadership and the advantages of China's political system."The CCP's leadership and China's socialist system are the fundamental guarantees against risks, challenges and difficulties," Xi said in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, where he presented medals to key figures in the poverty fight.Some global policy experts have said China sets a low bar in its definition of poverty, with sustained investment required to fund continued development in its poorest areas.China defines extreme rural poverty as annual per capita income of less than 4,000 yuan ($620), or about $1.69 a day at current exchange rates. That compares with the World Bank's global threshold of $1.90 a day.Xi said China had invested 1.6 trillion yuan in fighting povery over the past eight years, but did not give figures for spending planned over the next five years.In a "No. 1 policy document" released on Sunday, China vowed to stick with its poverty alleviation policies, while making some adjustments for a five-year transition towards what Beijing calls "rural revitalisation".State media publicised the milestone, with a commentary of more than two pages in the party's main newspaper, the People's Daily, lauding the "historic leap" led by Xi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-trumpets-victory-in-1-6-trillion-yuan-campaign-to-end-rural-poverty-101614234941232.html
25-02-2021||World||Biden signs executive orders to address vulnerabilities in supply chains||President Joe Biden has signed a series of executive orders to address vulnerabilities in supply chains across additional critical sectors of the US economy in an effort to boost domestic production and avoid shortages in goods amid the coronavirus pandemic.The executive order, Biden told reporters on Wednesday is about making sure that the country can meet every challenge it faces in this new era - pandemics, but also in defence, cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more.The order will help address the vulnerabilities in “our supply chains across additional critical sectors of our economy so that the American people are prepared to withstand any crisis and rely on ourselves.”“And the best way to do that is by protecting and sharpening America's competitive edge by investing here at home. As I've said from the beginning, while I was running: We're going to invest in America. We're going to invest in American workers. And then we can be in a much better position to even compete beyond what we're doing now,” Biden said.He said that the solution to supply chain issues will be to increase domestic production in certain industries as well as work with allies to prevent future shortages.Observing that the US needs to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable, Biden said that he is directing senior officials in his administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate.One of the executive orders signed by him orders a 100-day review of four vital products: semiconductors; key minerals and materials, like rare earths, that are used to make everything from harder steel to airplanes; three, pharmaceuticals and their ingredients; four, advanced batteries, like the ones used in electric vehicles, he said.“There's strong bipartisan support for fast reviews of these four areas because they're essential to protecting and strengthening American competitiveness,” Biden said adding that this order initiates a long-term review of the industry basis of six sectors of the overall economy over the next year.These reviews will identify policy recommendations to fortify supply chains.“It should be to fortify our supply chains at every step, and critically, to start implementing those recommendations right away."We're not going to wait for a review to be completed before we start closing the existing gaps,” he added.Later, Biden met with a bipartisan group of House and Senate members to discuss supply chain resilience and the need to work together in strengthening it.At a White House news conference, Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Sameera Fazili told reporters that creating more resilient supply chains is an opportunity for the country to come together to create well-paying jobs for workers across the US.“We know that even before the Covid-19 crisis, the economy was not working for most Americans. Worker pay was too low. Many families could not make ends meet. Many of the jobs that served as the heart of the middle class had been lost due to changes in both technology and the structure of the global economy,” she said.“Disruption is inevitable. But over the past few years, we have moved from crisis to crisis when some essential product was suddenly in short supply. What we need is the capacity to respond quickly when hit by a challenge. This executive order moves the whole government towards being more prepared,” she said.The executive orders signed by Biden asks agencies to review risks in supply chains and in domestic industrial bases, Fazili said.“They're going to think broadly about risk. There's climate risk and geopolitical risk, but there's also risk in not having enough workers ready to meet the needs of that sector, or enough factories or the right equipment to make a good -- or retool a shift -- to shift to a new spike in demand for an essential good,” she said.Fazili said that a big part of this executive order is consultation with stakeholders and experts.“This is a real opportunity to invest in the future of America and build on our nation's strengths. There are opportunities for small-business development to help diversify supplier networks and alleviate the risk of “too big to fail” companies in the supply chains for critical goods,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-signs-executive-orders-to-address-vulnerabilities-in-supply-chains-101614229925616.html
25-02-2021||World||Out competing China will be key to national security: Biden's CIA nominee||Out competing China will be key to America's national security in the decades ahead, President Joe Biden's pick to lead the CIA has told lawmakers, stressing that Beijing is the "biggest geopolitical test" that the US will face.Willian Burns, 64, a former diplomat who served in Russia and the Middle East, shared the assessment with members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday for the post of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director.“Out competing China will be key to our national security in the decades ahead. That will require a long-term clear eyed bipartisan strategy underpinned by domestic renewal and solid intelligence,” Burns said.“There will be areas in which it will be in our mutual self-interest to work with China from climate change to non-proliferation. And I am very mindful that (President) Xi Jinping's China is not without problems and frailties of its own,” he said.Also read: Chinese official calls for 'joint efforts' in China-US trade“The challenge posed by Xi Jinping's China, by an adversarial China, it is hard for me to see a more significant threat or challenge for the United States as far out as I can see into the 21st century than that one. It is the biggest geopolitical test that we face,” Burns said.The relations between the US and China are at an all-time low. The two countries are currently engaged in a bitter confrontation over various issues, including trade, the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the communist giant’s aggressive military moves in the disputed South China Sea and human rights.“There are, however, a growing number of areas in which Xi's China is a formidable authoritarian adversary, methodically strengthening its capabilities to steal intellectual property, repress its own people, bully its neighbours, expand its global reach, and build influence in American society,” Burns said.For the CIA, that will mean intensified focus and urgency, continually strengthening its already impressive cadre of China specialists, expanding its language skills, aligning personnel and resource allocation for the long haul, and employing a whole of agency approach to the operational and analytical challenges of this crucial threat, he told the lawmakers.“Another priority intimately connected to competition with China is technology,” he said.Responding to a question, Burns said that the evolution of China under Xi's rule over the last six or seven years has been a very sharp wake-up call in a lot of ways, the kind of aggressive, undisguised ambition and assertiveness has made very clear the nature of the adversary and rival that America faces today.Also read: Biden, Trudeau bypass tension for unity on virus, China, climate“The challenge is how do you build a long-term... We have to buckle up for the long haul, I think, in competition with China. This is not like the competition with the Soviet Union and the Cold War, which was primarily in security and ideological terms,” he said.“This is an adversary that is extraordinarily ambitious in technology and capable in economic terms as well. So it is buckling up for the long term and developing a very clear-eyed bipartisan strategy, which I think is entirely possible right now,” Burns said.Burns told lawmakers that it's important for the United States to view cooperation with China on climate issues is not a favour to the United States. It's in the self-interest of China to do that.“So, in other words, it's not something to be traded. It's in the self-interest of China as well to work on these issues. And it's important for us to be clear eyed about that, as I'm sure the president and Secretary (John) Kerry will be,” he said.The Chinese military has been flexing its muscles in the strategically vital Indo-Pacific region and is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea.Also at the hearing, Burns stressed the importance of "firmness and consistency" in responding to Russia, CNN reported.Burns said he learned through his foreign policy work "in dealing with those threats, responding to them and deterring them, firmness and consistency is hugely important, and it's also very important to work to the maximum extent possible with allies and partners.""We have more effects sometimes on Putin's calculus, when he sees responses coming, firm responses coming not just from the United States, but from our European allies and others as well. So, it pays off to work hard at widening that circle of countries who are going to push back," he was quoted as saying by the report.Burns also said that "it's always a mistake to underestimate Putin's Russia," noting that under Vladimir Putin's leadership it can be at least as disruptive as a rising power like China."So we have to be quite cold-eyed in our view of how those threats can emerge," he said.If confirmed, Burns won't be a member of Biden's Cabinet, which represents a change from the Trump administration, but a return to the status the job had in the Obama administration, the report added.CIA deputy director David Cohen has served in the role of acting director as Burns awaits confirmation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/out-competing-china-will-be-key-to-national-security-biden-s-cia-nominee-101614228019025.html

The event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing was televised live to the nation of 1.4 billion people by state media.Xi has made fighting poverty one of his main goals since becoming leader of the ruling Communist Party in late 2012. The party is expected to soon declare victory in building a “moderately prosperous” society, which would elevate living standards and bolster its legitimacy.Xi was the focus of a similar event in September last year in which he hailed China’s success in handling the coronavirus outbreak. Xi’s second term as party chief is set to expire next year, but he’s widely expected to stay on in that role after amending the constitution in 2018 to allow him to also remain in the position of president for a third term.Also read: Xi says, time, momentum on China's side as world faces unprecedented turbulenceThe People’s Daily, the party’s official mouthpiece, ran a three-page, 22,000-character article Wednesday summarizing the poverty-alleviation orders Xi has issued since taking power. His efforts “achieved great success and made a great contribution to global progress,” the newspaper said.China last year raised its official poverty line to people earning 4,000 yuan ($620) a year, up from 2,625 yuan in 2012, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. While that is higher than the World Bank’s absolute poverty line, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development defines anyone with income less than half the median as being poor.Using that standard, people in rural areas would need to earn above 7,500 yuan a year in China to escape poverty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-puts-personal-stamp-on-china-s-fight-against-poverty-101614223039845.html

Myanmar security forces burned down villages, killed civilians and engaged in mass rape in their campaign, which the World Court is investigating as a crime of genocide.Facebook in 2018 banned the accounts of several top Myanmar military leaders, including Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who led this month’s coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party. The general heads the junta that now acts as the government,The junta has tried to block Facebook and other social media platforms, but its efforts have proven ineffective.

25-02-2021||World||Huawei, controversial in the West, is going strong in the Gulf||Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is enjoying an extended honeymoon with oil-rich Gulf nations, despite being criticised in the United States and Europe as a potential security threat.Arab Gulf countries -- strategic partners of Washington that are seeking to diversify their economies -- are investing heavily in the sector as their appetite for technology grows.Huawei has struggled in recent years in the face of US sanctions, as Washington claims Huawei has close ties to China's military and that Beijing could use its equipment for espionage -- accusations the company denies.Britain and Sweden have banned the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G networks, while France has also imposed restrictions.Yet Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not only chosen Huawei for their 5G rollouts, but have also partnered with the company to develop "smart cities."These feature enhanced digital services and security surveillance -- a Huawei speciality Gulf states value highly for monitoring their populations.Gulf countries' "use of technologies for population surveillance is closer to the practices of China than those of Western countries," said Camille Lons, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Also read: Huawei challenges Trump claim of national security threatConcerns about Huawei voiced in the US and Europe "weren't convincing" in the region, she told AFP.- Mitigating 'political pressures' -While the telecoms giant has had a strong presence in the Gulf since the 1990s, its deals and big announcements there have multiplied in recent years.In January, Saudi Arabia announced it would open the largest Huawei store outside China in Riyadh, a few months after a deal with the company on developing artificial intelligence to support public and private sector growth.Last summer, Saudi investment firm Batic cemented a deal with Huawei to work on "smart city" projects in the kingdom, where it is already a main partner in the Yanbu Smart Industrial City project on the Red Sea.Huawei has also developed apps and digital infrastructure to support Muslim pilgrims visiting Mecca and Medina, Islam's two holiest sites."By gaining the trust of our partners in the Middle East, we have been able to mitigate external political pressures like those pursued by the US," Charles Yang, Huawei's Middle East chief, told AFP from the company's headquarters in Dubai.In the high-tech emirate, one of seven that make up the UAE, Huawei has launched projects ranging from data storage to online payment services for public transport networks.Dubai-based Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline, last year chose Huawei to build a centre to boost the company's surveillance and security capabilities.An Emirates spokesperson declined to elaborate on the precise nature of the technology, but said "such solutions are utilised... around the world primarily for public safety and security reasons".- 'Risk' for the US -China remains one of the Gulf's leading trade partners.UN figures show its 2019 trade with Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest exporter of crude oil -- reached about $36.4 billion, while with the UAE it exceeded $50 billion."Digital infrastructure has become a key pillar of (Gulf states') national transformation strategies," Yang said.Huawei said this month it hoped for a reset with Washington, after former US president Donald Trump targeted the firm as part of an intensifying China-US trade and technology standoff.But Lons from the International Institute for Strategic Studies warned the apparent Huawei-Gulf honeymoon could cause security worries for the US.She noted the presence of American military bases in the region, and that Gulf countries are "major buyers of US military equipment".There could be concerns about the "risk that sensitive US military information or technology is being spied on and transferred to China", she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-controversial-in-the-west-is-going-strong-in-the-gulf-101614221866482.html
25-02-2021||World||In boost for Covid-19 battle, Pfizer vaccine found 94% effective in real world||The first big real-world study of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be independently reviewed shows the shot is highly effective at preventing Covid-19, in a potentially landmark moment for countries desperate to end lockdowns and reopen economies.Up until now, most data on the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines has come under controlled conditions in clinical trials, leaving an element of uncertainty over how results would translate into the real world with its unpredictable variables.The research in Israel - two months into one of the world's fastest rollouts, providing a rich source of data - showed two doses of the Pfizer shot cut symptomatic Covid-19 cases by 94% across all age groups, and severe illnesses by nearly as much.The study of about 1.2 million people also showed a single shot was 57% effective in protecting against symptomatic infections after two weeks, according to the data published and peer-reviewed in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.The results of the study for the Clalit Research Institute were close to those in clinical trials last year which found two doses were found to be 95% effective."We were surprised because we expected that in the real-world setting, where cold chain is not maintained perfectly and the population is older and sicker, that you will not get as good results as you got in the controlled clinical trials," senior study author Ran Balicer told Reuters. "But we did and the vaccine worked as well in the real world.""We have shown the vaccine to be as effective in very different sub-groups, in the young and in the old in those with no co-morbidities and in those with few co-morbidities," he added.The study also suggests the vaccine, developed by US drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech, is effective against the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK. Researchers said they could not provide a specific level of efficacy, but the variant was the dominant version of the virus in Israel at the time of the study.The research did not shed light on how the Pfizer shot will fare against another variant, now dominant in South Africa, that has been shown to reduce the efficacy of other vaccines.'THIS IS MORE GREAT NEWS'Of the nine million people in Israel, a nation with universal healthcare, nearly half have received a first dose, and a third have received both doses since the rollout began on Dec. 19.This made the country a prime location for a real-world study into the vaccine's ability to stem the pandemic, along with its advanced data capabilities.The study examined about 600,000 vaccinated people against the same sized control group of unvaccinated people. Researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital also collaborated."This is more great news, confirming that the vaccine is around 90% effective at preventing documented infection of any degree of severity from 7 days after the second dose," said Peter English, a British government consultant in communicable disease control."Previous recently studied papers from Israel were observational studies. This one used an experimental design known as a case-control study ... giving greater confidence that differences between the groups are due to their vaccination status, and not to some other factor."The study published on Wednesday was the first analysis of a national Covid-19 vaccination strategy to be peer-reviewed. It also offered a more detailed look at how the vaccine was faring at weekly intervals, while matching people who received the shot to unvaccinated individuals with similar medical histories, sex, age and geographical characteristics.Other research centres in Israel, including the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Israel Institute of Technology have shared several studies in recent weeks that show the vaccine to be effective.At least three studies out of Israel have also suggested the vaccine can reduce coronavirus transmission, but the researchers have cautioned that wider studies must be conducted in order to establish clear-cut conclusions.GOT YOUR IMMUNITY PASS?The Weizmann Institute's latest data shows a dramatic drop in illness - which began this month with the first age group vaccinated, the over-60s - has now extended to the two subsequent groups to have completed both doses.As infections have fallen in Israel, the country has eased its third national lockdown and reopened swathes of its economy including malls, shops, schools and many workplaces in the past two weeks.Recreational venues such as theatres, gyms and hotels opened on Sunday, but are open only to those deemed immune - holders of a "Green Pass", a health ministry document available for download only by people seven days after their second dose or people who have recovered from Covid-19.On Wednesday, Tel Aviv held one of the country's first live concerts after months of gatherings being banned under coronavirus restrictions."This is so exciting, we are really so happy to be here today. It's unbelievable after one year of staying at home, it's great to be out to see some culture," said 60-year-old Gabi Shamir as she took her seat at the open-air show.Still, the vaccine's efficacy does not mean the country will be pandemic free any time soon. Like elsewhere in the world, a large proportion of the population are under 16 - about a third in Israel - meaning that they cannot yet get vaccinated as there have not been clinical trial results for children."This is definitely not the end of the pandemic," said Eran Kopel, an epidemiologist at Tel Aviv University. "Once there is a safe vaccine for the children in Israel and all over the world we can then start to say that we could be approaching herd immunity."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-boost-for-covid-19-battle-pfizer-vaccine-found-94-effective-in-real-world-101614224539126.html
25-02-2021||World||Military begins delivering vaccines in Texas, New York||The US military on Wednesday began delivering shots at coronavirus vaccination centres in Texas and New York and announced that service members will start staffing four centres in Florida and one in Philadelphia next week.The expanded vaccination effort came as Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met with military commanders overseeing the Covid-19 response effort. He also visited the vaccination centre in Los Angeles, the first staffed by the new active-duty military teams that are being developed.The Biden administration has said that delivering the vaccine to Americans is a top priority. The Pentagon is ramping up the deployment of what federal authorities say could be up to 100 vaccination teams around the country.The stepped-up efforts reflect the extent to which the coronavirus has devastated the United States, killing more than 500,000 Americans. While average daily deaths and new infections have been falling, some experts say too few Americans have been inoculated for the vaccine to be making enough of a difference. The decline instead is attributed to the passing of the holidays, more people staying indoors during the winter and better adherence to mask rules and social distancing.California has the highest coronavirus death toll in the nation, at more than 49,000. Austin is touring the federally run vaccination site that is set up on the campus of California State University of Los Angeles, which opened last week. The site, on the east side of LA, is staffed by a 222-member military team from Fort Carson, Colorado, and it highlights an effort by state leaders to make the vaccinations more available to communities hit hard by the pandemic.Watching the line of cars file slowly through the parking area on campus as people in their cars got shots, Austin spoke with troops who have been giving out vaccines. One soldier from the area told Austin how thrilled he was to be able to give his own mother a shot.“It almost brought me to tears,” Austin said later, recounting the story.Speaking to another group of service members working at the walk-up vaccination site, Austin said they need to take the leadership, coordination and compassionate skills they have learned doing this to their next mission.Austin told reporters later that the military is learning every day how to make the process more efficient. And he said one thing that has proved successful has been the mobile vaccination teams, and he intends to talk to agency leaders about expanding those.Despite the state's high death toll, the rates of new infections and hospitalizations continue to plummet across the state. Health officials said Sunday that the number of patients in California hospitals with Covid-19 has slipped below 7,000, a drop of more than a third over two weeks. Total cases are approaching 3.45 million.The positivity rate for people being tested has been falling for weeks, which means fewer people will end up in hospitals.In his first trip outside Washington as defence chief, Austin stopped in Colorado at US Northern Command and met with its commander, Air Force Gen. Glen VanHerck, who also heads the North American Aerospace Defence Command. Military officials there told reporters traveling with Austin that service members are delivering 6,000 shots a day in Los Angeles and will build to that number at the centre in Houston, where the 222-member team started working Wednesday.Smaller, 139-member teams began operations in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, and in Dallas, which has two. They are expected to soon be delivering 3,000 shots a day.Austin has so far approved the deployment of 25 military vaccination teams, which come in two sizes, 222 members and 139 members, and total about 4,700 service members. So far, 11 have either started or will begin next week.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has asked for 100 such teams, which would put the Defence Department on pace to deploy as many as 19,000 troops if all are needed. The troop number is almost double what federal authorities initially thought would be needed.The five military teams moving into cities this week include 139-member units going to Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville in Florida, and a 222-member team going to Philadelphia.The military has also sent three 25-member medical units to cities in New Jersey and is sending one to the US Virgin Islands.Military officials said developing new sites will depend on how much vaccine becomes available and whether states request the aid and can provide proper locations.Separately, in a video message to the military force, Austin urged service members to get the vaccine. The shot is voluntary because the vaccines have not yet gotten final approval from the Food and Drug Administration. And while rates vary, military units around the world say 30 to 60% percent of their troops who are offered the vaccine are declining. Military leaders said last week that they believe the overall declination rate is about 30%, but they say they do not have good data.Speaking to reporters in Los Angeles, Austin also acknowledged the reluctance in the Black community to the vaccine. As the first Black person to serve as defence chief, Austin said that he believes the vaccine is safe and that with enough information people will make the right decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/military-begins-delivering-vaccines-in-texas-new-york-101614219461659.html

Governments in Europe and Australia are increasingly sympathetic to this point of view. The two tech companies suck up the majority of US digital advertising dollars, which — among other problems — has hurt publishers.Also read| Australia passes code to force Google, Facebook pay media companies for contentFacebook said on Tuesday it would lift a ban on news links in Australian after the government agreed to tweak proposed legislation that would help publishers negotiate payments with Facebook and Google. Facebook was criticised for its ban, which also temporarily cut access to government pandemic, public health and emergency services on the social networking site.Facebook said Tuesday that the changes allow it to choose which publishers it will support and indicated that it will now start striking such deals in Australia.Google had already been signing content licensing deals with Australian media companies, and says that it has arrangements with more than 50 publishers in the country and more than 500 globally.There may be more such regulation in other countries.

25-02-2021||World||Biden to put Tanden in another post should her nomination fail||The Biden administration will find another role for Neera Tanden, the president’s pick for budget director, should her controversial nomination fail in the Senate, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on Wednesday.Klain said President Joe Biden is continuing to support Tanden as head of the Office of Management and Budget but his comments marked the first time a senior administration official described contingency plans if her nomination collapses.“If Neera Tanden is not confirmed, she will not become the budget director, we will find some other place for her to serve in the administration that doesn’t require Senate confirmation,” Klain told MSNBC. “But let me be clear: We’re gonna get Neera Tanden confirmed.”Klain said the White House is “fighting our guts out to get her confirmed” and hoping one Republican would offer support after West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would vote against her. Klain cited Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa as one of the lawmakers who has said he is open-minded about her nomination.Senate committees on Budget and on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs delayed votes planned for Wednesday on Tanden’s nomination, without announcing when they might be rescheduled. Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, a Vermont progressive who had been at odds with Tanden in the past, said his panel’s vote was delayed because she didn’t have enough support.Also read: What is the controversy around Neera Tanden’s Senate confirmation?Also read: Neera Tanden's committee vote delayed as doubts about confirmation mountThe Biden administration this week stepped up efforts to win over senators of both parties who have been put off by Tanden’s sharp words for lawmakers. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said they’re not yet at the point of withdrawing the nomination.“Neera Tanden has a record of working with people who disagree with her, working with people who have different viewpoints, and different objectives and priorities, and that’s something she would certainly take into the job if she’s confirmed,” Psaki said.Biden’s allies on Capitol Hill on Wednesday were reaching out to Democrats who haven’t expressed support yet for the nominee.“We’re doing a full scale effort, including the White House and members, to find support,” Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said Wednesday. Asked whether her nomination is in trouble, he said, “We’re working hard to make sure she’s out of trouble.”Wednesday’s committee postponements hint at further unease. Even before her confirmation gets to a floor vote in the 50-50 chamber, she has to clear both panels where Democrats can’t afford to lose any members because of their slim control.Tanden, 50, head of the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, has ties to Hillary Clinton and would be the first South Asian woman to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Although she was endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO labor union federation, she has made enemies on Capitol Hill by speaking negatively about Republicans and some progressives, including Sanders, the Budget chairman.Tanden faced criticism during her confirmation hearing for tweets about the very U.S. senators she now needs to win over. She deleted many of her more controversial posts, which led some lawmakers to question how transparent and nonpartisan she would be in a White House role that must work closely with Congress.Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, who serves on the Homeland Security Committee, hasn’t said whether she’ll support Tanden. Her office didn’t respond to requests for comment.Opposition by her or Sanders, who also hasn’t said how he would vote, would require additional Republican votes for Tanden to win confirmation in the full Senate, which is divided evenly along party lines.One of the few Republicans the White House could still woo is Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a moderate who has broken with her party on other issues. Murkowski was among the people Tanden has targeted on Twitter, including one 2017 tweet about tax policy.Murkowski said she wasn’t aware of that tweet when asked by reporters Wednesday. She said she had spoken with the White House about Tanden’s nomination.“I suggested to the White House that my colleagues were being very critical of the statements and rightly so. And some of them were clearly over the top,” Murkowski said. “I don’t think that’s a model that we want to set for anybody -- whether it’s a nominee, whether it’s a president or whether it’s a senator. So I’d like us all to cool that.”“I was trying to look at competence but apparently I’m going to have to do more looking into what she thinks about me,” Murkowski said, laughing.Grassley said earlier Wednesday he “had a couple of good conversations with her” and wants to discuss her nomination with other colleagues before deciding.But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is pushing all of the chamber’s GOP members to vote against the nomination.”I think that her record is pretty extensive of being very partisan, and there was a concern about whether or not that carries over to the job which is an important one and one we’re gonna have to work with people on your side,” Republican Whip John Thune of South Dakota said Wednesday. “I personally am not worried about tweets, but I do think that your digital footprint now should be a reminder that stuff that’s all going to come back to bite you at some point.”Republicans still complain about Democratic delays confirming some of former President Donald Trump’s cabinet picks early in his term, some of whom later resigned amid ethics inquiries. Trump often used his Twitter feed for personal attacks on his opponents, which Republicans routinely declined to condemn.Alternative Candidate?If Tanden isn’t able to rally enough bipartisan support, some lawmakers are already pushing the Biden administration to elevate Shalanda Young, the House Appropriations Committee’s staff director and Biden’s pick for deputy budget director, as the top nominee.“The Black Caucus is fully supporting Shalanda Young’s confirmation should Neera Tanden’s nomination be unsuccessful,” said Dominic Manecke, a spokesman for Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat.Alabama Senator Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said he doesn’t support Tanden, but he would support Young, saying “she’s very qualified, but that’s up to them.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-put-tanden-in-another-post-should-her-nomination-fail-101614217512606.html
25-02-2021||World||Pak caught in China's debt-trap diplomacy, seeks relief from 'iron ally': Report||In China's debt-trap diplomacy, Pakistan is struggling to repay loans for power projects under President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and seeks to reschedule as much as USD 22 billion in outstanding credits.In recent years, Chinese loans have fueled a massive buildout of Pakistan's power generation, financing that has turned a perennial electricity shortfall into a now-massive capacity surplus that the highly indebted nation can increasingly ill-afford, Asia Times reported.Also Read: China lauds ‘iron ally’ Pak for not evacuating stranded from WuhanIn those debt-rescheduling talks, Pakistani officials are also reportedly asking their Chinese counterparts to decelerate agreed plans to build even more power plants that would add to the overcapacity problem."Yes, we have accelerated efforts to get some sort of relaxation from Beijing either in the power purchase mechanism or on the mode of payment of capacity cost," Asia Times quoted the source as saying.According to the source, a high-level delegation led by Pakistani President Arif Alvi visited Beijing last March to discuss the possibility of a 2.5 per cent cut in the present interest rate on power sector-related loans at Libor plus 4.5 per cent.Also Read: China puts the pedal to the metal on vaccine diplomacy. There are concerns | Analysis"[Alvi] also discussed with his Chinese counterpart a 10-year extension in the debt repayment period. These two rebates, if approved, would save [Pakistan] about USD 600 million annually," said the source.The Pakistani government has recently re-approached Chinese officials on the issue but no information has leaked out in the public domain on their exchanges, reported Asia Times."First, the power purchase agreements made with Beijing provide for a highly overrated power supply, which eats up roughly USD 1.6 billion annually. Another USD 1.8 billion goes into power pilferage and line losses, and yet another USD 9 million is consumed in recovery losses of power dues from consumers," Asia Times quoted Dr Farrukh Saleem, an Islamabad-based political economist, analyst, and columnist, citing official statistics on power sector losses incurred by the state.Saleem said that the recent COVID-influenced downturn in gross domestic product growth from 5.8 per cent in 2018 to -0.4 per cent in 2020, the first time Pakistan's economy dipped into negative growth in over seven decades, has curtailed electricity demand across the country."This rendered thousands of megawatt electricity surplus, on which the government pays capacity charges in line with the agreements," Saleem added.Experts say that if the current overcapacity problem and debt repayment terms persist, the government's overall power sector liability may balloon beyond 1.5 trillion rupees (USD 9.4 billion) by the end of 2023, reported Asia Times.Asia Times further reported that official estimates indicate that Pakistan's energy-related debts will rise to 2.8 trillion (USD 17.5 billion) rupees by the end of June under current Belt and Road terms and conditions. The figures show that power sector liabilities surged by 538 billion rupees (USD 3.4 billion) in just one year from July 2019 to June 2020.Official figures indicate that Pakistan's total debt servicing liability could surpass USD 14 billion by the end of the year, at a time foreign exchange reserves are hovering around USD 13 billion.That's leading some analysts to the conclusion that China's Belt and Road lending to Pakistan is becoming a "debt trap", as total external debts and liabilities hit USD 115.76 billion at the end of 2020 and more owed in 2021 for what are now seen as unproductive Chinese power sector investments, Asia Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-caught-in-china-s-debt-trap-diplomacy-seeks-relief-from-iron-ally-101614221764956.html

Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met Myanmar's military-appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, for talks in the Thai capital.Indonesia's interventions have raised suspicion among Myanmar democracy activists who fear dealing with the junta would confer legitimacy on it and its bid to scrap the November election.Retno, speaking to reporters in Bangkok, said the wellbeing of the people of Myanmar was the top priority."We ask for everybody to use restraint and not resort to violence ... to avoid casualties and bloodshed," Retno said after her talks with the Myanmar minister and her Thai counterpart, Don Pramudwinai.A Reuters report this week cited sources as saying Indonesia was proposing that ASEAN members send monitors to ensure the generals stick to their promise of fair new elections.The military has not given a time frame for the new election it has promised, although it imposed a one-year state of emergency when it seized power.Dozens of protesters gathered outside the Thai embassy in the main city of Yangon on Wednesday with signs reading: "Respect our vote" and "We voted NLD".Retno did not mention the issue of the election but said Indonesia emphasised "the importance of an inclusive democratic transition process".The crisis has restored Myanmar's reputation as the problem member of the 10-country ASEAN and the diplomatic scramble by its neighbours comes as wider international concern is growing.The United States, Britain and others have imposed limited sanctions aimed at members of the junta and military businesses.China has traditionally taken a softer line on Myanmar as have ASEAN neighbours.Washington has also expressed concern over Malaysia's deportation of nearly 1,100 Myanmar nationals and urged countries in the region to hold off on any repatriations in light of the coup.Malaysia is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar and several Malaysian lawmakers and rights groups on Wednesday called on the government to explain its deportation, despite a court-ordered stay, with some saying the move could amount to contempt of court.The deported group is to arrive in Myanmar on Saturday, according to a post on Myanmar's navy Facebook page.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-students-doctors-plan-more-protests-against-military-rule-101614217386495.html

Some of these meetings have focused on the latest report submitted by Pakistan regarding compliance with the FATF’s 27-point action plan that was drawn up after the country was placed on the grey list in June 2018.At its last plenary in October 2020, the FATF concluded that Pakistan had fully complied with 21 of 27 points in the action plan but warned the country that it could not be given “forever” to address outstanding issues. As all deadlines for the action plan had expired, the FATF had urged Pakistan to deliver on all 27 points by February 2021.The Australia-based Asia-Pacific Group (APG), a key regional affiliate of the FATF, had also concluded before the last plenary meeting that Pakistan was fully compliant with only two of 40 recommendations to counter terror financing and money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-awaits-fatf-ruling-on-terror-101614219001650.html

The ruling conservative Liberal Party does not have a majority in the upper house, but support from the opposition Labour Party is expected to be enough to pass the bill.“What we’ve sworn to do is create a level playing field,” Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg told Sky News on Wednesday. “We’ve sought to sustain public interest journalism in this country, and we’ve also sought to enhance and encourage those commercial deals between the parties.”Facebook set to invest $1billn in news industryFacebook on Wednesday pledged to invest at least $1 billion in the news industry over the next three years, days after a high-profile standoff with the Australian government over paying news outlets for content.Facebook on Tuesday restored Australian news pages, ending a week-long blackout after wringing concessions from the government over a proposed law that will require all tech giants to pay media companies for their news content.In a blog detailing its version of the showdown, Facebook said the news ban was related to a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the relationship between the company and news publishers. It also acknowledged that some non-news content got inadvertently blocked when it had banned all news content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-mps-to-okay-changes-to-new-pay-for-news-law-101614218793503.html
25-02-2021||World||J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine closes in on FDA’s nod||The US drugs regulator has virtually cleared the path for a third Covid-19 vaccine, confirming the efficacy and safety of the Johnson & Johnson shot on Wednesday.J&J’s one-shot vaccine could join Pfizer and Moderna’s shots as early as this week in the battle against a pandemic that has killed more than half a million people in the United States, a grim milestone crossed earlier this week.An advisory committee of experts appointed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will meet on Friday to evaluate the findings and grant emergency use authorisation.According to papers submitted by Johnson & Johnson to the FDA seeking emergency use go-ahead, the vaccine has demonstrated an overall efficacy level of 66% - 72% in the United States and 57% in South Africa, a country that is dealing with a highly contagious strain of the coronavirus.The vaccination was more effective, at 86%, against severe forms of Covid-19 in the United States, and 82% against severe disease in South Africa, reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death among those inoculated.Unlike Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s jabs, Johnson & Johnson’s one is a one-shot vaccine. It’s also known to be easier to store - it can be kept in refrigeration for three months - and transport. The vaccine does not require extremely cold conditions, which the Pfizer vaccine needs.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was tried out on more than 44,000 people, aged 18 and older, in multiple countries. The company applied for emergency use authorisation on February 4.The pharma giant expects to roll out millions of doses of its vaccine the next week, pending authorisation, but it is likely to fall short of the expected 10 million by February end.“We will have 20 million doses of the vaccine to be made available by the end of March and we’re prepared to ship, immediately upon emergency use authorisation, nearly 4 million doses of our vaccine, Richard Nettles, the company subsidiary Janssen’s vice-president of medical affairs, said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jjs-covid-19-vaccine-closes-in-on-fda-s-nod-101614218442041.html

25-02-2021||World||Fencing, tightened security at Capitol staying in place for now||The razor wire-topped fences and National Guard patrols in place around the US Capitol grounds since the Jan. 6 mob attack will remain for the time being despite agitation among many lawmakers for the complex to be reopened to the public.Capitol officials who briefed senators on security Wednesday provided no timetable for when the extra security measures, including National Guard troops, would be eased, lawmakers said.“I am very interested in a plan to move as quickly as possible to have the Capitol again be a place where the public is welcome,” said Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat. “I just think it sends kind of a bad message about our country to have our Capitol surrounded by razor wire.”He and other senators said they didn’t hear in the private briefing call any general plan for easing restrictions, which also include street closures in the area.The Capitol has been closed to the public since last spring because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Following the Jan. 6 riot, in which a mob of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters overwhelmed police and rampaged through the building, security was tightened significantly with fencing and National Guard patrols as law enforcement officials look into continuing threats against Congress from extremists.Also read| Amid surge, US tries to expedite release of migrant childrenThe chief of the Capitol Police force and two other top congressional officials resigned in the wake of the breach, and multiple congressional inquiries into security failings on Jan. 6 are under way. In prepared testimony for a House hearing Thursday, acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman says that intelligence reports on the threat to Congress before the insurrection were “muddled or contradictory.”Members of both parties said they were anxious for things to return to normal and for the National Guard to be sent home.“I don’t think the poor handling of Jan. 6 should lead us to punish the public,” Kaine said.“I said there’s got to be an end to this thing,” said Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee. “And I haven’t heard anything in the presentation that leads me to believe there’s going to be an end, or that there’s really justification.”Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, was even more emphatic, though he said he was unable to join the briefing call because of nomination hearings.Also read| Congress weighs reforms to troubled US Postal Service over finance woes“There’s nothing they could have said at that security briefing that would justify having fences and barbed wire,” Burr said. “That is a bunch of malarkey. They ought to tear these fences down and send them home today.”Burr was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump on an article of impeachment charging him with inciting the Jan. 6 attack.Not all senators are ready for the barriers to come down immediately, however.Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a Democrat, said the law enforcement officials who conducted the briefing told senators that threats against individuals members of Congress have gone up by 90%. Hirono also said that domestic terrorists and White supremacists feel “emboldened” to carry out violent attacks.”“I think most of us would like to see a day when the fencing and especially the fencing with barbed wire comes down, but there’s still a threat out there and as I say they feel quite emboldened now to plot, plan and go dark in communicating with each other,” Hirono added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fencing-tightened-security-at-capitol-staying-in-place-for-now-101614214301111.html
25-02-2021||World||FAA met to discuss more frequent engine inspections days before Denver incident||Only days before a dramatic engine failure on a United Airlines flight, federal regulators had met about requiring more frequent inspections of the same type of engine, CNN reported citing the source.On Saturday (local time), United Airlines Flight 328 made an emergency landing in Denver when its right Pratt and Whitney PW4000 series engine failed with a loud bang only minutes after takeoff."Last week we were already in the process of undertaking activity and analysis to reduce the inspection interval," CNN quoted Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Steve Dickson as saying.The FAA review was prompted after a December failure of a PW4000 series engine on another Boeing 777-200 in Japan.CNN further reported that federal regulators had required thermal inspections of engine fan blades for wear and tear every 6,500 times the PW4000 series engine is turned on, a measure officially known as cycles. Cracks and damage can be so small or hidden that they are not visible to the naked eye.Also read| FAA orders high-tech inspections of jet engines on Boeing 777sAccording to the source, the PW4000 series engine that failed Saturday was "far short" of the 6,500 cycles that would prompt the next inspection.However, the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, said it will review maintenance records; it has not specified the number of cycles on the engine since the last inspection.The incidents have engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney recommending significantly more frequent inspections, CNN reported citing a company service bulletin.The bulletin, issued two days after the Denver incident, recommended each engine's 22 fan blades be inspected every 1,000 cycles, but it's unclear what the FAA will ultimately require.United Airlines Flight 328 rained a mile-long trail of debris over suburban Denver before a successful emergency landing. NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Monday (local time) that he believed one fan blade had broken off the engine due to metal fatigue and that it had struck and broken the adjacent blade.Also read| UK temporarily bans some Boeing 777s from its airspace after Denver incidentHowever, investigators said one blade had been found inside the engine and the other was found in a soccer field. NTSB said it had recovered the fan blade that failed and shipped it to a Pratt and Whitney lab for analysis.The FAA announced Tuesday (local time) that it would require seven versions of Pratt and Whitney 4000 engines to be inspected before flying again."Until we know more about this particular event, we felt that was the safest course of action," Dickson said adding "There's also the possibility that there will be other types of inspections that could be performed going forward using different technologies."Dickson said the FAA does not see a pattern of engine failures that should concern travelers and that he would feel comfortable flying on the Boeing 777."The safest form of travel in human history is commercial jet travel in the United States, or on a US carrier," Dickson said."And the actions that we are taking at the agency are designed to make sure that it stays that way," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faa-met-to-discuss-more-frequent-engine-inspections-days-before-denver-incident-101614213724836.html

The next two days will be critical in resolving financial obligations, he said during a board meeting Wednesday.The revelations come as Texas continues to recover from blackouts that left more than 4 million in the dark for days during a deep winter freeze. In the wake of the crisis, six members of Ercot’s board have resigned, including the chair and vice chair, after Governor Greg Abbott criticized the grid operator’s handling of the event.Also read| Amid surge, US tries to expedite release of migrant childrenSeveral retail electricity providers “are currently in payment breach” under Ercot protocols, but the grid operator “has not yet taken action to revoke their rights” or terminate their agreements, according to a statement late Wednesday.If Ercot is unable to collect the revenues necessary to cover defaults, those costs would flow to other market participants, who could then pass those charges onto consumers, Chief Financial Officer Sean Taylor said during the meeting.Ercot paused collateral collection on Monday but resumed it again a day later due to concerns about downstream financial impacts. Another pause is still under consideration, Ögelman said. However, disrupting the collection process “has a lot of liquidity risk” and could have “chilling consequences,” he said.The grid operator doesn’t anticipate any issues handling the financial transactions, said Taylor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-power-companies-face-liquidity-crisis-as-bills-mount-board-leaders-resign-101614213168925.html

25-02-2021||World||Biden's trade nominee Katherine Tai calls China 'both a rival and a partner'||President Joe Biden’s nominee for trade chief is pledging to work with allies to take on China while also embarking on a pragmatic approach to the Asian nation, saying it’s both a rival and partner whose cooperation the U.S. needs to address global challenges.Without going into specifics of how she would address tariffs, export bans and other key issues, Katherine Tai, the pick for U.S. trade representative, said she knows the “opportunities and limitations in our existing toolbox.”“We must recommit to working relentlessly with others to promote and defend our shared values of freedom, democracy, truth, and opportunity in a just society,” Tai said in the text of remarks seen by Bloomberg ahead of her confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee.The comments illustrate how Tai will pursue a hard line in U.S.-China negotiations while also indicating a more methodical and practical style to distance the Biden administration from the chaos that defined the Trump team’s trade agenda. Tai, whose nomination requires Senate approval, is expected to play a key role in setting and implementing Biden’s trade policy, which they both have promised to focus on workers and the middle class.While Tai has a reputation as a progressive Democrat, she’s respected by members of both parties, who have praised her ability to find common ground on thorny matters such as those involving both business and labor.Tai, in the prepared remarks, touted her own experience as the chief counsel for China enforcement for three years at USTR, saying that she knows firsthand the importance of holding the nation accountable for its unfair trade practices, but also the dexterity required in U.S. policy.Echoing Biden’s call to “Build Back Better” from the pandemic, Tai said that the U.S. needs to prioritize making investments at home in people and infrastructure to boost competitiveness and at the same time enforce the rules of global commerce vigorously.“We must remember how to walk, chew gum and play chess at the same time,” she said.Tai spent the past four years as the chief counsel for Democrats on the U.S. House Ways & Means Committee responsible for trade. She was a key figure in negotiations with the Trump administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement, which passed both the House and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan majorities and was signed by Trump last year.Among the trade challenges facing the Biden administration is deciding what to do with the so-called phase one deal that President Donald Trump struck with China in early 2020 and the more than $350 billion in tariffs that remain in place. Biden has pledged to work with allies to confront China rather than face the nation alone as Trump did, a theme echoed by Tai.She’s likely to face questions from senators on Biden’s approach to the tariffs on Chinese goods, which his administration has indicated it won’t change before a review of trade policy is complete. Other topics could include trade with the European Union, policy toward the World Trade Organization and the Trump administration’s ban on American firms exporting to Chinese companies including telecommunications-equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-trade-nominee-katherine-tai-calls-china-both-a-rival-and-a-partner-101614212569808.html
25-02-2021||World||Republicans introduce resolution opposing any move to lift sanctions on Iran||Senator Tom Cotton and more than 40 other Republican lawmakers introduced a resolution Wednesday opposing any move to lift sanctions on Iran, underscoring the resistance the Biden administration will face in trying to get back into the 2015 nuclear accord.The resolution “rejects and opposes the reapplication of sanctions relief for Iran” and expresses disapproval of any move to reverse a ban that keeps Iran from accessing the U.S. financial system, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg News.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has vowed not to ease sanctions on Iran until it returns to compliance with the multinational accord that former President Donald Trump abandoned. But the U.S. has offered to meet with Iran under the auspices of the five other nations that joined in crafting the nuclear agreement. So far, Iran has spurned the offer.“The U.S. must maintain sanctions on the Iranian regime until it abandons its nuclear ambitions and ends its support for violence and terror around the region,” the resolution’s House and Senate sponsors say in a statement. “Iran took advantage of weak policies during the Obama administration, and President Biden must not repeat those same mistakes.”The resolution is largely symbolic and stands little chance of passage given that Democrats control both chambers of Congress. Nonetheless, it’s a warning to both the Biden administration and Iran that circumventing Congress would only jeopardize any future agreement.In that respect, it echoes a letter Cotton, Arkansas’s junior senator, initiated before the accord was completed under President Barack Obama in 2015, warning Iran that the next American president could revoke it -- as Trump did. Cotton has remained one of the nuclear deal’s most persistent critics.Like the original Iran accord, any renewed agreement would be unlikely to be offered as a treaty that would require a two-thirds vote of approval in the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-introduce-resolution-opposing-any-move-to-lift-sanctions-on-iran-101614211985048.html

25-02-2021||World||Amid surge, US tries to expedite release of migrant children||With its long-term facilities for immigrant children nearly full, the Biden administration is working to expedite the release of children to their relatives in the U.S.U.S. Health and Human Services on Wednesday authorized operators of long-term facilities to pay for some of the children’s flights and transportation to the homes of their sponsors. Under the agency's current guidelines, sponsors can be charged for those flights and required to pay before the government will release children, even if the sponsors have been vetted by the government.Those costs can sometimes exceed $1,000 per child.An internal memo sent Wednesday and obtained by The Associated Press authorizes facility operators to use government funding for transport fees “in the event that a sponsor is not able to pay fees associated with commercial airfare, and a child’s physical release would be otherwise delayed.” HHS declined to say how many flights would be funded.HHS has drastically cut its capacity due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly all of the department’s 7,100 beds for immigrant children are full. Meanwhile, Border Patrol agents are apprehending an average of more than 200 children crossing the border without a parent per day. Most Border Patrol facilities aren't equipped for long-term detention, with children forced to sleep on mats in cells where the lights stay on around the clock.To take children from the Border Patrol, HHS reopened a surge facility at Carrizo Springs, Texas, that can hold up to 700 teenagers, and may soon reopen another site at Homestead, Florida. While they have beds, classrooms and dining areas, surge facilities cost an estimated $775 per child per day and are not subject to the same licensing requirements as regular facilities.Democrats sharply criticized them during the administration of former President Donald Trump, and news of Carrizo Springs’ reopening has drawn criticism from some Democrats as well as Republicans who argue Trump was unfairly blamed. Some have accused Biden of moving to detain children in “cages." No children are detained in cells or behind chain-link fencing at Carrizo Springs, which has long trailers that serve as dormitories and a large tent as a dining hall.“We had to expand and open additional facilities because there was not enough space in the existing facilities if we were to abide by Covid protocols," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. Psaki noted that Biden halted a Trump-era practice of expelling unaccompanied immigrant children under public health law, though the U.S. still expels immigrant families and single adults who cross the border without permission.“Our objective is to move these kids quickly from there to vetted, sponsored families and to places where they can safely be," she said.But experts on the detention of immigrant children say HHS needs to change how it works to relieve pressure on the overall system.Leecia Welch, senior director of child welfare at the nonprofit National Center for Youth Law, said HHS could have made several policy changes months ago that would alleviate what she called “a government-created crisis.” She applauded the move to pay for flights and called on U.S. officials to explore other ways to release children from HHS faster, including by raising the capacity of regular facilities while ensuring that protocols are followed to stop the spread of the virus.“While we recognize the Biden administration’s efforts to process unaccompanied children in a responsible way that addresses public health needs and prioritizes children’s safety, it is critical that it not repeat the mistakes of the Trump administration," Naureen Shah, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.One longstanding requirement that has delayed some releases is forcing sponsors to pay for airfares.“Facilities have told families that they will not release a child unless they specifically go to a specific travel agency and purchase tickets,” said Dr. Amy Cohen, executive director of the advocacy group Every Last One.In one case this week, Cohen said, staff at a facility told a woman that she would have to bring a certified check to the airport in order to collect her child, who has been in an HHS facility for three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-surge-us-tries-to-expedite-release-of-migrant-children-101614201995532.html

That is, who needs to take which step so that a general agreement can be achieved at the end of which the U.S. are part of this agreement again.”Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear late Tuesday that his country doesn't have confidence in the accord with Tehran.“We have already seen the quality of agreements with extremist regimes such as yours, in the past century and in this one, with the government of North Korea,” he said. "With or without agreements – we will do everything so that you will not arm yourselves with nuclear weapons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-urges-iran-to-accept-diplomacy-in-nuclear-dispute-101614191956250.html

25-02-2021||India||'375 mn Indian children may suffer due to Covid-19 pandemic': CSE report||Around 375 million children (aged between 0-14 years) in India may suffer from the long-lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including malnutrition to loss of education and work productivity, said the Centre for Science and Environment in its annual State of Environment report released on Thursday.The report has derived this number based on different studies done on the impact of children due to Covid-19 across the world and India by organisations such as the World Bank, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Global Health Science.The UNICEF said that most of the children missed the subsidised food offered in government schools during the lockdown. The CSE estimated that about 90.4 million children missed the meals. The report said that half of 500 million children that were forced out of schools across the world were in India.“The target to reduce the stunting target to 2.5 per cent of the children in the age group of 0-5 by 2030 from 34.7 per cent in 2018 could be impacted because of Covid-19,” the report said.Also read: Pakistan stays in FATF ‘grey list’, given June deadline to implement action planCSE’s director general Sunita Narian said Covid-19 had made the world’s poor poorer. “Additionally, 115 million people may get pushed into extreme poverty by the pandemic and most of them live in South Asia,” she said.On the sustainable development goals (SDGs), the report said that India ranks 117 among 192 countries and is behind all South Asian countries, except Pakistan.The five best performing states on SDGs are Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, the report said, adding that the five worst states were Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh.On air pollution, the report pointed out that 1.67 million Indians died due to air pollution in 2019 and its economic cost was $36,000 million, equivalent to 1.36 per cent of India’s GDP.The report said that contrary to popular belief, India’s rivers did not see any significant improvement in their water quality during the lockdown. “Of India’s 19 major rivers, five – including Ganga – ran dirtier in the Covid-19 period,” the report said.Amid all the gloom, the report said there was one good news. And, it was that 34 per cent of Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act funds since 2014-15 were used for water-related works, leading to the creation of almost 11 million water assets in half a million India villages.“The overall assessment is that our air and water quality is under stress; all trends show that pollution is increasing and this has massive impacts on our health,” she said.However, she pointed out that the good news was that India was adopting new sustainable technologies. “We are adopting technologies that will be affordable to large numbers and so, sustainable,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/375-mn-indian-children-may-suffer-due-to-pandemic-cse-report-101614271751644.html

Any attack on Coronil suggests pettiness."The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday demanded an explanation from Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan for promoting Patanjali's Coronil Ayurvedic medicine."Being a Health Minister of the country, how justified is it to release such falsely fabricated unscientific product to people of the whole country and how ethical is it to promote the product in unethical, wrong and false ways?" Dr Jayalal, IMA national president, had said."Let us not adulterate Ayurveda on the pretext of market gain to some monopoly corporate and create a disaster for humanity," IMA had said.

Discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement,” Jaishankar tweeted, without giving details.There was no official word on the contact from the Chinese side.The “Moscow Agreement” that Jaishankar referred to was a five-point agreement that the two sides had concluded during the meeting of the foreign ministers in the Russian capital. A joint statement issued after that meeting had said the two sides would be guided by the consensus of the leaders of India and China, including not allowing differences to become disputes.Jaishankar and Wang had also agreed that border troops would “continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions”, and that the two sides would abide by all existing agreements and protocols on border management and “avoid any action that could escalate matters”.The two sides further agreed to continue dialogue through the Special Representatives’ mechanism and through meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. Once the situation eases, the two sides would work on new confidence-building measures for enhancing peace and tranquillity in border areas.Asked about the situation on the LAC at a regular news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Both sides view the smooth and successful completion of disengagement in the north and south bank [of Pangong Lake] as a significant first step as this forms a basis for resolution of remaining issues so as to achieve the eventual goal of complete disengagement in all friction areas.”“The two sides have agreed to work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues,” he said.Within 48 hours of the completion of the disengagement at Pangong Lake, the 10th round of talks between senior military commanders of the two sides was held on February 20. Srivastava said the two sides had “candid and in-depth exchange of views on the remaining issues along the LAC in the western sector” at this meeting.The meeting of the military commanders had focused on disengagement at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains though there were no immediate signs of a breakthrough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-talks-to-chinese-counterpart-wang-yi-reviews-disengagement-on-lac-101614269763302.html
25-02-2021||India||Tandav row: HC denies anticipatory bail to Amazon Prime Video's commercial head||The Allahabad High Court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail application of Amazon Prime Video's commercial head, Aparna Purohit, in the ongoing investigation against the web series 'Tandav'.Purohit was accused of the inappropriate depiction of Uttar Pradesh police personnel, Hindu deities and adverse portrayal of a character playing the prime minister in the web series.Justice Siddharth, while rejecting the application, said that though the applicant was earlier granted interim protection from arrest by another bench in a similar case, she was not cooperating with the investigation.Petitioner's plea was that the web series was a work of fiction. There was no intention of the applicant to outrage the religious sentiments of any community.The state government's counsel argued that a total of ten FIRs and four criminal complaints have been filed relating to the disputed web series across the country. It shows that merely one person is not affected by the conduct of the applicant rather several people across the country have felt that the web series is offensive and hence they lodged FIRs/complaints.File photo: Bharat Bandh - What services are likely to be affected, what not"It is not a stray case of some over-sensitive individual lodging the FIR against the applicant and other co-accused persons regarding objectionable character and content of the web series in dispute," added the counsel.The court, after hearing the concerned parties, observed, "The basic philosophy of the Constitution is to permit the people of all faith to practice, profess and propagate their religion freely without hurting or acting against the people who profess or practice different religious faith than theirs. Therefore, it is an onerous duty of every citizen to respect the feelings of the people of other faith even while making a fiction".Referring to certain scenes of the web-series, the court observed, "the scenes in dispute are likely to cause disturbance and threats to public order. The reference to Hindu Gods and Goddesses in the scenes in dispute in berating light cannot be justified."The court then observed, "Western filmmakers have refrained from ridiculing Lord Jesus or the Prophet but Hindi filmmakers have done this repeatedly and still doing this most unabashedly with the Hindu Gods and Goddesses."On the use of the names of Hindu deities, and disrespectfully showing them in Hindi movies, the court observed, "This tendency on the part of the Hindi film industry is growing and if not curbed in time, it may have disastrous consequences for the Indian social, religious and communal order. There appears to be a design behind such acts on the part of the people who just give a disclaimer in all the films and depict things in the movies which are really religiously, socially and communally offensive in nature. The young generation of the country, which is not much aware of the social and cultural heritage of this country, gradually starts believing what is shown in the movies by the people like the accused persons in the present movie in dispute and thereby, it destroys the basic concept of the survival of this country having tremendous diversity of all kinds as a united nation. The film industry in the south has not indulged in such acts like the Hindi film industry."The court went on to take judicial notice of the fact that whenever such crimes (like the one at hand) are committed by some citizens of the country, "the forces inimical to the interest of this country become active and they make it an issue and raise it before different national and international forums alleging that Indian citizens have become intolerant and 'India' has become an unsafe place to live."On January 19, an FIR was lodged on the complaint of one Balbir Azad of Raunija village under Rabupura police station of Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh. In the complaint, Azad alleged that the series depicted Uttar Pradesh and its police in a bad light. The complaint further alleged that the series had deliberately denigrated Hindu deities.The FIR further alleged that the web series in question depicted the Prime Minister of India as going against democratic norms and deliberate comments were used to disturb caste and communal amity. The makers of the series wanted to disturb the peace and tranquillity with the aim of making money, the complainant alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-row-hc-denies-anticipatory-bail-to-amazon-prime-video-s-commercial-head-101614268757538.html
25-02-2021||India||When will prices of petrol and diesel be reduced? 'It's a dharam sankat', says Sitharaman||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday that she won't be able to answer when the prices of petrol and diesel will be reduced. Sitharaman said it's a "dharam sankat (dilemma)"."I won't be able to say 'when'.. it is a ‘dharam sankat’ (dilemma)," she said at an event in Ahmedabad."It's not just the cess. You have the excise duty of the Centre, then you have the VAT of the states. So there's is no hiding the fact that there is revenue there. It's not just me, you ask any state. There's revenue there," the finance minister further said.She reiterated that the only way to find a solution to this problem is that the Centre and states should hold a dialogue. "I concede that's where action has to be, let's see what we can do," said Sitharaman, adding that she agrees the end users should pay less for fuel.Earlier in the day, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das had said there is a need for coordinated action between the Centre and state governments to reduce taxes on petrol and diesel prices.“There is a need for coordinated action between the Centre and states because there are inherent taxes levied by both,” the Governor said adding that calibrated reduction of taxes was important.He, however, said both the Centre and the state governments have their revenue pressures and they are required to spend high sums of money to enable the country and the people to come out of the Covid-19 pandemic stress.Over a period of time, the prices of petrol and diesel have increased sharply in the country. In some cities, the price has reached ₹100 per litre.The opposition parties have been attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government over the fuel price hike. On Thursday, in an unusual protest against the LPG price hike, a Congress spokesperson on Thursday conducted a press conference sitting on an empty cylinder as the party accused the Narendra Modi government of being "anti-people".There has been no hike in fuel prices on Thursday and the rates of petrol and diesel prices in Delhi remain ₹90.93 per litre and ₹81.32 per litre respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-petrol-price-hike-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-says-it-s-a-dharam-sankat-101614268505517.html

25-02-2021||India||'Corrupt, liars!' PM Modi attacks DMK-Congress combine in TN, Puducherry||Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the BJP’s campaign in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu on Thursday. in a blistering attack against the Congress-DMK combine, the prime minister called them corrupt, liars and women troublers.PM Modi was in the two-poll bound neighbouring regions to launch a slew of infrastructure projects meant to give his regional allies a fillip ahead of the polls in April-May. He also switched-over to power-packed political speeches.Tamil NaduIn Coimbatore, Modi began his speech with the BJP’s war cry in the state ‘Vetrivel Veeravel’ (victorious spear, courageous spear) referring to their 'vetrivel yatra' (victorious spear march) launched in November 2020 in support of Tamil deity Lord Muruga's devotees. DMK and Congress began their first round of seat-sharing talks for Tamil Nadu on Thursday. Modi termed their meetings as "corruption hackathons". "Their leaders sit and brainstorm how to loot,” he said.The BJP, which has no MLA or MP from Tamil Nadu, will face the elections with the ruling AIADMK which has a strong hold over the western region comprising Coimbatore. Modi called the way the NDA functioned in the centre with the AIADMK as a "classic example of cooperative federalism."Also read: Indian Newspaper Society writes to Google to pay for newsHe then continued to attack their principal opposition, the DMK for ‘promoting a strong man culture' with anti-social elements in every district. “Who suffers most in such a culture? Women,” said Modi. “Entire Tamil Nadu knows how the DMK treated ‘Amma’ Jayalalithaa ji. Leaders who troubled Jayalalithaa ji have been given posts,” he said referring to a 1989 incident when Jayalalithaa, as the leader of the opposition, was allegedly assaulted in the assembly when DMK was in power.Recalling the power-cuts during the DMK’s regime, Modi said that the Dravidian party has “lost the right to be called an all-Tamil Nadu” party. "Last time they won a full majority on their own in the state was 25 years ago. The DMK and the Congress have tried to launch and re-launch their respective first families but got no success. There is a continuous family drama there," he added.PuducherryDays after the Congress government fell in Puducherry after being unable to prove a majority and blamed the BJP for toppling it, Modi hit back at former chief minister V Narayanasamy. “He was more interested in lifting the slippers of his leader rather than “lifting people out of poverty,” said Modi. “People of Puducherry are experiencing freedom from the Congress government.” Amidst Congress’ charges that the centre colluded with former L-G Kiran Bedi to thwart their governance, Modi said that it was Congress that didn’t cooperate and 'didn’t utilise central funds’Modi also brought up the viral video clip of Narayanasamy wrongly translating a woman’s complaint against the CM into a compliment to Rahul Gandhi, during his meeting last week with fisherfolk. “He lied to the people and his own leader. Can a party whose culture is based on lies ever serve people?” the prime minister questioned. “The colonial rulers adopted the policy of divide and rule. Congress’ policy is 'divide, lie and rule'. They are gold, silver and bronze medal winners in telling lies.”Reacting to Gandhi wondering why there was no fisheries ministry in Delhi during the above-said interaction, Modi said, “I was shocked. Current NDA formed the fisheries ministry in 2019 and the budget allocated for fisheries has grown more than 80 per cent in two years.” To this, Gandhi, who is campaigning in poll-bound Kerala, tweeted, “Dear PM...Fisherfolk need an independent and dedicated ministry of fisheries, not just a department within a ministry.”Modi also blamed the Congress in the Union territory for not conducting panchayat polls when it could be held in Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, and Leh-Ladakh. He concluded that his election manifesto was for the NDA to make Puducherry the ‘BEST’' - as a hub for B- Business, E-education, S-spirituality, and T-Tourism.A few hours later, President’s rule was imposed in Puducherry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corrupt-liars-pm-modi-attacks-dmk-congress-combine-in-tn-puducherry-101614266819225.html

25-02-2021||India||Wild boars resurface in Kashmir valley after almost 30 years||Wild boars, which are not native to Kashmir and had not been seen since the mid-1980s, have been sighted increasingly in the past few years in the valley causing concern among the local population and wildlife experts.Conservationists and officials conclude that the population of the wild boars has increased based on the increased sightings of the wild animal in central and north Kashmir since 2018.They say that the wild pigs have been sighted in many areas of north Kashmir, including Uri, Lachipora, Limber, Rafiabad, Rajwar and Balpur. The animal has also been found wandering in Dachigam National Park and its adjoining orchard and crop areas in summer capital Srinagar.“They were not sighted commonly in the field but now everybody is informing us about their presence. They are scavengers and are foraging in wild spaces,” said wildlife warden north Kashmir, Mohammad Maqbool Baba.Baba said that they have not yet conducted any census of the animal, which is a prolific breeder and is omnivorous. “There would be a maximum of 100 such animals in north Kashmir,” he said.The increased presence of the animal has caused panic among people, particularly farmers. The animal is also not accepted culturally in the Muslim majority region.“We have very less staff and it is not possible to watch every place. Still our teams tried to scatter them. Government should think something over the issue,” said Baba.Wild boars are not native to Kashmir and are believed to be introduced by Maharaja Gulab Singh for game hunting.Intisar Suhail, wildlife warden of Shopian who has co authored a publication on wild boars, said that the species was introduced by the Maharaja some 100 years ago for his game.“Historically wild boars were found in Dachigam and the reserves around it. Since it was non-native its population slowly declined due to the cold weather. They had not been sighted for many years. It has revived recently,” he said.Suhail said that the reason for its revival may be multi-factor. “Climate change can be one of the factors. We have been witnessing warm temperatures for the past few years,” he said.In north Kashmir, he said that the reason may be owing to the increase in population of wild boars in Pakistan occupied Kashmir forests adjoining the Line of Control.“Researchers from across the LoC say that in the past 10 years there has been an increase in its population. So it would have spilled over into north Kashmir also,” he said.The wildlife researchers said that the animal was last seen in Dachigam in the 1980s and they are now fearful of the negative impact of the animal’s recurrence on the local ecosystem.“From 2007 to 2011 we did extensive camera trappings in Dachigam but did not sight the animal even once during the period. The sightings of the animal have been made in the past few years. We have not assessed their numbers but there is a population in Dachigam which comes out into orchards and there are also crop raidings,” said Dr Samina Amin Charoo, research officer wildlife department.“It is an invasive species and a prolific breeder. And universally it is a fact that when an invasive species comes it becomes dominant on the native species. It will obviously have a negative effect on the ecosystem,” she said.The wildlife department is formulating a management action plan for all protected areas. “We will also look into the problem to know its population and its effects,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wild-boars-resurface-in-kashmir-valley-after-almost-30-years-101614264574797.html
25-02-2021||India||For Andhra MLC polls, Jagan Reddy names sons of lawmakers who died of Covid||The YSR Congress Party on Thursday announced the candidatures of the sons of the two of its lawmakers who died of Covid-19, for the forthcoming elections to state legislative council.Balli Kalyan Chakravarthy, son of Balli Durgaprasada Rao, parliament member from Tirupati in Chittoor district who died of Covid-19 in September, has been given the party nod for the state legislative council elections.Though Chakravarthy was initially considered for the by-elections to Tirupati Lok Sabha seat, party president and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy decided to nominate him to the legislative council.Similarly, the party also gave the go-ahead for Challa Bhagirath Reddy, son of party lawmaker Challa Ramakrishna Reddy, who also died of Covid-19 on January 1 this year. Jagan, who called on the family of Ramakrishna Reddy in Owk in Kurnool district later, promised to make his son as the MLC.The Election Commission of India on Thursday issued notification for the elections to six MLC seats under the MLAs’ quota in Andhra Pradesh. The elections, if necessary, would be held on March 15 and results would be declared the same day.The six seats in the legislative council have fallen vacant due to the completion of term of four MLCs – Mohammad Iqbal, Tippe Swamy, Sandhya Rani and Veera Venkanna Chowdary; death of one MLC – Challa Ramakrishna Reddy and the resignation of another sitting MLC Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose on his election to Rajya Sabha.For the remaining four MLC seats, the YSRCP announced the names of Mohammad Iqbal (for the second consecutive term) from Anantapur, Duvvada Srinivas from Tekkali in Srikakulam, former MP C Ramachandraiah from Kadapa and Kareemunnisa, a former woman corporator of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation.The YSR Congress party is expected to win all the six MLC seats as it has numbers in its favour – 151 MLAs in the 175-member state assembly. The only opposition in the assembly – Telugu Desam Party – doesn’t have enough strength to win even a single seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-andhra-mlc-polls-jagan-reddy-names-sons-of-lawmakers-who-died-of-covid-101614263420796.html

Shailaja had asked for more vaccines to be provided before the state starts inoculating the third priority group - those over 50 years of age and above.She had also asked for another opportunity to register healthcare workers who have missed the registration deadline, so they don’t miss out on their Covid-19 jabs.According to a press release by the ministry of health, Kerala has administered the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to 85.09 per cent of the beneficiaries. The state has administered a total of 4,89,495 doses of the vaccine till February 24.Kerala on Thursday registered 3,677 new Covid-19 cases, marking a slight drop from the 4,106 cases registered on Wednesday. The total number of active cases also came down from 52,869 recorded the day before to 51,879 recorded on Thursday.The Centre had on Wednesday deputed multi-disciplinary teams to Kerala and nine other states with high Covid-19 caseloads, hoping to find out what led to the recent spike in the number of cases. An overall laxity in abiding by Covid-19 preventative norms is broadly believed to be the reason behind the sudden increase in daily tally of cases, but the central government team has been dispatched to help zero in on any specific reason, if any, behind the increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-to-write-to-centre-requesting-more-covid-19-vaccines-101614262247506.html
25-02-2021||India||Nirav Modi extradition: Now for UK minister Priti Patel to sign off||A UK court ruling on Thursday that Nirav Modi does have a case to answer before the Indian courts in relation the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case clears the legal pathway to the diamond merchant's extradition, with the Westminster Magistrates’ Court judgment now making its way to the desk of British Home Secretary Priti Patel for a sign off.India is a designated Part 2 country by virtue of the Extradition Act 2003, which means it is the Cabinet minister who has the authority to order a requested person's extradition after considering a number of further issues.Under the provisions of the act, the Secretary of State must consider the possible imposition of the death penalty, in which case extradition cannot be ordered; the rule of specialty, which prohibits a person being dealt with in the requesting state for matters other than those referenced in the extradition request; and whether or not the person was in the UK following extradition from another state, in which case that states permission must be obtained before extraditing to a third state.Read more: UK judge clears Nirav Modi's extradition, says no evidence to suggest he will not receive justice in IndiaIf these factors do not prevent extradition, the minister must order extradition within two months of the day on which the District Judge referred his decision to the Secretary of State, in this case by the end of April.The Home Secretary's order rarely goes against the court’s conclusions, as she has to consider only these very narrow bars to extradition which are unlikely to apply in Modi's case.However, as witnessed in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya – who remains on bail in the UK while a "confidential" matter, believed to relate to an asylum request, is resolved – there is still some way to go before Modi can be formally moved from Wandsworth Prison in London to Barrack 12 Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai and face trial in India.Watch | 'Nirav Modi can be extradited to India': What UK Judge said & what happens nextThe ministerial decision aside, the judge has informed Modi of his right to seek an appeal in the High Court and has up to 14 days to make that application after the Home Secretary has made her decision known. Any appeal, if granted, will be heard at the Administrative Division of the High Court in London.It is also possible to appeal to the UK Supreme Court but this is only possible if the High Court certifies that the appeal involves a point of law of general public importance, and either the High Court or the Supreme Court gives leave for the appeal to be made.Modi's legal team did not immediately confirm if he intends to appeal against Thursday’s ruling in the High Court and he will remain behind bars at Wandsworth Prison on judicial remand until the next stage in the legal process.Meanwhile, Indian-origin minister Priti Patel has a number of matters related to Indian economic offenders adding up – with Mallya’s case yet to be fully resolved and that of accused arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari set to begin its magistrates’ court journey from April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-extradition-now-for-uk-minister-priti-patel-to-sign-off-101614260876549.html

A notification imposing the President's Rule in Puducherry was issued by the Union home ministry on Thursday. The union territory's Assembly has been kept under suspended animation.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was blamed for the fall of the government by former chief minister V Narayanasamy, did not stake claim to form government.“We will not try and form a government at this stage.

25-02-2021||India||‘Personal agenda’: UK court on Markandey Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi trial||Ordering the extradition of Nirav Modi on Thursday, the District Judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court Sam Goozee said that the testimony of former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju was not reliable and had “hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda”.Katju had last year appeared in the Westminster court as an expert defending Nirav Modi saying he won’t receive fair trial in India.In his judgement, reviewed by HT, Jude Sam Goozee said – “I attach little weight to Justice Katju’s expert opinion. Despite having been a former Supreme Court judge in India until his retirement in 2011 his evidence was in my assessment less than objective and reliable. His evidence in Court appeared tinged with resentment towards former senior judicial colleagues. It had hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda.”The Judge further said that he found Katju’s “evidence and behaviour in engaging the media the day before giving evidence to be questionable for someone who served the Indian Judiciary at such a high level appointed to guard and protect the rule of law.”In his testimony, Katju had said in the court that India was in terrible economic collapse and the (ruling) BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) were trying to solve the problem but they did not know how to, so they found scapegoats and Nirav Modi is a scapegoat for causing financial crisis in India. Katju had also said during his testimony that the Indian Supreme Court had become subservient to the Indian government.Rejecting his contention, Judge Sam Goozee said in judgement– “Despite making commentary about the fairness of any trial process in India, he accepted on a number of occasions in cross-examination that he had not considered the evidence and it is evident from his report he certainly had not considered the full requests from the Government of India”.“He made bold assertions about corruption across the judiciary in India (including former Chief Justices) and that the Supreme Court had surrendered itself to the executive. Of note, despite being critical of a former Chief Justice passing a verdict in a Supreme Court case in exchange for a nomination to the Upper House of Parliament in India on his retirement on a quid pro quo basis, suggesting collusion and corruption, Justice Katju himself secured appointment by the Government to Chairman of the Press Council of India following his own retirement,” the Judge observed.The court further said - “Despite being highly critical of the ‘trial by media’ and its impact on Nirav Modi’s case, he (Katju) took the astonishing decision to brief journalists in relation to the evidence he was giving in these proceedings, creating his own media storm and adding to the heightened media interest to date.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/personal-agenda-uk-court-on-markandey-katju-s-testimony-in-nirav-modi-trial-101614258078164.html
25-02-2021||India||RBI's asset purchases did not dilute its balance sheet: Governor Das||Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said the central bank's asset purchases, aimed at mitigating Covid-19-related liquidity stress in the system, did not dilute its balance sheet or compromise on core principles of central banking.In the wake of the pandemic, the RBI undertook several conventional and unconventional measures."Unlike many central banks, the RBI's asset purchases did not dilute its balance sheet and hence, did not compromise on core principles of central banking," Das said while addressing an event organised by the Bombay Chamber of Commerce. These purchases were confined to risk-free sovereign (government) bonds including state government securities only, he said.  Other than conventional measures, RBI introduced long term repo operations (LTROs) and targeted long term repo operations (TLTROs) to augment the system as well as sector-specific liquidity to meet sectoral credit needs and alleviate stress, he said. Special refinance facilities were provided to select All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs), while a special liquidity facility for mutual funds (SLF-MF) was introduced to ease redemption pressures, he added.   The governor further said over the last few months, forward guidance gained prominence in RBI's communication strategy for cooperative outcomes."Our commitment to ensure ample liquidity conditions supportive of recovery dispelled illiquidity fears and bolstered market sentiments. We will continue to support the recovery process through the provision of ample liquidity in the system, while maintaining financial stability," he said.    Speaking on the topic 'Creating New Opportunities for Growth', the governor said the manufacturing sector is spearheading the growth recovery as many contact-intensive services sub-sectors are severely affected by the pandemic.    He said the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Subordinate Debt (CGSSD), along with various monetary and regulatory measures by the RBI including rate cuts, moratorium and restructuring, will not only help in ameliorating stress in the MSME sector but also open new opportunities.  Digital penetration in the country has scaled a new high, Das said, adding that time has come to leverage its applications while at the same time strengthen the digital infrastructure.He also urged corporate sector to invest more to create scale and skill in the health sector, which has tremendous opportunities.  The governor said one of the policy areas which needs focus for providing a durable push to the country's exports and growth is Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with key strategically important economies."The potential FTAs need to take cognisance of not only domestic strengths and global opportunities but also the emerging geo-political landscape in the post-pandemic period," he said, adding that the post-Brexit scenario offers a greater scope for having separate trade agreements with the UK and the European Union.Das further said the country is on the cusp of a turnaround in fortunes."In contrast to the rest of the world, the caseload of Covid-19 in India has declined and it is crucial for us to consolidate this decline and capitalise on the success that has been hard-earned," he emphasised.He also said with the infection caseload in some parts of the country again creeping up, one needs to stay vigilant and steadfast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbis-asset-purchases-did-not-dilute-its-balance-sheet-governor-das-101614258047722.html

She then continued the ride. The video of the incident was tweeted by several news outlets, including ANI.ALSO WATCH | Mamata Banerjee rides e-scooter in protest against fuel price hike﻿#WATCH | West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee nearly falls while driving an electric scooter in Howrah, as a mark of protest against fuel price hike. She quickly regained her balance with support and continued to drive. She is travelling to Kalighat from State Secretariat in Nabanna pic.twitter.com/CnAsQYNhTPThe chief minister was travelling to Kalighat from State Secretariat in Nabanna.However, she finally reached her office riding pillion on the electric scooter with a placard protesting against the petrol price hike hanging around her neck. Banerjee sat behind a Trinamool Congress leader and minister Firhad Hakim who rode the battery-powered scooter. Hakim was also had a similar placard hanging from his neck.Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Banerjee said, "There was demonetisation, and now fuel prices are rising. Modi government is selling everything in the country. From Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to coal everything in the country is being sold. This is an anti-people, anti-youth and anti-farmer government."“This is our protest against hike prices of petrol, diesel and LPG. There was a hike in LPG prices even last night and a cylinder now costs at least ₹800. Kerosene is unavailable the market. In Bengal, around ten million people depend on kerosene for cooking. The kitchen is the worst hit every time there is a hike in fuel prices,” she added.The BJP sought to make light of the chief minister’s protest. “This is a unique ploy by Mamata Banerjee. The Centre has said that if petrol and diesel are brought under the purview of GST, fuel prices may drop by ₹10 to ₹15 in one go. State finance minister is the chairman of the GST council. Instead of riding a scooter, she should ask him to call a meeting of GST council and states, and take steps towards bring fuel under GST purview,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP state vice-president.Over a period of time the prices of petrol and diesel have increased sharply in the country.Opposition parties have held protests in different parts of the country over the fuel price rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-nearly-falls-trying-to-rides-an-electric-scooter-101614258175857.html

This price rise and its shameless defence shall be appropriately answered by the people," Yechury said in a tweet.The Railways maintained that since the coronavirus-triggered lockdown was eased, it was running only special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now, even short-distance passenger trains are being run as special trains.As a special provision in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the fares of these trains have been fixed at par with the price of unreserved tickets of mail and express trains for the same distance, a statement from the railway ministry said.For example, a ticket from Amritsar to Pathankot costs ₹55 now. Earlier, it was priced at ₹25. Similarly, a ticket of a passenger DMU between the Jalandhar City railway station and Ferozpur costs ₹60 now, while it used to cost ₹30 earlier."Railways would like to inform that these slightly higher fares for passenger and other short distance trains had been introduced to discourage people from avoidable travels and those which are not most necessary," the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sitaram-yechury-hits-out-at-government-over-rise-in-short-distance-train-fares-101614256301801.html

He also termed the seat-sharing meetings between Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress party as "corruption hackathons" and said, "Their leaders sit and brainstorm how to loot.""Today, the nation is seeing two distinct styles of politics - the opposition's misgovernance with corruption and NDA's governance with compassion," PM Modi said at an event in Coimbatore.Further targeting the DMK, PM Modi said that DMK has lost the right to be called an all Tamil Nadu party. "Last time they won a full majority on their own in the state was 25 years ago. Both parties have tried to launch and re-launch their respective first families but got no success. There is continuous family drama there," he added.With just three months left for the assembly elections in the state, the DMK and its alliance partner in Tamil Nadu are holding seat-sharing talks. However, no consensus has been reached so far.Earlier in the day, PM Modi inaugurated key infrastructure projects, including the Bhawani Sagar Dam in the state. "This project will be of great benefit for our farmers," he said. "The foundation stone to modernise the Bhawani Sagar Dam is being laid. This will irrigate over 2 lakh acres of land. The district of Erode, Karur, Tiruppur will benefit from this," PM Modi also said.He also said that India's commitment to port-led development can be seen through the Sagarmala scheme as he dedicated the project to the country. Further speaking on future projects, PM Modi said, "About 575 projects at a total cost of over ₹6 lakh crores have been identified for implementation during 2015-2035 period."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-taregts-congress-dmk-in-tamil-nadu-rally-says-their-leaders-sit-and-brainstorm-how-to-loot-101614254916026.html

Army prepared to meet all operational challenges, remains poised to mitigate threats," officials told news agency ANI.Also Read: Armies of India, Pakistan agree to ceasefire along LoC from Feb 24 midnightIndia and China have been involved in a border dispute for decades over Line of Actual Control (LAC), which is not clearly demarcated, but the dispute flared in May last year after the Galwan Valley clash. However, recently, the two countries have agreed to disengage from the border and are now in the process of pulling troops back from parts of it. This is in cognisance with India's stand that peace at the border is a prerequisite for developing bilateral relations.Meanwhile, China earlier last week revealed for the first time information on the number of soldiers who died in one of the military standoff between the countries at the Galwan clash. According to the country, four of its soldiers died in the clash.Troops from India and Pakistan have been involved in frequent skirmishes since relations between the two countries deteriorated after the Pulwama suicide attack in February 2019. Also Read: LoC ceasefire outcome of ‘behind the scenes’ contacts: Pakistan’s de facto NSAAccording to a joint statement issued by the armies of both India and Pakistan, the decision to observe a ceasefire followed a discussion between Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha, and his Pakistani counterpart, Maj Gen Nauman Zakaria.

Various community groups and social workers have supported the plea, the Gulf News reported.India has since February 23 made it mandatory for passengers to produce the negative report of the RT-PCR tests taken within 72 hours before their departure to India.The passengers are also required to undergo self-paid confirmatory molecular test on arrival in India.The on-arrival test cost would be an additional burden for several Indian families flying home, Ashraf Thamarassery, a prominent social worker and winner of India’s Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award for NRIs, said.“There are many people, who have lost jobs, flying back home. There are families with four or five members leaving the UAE. Also, how can people, who are leaving after staying without any documents and financial cases, pay this amount? Those who came on visit visa looking for jobs will also be affected,” Thamarassery was quoted as saying in the report.He said the Indian government should urgently address the issue and help fund the tests.He said that the people coming to the UAE are also tested on arrival but the government is bearing the cost of testing passengers of all nationalities.K V Shamsudheen, who runs Sharjah-based Pravasi Bandhu Welafre Trust, said he has written a letter to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to stop the “self-paid” test on arrival.Meanwhile, some expats are even delaying their journey to India hoping that the government would revise the rules, the news report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-expats-in-uae-seek-exemption-from-self-paid-covid-tests-on-arrival-in-india-101614249004800.html
25-02-2021||India||Months before Chamoli tragedy, satellite images showed crack in mountain ice||Months before the landslide, which triggered flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli on February 7, satellite images showed a crack opening on an ice-covered flank of 6,029 metre-high Ronti mountain, American space agency NASA’s Earth Observatory has said in a report. The report published on the observatory’s website added this became clear after comparing high-resolution satellite images of the area before and after the tragedy on January 20 and February 21. It cited a closeup of the images in the same area before and after the debris flow and pointed to a “dark scar near the origin of the landslide and the trail of dust and debris that blanketed the valley walls downstream”. “On February 7, 2021, a huge chunk of a steep slope broke off from the peak, bringing down part of a hanging glacier perched on the ridge. After freefalling for roughly two kilometres, the rock and ice shattered as it slammed into the ground, producing an enormous landslide and dust cloud.”Also Read | NASA releases panorama taken by Mars roverThe report added as the accelerating rock and ice raced through the Ronti and Rishiganga River valley, they picked up glacial sediments and melted snow. “All the materials mixed into a fast-moving slurry that overwhelmed the river and churned wildly as it rushed through the river valley.”The observatory shares images, stories, and discoveries about the environment, and climate that emerge from NASA research.Scientists from Dehradun’s Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, who visited the disaster scene, have come up with similar findings, minus the crack being visible months before.Kalachand Sain, the institute’s director, said experts were scanning satellite imagery of Ronti mountain to establish when the crack or movement became visible. He added they overall know what happened, but more study was needed for the specific details and the sequence of events.“Our team, after studying the site and comparing the ground observations with satellite imagery, found that crashing of the hanging rock mass/snow down the mountainside, took debris, rocks, snow with it, which led to the tragedy downstream the Rishiganga.” Sain said due to freezing, thawing, and temperature variation, the rock mass loosened and broke off due to the gravitational pull. He added it slid down with snow, debris, and boulders, and soil.Sain said the mass got into the Ronti Gad stream, which receives waters from glaciers in the area. “The mass blocked the water of the stream damming it up to such an extent that it breached and the whole mass of water, boulders, and rock...” He said the mass came crashing down with force towards the Rishiganga Dam site and left 69 people dead and 135 missing.Sain said even now there is some remnant debris in the stream. He added if rains lash the area or snow melts, it could again lead to water accumulation. “We, as well as authorities, are keeping a tab on all these developments so that timely measures can be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/months-before-chamoli-tragedy-satellite-images-showed-crack-in-mountain-ice-101614249052642.html

25-02-2021||India||India, Pakistan agree to follow all ceasefire pacts||India and Pakistan have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and other sectors, according to a joint statement on Thursday.The decision on ceasefire, effective since Wednesday midnight, was taken at a meeting between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan.The DGMOs held discussions over the established mechanism of hotline contact and reviewed the situation along the Line of Control and all other sectors in a "free, frank and cordial atmosphere"."In the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders, the two DGMOs agreed to address each other's core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence."Both sides agreed for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control and all other sectors with effect from midnight of February 24/25," the joint statement said.They also reiterated that existing mechanisms of hotline contact and border flag meetings will be utilised to resolve any unforeseen situation or misunderstanding, it added.In written response to a question in Lok Sabha earlier this month, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said a total of 10,752 cases of ceasefire violations have taken place along India's border with Pakistan in the last three years, in which 72 security personnel and 70 civilians were killed.He said 364 security personnel and 341 civilians were injured in cross-border firings along the International Border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018, 2019 and 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pakistan-agree-to-follow-all-ceasefire-pacts-101614242684732.html
25-02-2021||India||Would be compelled to take pre-emptive strike when confronted by imminent terror attack: India at UN||India told a UN meeting that a country would be compelled to undertake a “pre-emptive strike” when confronted by an "imminent armed attack” from a non-state actor operating in a third state, as it highlighted several proxy cross-border terror attacks, including one in Pulwama, perpetrated against it from its neighbourhood, a clear reference to Pakistan.India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said at an Arria Formula meeting organised by Mexico that non-state actors such as terrorist groups often attack states from remote locations within other host states, using the sovereignty of that host state as a “smokescreen”.On this, a growing number of states believe that the use of force in self-defence against a non-state actor operating in the territory of another host state can be undertaken if the “non-state actor has repeatedly undertaken armed attacks against the State; the host state is unwilling to address the threat posed by the non-state actor; the host state is actively supporting and sponsoring the attack by the non-state actor,” he said.“In other words, a state would be compelled to undertake a pre-emptive strike when it is confronted by an imminent armed attack from a non-state actor operating in a third state," he said on Wednesday."This state of affairs exonerates the affected state from the duty to respect, vis-a-vis the aggressor, the general obligation to refrain from the use of force,” Naidu said at the Arria Formula meeting.The Arria Formula meetings are informal meetings of the Security Council, on ‘Upholding the collective security system of the UN Charter: the use of force in international law, non-state actors and legitimate self-defence’.He noted that Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) have formally endorsed the view that self-defence is available to avert terrorist attacks such as in the case of the 9/11 attacks.On February 26, 2019, less than two weeks after 40 police personnel were killed in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir in a terror attack perpetrated by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed on February 14, India had conducted a pinpoint and swift airstrike in a pre-dawn operation, described as "non-military" and "preemptive", against the terror group’s biggest training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.Then Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had said at the time that “credible intelligence was received that JeM was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country, and the fidayeen jihadis were being trained for this purpose. In the face of imminent danger, a preemptive strike became absolutely necessary.”Naidu told the informal meeting that India has been subject to cross-border terrorist attacks perpetrated by non-state actors with the active complicity of “another host state”, a clear reference to Pakistan.He stressed that exercising self-defence is a nation’s primary right when a situation demands “immediate and proportionate action” and applies also to attacks by non-state actors.“Some states are resorting to proxy war by supporting non-state actors such as terrorist groups to evade international censure. Such support to non-state actors has ranged from providing and equipping the terrorist groups with training, financing, intelligence and weapons to logistics and recruitment facilitation,” he said.India for decades has been subject to such proxy cross-border and relentless state-supported terrorist attacks from its neighbourhood, he said."Whether it is was the 1993 Mumbai bombings, or the random and indiscriminate firings of 26/11 which witnessed the launch of the phenomenon of lone-wolves or more recently, the cowardly attacks in Pathankot and Pulwama, the world has been witness to the fact that India has repeatedly been targeted by such non-state actors with the active complicity of another host State,” Naidu said.Naidu told the meeting that exercising self-defence is a primary right of States to be exercised when the situation is imminent and “demands necessary, immediate, and proportionate action” and that customary international law has long recognised the principles governing the use of force in self-defence.He noted that Article 51 of the UN Charter is not confined to “self-defence” in response to attacks by states only."The right of self-defence applies also to attacks by non-state actors. In fact, the source of the attack, whether a state or a non-state actor, is irrelevant to the existence of the right of self-defence.”Naidu stressed that India believes that instances where states have exercised the right of self-defense to attack non-state actors located in other states must be consistent with Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.But “preemptive actions taken to fight the menace of terrorism, even without the consent of the state hosting the non-state actors, meets this criterion because such actions are not of reprisal since their prime motive is for protecting the affected states’ national integrity and sovereignty,” he said.Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”Noting that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter requires that states refrain from the use of force, he said the drafting history of Article 51 of the UN Charter and the relevant San Francisco Conference Report of June 1945 that considered Article 2(4) of the UN Charter mentions that “the use of arms in legitimate self-defence remains admitted and unimpaired.”He added that Article 51 also explicitly acknowledges the pre-existing customary right of self-defence, as recognised by the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council by stating that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/would-be-compelled-to-take-pre-emptive-strike-when-confronted-by-imminent-attack-from-non-state-actor-operating-in-third-state-india-at-un-101614245521430.html

He declared them as “all pass” for the current academic year due to the “unprecedented situation” created by Covid-19 pandemic and following the feedback from parents and teachers.Offline classes were resumed for students of class 10 and 12 in January 2021. “They were given vitamin and zinc tablets to boost immunity,” said Palaniswami. Since the lockdown in March, school students were educated through television and online classes. Last March, Tamil Nadu announced “all pass” for classes 1 to 9, meaning they were to be promoted without examinations. “Syllabus was also reduced because they were educated through television and online mediums,” Palaniswami said.Also Read: PM to address convocation ceremony of TN Dr MGR Medical University on FridayRecently, the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Government Examinations released the timetable for class 12 state board examinations, which will be conducted from May 3 to May 21.

The developed world is under pressure as on one hand, they talk about supporting each other in the multilateral fight against Covid but on other hand, they're looking at protecting the interest of few companies only in terms of innovation or R&D” the minister said, as quoted by ANI.Calling world leaders to join India’s proposal, the minister tweeted on Thursday, “World cannot continue to engage in endless discussions while millions of lives & livelihoods are lost. Intellectual Property waiver on Covid-19 medicine provides an opportunity to rejuvenate the world. Hope the world leaders join India in that effort.”.In October of last year, India and South Africa proposed a Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver for all WTO members for certain provisions of copyrights, patents, and protection of undisclosed information to allow greater access to affordable Covid-19 healthcare facilities, like vaccines, especially for developing and middle-income countries.“India is at the forefront along with South Africa, in a proposal we had introduced in Oct 2020 before WTO in the TRIPS Council for a TRIPS waiver during Covid pandemic to allow more countries to get equitable access to medicines & other products, waiving IPR regime,” Goyal said at the conference.The waiver is being opposed by China, the European Union, the UK, the US Switzerland, Japan, and Australia, among others. The TRIPS waiver has garnered the strong support of around 90 countries, reported news agency ANI. The ultimate decision on the waiver will be taken by all member states of WTO at the General Council in March, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/57-countries-back-india-s-demand-for-intellectual-property-waiver-on-covid-19-vaccine-goyal-101614244471806.html

The guidelines will cover digitised content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks.It will also include intermediaries such as Twitter and Facebook, publishers of news and current affairs content, and curators of such content.So far, online news media has not been unregulated, with the information & broadcasting ministry brining it under its ambit last year, but not yet formalising rules for it. These guidelines will come into effect in three months.In case of OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, the government has established a three-stair (three-level) grievance redressal mechanism which has following parts: self-regulation by the publishers, self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the publishers, and an oversight mechanism.Here are the main points of the new guidelines announced by Union ministers Prakasah Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad:Additional due diligence to be followed by significant social media intermediary||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-points-from-govt-guidelines-to-curb-misuse-of-social-media-101614244488164.html
25-02-2021||India||NSA Doval led secret back-channels talks with Pak for months before DGMO pact||The joint statement issued by India and Pakistan on the ceasefire agreement between their top military commanders comes months after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his counterpart in Islamabad initiated back-channel conversations to ensure peace along the borders, people aware of the matter said.NSA Doval and Moeed W Yusuf, Prime Minister Imran Khan's special assistant on National Security Division and Strategic Policy Planning, have been in touch directly and via interlocutors from the intelligence community, a person familiar with the negotiations said.Moeed Yusuf initially appeared to confirm that the two countries had been making efforts behind the scenes at a diplomatic level. Later in a tweet, he, however, insisted that this was being handled by the DGMO and not him. Watch: India-Pak ceasefire: The Ajit Doval factor & Islamabad’s reactionThe joint statement is the first outcome of these conversations that included at least one face-to-face meeting in a third country, the person cited above said. He added that only a small group of top government leaders including Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar were aware of the details of the talks.Thursday’s joint statement, issued in New Delhi by the defence ministry, said the director generals of military operations (DGMO) of the two armies had agreed to “strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control” from Wednesday midnight.The two top commanders also “agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns which have a propensity to disturb the peace and lead to violence”.To be sure, this is not the first time that the two top army officers have agreed to hold peace along the border. They signed off on a similar pact in 2018 when they pledged to strictly adhere to the terms of the ceasefire understanding of 2003 in letter and spirit.Officials said Thursday’s joint statement could be the first of the many steps that the two countries may take over the next few months to normalise relations, one step at a time.National security planners said there were five developments over the last month or so that indicated a nuanced shift.The first sign that the back-channel conversations were on track came earlier this month. Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, in sharp contrast to his strident pitch against India after the Balakot air strike in 2019, on February 2 spoke of Islamabad’s commitment to what he called the ideal of mutual respect and peaceful co-existence and said: “it is time to extend a hand of peace in all directions”.The next was the toned-down statements that emerged from Islamabad three days later, on February 5 which is observed by the Pakistani establishment as Kashmir Solidarity Day. “I found it unusual,” said a counter-terror official who wasn’t in the loop on the secret talks.Simultaneously, the official said there was a decline in the ceasefire violations along the border in Jammu and Kashmir in recent weeks.A top government functionary said Gen Bajwa’s much-publicised peace proposal, a decline in ceasefire violations and Pakistan’s toned-down rhetoric were linked to the quiet conversations that had been taking place.The fourth sign of a possible thaw in the relations was Pakistan steering clear of the Kashmir issue at last week’s Saarc meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Health, restricted himself to the issue at hand, a sharp contrast to Pakistan’s previous attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the Saarc meeting held in March last year.The fifth indicator, an official said, was New Delhi’s gesture to allow Imran Khan’s special aircraft to use the Indian airspace en route to Sri Lanka on Tuesday. PM Khan’s Pakistan Air Force jet flew along India’s coastline and over the Lakshadweep archipelago before landing in Colombo.The decision to allow the special flight to use its airspace was in marked contrast to Pakistan’s action in 2019, when Islamabad denied permission for the use of Pakistani airspace by three Indian VVIP flights.In September 2019, Pakistan didn’t permit the use of its airspace by a special flight carrying President Ram Nath Kovind to Europe, and another flight in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to US to attend the UN General Assembly session. Pakistani also didn’t allow the use of its airspace by another VVIP flight during Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-doval-led-secret-back-channels-talks-with-pak-for-months-before-dgmo-pact-101614243251747.html
25-02-2021||India||'Living together as partners not same as Indian family unit': Centre opposes same sex marriage in Delhi HC||The Centre on Thursday told the Delhi high court that living together as partners and having sexual relationship by same-sex couple not comparable with Indian family unit. The Centre's response was filed in the form of an affidavit.Opposing same sex marriages, the Centre said, "While a marriage may be between two private individuals having a profound impact on their private lives, it cannot be relegated to merely a concept within the domain of privacy of an individual.""Living together as partners & having sexual relationship by same sex individual is not comparable with Indian family unit concept of a husband, wife & children which necessarily presuppose a biological man as 'husband', a biological woman as 'wife' and children born out of union," it further said in a affidavit.The Centre said that registration of marriage of same sex persons also results in violation of existing personal as well as codified law provisions."It is submitted that the Parliament has designed and framed the marriage laws in the country, which are governed by the personal laws/codified laws relatable to customs of various religious communities, to recognise only the union of a man and a woman to be capable of religious sanction, and thereby claim legal and statutory sanction. It is submitted that any interference with the same would cause a complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country," the Centre said in the affidavit.The government also said that in same-sex marriage, it is neither possible nor feasible to term one as husband and the other one as wife. "Resultantly the statutory scheme of many statutory enactments will become otiose," it said.The Centre's affidavit was filed in response to the high court notice on a petition seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages.The plea has contended that the Hindu Marriage Act does not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual marriages if one were to go by how it is worded. It added the Act very clearly states that marriage can be solemnised between “any two Hindus”.The petition was filed by members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex community in September last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/living-together-as-partners-not-same-as-indian-family-unit-centre-opposes-same-sex-marriage-in-delhi-hc-101614243565759.html
25-02-2021||India||India's healthcare workers balk at taking homegrown Covid-19 vaccine||India is struggling to convince its health and front-line workers to take a homegrown Covid-19 vaccine controversially approved without late-stage efficacy data, government data showed on Thursday, days ahead of a wider roll-out.The country has the world's second-highest number of Covid-19 infections after the United States, with cases recently surging as mask wearing declines and states have eased social distancing measures. A lack of confidence in a homegrown vaccine country could prevent India from meeting its target of vaccinating 300 million of its 1.35 billion people by August.India has vaccinated more than 10.5 million health and front-line workers since beginning its immunisation campaign on Jan. 16.But only 1.2 million, or about 11%, of them have taken COVAXIN, the locally developed vaccine from Bharat Biotech, while the remaining 9.4 million have used the vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca, according to the government's Co-Win online platform used to track the vaccination drive.India's federal government has so far ordered 10 million doses of COVAXIN and 21 million doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca shot. The government says it has received at least 5.5 million COVAXIN doses."It's all because of the initial discussion about how (COVAXIN) was only an experimental vaccine, how it had not completed the Phase-3 trial," said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who advises the Maharashtra state government on vaccine strategy."These things created doubts in the minds of people, resulting in lesser acceptance. The availability is not a concern at this juncture."However, India's Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday attributed the lower uptake of COVAXIN to Bharat Biotech's limited production capacity compared to that of the Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest vaccine producer, which is making the AstraZeneca shot for low- and medium-income countries."We have found that in proportion to the quantity of vaccine available with us, (COVAXIN's) off-take is fairly satisfactory," told a news conference.His ministry did not respond to a request seeking comment on the latest figures showing that only about 12% of the ordered doses had been administered.Earlier this month, Chhattisgarh, an opposition-ruled state of 32 million people, told the federal government it would not use COVAXIN until its efficacy could be proven in an ongoing late-stage trial. Epidemiologist and public health experts have also criticised the COVAXIN approval as rushed.Bharat Biotech has said efficacy data from the trial on nearly 26,000 volunteers will be out soon. The company, along with India's drug regulator, says the vaccine is safe and effective based on early and intermediate studies.Bharat Biotech did not immediately comment on the lower uptake of its vaccine.Cases RisingThe government is trying to expedite vaccinations as cases have surged, especially in Maharashtra in the west and the southern state of Kerala, possibly as they have reopened suburban trains and schools.Mask-wearing and social distancing has also largely vanished, with big events like international cricket matches being played in front of tens of thousands of spectators hardly following any Covid-19 rules.India reported 16,738 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, the highest daily jump in a month, health ministry data showed on Thursday, raising the total to 11.05 million.More than half of the new cases were in Maharashtra, India's richest and home to its financial capital Mumbai, which reported a record high of 8,807 cases on Wednesday.Deaths across the country rose by 138, also the highest in a month, taking the total to 156,705.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-healthcare-workers-balk-at-taking-homegrown-covid-19-vaccine-101614242736582.html
25-02-2021||India||'Needed level playing field': Govt announces new online media rules||Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar on Thursday released the guidelines of new rules to regulate digital content on social media to curb the misuse of the platforms. "Social media is welcome to do business India," Prasad said as he began laying out the guidelines. The government welcomes criticism of the government and the right to dissent, but it is very important that the users must be given a forum to raise their grievance against the abuse and misuse of social media, he said."Concerns have been raised over the years about rampant abuse of social media... the ministry had widespread consultations and we prepared a draft in December 2018. There'll be two categories - intermediary which can be social media intermediary and significant social media intermediary," Prasad said during the briefing.As per the new guidelines, social media platforms are required to disclose the first originator of mischievous tweet or message if they are asked by the government, the information and technology minister announced. They are also required to submit a compliance report every month."This should be only in relation to sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, public order, relations with foreign states, or rape, sexually explicit content etc," he also said.The social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter are also ordered to have to have a grievance redressal mechanism under which they are required to name a grievance officer who shall register the grievance within 24 hours and disposal in 15 days.Social media platforms are also required to have provision for voluntary verification of users.The laws made for social media will come into effect in the next three months, Prasad also said. "The government has given three months of window to the social media companies to improve their mechanism," he added.For OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hotsar, the union minister announced that they will have to have a self-regulating body which "will be headed by a retired Supreme Court or high court judge or very eminent person in this category."An oversight mechanism will also be set up at the government level to deal with case that required immediate action.The new guidelines also mandates self-classification of content on all OTT platforms, Javadekar also said. The categories will be 13+, 16+ and A (Adult) categories. "There has to be a mechanism of parental lock and ensuring compliance that children don't see that," he also said during the briefing.Until now, the online news publishers, social media platforms and OTT streaming services were not regulated under the Information and Broadcasting ministry. It was brought under the its ambit last year after the government received several complaints regarding fake news and explicit shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-releases-guidelines-to-regulate-digital-content-on-social-media-101614243250700.html

The police, however, dismissed the allegations as a campaign to discredit the special surrender drive launched in the Maoist-infested district.Sori further alleged that the sarpanch and others from the girl’s village said there were no ligature marks on Kawasi’s neck, suggesting they doubted the police's version that she died by hanging.“Kumari Jogi, a Maoist, was nabbed by the police from the village along with one another innocent woman. The duo were brought to the district headquarters and after interrogation, police forced them to surrender. Police claimed that the deceased was a member of CNM, which is not true… Forceful surrender took place due to which she was not happy,” said Soni Sori.On Tuesday, Dantewada police claimed Kawasi was a Maoist cadre, who surrendered with five others on February 19 and died by suicide a few days later on February 23. She was a resident of Gudse village under Katekalyan police station in the district. As per the police, Kawasi was a member of Chetna Natya Mandli (CNM) - a cultural wing of the Maoists and had approached police on February 18 along with a senior woman Maoist cadre, Kumari Jogi (36), a member of Katekalyan area committee of the banned group, expressing their willingness to surrender.Sori further claimed that on Tuesday, village sarpanch and others came to meet Kawasi but the police did not let them.“The villagers came on Tuesday to meet the woman since they came to know that she was not happy. The police told them that interrogation was going on but she died by suicide. Some people, who saw the body on Tuesday, claimed there was no mark on her neck… We believe that someone killed her. A probe should be ordered,” Sori continued.Dantewada superintendent of police (SP) Abhishek Pallava said the deceased surrendered in front of the media and her interrogation report as well as the statement of Jogi along with others she worked with clearly mentions that she was working as a CNM member for the past six months.“When villagers came to meet her on February 21, she clearly said she did not want to go back to her village. She wanted to work with the police along with Jogi,” Pallava said, adding, as per the surrender policy, whoever accepts working as a Maoist during the interrogation, can surrender.As far as allegation of murder was concerned, a detailed post-mortem was being done by a team of doctors including a forensic expert and it was videographed, he said.“Statements of surrendered cadres and the police personnel present lead to the conclusion of suicide. There is no motive for murder in the case. A magisterial inquiry has already been ordered by the collector of Dantewada. This campaign is being done on the behest of the Maoists to defame the ‘Lon Varatu’ campaign. As per initial probe, it seems the Maoists were holding meetings in Katekalyan area, forcing families and public representatives to go to Dantewada and bring surrendered cadres back to their fold,” said the SP.Also Read:2 security personnel killed in Chhattisgarh’s Narayanpur in Maoist attacksSoni, however, questioned the Lone Varatu campaign and alleged fake and forceful surrenders were taking place under the campaign.“The tribals of Dantewada are in fear because of the Lone Varratu because of forced surrenders. This should be stopped,” Soni alleged.“We don’t need forced surrenders since 316 Maoists have laid down arms including 82 who had rewards on their heads. All surrendered cadres are presented before the media in a transparent manner. Surrender and rehabilitation is a much better option than being jailed for years together,” the SP said, responding to the allegations.Lon Varratu in local Gondi language means Return Home. Maoists in about 50 hypersensitive villages are being encouraged by Dantewada administration to surrender under this programme, police claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-allegations-cloud-alleged-suicide-of-surrendered-woman-maoist-101614240338633.html

A 14.2 kg LPG cylinder will now cost ₹794 in the national capital in contrast to the previous price of ₹769.This rise in the prices of the LPG gas cylinders comes for the third time this month. Earlier, the cost of the domestic gas cylinders was increased by ₹25 on February 4 and then by ₹50 on February 15.The new price of the LPG gas cylinders in Kolkata is now ₹820, increased from ₹795. In Mumbai, the cylinders will now cost ₹794 as against ₹769, in Chennai, it will cost ₹810 as against ₹785, and in Hyderabad, it will be ₹846.50 against the previous price of ₹821.50.Also Read | Petrol costs ₹90.93, diesel ₹81.32 in Delhi. Check fuel prices in different statesThe LPG domestic gas cylinders have witnessed a hike of ₹200 in three months. In December last year, the price of the domestic cylinders rose by ₹100 each while there was no change in the prices in January.Thie LPG price hike comes in the backdrop of rising petrol and diesel prices. The Modi government has been immensely criticised for not reducing the high taxes levied on the fuel that is driving the retail cost to touch peaks as the global crude oil rates rebound.The government had increased the taxes on fuel when the global crude oil rates had plunged to a two-decade low due to the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic in April last year. The opposition parties have been protesting against the recent fuel price hike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lpg-gets-costlier-by-rs-25-one-cylinder-to-cost-rs-794-in-delhi-101614236724967.html
25-02-2021||India||Covid-19 samples from 8 Maharashtra districts sent for testing of new mutations||As cases of Covid-19 surge in Maharashtra, samples from about eight districts have been sent to laboratories across the country, including the National Institute of Virology and National Center for Disease Control, to find out if any new variant is behind the increasing number of cases.Speaking to ANI, the advisor to the state for Covid control Dr Subhash Salunke said, "The ICMR has not been able to clearly come out whether is there any new mutant virus or not, that study is being done at NIV and NCDC and other few laboratories in the country, 8 districts of Maharashtra have already sent the required number of 100 samples per district. Results of these studies will be available to us maximum by the end of this week or maybe in another 8 to 10 days. After that, we will be able to confidently state whether the mutation has taken place, if the indigenous strain has mutated and if it is there then what type of mutation it is etc."The transmission of cases has increased rapidly in some districts of the Vidarbha region. Districts such as Amravati have been reporting over 20 per cent positivity rate in the last few days."Our finding shows that transmission rate has increased, in some cases the whole locality or a family is affected. Even last time when cases were at the peak we could not see such a trend even in Pune or Mumbai, but we could see this picture in Amravati or Yavatmal this time. The positivity rate in Amravati and surrounding areas has gone up to 20% to 25% hence one thing is clear that something is wrong with the virus because the behaviour of the people is the same everywhere in every district. This change is the clear indication that some changes in the virus are there but exact details of the changes will be clear once we get the scientific data after study." said Dr Salunke.Earlier samples tested at BJ Medical college laboratory in Pune have shown that the UK and Africa strain are not the reason behind the sudden surge of cases in parts of Maharashtra, however, scientists at multiple laboratories across the country are also working to find out if any indigenous variant of the virus is behind the spike.Dr Salunke also cautioned the authorities about the possible spread of this virus to other states if it is not controlled in time."It is also showing concentrated spur in some of the areas like Vidarbha region and now it is slowly getting transmitted to other districts such as Pune and even Mumbai. If we don't control it right now it may spread to other states because the potential is there," Dr Salunke said.However, he said that proper treatment is available to patients and added that the present treatment strategy is working well.He also added that clinicians across the country have treated lakhs of patients last year and are clear about the treatment for patients.Dr Subhash Salunkhe also chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee. He was the former director general of health services, Maharashtra and WHO chief of Indonesia.

25-02-2021||India||Armies of India, Pakistan agree to ceasefire along LoC from Feb 24 midnight||In a surprise development, Indian and Pakistani militaries announced on Thursday that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24.A joint statement issued by the armies of both countries said the move followed a discussion between India’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha, and his Pakistani counterpart, Maj Gen Nauman Zakaria, over their established telephone hotline.The move comes at a time when the Indian military is largely focused on the standoff with China in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which emerged in the open in May last year, though there has been no let-up in counter-terrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir.Also Read: NSA Doval led secret back-channels talks with Pak for months before DGMO pactDuring their discussion on the hotline, the two sides “reviewed the situation along the Line of Control and all other sectors in a free, frank and cordial atmosphere”, the joint statement said.“Both sides agreed for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control and all other sectors with effect from midnight 24/25 Feb 2021,” the statement added.The DGMOs also “agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence” in the interest of “achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders”.Also Read: Long way to go for full LAC de-escalation: Army chief General NaravaneThe two sides further said that existing mechanisms of hotline contact and border flag meetings will be used to “resolve any unforeseen situation or misunderstanding”.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the established convention of weekly contacts between officials of the Directorate General of Military Operations of the two countries had continued in recent months despite periodic flare-ups along the LoC. The DGMOs speak on the hotline when there is a specific request from one side, the people added.Troops from the two sides have traded fire since relations between the two countries hit a low after the Pulwama suicide attack in February 2019 and India’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019.The people said that while the Indian side had agreed on the ceasefire, there was no question of lowering the guard when it comes to operations to counter infiltration along the LoC or terrorism within Jammu and Kashmir.“The main idea is to have peace along the LoC so that the local population doesn’t suffer,” said one of the people cited above.India and Pakistan had agreed along a ceasefire on the LoC in November 2003 but it has been frequently violated in recent years.On Wednesday, the Indian Army chief, Gen MM Naravane, had said India wants peace and tranquillity along all its borders, be it the LAC, LoC or the frontier with Myanmar.“With our continuous engagement with Pakistan, we will be able to prevail over them (for border peace)...as unsettled borders help no one,” he told a virtual seminar.Naravane, however, said terror launchpads were active across the LoC, and the army will be prepared for a fresh influx of infiltrators in the summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armies-of-india-pakistan-agree-to-ceasefire-along-loc-from-feb-24-midnight-101614239032092.html

25-02-2021||India||Fashion forward: Parliament staff get great deals on clothes, accessories||Branded fabric for ₹49 per metre, or a pair of socks for ₹18—Lok Sabha authorities are offering a whole range of cloth and accessories for its officers at prices that can beat any end-of-season sale. The secretariat has put out a circular listing as many as 50 items available for sale—fabric for shirts, trousers, summer suits, winter suits, uniforms for marshals of the House, belts, shoes, socks, neckties and even leather gloves and jackets. A leather jacket is available for ₹1,600, while a pair of leather shoes for drivers and attendants can be bought for ₹520. Shoes for protocol department officials, who handle VVIP guests and international seminars, are priced at ₹1,200. Similarly, fabrics from Mayur for protocol officers are available from ₹473 per metre, while white shirts can be bought at ₹300 each. But these items are only available for House officials and one can only buy up to six metres of fabric. Most of them are branded items. One can get fabrics from Raymonds, Reid and Taylor or even Mayur and Vimal. As many as 17 items are available at steeper discounts, including Reid and Tailor cloth for reporters’ uniforms at ₹32 per metre or Raymond cloth for summer uniforms at just ₹32 per metre. Also Read | Facebook now says it’s not obligated to appear before Parliamentary panelsIndian Parliament secretariat has about 2,500 officials. They only buy cloth for their uniform from the secretariat as it matches the prescribed colour and style. The strict dress code of Lok Sabha officials has seen several changes over the years. Its biggest transformation took place in 2019, leading to better quality of uniforms this year. Earlier, Lok Sabha officials would buy cloth once in two years, which they would get stitched by any of the 4-5 Delhi tailors empanelled with the secretariat. Now, women officers get a uniform allowance of up to ₹17,000 and men get up to ₹16,000, depending on the nature of their jobs and ranks. Reporting branch, table office and security service officials, drivers and chamber attendants are eligible for this uniform allowance. “These branches deal with MPs and other visitors. They are the face of the Parliament secretariat in public and so, they have a set uniform that adds to the dignity of Indian Parliament,” said a senior official. The benefit of this allowance system, several officers pointed out, is that officials can buy their new uniforms whenever they want, instead of getting it every two years. Also, they are free to buy clothes, which must adhere to the fixed colour patterns, of better quality. The women officers wear a fixed patterned saree, while men can wear a range of safari suits—blue, fawn, Prussian blue, charcoal—depending on the section they work in. In winter, men and women have to wear blazers and buttoned up coats. While the table office handles the entire range of paperwork for the House, receiving notices for debates, introduction of Bills or sorting questions for the Question Hour, Parliament security is a special branch handling all security aspects of the estate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fashion-forward-parliament-staff-get-great-deals-on-clothes-accessories-101614236812308.html

It is the same situation in the Depsang bulge area and across the Daulet Beg Oldi sector even as the military commanders on both sides work towards a roadmap to restore status quo ante on East Ladakh LAC.However, the concern of the national security planners is the rapid infrastructure upgrades that the PLA is undertaking across Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. There is evidence to show increased troop and equipment sheds and better road communication across Naku La in north Sikkim. The PLA simultaneously transgressed into the Naku La sector in May 2020 with both armies engaging in fisticuffs. The PLA created Naku La as a friction point around six years ago with the intention to convey that while Beijing recognises Sikkim as part of Indian territory, the border still is unresolved.The other area of concern is the rapid military-infra upgrade across the Upper Subansiri district in Arunachal Pradesh with the PLA constructing at least three new bridges, a new 66-kilometre road and troop sheds in the area.“It is a matter of concern as it shows that the PLA is focused on the LAC despite disengaging from Pangong Tso. It clearly shows that the Indian Army has to maintain vigil all along the unsettled border including the central sector across Uttarakhand,” said a senior official.Although New Delhi and Beijing have continued discreet conversations between top officials on both sides, Indian diplomats and security officials believe that India will have to prepare strategies to deal with both aggressive and friendly China and cannot afford to let the guard down. China continues to play behind scenes in Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh after virtually snaring Pakistan and Sri Lanka in its debt trap under the garb of benign connectivity, a security official said.The Chinese game plan goes beyond accessing Indian Ocean with security ramifications for Indian Navy by providing long sea legs to adversaries of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-india-china-work-on-ladakh-concerns-over-infra-push-across-sikkim-arunachal-101614228211456.html

Additional sessions judge Dharemendar Rana passed the order after the public prosecutor submitted that no coercive action will be taken against Pune-based Muluk, an engineer by profession.Also Read | Toolkit case: Shantanu Muluk’s bail plea hearing todayArguing for the Delhi Police, which is conducting an investigation into the case, public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed informed the bench that Muluk’s replies to it in connection with the case were inconsistent and full of contradictions. The public prosecutor further submitted in the court that the police would need seven days to file a detailed reply.Following this, judge Rana directed that no coercive action should be taken against Muluk, extending his interim protection till March 9. Earlier, on Wednesday, the court had sought the police’s response on the anticipatory bail plea filed by Muluk and posted arguments on it for Thursday.On February 16, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court had granted transit anticipatory bail to him for 10 days. Nikita Jacob, another accused in the case, too, has already been granted three-week transit anticipatory bail by the High Court. On Tuesday, Disha Ravi, the only accused to be arrested in this case thus far, was granted bail by Additional sessions judge Rana.Ravi was arrested on February 13 and sent to five-day police custody. She was then sent to three and one-day judicial custody respectively, before finally getting bail.The controversy dates back to earlier this month, when international climate activist Great Thunberg tweeted a 'toolkit' over the ongoing farmers’ protest in India. The Delhi Police then filed an FIR against ‘unknown’ persons, later naming Ravi, Muluk and Jacob as the three main accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-shantanu-muluk-gets-interim-protection-from-arrest-till-march-9-101614231740159.html

Check fuel prices in different states||Petrol and diesel prices are far above their peak this year touching ₹100 mark in states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. While no fuel price rise has been reported on Thursday, petrol price in Delhi is ₹90.93 per litre and diesel costs ₹81.32 per litre, as per goods returns.The increase in the prices of the fuel primarily depends on the crude oil prices in the international market as India is dependent on import 85 per cent of its crude oil needs.The last hike in the prices of petrol and diesel was on Tuesday when the fuels prices rose by ₹35 litre each.Fuel prices in the country had witnessed a rise consecutively for twelve days before a two-day pause on February 21 and 22.Here is how much petrol and diesel cost as of Thursday in different cities of India:In Kolkata, the price of petrol is ₹91.12, Mumbai ₹97.34, Chennai ₹92.97, Bengaluru ₹93.98, Bhubaneswar ₹91.50, Chandigarh ₹87.50, Hyderabad ₹94.54, Jaipur ₹97.96, Trivandrum ₹92.65.Diesel price in Kolkata is ₹84.20, Mumbai ₹88.44, Chennai ₹86.37, Bengaluru ₹86.21, Bhubaneswar ₹88.47, Chandigarh ₹81.02, Hyderabad ₹88.69, Jaipur ₹90.27, Trivandrum ₹87.22.Also Read | Tests on kids: Expert panel asks Bharat Biotech to submit Covaxin efficacy data firstThe prices of petrol and diesel per litre cost different in different cities across India due to the VAT (local taxes) and freight levied.

However, the tax rates are still unchanged when the global rates have recovered taking the fuel prices to record highs.About 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol is central and state taxes, while for diesel these taxes make up for 54 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-costs-rs-90-93-diesel-rs-81-32-in-delhi-check-fuel-prices-in-different-states-101614227620471.html
25-02-2021||India||India, Bangladesh to start bi-weekly passenger train from March 26||India and Bangladesh on Wednesday announced a bi-weekly train between New Jalpaiguri (NJP) in north Bengal and Dhaka in Bangladesh starting March 26, the day the neighbouring country begins the golden jubilee celebrations of its independence.The non-stop passenger train with ten bogeys, running between New Jalpaiguri and Dhaka, will cover a distance of 513km. This will also be the third passenger train between the two countries. The other two are: Maitree Express that runs between Kolkata and Dhaka, and Bandhan Express that connects Kolkata and Khulna. Ravindra Kumar Verma, divisional railway manager of India’s Katihar division, said: “We held a detailed discussion with a team of Bangladesh railway officers led by Mohammed Shahidul Islam, the divisional railway manager of Bangladesh’s railways’ Paksey division, who arrived in Siliguri on February 22.”The Haldibari-Chilahati (in Bangladesh) train route was opened after a gap of 55 years for goods trains on December 17 last year. The passenger train between New Jalpaiguri and Dhaka will take the same route. Also Read | Assam Congress collects over 1 lakh ‘gamosas’ with anti-CAA messageIslam said, “The train services will improve the bilateral relations between the two countries and will boost the tourism industry in both the countries.” The name of the train and its fare are yet to be decided, said Verma. Custom and immigration facilities will be provided at NJP and Dhaka railway stations. The train will ply from NJP on Thursdays and Fridays and from Dhaka on Fridays and Tuesdays.Once the passenger train service on the Haldibari-Chilahati route is resumed, many other trains between North Bengal and Kolkata could avoid detours, taking this route instead.

The state finance department said the tax rate for diesel has been reduced from ₹11.08 to ₹10.51 per liter or 17.50% to 16.50% per liter (whichever is higher) while the tax on petrol and other motor spirits has been reduced from ₹18.26 to ₹16.04 per liter or 29.80% to 25% per litre (whichever is higher). The reduction in fuel tax came into effect from February 22.The price of petrol which was retailing at around ₹93.48 and diesel at ₹84.35 on February 21 in the state capital Kohima, before the tax cut, is being retailed at ₹90.41 and ₹83.99 on Wednesday respectively.The prices of petrol and diesel have been on the rise for the last month due to increasing prices of crude oil in the international market on the back of rising demand and hope after the launch of coronavirus vaccines in several countries. Prices of petrol and diesel across the country are market-determined and attract uniform central excise duty, but their prices differ from state to state because of the wide variations in the local levies or value-added tax. The Central government levies ₹32.98 per litre of excise duty on petrol and ₹31.83 a litre on diesel. Central and state taxes make up for over 61% of the retail selling price of petrol and about 56% of diesel in most states.Also Read: 'Nagaland government wrongly used funds belonging to employees': CAG reportRising fuel prices have become a huge political issue in the country with the opposition targeting the government for not reducing Central taxes to bring relief to the common man. However, the Central government has termed the issue to be vexed given the need to generate revenues to meet budgetary targets after the slump due to coronavirus induced slowdown in the economy.In some states, the price of petrol crossed ₹100 a litre due the current streak of rise in prices. The decision of the Nagaland government to cut fuel rates follows similar reductions in neighbouring states- Assam and Meghalaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-cuts-taxes-on-petrol-and-diesel-fuel-prices-come-down-101614219207448.html

I would like to thank the people of Gujarat from the bottom of my heart. The people of Surat have handed over the responsibility to the Aam Aadmi Party as the main opposition party and rejected the Congress,” he said in a video message.“Gujarat has introduced a phase of new politics, which is politics of honesty, politics of work, politics of improved schools and hospitals, and politics of 24x7 free electricity,” said Kejriwal.“We will change the face of Gujarat in coordination with the people of the state.

Two among those six injured are in serious condition.SDPI had taken out a rally on Wednesday in Alappuzha’s Wayalar, which was deemed provocative by the RSS workers and led to clashes between both groups leading to the death of a 22-year-old RSS worker, R Nandu. The RSS worker was stabbed to death during the clashes.Police have held six SDPI workers with connection to the murder. Police presence in Wayalar has been increased in the district in the wake of the violence. Following the death of the RSS worker, the group has called for a district-wide strike on Thursday. The RSS has also asked its workers to exercise maximum restraint and not give into provocation. The SDPI, youth wing of Popular Front of India (PFI), has been involved in several clashes in the past. The Popular Front of India has been involved in clashes and political murders since its inception. The outfit was formed in 2006 after three Muslim organizations floated after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 - the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of Tamil Nadu merged.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) and other intelligence agencies say that the group has seen a phenomenal rise, according to a HT report. The central agency after finding out the first Islamic State (IS) module in Kerala found that some of those arrested belonged to PFI. The group claims that it is a neo-social movement committed to empower people belonging to the minority communities, Dalits and other weaker sections of the society.(with inputs from Ramesh Babu)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-worker-stabbed-to-death-in-kerala-during-sdpi-rally-101614215499989.html
25-02-2021||India||‘Differences will arise if laws are steamrolled’: Mallikarjun Kharge||The newly appointed Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress, brings nearly half a century of legislative experience to the post. He spoke to Vinod Sharma on a range of issues. Edited excerpts:You were only half-LoP in the Lok Sabha from 2014 to 2019 as the Congress lacked the numbers to be the recognised Opposition. By that measure, your LoP status in the Rajya Sabha seems a promotion.There’s nothing like half a leader. I led a national party which got over 10 crore votes in the general elections. The speaker could have suspended the rule requiring 10% of the House strength to be the recognised Opposition. She (Sumitra Mahajan) did not, nor did the government. Not having the logistical support that’s officially provided to the LoP was no handicap. My party and my leader Sonia Gandhi lent me that support.The foremost requirement in the role I played was to be a strong Opposition voice on matters that impacted the people, especially the poor, the farmers, and the working class. They (the treasury benches) would insult us by pointing to our numerical weakness. They forgot that they had just two MPs after the 1984 polls. At that time, the Congress did not insult a great leader like Atal Bihari Vajpayee. My party’s frugal strength never weighed me down. The Rajya Sabha position is no elevation. I’m only a recognised LoP. When Ghulam Nabi Azad took over, we had over 70 members. Today our army is reduced; we have to fight with a bench strength of 36 but there will be no let-up in our battle for the people’s welfare.The Congress’s Rajya Sabha construct is top-heavy. Its 36 MPs include several frontline leaders. Could there be problems bringing on the same page the likes of Manmohan Singh, AK Antony, P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma, Digvijaya Singh, Ambika Soni, Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Singhvi, Jairam Ramesh and KC Venugopal?They’re experienced, intelligent people constituting the cream of our party. I’ve known them for long, as I joined the Congress after the 1969 split. I’ll seek their advice. My worry is the allocation of time for important debates the ruling side tends to curtail.The Congress took divergent stands in the two Houses in the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address. The Rajya Sabha debated while there was a logjam in the other House, bringing forth the lack of coordination between the party’s legislative wings.Such decisions get driven by situations in the Houses. Divergence could be as much on account of government’s divergent approach in the Lok Sabha [where it has a big majority], and the Upper House where the numbers are relatively balanced. Our legislative wings were working together and will continue to do so.The late Ananth Kumar was the parliamentary affairs minister when you were in Lok Sabha. Even the incumbent, Pralhad Joshi, is from your state of Karnataka. Will the coincidence help?We might be from the same state but we’ve ideological differences. We’ll cooperate, but it’s the government’s responsibility to take all Opposition parties along — convincingly and not through bulldozer tactics — for the smooth conduct of Parliament.Your predecessor Ghulam Nabi Azad had cordial working relations with Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How do you rate your personal equation with them?Naidu is from Andhra but has been a Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka. I’ve known him well. Now he’s the vice-president and chairperson of our House. We respect the position he holds, and assure him of our support...we expect him to recognise the Opposition’s right to raise and debate issues. As for the PM, he’s de jure the leader of the Lok Sabha but de facto the leader of both houses. We respect the PM, but differences will arise if laws are steamrolled — as was the case with labour reforms and the farm legislation. We won’t accept that the party that has the majority can do anything.What was your experience when you and the PM were members of committees that appointed chiefs of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Central Vigilance Commission?The majority view prevailed. I gave dissenting notes (as was the case when an interim CBI director was appointed). They called me a dissenting leader. But reasoned dissent is the Opposition’s prerogative. The problem arose because the PM didn’t consider the other view. Democracy provides for differing perceptions without prejudice or vengeance.Certain legislation being brought as money bills could be a sticking point in the second half of the Budget session. Your colleagues have urged the Lok Sabha Speaker to ensure bicameral scrutiny of privatisation proposals....Our job is to scrutinise the bills passed by the Lower House. That ensures robust law-making and safeguards against judicial intervention. We’ll discuss the matter in our party and take a stand. The government’s policy to dismantle and not repair public sector undertakings will impact the common man and the job quotas for the SCs/STs/OBCs. Even profitable PSUs are being shut. That will kill reserved employment, while the private sector which gets lakhs of crores of rupees written off as NPAs is loath to offer opportunities to the weaker sections. That’s why the Rajya Sabha must scrutinise such laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/differences-will-arise-if-laws-are-steamrolled-mallikarjun-kharge-101614215864486.html
25-02-2021||India||Citing poor infra, SC seeks legislative impact study on consumer law||Concerned over massive vacancies and severe deficiency in the infrastructure across consumer courts in the country, the Supreme Court has asked the Central government whether a “legislative impact study” was carried out before a new consumer protection law was notified in July 2020.An SC bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, directed the government to place the said study before the court to indicate if social, economic and institutional impacts were taken into account prior to replacing the 1986 consumer protection law with the 2019 law, which was brought into force in July 2020.The bench, which also included justice Hemant Gupta, underlined that the new law widened the meaning of “consumer” allowing them to file a complaint from his place of residence; brought e-commerce platforms within the fold of the law; provided for time-bound redressal; made celebrity-endorsers also liable and enhanced the monetary jurisdiction of the consumer courts at all levels.Under the 2019 law, a district forum can decide a consumer dispute up to ₹1 crore as against ₹20 lakh under the old law. Similarly, pecuniary jurisdiction of state commission has been enhanced from ₹1 crore to ₹10 crore, and a national commission can now decide disputes over and above ₹10 crore.Citing these radical changes, the bench said: “The new act expands the jurisdiction of the consumer forums to many new areas and thus, logically a legislative impact study ought to have been completed, keeping in mind the litigation, which will shift in the subjects added to the jurisdiction of the consumer tribunals. There is also a shifting of pecuniary jurisdiction. This would also result in transfer of a large number of cases between forums. Thus, the legislative impact study ought to have taken this into consideration as to what are the cases which are likely to be shifted.”Noting that more than 600 vacancies existed across the consumer courts, the court emphasised that these aspects should have formed a part of the “legislative impact study” to ascertain the volume of cases the consumer courts at different levels will be burdened with not only now but in the reasonable time in the future.“There should have been analysis, both at the state level and at the national level of the number of fora which are required to deal with the increase in the financial jurisdiction and the expanded legal area of jurisdiction,” maintained the bench, as it took up suo motu (on its own) case on the alleged “inaction of the government” in appointing members of the consumer courts and providing adequate infrastructure.The bench heard senior counsel Gopal Shankarnarayan and advocate Aditya Narayan as amicus curiae, who assisted the court, and additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, representing the government, when it regretted that even though the national consumer commission had six vacancies, the matter was with the Appointment Committee of Cabinet (ACC) since July 2020 without any decision on fresh appointments.Also Read: No extra chance for taking UPSC exam: Supreme Court“This is hardly expected at the apex level, as it creates a cascading effect down, which does not speak well of the institution. We expect due care to be taken in this behalf so that at least these vacancies are filled up by the time we take up these proceedings on the next date,” rued the court, fixing April 12 as the next date.The court also directed chief secretaries of all the state governments to send the latest vacancy positions to the national commission for uploading it on the website and also notify the new rules for appointments in the consumer courts, besides filing their reports on the existing infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citing-poor-infra-sc-seeks-legislative-impact-study-on-consumer-law-101614215481701.html
25-02-2021||India||Assam declared ‘disturbed area’ for six months||Ahead of the assembly elections, Assam governor Jagdish Mukhi declared the entire state as ‘Disturbed Area’ for six months starting February 27.The state is scheduled to go to polls in April-May.“As per powers conferred under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, the Governor of Assam has declared the entire state of Assam as ‘disturbed area’ up to six months beyond February 27, 2021, unless withdrawn earlier,” a release issued by the state government stated.The fresh order is an extension of a similar move on August 28 last year, when the state was declared a ‘Disturbed Area’ for six months. There is no official comment yet on the reason behind the extension.However, government officials familiar with the matter cited attacks on security forces in the northeast and recovery of large amounts of arms and ammunition from several parts of Assam as a reason for the move.On Tuesday, 1,040 militants belonging to five different rebel outfits from Karbi Anglong region of the state had laid down arms in front of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-declared-disturbed-area-for-six-months-101614214576479.html
25-02-2021||India||Punjab ‘shamelessly’ backing Mukhtar Ansari: UP govt in Supreme Court||The Uttar Pradesh government accused the Punjab government in the Supreme Court on Wednesday of “shamelessly” supporting criminal-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari after repeated requests to transfer him from Punjab’s Ropar Jail to Banda Jail in UP was turned down by jail authorities citing Ansari’s poor health.When the apex court took up the petition by the UP government seeking Ansari’s transfer out of Punjab, an adjournment request was made by senior advocate Dushyant Dave appearing for the Punjab government.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and RS Reddy posted the matter to Tuesday. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the UP government remarked, “The state (Punjab) seems to be more concerned than the accused.” At this, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi who appeared for Ansari shared a light moment by saying, “I am just a small fly. Two states are fighting over me.”Mehta replied, “You are such a powerful fly that one state is shamelessly coming to your support.” Rohatgi wittingly added, “If that is so, why don’t you make me the chief minister”, at which Mehta quipped, “Possibly, that’s what the state is trying to do.”The banter between the lawyers did not engage the court’s attention. However, documents filed by UP before the court spelt out the bitterness between the two states over being denied the custody of Ansari, who is a sitting member of the UP Legislative Assembly and has 10 cases ranging from murder, extortion, cheating and fraud to those under the Gangster Act against him in the state.“I am appalled (by their statement). May God forgive them for what they are saying! I will like to give reverence to pendency of the matter before a court of law and make no comment,” Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-shamelessly-backing-mukhtar-ansari-up-govt-in-supreme-court-101614213574150.html

Family members told police that it was her second attempt to kill herself in the past 24 hours, according to a police official who did not want to be named.“Prima facie, it appears to be a suspected suicide,” Babu said. “We have got the post-mortem done and are sending the viscera sample to a forensic laboratory for examination. We will be able to disclose the exact cause of death only after forensic examination.”The woman was staying at her uncle’s house since the second week of February, after police said she faked her abduction and alleged a rape attempt.On February 10, the student’s parents called local police on a toll-free number, alleging that miscreants abducted their daughter. They said their daughter managed to make a quick call to alert them. Police rescued the woman from a nearby village.Later, police concluded she misled her parents and police. “She was neither abducted, nor raped,” local police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat told reporters on February 13.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)

25-02-2021||India||Long way to go for full LAC de-escalation: Army chief General Naravane||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Wednesday said that the ongoing disengagement process with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) along the Line of actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh was a “win-win situation” for both sides, but there was “still a long way to go” before de-escalation of conflict in the theatre and eventual de-induction of rival soldiers can be achieved through talks.“For any agreement to last, both sides should feel they have achieved something. The talks have had a good outcome. Disengagement is a very good end result,” the army chief said, responding to a spate of questions on the border standoff after he delivered a talk on the Role of Indian Army in Dealing with National Security Challenges.Vivekananda International Foundation organised the talk.Naravane’s comments came four days after Indian and Chinese generals held talks in eastern Ladakh and agreed to resolve outstanding issues at friction points on the LAC in a “steady and orderly” manner and were unanimous that last week’s Pangong Tso disengagement provided “a good basis” for resolving pending problems.Naravane acknowledged that some issues, including Depsang, remained but strategies were in place to resolve those matters. “We have leverage for negotiating favourable outcomes in future talks, but I would not like to mention those strategies.”Outstanding problems with PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra — friction points on the LAC — were discussed during the 10th round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers of the two sides on February 20.Naravane said the army was progressing cautiously because of the trust deficit with PLA. “Until that trust deficit is removed, we will be wary about the developments there…But at the end of the day, we have achieved a lot,” he said.The army is right to be cautious keeping in view what happened last year along the LAC, in particular at Galwan, and the fact that problems remain at Gogra, Hot Springs, Demchok and Depsang, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“It’s good to hear that there are strategies to resolve the remaining areas. But their success will depend on how far we are able to restore status quo ante. That should be the ultimate objective,” Hooda added.The army chief said China understood that its salami-slicing strategy won’t work with India. Salami slicing refers to a string of small, clandestine actions meant to achieve a larger goal that would be difficult to accomplish in one go.“China is in the habit of making small incremental moves to achieve its goals. Each such move may not be individually noticeable. It (China) has made use of the strategy to make gains in South China Sea without firing a shot or without loss of life. We have shown them this strategy will not work with us and every move will be met resolutely,” the army chief said.Asked what steps were being taken to ensure that PLA does not reoccupy strategic heights on the south bank of Pangong Tso, the army chief said systems were in place to make sure that there is no recapturing of heights and the disengagement process – like previous border agreements – are premised on the fact that the pacts will be observed in letter and spirit. “We will trust but we will also verify.”Referring to the political, diplomatic and military engagement with China to resolve the standoff, he said the “whole of government approach” worked well and helped India chalk out its response to the developments on the border. “Whatever has panned out is the result of this approach and what we have achieved so far is very good,” he said. Naravane said National Security Adviser Ajit Doval’s advice was very useful in chalking out response to developments in the Ladakh sector.The proposals discussed during the February 20 talks to normalise the border situation have been put up by both sides before their higher authorities in order to finalise the future course of disengagement. The talks took place after the completion of the first round of disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Indian army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Gogra and Hot Springs, where rival troops are forward-deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre.The Pangong disengagement took place on strategic heights on both banks of the lake, and saw the two armies pull back their front-line troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns under an agreement reached earlier this month.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points. The first round of disengagement at Pangong Tso involved pulling back troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline as well as withdrawing soldiers holding positions on the Kailash range on the south bank. Under the agreement, neither side will patrol the contested areas between Fingers 4 and 8 until an agreement is reached through future talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-way-to-go-for-full-lac-de-escalation-army-chief-general-naravane-101614212186351.html
25-02-2021||India||No extra chance for taking UPSC exam: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to provide an extra chance to appear for the Civil Services Examination in 2021 to candidates barred by age or number of attempts from taking it, after some of them approached the apex court citing difficulties in preparation that affected their performance in the October 2020 exam.The court did not see merit in the grounds on which the candidates were seeking an extra chance, and was also worried about this setting the wrong kind of precedent.In a February 5 hearing, the government offered candidates who have exhausted their chances an extra one, as a concession, but the court advised it against this, although it said the government is free to exercise its discretion in addressing the grievances of the petitioners.It wasn’t immediately clear whether the government will now go ahead with this offer.Dismissing the plea of nearly 150 candidates who approached the Supreme Court, a three-judge bench comprising justices AM Khanwilkar, Indu Malhotra and Ajay Rastogi said: “What is being claimed and prayed for under the guise of Covid-19 pandemic is nothing but a lame excuse in taking additional attempt to participate in the Civil Service Examination (CSE), 2021.”In its 40-page judgment, the court said the pattern of CSE has remained unchanged since 2015; the candidates got an additional five months to prepare considering that the examination was originally to be held in May 2020; and those petitioning the court chose not to exercise the option to withdraw from the examination despite the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which conducts it, opening a second window for withdrawal between August 1-8, 2020, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The petitioners were mentally prepared to give the examination, the bench noted.Refusing to view the case of the petitioners in isolation, the court found merit in the argument of the Centre that any concession to this batch of petitioners will not be fair to the others. All of them, “irrespective of the nature of attempt (first or second, etc) who appeared in the 2020 Examination must have faced the same consequences as being faced by the writ petitioners… the reasoning would equally apply to those who have crossed the upper age barrier”, reasoned justice Rastogi, who authored the judgment.The court wondered whether a concession to the petitioners could create a similar right for those candidates who withdrew from the examination last year because of a lack of preparation or due to personal reasons.“If this court shows indulgence to [a] few who participated in the examination in 2020, it will set down a precedent and also have cascading effect on examinations in other streams, for which we are dissuaded to exercise plenary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution,” the judges held.UPSC also opposed the petition on the grounds that a favourable judgment could affect various examinations and recruitment tests conducted by it and state service commissions.The Centre initially opposed the petition, but on February 5 offered a “one-time” concession to those candidates who exhausted their last attempt in the examination conducted last year. General category candidates are allowed six attempts. Candidates belonging to other backward classes (OBCs) are allowed nine and those from the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (SCs and STs) can appear as many times as they want. The age bar for the three categories is 32, 35 and 37, respectively.According to government data, 486,952 candidates appeared for the 2020 Civil Service Examination. Of this, 3,863 were appearing for their last attempt, and 2,236 were at the age threshold.Commenting on the one-time concession offered by the Centre at the suggestion of the court, the bench said, “…any relaxation which is not permissible either in attempt or age under the scheme of Rules (for competitive examinations) 2020 apart from being in contravention to the rules, it may be discriminatory, and it is advisable not to exercise discretion in implementing what is being proposed by Centre (respondent 1).”However, the court left the door open by stating that the Centre will be free to exercise its discretion to mitigate the difficulties faced by the petitioners. It said: “We make it clear that this decision would not restrict the Centre (Respondent 1) or the executive in exercising its discretion in meeting out the nature of difficulties as being projected to this court, if come across in future in dealing with the situation, if required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-extra-chance-for-taking-upsc-exam-supreme-court-101614211757166.html
25-02-2021||India||Paid shots from March 1 as India expands Covid-19 vaccine drive||Anyone above the age of 60 or above 45 and with existing illnesses that make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 will be allowed to sign up to receive coronavirus vaccines at government as well as private hospitals from March 1, the Union Cabinet decided on Wednesday.The decision marks a significant opening up of the vaccination drive, with the roll-out for the general public being moved up from the previously estimated window of mid-March, and comes at a time when the country is on the brink of a second wave of infections.“The second phase of the world’s largest vaccination drive will start from Monday in which anybody above 60 years and 45 years plus with co-morbidities will be given vaccines in 10,000 government medical facilities and also over 20,000 private hospitals,” said information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar at the briefing on Cabinet decisions.The doses at the government centres will be free. Private hospitals will be allowed to charge for them, but the rate will be fixed and announced by the government at a later date. This is the first time the private sector will be actively involved in administering vaccines, and doses will be available to eligible people who are willing to pay.While most of the details of the protocols are yet to be finalised, an official said that the sign-ups will initially be allowed through the Aarogya Setu mobile application, which was launched last year as a digital contact tracing tool.“To begin with, the population that is eligible to take the vaccine will be asked to download the Aarogya Setu app. There will be an option under the Co-WIN section where they can register and book an appointment for vaccination,” said a senior government official, privy to the matter, asking not to be named.Once registered, people may also be able to walk in to get their doses, as is the case at present for those eligible at the moment, this person added.For those with comorbid conditions, the government is expected to release a list of qualifying diseases in the coming days.“Gradually, there may also be helplines, interactive voice response (IVR) system option for those with basic phones, and also a web portal for registration -- but the start will happen through the Aarogya Setu app,” the official said.At vaccination sites, those seeking a dose will need to prove their identity by showing a government-issued identity card.India launched the coronavirus vaccination campaign on January 16, and in the period since, a little over 11 million people have received at least one dose. Experts believe now is the time to rapidly ramp up the campaign, since India’s cases have begun to inch up and several states are showing a resurgence.“So far we have immunised only 1% of our population, while Israel has immunised 85%, and the US 23%. At the current pace, we will not be able to achieve the target even by the end of the year. We have to speed up the vaccination drive at least six to ten times,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, who headed the Delhi government’s first committee on controlling and managing Covid-19 infections.At least one of the ways in which it can be done is by opening up the campaign to anyone willing to take shots, particularly since the turnout till now has been a little over 50% of the targeted vaccination per day.“I think, if we need to achieve our target we need to have vaccination in more and more places, we have to open it up in a manner that those who are willing to take the vaccine are allowed to come rather than calling people and them not turning up,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Guleria added that people in high risk group residing in regions seeing a spurt in infections should be immunised quickly “as it will help in decreasing the mortality and hospitalisations”.The situation is now a race against time for India to build up immunity among its population faster than the virus can spread. The discovery of mutated variants, announced by the government on Tuesday, further threatens the country’s grip on the epidemic, receded to its lowest levels less than a fortnight ago.According to the official quoted above, sign-ups will open in a few days and those who receive at least one dose can download a QR-code based certificate through the mobile app, as well as awareness material about vaccines and vaccine-related statistics from across the country.“This section is being further modified to allow beneficiaries to also book an appointment,” said a second official, who asked not to be named.“We are waiting to hear from the government to know what the guidelines are. Now that we have seen in past one month that CoWIN works well, we are confident that scaling up can happen in days. But we will totally abide by government instructions to know how many vaccinations they want us to do in a day, whether we will be allowed to procure directly from manufacturers or the government will provide us with the vaccine,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paid-shots-from-march-1-as-india-expands-covid-19-vaccine-drive-101614210407582.html
25-02-2021||India||Govt rules for online media to include takedown power||The Union government wants to treat online news media publishers at par with traditional media publishers, such as newspapers and news channels, and also bring them under the ambit of section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act that gives takedown powers to the government, according to new guidelines yet to be put in force.Digital media, as defined in a document that lays out the government’s framework to regulate online content, will cover digitised content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks. It includes intermediaries such as Twitter and Facebook, and publishers of news and current affairs content. It also includes so-called curators of such content.So far, online news media has not been unregulated, with the information & broadcasting ministry brining it under its ambit last year, but not yet formalising rules for it. Nor are intermediaries, especially social media companies that take refuge in their intermediary status when it comes to owing up responsibility for content. According to the guidelines titled Information Technology (Guidelines for intermediaries and digital media ethics code) Rules, 2021, digital news media publishers will need to follow rules that apply to print and electronic media.Publishers of news and current affairs content will cover online papers, news portals, news agencies, and news aggregators, but not include the e-paper of any newspaper (print media comes under the purview of the Press Council of India, anyway, and has to follow established guidelines). It also does not cover news operations that do not qualify as a “systematic business activity” — effectively excluding blogs and non-profit publishers.Newspapers and TV news channels are governed under the Press Council of India Act, 1978, and Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, 1995, respectively. According to the proposed changes, these acts will also apply to online news and current affairs portals under the Code of Ethics. They are expected to follow the norms, with the government also planning to put in place a three-tier self-regulation system to ensure compliance with the Code.According to the document, reviewed by HT, a significant publisher of news would have to operate in the territory of India and will be classified as such as long as it has at least 500,000 subscribers or 5 million followers. HT learns that some of these provisions are still being evaluated and may change.Those qualifying under the significant publisher of news category will have to register with Broadcast Seva, a government run portal that operates under the ministry of information and technology.The three-tier framework includes self-regulation, an industry regulatory body headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court and high court with additional members from an I&B ministry approved panel, and an oversight mechanism that includes an interministerial committee with the authority to block access to content.The interministerial committee, which is proposed to form the apex of the regulation system, can act on a complaint, take suo motu cognisance of an issue, and any grievance flagged by the ministry.There are various steps that the government can take to act on non-compliance with the Code, with the most extreme step being blocking access for the public under section 69(A) that covers threat to public order.The extension of 69(A) to digital news publishers and OTT platforms in so much as it gives takedown powers to the government, is a contentious area, said experts.NS Nappinai, Supreme Court advocate and founder of Cyber Saathi, said that proposed rules have to be evaluated for sustainability under the parent Act, ie, the IT Act. “A rule can only be framed within the ambit of the parent provision,” she said. “In case 69(A) is extended to cover online news agencies then the rule will have to be analysed in context of the law enacted by Parliament, which extend at present only to Intermediaries.”“Hence when Intermediaries disseminate news such as Facebook or Twitter, they can be made subject to orders under section 69(A) of IT Act,” she said.Section 69(A) became a point of contention earlier this month when Twitter, which is an intermediary, was asked to take down accounts of journalists and news media organisation. Twitter refused to comply with the government’s orders, stating that the content was newsworthy and constituted free speech. The action had prompted the government to threaten penal provisions.“Twitter is bound to comply with a government order, but they can legally challenge the enforcement using due process,” Nappinai added.Internet Freedom Foundation trustee Apar Gupta agreed.“There is a very large question of the existence of legislative power for what these rules are intending to do and whether they are often going beyond the letter and spirit of the Information Technology Act,” Gupta said. “Regulation posed on basis of the Technology Act cannot extend to news providers and OTT platforms, as neither constitute intermediaries.”Gupta added that there has always been some form of regulation of news media, but it has either been done via a statutory provision or under the journalistic ethics enforced by Press Council of India.“For the IT Act to be used as content control mechanism, especially through exercise of powers aimed at intermediaries which do not originally publish content, seems to be an overreach of executive power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rules-for-online-media-to-include-takedown-power-101614208802005.html
25-02-2021||India||‘Patron of terror’: India hits out at Pakistan at United Nations||India on Wednesday rejected Pakistan’s criticism of the human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) at the UN Human Rights Council, saying the government in Islamabad should instead focus on credible action to end state-sponsored terrorism.New Delhi’s response to the criticism by Pakistani human rights minister Shireen Mazari in her address to the UN body in Geneva also described Pakistan as a country with “one of the world’s worst human rights records”, where “institutionalised discrimination and persecution” of minorities has continued unabated.India’s “right of reply” to the Pakistani minister’s speech was delivered by Seema Pujani, second secretary in the permanent mission to the UN. She described Pakistan’s continued misuse of various platforms for “baseless and malicious propaganda against India is not new”.Pujani pointed out Pakistan has been the “home and patron to the largest number of internationally proscribed terrorist entities and individuals”, and 126 individuals and 24 entities sanctioned by the UN Security Council are associated with the country. “State-sponsored terrorism by Pakistan is a threat not only to India but to other countries in the region and beyond. The recent acquittal of Omar Saeed Sheikh, the al-Qaeda terrorist and murderer of the American journalist Daniel Pearl, by the Pakistani Supreme Court is a clear example of the Pakistani establishment’s nexus with such entities and, as the US secretary of state said, it is ‘an affront to terrorism victims everywhere’,” Pujani said.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who addressed the UN agency before Mazari on Wednesday, had, without naming Pakistan, said terrorism remains one of the “gravest threats to humankind” and constitutes a severe challenge to the global human rights agenda.Referring to the 2019 decision to scrap the special status of J&K, Pujani said: “We reiterate that the entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India. The steps taken...to ensure good governance and development in these union territories are our internal matters.”The Indian response pointed out that Pakistan would do well to “put its own house in order, before venturing to point a finger at India”. “The violence, institutionalised discrimination and persecution faced by Pakistan’s minorities, including Christians, Sikhs and Hindus, has continued unabated. There have been frequent attacks on the places of worship of minority communities, a grave violation of their right to freedom of religion and belief,” Pujani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patron-of-terror-india-hits-out-at-pakistan-at-united-nations-101614208461533.html
25-02-2021||India||2020-21 likely to see record paddy procurement||The Centre is on course to buying a record quantity of kharif or summer-sown paddy during 2020-21, with a sharply higher share of Punjab’s crop, with procurement nationwide rising 16.5% from the quantity purchased in the previous year, data from the food ministry show.Paddy is the main summer staple that drives the incomes of millions of farmers. The ministry’s official figures show the government’s total procurement of summer paddy has touched 65.8 million tonnes until January 22 against the purchase of 56.5 million tonnes in the corresponding part of last year.About 9.5 million farmers have been paid minimum support price worth ₹1.24 lakh crore. The food ministry has projected that total procurement will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes, up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20.Punjab’s share is 20.2 million tonne, which is 30.7% of the total quantity procured.Production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonne, slightly higher than the 143.4 million tonne produced during the kharif season of 2019-20.The ministry this year expanded its procurement operations, which refers to the government’s buying of farm produce at assured prices for summer-sown crops amid a massive farmers’ protest against three agricultural laws approved last year to remove regulations in the farm sector.The government hopes to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers this year, against last year’s 10.2 million. The government has also raised by 27% the number of paddy-purchase centres, which now stand at 39,122, up from 30,709 last year, official figures show.An official statement said paddy procurement is still under way in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Karnataka, West Bengal and Tripura.The Centre has fixed an MSP for the so-called common variety of paddy at ₹1,868 per quintal and for the A grade variety at ₹1,888 per quintal for the current year. The government had initially set a total rice procurement target of 49.5 million tonnes for the entire country in the 2020-21 kharif season.“The freeing up of storage space because of higher disbursal of subsidised grains during the pandemic has enabled the government to ramp up procurement,” said analyst Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/202021-likely-to-see-record-paddy-procurement-101614207631931.html
25-02-2021||India||BJP, Congress trade barbs over Motera stadium renaming||The Bharatiya Janata Party defended the renaming of the cricket stadium at Motera as the Narendra Modi stadium but pointed out that while the stadium is now named after the PM, the larger sports complex of which it is a part continues to be named after Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India’s first home minister.At a cabinet briefing, union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at the Congress and wondered if the top Congress leaders such as Sonia or Rahul Gandhi have even bothered to visit the world’s tallest statue, that of Sardar Patel, at Kevadiya in Gujarat.While Javadekar said the two Congress leaders have not even visited the statue, Prasad said, “A tourist place getting global praise has not been visited yet or praised by the two Congress leaders. What else is there to say?”One BJP leader even flashed a list of 23 stadiums, one sports award and 17 tournaments named after members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.Earlier in the day, soon after the stadium was inaugurated by President Ram Nath Kovind, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “Beautiful how the truth reveals itself. Narendra Modi stadium Adani end. Reliance end. With Jay Shah presiding. #HumDoHumareDo.”The party spokesperson Pawan Khera alleged that Modi has insulted the two great sons of Gujarat and great international icons, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel while renaming the stadium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-trade-barbs-over-motera-stadium-renaming-101614206918283.html
25-02-2021||India||Facebook now says it’s not obligated to appear before Parliamentary panels||Can social media company Facebook choose to not appear before parliamentary and state-assembly panels if it doesn’t want to? That question saw interesting exchanges in the Supreme Court on Wednesday with the court telling the company that this seeming lack of accountability is “a very difficult proposition to accept” and the Centre, reacting to the company’s claim, nuancing its earlier position and saying the company would have to appear before Parliament or a state assembly if they have the “legislative competence” on the subject at hand.The exchange and Facebook’s contention that it could choose not to appear before any institution, as long as it follows the laws, is interesting because it comes at a time when the Union government is readying a framework to regulate social media and digital media companies.“Logically, you are a platform for debate. So, the debates will occur. But you say that you do not want to participate in a debate or a discussion or an inquiry before any committee. But you still want to carry out business in India. You are saying that I am willing to do business in India; I will provide a platform for debate but I do not want to be accountable. That is a very difficult proposition to accept,” said a bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.This came after Facebook told the court that it is not obligated to appear before any committee of Parliament or the state assemblies — a stand promptly opposed by the Central government.The social media company said it cannot be compelled by any committee of the parliament or the state assembly to participate in an inquiry and that its move to appear before a parliamentary panel on information technology last month was “a business decision”.The Centre, countering Facebook’s submission, submitted before the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, said that the tech company is bound to appear and depose if a parliamentary panel summons it.The disagreement in the top court came across during the hearing of a petition by Ajit Mohan, head of Facebook India,who challenged the summons issued to him by peace and harmony committee of the Delhi assembly, asking him to appear and answer some queries on the role of the social networking portal in the Delhi riots in February 2020.As the hearing commenced, the bench asked whether Facebook’s position was that it had a right not to appear before any committee after it has already attended the summons from the parliamentary committee of information technology in January.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Facebook, answered in the affirmative: “I have the right to not appear irrespective of the institution. I am complying with all the laws. I am not breaching any law. But I can choose not to appear before any committee.”Salve added that except for one contention that Parliament has the power to regulate the social media and intermediaries, which the Delhi government does not have, Facebook would raise the same arguments to not appear before the parliamentary panel too.He added that “compulsion on experts is abhorrent to the idea of free speech and liberty” while accusing the Delhi assembly of demonstrating “constitutional arrogance” in pressing for the appearance of the Facebook before its committee.The senior counsel then read out from a letter written by Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of the company, in September 2020, raising “serious concerns” over the “concerted effort” by the platform to “reduce the reach of people supportive of right-of-centre ideology”.He further said Aam Aadmi Party MLA and chairman of the peace and harmony committee Raghav Chadha has, on the other hand accused Facebook of supporting the right-wing groups during the February 2020 riots.“Both sides are saying we took sides. What is going on here is a political battle. Their (Delhi government’s) face off is not with Facebook but with the Union. I have a right to not go and that is how I understand my right to silence. I don’t want to be in the middle of a divide,” emphasised Salve.At this, the bench retorted: “You are a powerful platform and the argument is that you cannot be an unaccountable platform. You have no hesitation to go before the parliamentary committee. There you may face the same divide but you still went.”Salve replied: “I went because of a commercial compulsion. It is my choice to agree where to appear. I may choose not to go to any committee. And I don’t want to give my reasons too because that may create more problems.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, opposed this: “If the assembly has the competence, Facebook cannot say no. My case is Facebook’s coming to parliament cannot be a voluntary act; they are bound to come. Likewise, if a state assembly has the legislative competence on the subject it is dealing with, Facebook should go there too.”This submission by Mehta is different from his previous statement made on February 17 when he had said that Facebook is accountable only to Parliament and not to any state assembly since only the Centre has the power to frame laws on social media and intermediaries.At this juncture, the bench told Salve: “Let us assume the IT Ministry wants to call you. You say I do not want to come but the ministry has power and there is a platform on which you operate. Can you say I am hands off? It has been troubling our minds.”Senior advocate Salve reiterated that Facebook has a constitutional right and maintained that the company, while opting not to go before the peace and harmony committee, had placed its case on the jurisprudential principles that the Delhi assembly lacked the power as well as the legislative competence on the subject of law-and-order which is under the Union government in the Capital.The bench reserved its verdict on Mohan’s plea on the validity of the summons issued to him and Facebook.The Supreme Court has not indicted any date for delivering the judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-now-says-it-s-not-obligated-to-appear-before-parliamentary-panels-101614205288491.html

Muluk had got transit bail from the Bombay high court on February 16 for a period of 10 days.During the brief hearing held through video-conferencing on Wednesday, the court noted Delhi police’s submission that Muluk has been granted protection from arrest till February 26.The matter was adjourned after the public prosecutor, Irfan Ahmed, said that the investigating officer of the case was not present today and “it would be better if the matter is heard in physical presence.”Muluk, along with Ravi and another co-accused Nikita Jacob, was booked for alleged sedition and other charges. Ravi was arrested by a cyber cell team of Delhi Police from Bengaluru and brought to Delhi. Muluk and Jacob are currently on transit bail, with Ravi being granted bail on Tuesday after 10 days in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-shantanu-muluk-s-bail-plea-hearing-today-101614193499277.html

TMC youth leader Vinay Mishra has been named,” said a CBI official.Earlier this month, CBI in the first charge-sheet in the case had named BSF Commandant Satish Kumar and Murshidabad-based businessman Enamul Haque along with five others for their alleged involvement in cattle smuggling across the India-Bangladesh border.Both Kumar and Haque have been arrested and are now in custody. CBI took over the case in September 2020.In two parallel investigations, the CBI is also probing a multi-crore coal smuggling scam. The central agency has already questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee.“Such is their audacity that they are branding mothers and daughters as coal smugglers? They are entering our house and accusing a housewife aged only 22-23 years of being a coal smuggler,” Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hit out on Wednesday.The Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal is the longest international border in any state across the country. Out of the 4096.7 km long Indo-Bangla border, West Bengal alone shares 2216 km with the neighbouring country. In south Bengal, the border is more than 900 km long out which nearly 60% is riverine.The Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly in West Bengal, is also one of the most porous borders. Data placed by the Union ministry of home affairs before the Parliament in March 2020 shows that in 2017, 2018 and 2019 security agencies arrested 1175, 1118 and 1351 people along the entire stretch of the Indo-Bangla border in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-names-tmc-youth-leader-in-charge-sheet-of-cattle-smuggling-case-101614191433898.html

25-02-2021||NA||Highlights: False narrative that farmers will lose land: Union minister||The farmers' protest against the Centre's three new farm laws is continuing at Delhi's border as the deadlock between the protesting farmer unions and the government continues over the repeal of the laws.Rakesh Tikait, leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said on Tuesday that the protesting farmers would gherao Parliament, if the Central government does not repeal the three laws, during his address to a Kisan Panchayat in Sikar, Rajasthan. Earlier on Tuesday, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav, too, addressed a similar panchayat in Sikar.Meanwhile, the political battles in poll-bound states have been centred largely around the farm laws and the farmers' protests. Union minister Prahlad Joshi of the BJP attacked Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday saying that Gandhi is an "actor on tractor." The remarks came a day after Gandhi held a tractor rally in his constituency in Kerala supporting the protesting farmers. Gandhi too had been attacking the Centre in his political rallies, saying that the government wants to take away the agriculture business from farmers and "and give the entire business to two or three friends of PM Modi".In other developments around the issue, climate activist Disha Ravi had been released from the Tihar jail on Tuesday after a Delhi court granted bail to her on grounds of "scanty and sketchy" evidence. She was earlier arrested in connection with the 'toolkit' case. Also, Lakha Sidhana, one of the accused in the tractor rally clashes during the republic day, addressed a farmers' rally in Mehraj, Bathinda, calling for the protests to be intensified.Follow all the updates here:False narrative that farmers will lose land, won't get MSP: Union minister BalyanBJP leader and Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan on Wednesday said the the protest against Centre's three new farm laws has become "emotional" and acknowledged that his party and the government might not have been able to explain the benefits of the laws to farmers.

25-02-2021||Today's||Myanmar-China ties: It’s complicated||Earlier this month, the world was shocked when Myanmar’s military junta led by the military’s commander-in-chief, Min Aung Hlaing, overthrew the democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi and took the country back to the days of military dictatorship. The surprise move led many to speculate on the timing of the coup and the declaration of a year-long state of emergency. Clearly, the recent elections played a role — Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD), advocating a platform of constitutional reform that would rein in the role of the military, had just won the elections with a resounding 83% of seats in parliament while the junta-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party won a mere 7% of seats. But some also pointed to China’s hand. They suggested that ousting the NLD and assisting the authoritarian junta back to power would prevent any shift of Myanmar towards, and eventual democratic alignment with, the United States (US). Seemingly doing its bit to bolster this argument, Xinhua referred to the coup as “a major cabinet reshuffle,” and not a hint of criticism or condemnation came from the Chinese government. Yet, this assessment of the coup being a benefit for China is too simplistic.In fact, China’s relationship with Myanmar is complicated. It has waxed and waned since the 1940s — Burma, as it was called then, achieved independence from British rule in 1948, and the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949. Although the two established diplomatic relations in 1950, the 1960s saw turmoil in bilateral relations. The coup in 1962 by General Ne Win was the beginning of military rule. Although China became one of the earliest countries to recognise the junta government (right after India), it had a long record of financial support to the anti-government and armed Burma Communist Party, which incensed the junta. In addition, China’s attempts to influence its diaspora in Burma through cross-border migration, and, particularly, by exporting its Cultural Revolution, led to the rise of anti-China sentiment. In 1967, widespread anti-Chinese riots in Burma brought the relationship to its nadir. The resentment and brutality that ensued against the Chinese diaspora were compounded by the junta’s treatment of the riots. At first lackadaisical in their response, then complicit, and then, finally, switching to a crackdown, the junta used the riots to consolidate their authority, and distract citizens from problems like food shortages. Although the Sino-Burmese relationship eventually normalised, the riots embodied a fundamental weakness in the ties — China’s foreign policy interests in Myanmar are layered with provincial interests and cross-border issues.For China, there have always been certain issues that are core to its relationship with Myanmar. The latter is strategically important to gain access to the Indian Ocean as well as to Southeast Asia. It is economically important because of its natural resources such as timber, the hydroelectric possibilities stemming from its many large rivers, as well as oil and gas and minerals. Finally, China is committed to large-scale infrastructure projects in the country.However, these interests need to be framed in the context of provincial interests and cross-border relations. A Chinese province such as Yunnan and its role in the bilateral relationship provides an example of the complexity. Yunnan and Myanmar share a border, and the provincial government has direct interactions with Myanmar’s government. Thus, oil and gas pipelines connect Myanmar’s Rakhine state and Yunnan capital Kunming, and cross-border trade is crucial for both. Yunnan is also home to many of China’s ethnic minorities who share cultural affinities with ethnic groups in Myanmar. But some of these ethnic groups are both anti-junta and armed, and have engaged in border clashes that have spilled across the Chinese border, threatening the delicate power structure in Yunnan. These rebel ethnic groups have also reportedly received Beijing’s backing from time-to-time, angering the generals. And the clashes have led to thousands of refugees sheltering in Yunnan — which has been neither to Naypyidaw nor to Beijing’s liking. Meanwhile, the flow of illegal Chinese migrants across the border means the Chinese government has the constant headache of juggling the economic benefits their presence could generate with their potential to create more anti-Chinese sentiment in Myanmar where nationalistic feelings run high.These complications mean that China’s more recent closeness with Myanmar was initiated not by the junta but by the NLD government. Aung San Suu Kyi made overtures towards Beijing after she faced international condemnation for not denouncing the Burmese military’s ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya minority — she not only agreed to the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor to be developed under the Belt and Road Initiative, but also to a railroad project that had been shelved by the military regime. Unsurprisingly, President Xi Jinping enthusiastically embraced these overtures, welcoming her to China for several visits. In short, while China needs to work with Myanmar, the generals make for uneasy bedfellows in a relationship that has had a long-and-turbulent history.Manjari Chatterjee Miller is associate professor, Pardee School, Boston University, director, BU Rising Powers Initiative, and a research associate, University of Oxford The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/myanmarchina-ties-it-s-complicated-101614263033569.html
