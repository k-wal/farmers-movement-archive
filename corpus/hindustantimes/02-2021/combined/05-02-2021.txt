However, some of the shocking cases described in medical journals , those reported in the media, online consumer complaints and the cases filed before the consumer courts seeking compensation for the injuries caused by defective pressure cookers, all point to the very serious threat posed by poor quality pressure cookers and thereby, the need for mandatory certification. Besides severe burn injuries, sub-standard cookers have caused fractures, blindness and even death.The Indian Journal of Neurotrauma (2018), for example, reports on the severe trauma and loss of vision in the right eye suffered by a 30-year old man when the metallic head of the pressure regulator, propelled by the steam from a malfunctioning pressure cooker, hit him so hard that it got lodged inside his eye socket. The penetrating orbital injury required a complicated surgery to remove the metallic part and also the bone fragments.A 57-year old woman in Khunti district, Jharkhand, suffered a similar life-threatening injury when the cooker’s pressure regulating device got lodged deep inside her face. She had kept the pressure cooker on the stove and got busy with some other work for almost an hour. When she did remember and tried to remove it from the gas stove, the steam ejected the metal part like a bullet from a gun Doctors extricated it after a lengthy surgery and saved her life, but could not restore her vision.In January 2018, two girl students of a private nursing college got hurt when a pressure cooker suddenly burst at their hostel mess in the outskirts of Shimla. In Feburary, a female mid-day meal worker suffered burn injuries on her arm and face after a pressure cooker exploded in the kitchen of a government senior secondary school in Chandigarh. In another case reported in 2015, the cooker lid opened before the complete release of the pressure (instead of remaining locked), spewing boiling food on the face of the user.Another lesser known danger from poor quality pressure cookers is the leaching of toxic heavy metals into the food, thereby necessitating quality control in respect of the choice of materials used not only for the container and the lid, but also the various parts including the pressure regulating device, safety valve and the gasket. . Besides manufacturing defects and spurious spare parts, consumers’ failure to follow usage instructions have also led to serious accidents. It’s for this reason that the Indian Standard (IS) 2347 not only specifies the quality of the pressure cooker, but also lays considerable emphasis on the manufacturer providing fully illustrated usage instructions and warnings. Each cooker should indelibly and legibly indicate the necessity of reading instructions before use, the standard says.However, since many consumers who use the pressure cooker may not be literate enough to read the instructions or even comprehend the illustrations, manufacturers should also be asked to take up consumer education on safe usage through television advertising. Retailers should also take the responsibility of instructing consumers about the proper use of the cooker at the time of purchase.. They must also warn consumers about spurious spare parts. Today the pressure cooker market has undergone a sea change. Unlike the cookers of yesteryear, they are now available in a variety of designs, materials , shapes and colours . The size of the market can be gauged from the fact that the Bureau of Indian Standards now has a list of 340 licensees and there could well be many more who are yet to get the license for use of the mandatory ISI mark ! What is now required is strict enforcement , so that every pressure cooker marketed in the country is absolutely safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pressure-cookers-are-safer-now-thanks-to-mandatory-isi-certification-101612549649104.html

05-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt forms GoM under Sisodia to draw up new excise policy; Jain, Gehlot are members||The Delhi cabinet on Friday appointed a group of ministers (GoM) to finalise a new excise policy for the national capital.The GoM, under deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, will deliberate on a report submitted to the government by a committee of experts that was set up by Sisodia last year to augment the excise revenue of the city-state.HT had earlier reported on these recommendations, the primary ones being that restaurants, clubs and pubs be allowed to stay open until 3 am daily, instead of 1am; that these outlets be allowed to serve full bottles at the table; and that they be given permission to serve liquor in open areas such as rooftops and balconies.The committee has also said anyone over the age of 21 years should be able to get a drink at the bar or hotel. In Delhi, at least on paper, the minimum age to be served liquor at an establishment is 25.The same committee had also recommended that the number of dry days in the capital be reduced from 21, on average, to just three a year, and norms be relaxed for department stores to avail of licences for selling wine and beer.Other than Sisodia, who also holds the finance and excise portfolios in Delhi, the GoM will have as members health minister Satyendar Jain and revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, the Delhi government said.“The new excise policy of the Delhi government will ensure transparency, ease of doing business for taxpayers and business sector too, and ensure steady growth of government revenues… The group of ministers will examine all aspects of the current system -- of excise duty administration; the report submitted by the expert committee and its suggestions; and feedback and comments received from stakeholders and general public -- before making a final policy decision in the coming weeks,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-forms-gom-under-sisodia-to-draw-up-new-excise-policy-jain-gehlot-are-members-101612549349668.html
05-02-2021||Other||Delhi govt reduces circle rates by 20% for next six months||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Friday reduced circle rates, the minimum price at which a property can be bought, for all categories of properties for the next six months, a move that experts said will boost the real estate market and boost revenue for the government. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Friday. It was decided to reduce the circle rates by 20% for residential, commercial and industrial properties across all categories of localities.“… This decision is expected to make it substantially cheaper for people to do property transactions, revive the real estate sector which has been hit severely by the coronavirus pandemic and create new jobs,” the chief minister’s office said in a statement.The statement further read, “A reduction of 20% in the circle rate would have an impact close to reduction by 1% in the stamp duty or registration charges… The economy by and large at the national level, in general, and the real estate sector, in particular, have witnessed huge slump due to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. Lakhs of construction workers have lost their jobs. While the Kejriwal government has already provided direct monetary relief of ₹10,000 for construction workers of Delhi, there was a need to revive the real estate sector and get the lost jobs back. Today’s decision of the Delhi cabinet will help begin the long-term recovery in the real estate sector.”Circle rate is the minimum designated price per square metre or square feet for land or property fixed for a certain category of locality, at which transactions have to be registered. It varies with each state and is revised from time to time depending on demand, supply and other development indicators pertaining to the concerned area.Delhi broadly has eight categories of localities – from A to H. Category A being the most affluent ones and H being the most economically weaker ones. The circle rates are proportionate. For instance, in an A category locality, circle rate for a residential property so far was ₹7,74,000 per square metre and for one in an H category locality was ₹23,280.Neighbourhoods such as Golf Links, Vasant Vihar and Jor Bagh come under A category, those like Greater Kailash, Defence Colony and Safdarjung Enclave come under B and those in Tagore Garden and Subhash Nagar come under C. Categories D and E mostly have localities that were notified as regularised in the past, some old areas where low-income and mid-income flats were developed and resettlement colonies. Categories F, G and H comprise mostly of unauthorised colonies in which residents have recently availed the opportunity – through a central government scheme – to get their properties registered.For registration, there is a stamp fee on the transaction value – which is 6% for men and 4% for women – to be paid by the buyers. “In property transactions, people tend to keep the transaction value less on paper and essentially pay the registry fee on more or less the circle rate, which is the base rate for property transactions in a concerned area,” said a senior official in the government’s revenue department who did not wish to be identified.In 2018-19, the Delhi government earned around ₹4,459 crore through property registries. For 2019-20, the revised estimate was ₹4,897 crore and for 2020-21, the budget estimate was ₹5,297 crore, showed budget documents of the government.However, a senior official in the finance department said that between April 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020, the Delhi government earned ₹1,860.57 crore, against ₹3,258.47 crore for the corresponding period in the previous financial year.Mudassir Zaidi, executive director of real estate consultant group Knight Frank, said: “The real estate sector in Delhi was already witnessing a slump for several years now. The demonetisation in November 2016 came as a major blow. And then Covid-19 happened. The market is now showing slow signs of recovery. This decision by the Delhi government would significantly contribute to the market’s revival by boosting the volume of transactions, especially in the most affluent colonies in Delhi where market rates of properties had dropped below circle rates. The government’s decision is capable of rectifying such anomalies in the system.”Ritesh Mehta, senior director and head (west India) residential services at JLL India, said: “It is a positive move and will encourage the fence sitters to take the plunge. The cost of a house may not be directly impacted by the move as the cost is a function of many other factors like demand and supply but will give a positive push to the real estate market. In the residential segment, it will impact more in Category A which is categorised as posh and high-end, where typically the market rates are lower than the circle rate. It will boost luxury transactions as the monetary impact would be high.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-reduces-circle-rates-by-20-for-next-six-months-101612549350321.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Light rain chases away pollution, AQI moderate in Delhi||A day after the light rain on Thursday, when the minimum temperature in the city had climbed to 12.4 degrees Celsius, the mercury dropped once again on Friday to a minimum of 6.8 degrees Celsius -- two degrees below the season’s normal. India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said the drop was primarily due to the cold, dry winds blowing in from the snow-clad western Himalayas. The city had recorded 2.1mm rainfall on Thursday under the influence of a western disturbance, which also led to widespread snowfall in the hilly regions.The Safdarjung observatory, which provides the representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6.8 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, on Friday as against 12.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The maximum temperature was 23 degrees Celsius.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said with the passing of the western disturbance, the wind direction over Delhi has changed to north-westerly.“Cold, dry winds from the mountains have started blowing over the plains, resulting in a dip in the minimum temperature,” an IMD official said, wishing not to be named.He said the temperature is likely to fall further over the weekend and settle at around 5-6 degrees Celsius. However, by February 8, the temperature will rise again.“There is another western disturbance that is likely to impact the Himalayas. Its impact on the plains will be a slight rise in the minimum and maximum temperature,” Srivastava said. Meanwhile, the light rain on Thursday, coupled with strong winds, improved the city’s air quality significantly. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi on Friday was 133, in the ”moderate” zone. On Thursday, the average AQI was 316, in the ”very poor” category.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said isolated rain observed under the influence of a western disturbance and high winds contributed to the improvement in AQI.“Surface winds are low in the morning but forecasted to improve during daytime. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and remain in the “moderate” or “poor” category Saturday. “Poor” to “very poor” AQI is forecasted for February 7 and February 8,” Safar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/light-rain-chases-away-pollution-aqi-moderate-indelhi-101612549349051.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Anarchy cannot be tolerated in civilised society, says HC on sanitation workers’ strike||The Delhi high court on Friday came down heavily on sanitation worker unions that were on a strike, and said their “anarchy” of obstructing the regular work of cleaning and dumping garbage on streets cannot be allowed to prevail in a civilised society. The strike by sanitation workers of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), which began on January 15 demanding the payments of salaries pending since December 2020, was called off on Thursday, after the EDMC cleared all dues.EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain confirmed the development and said the civic body has been in talks with the sanitation workers’ union for the past one week. “I’m yet to go through the detailed court order, but sanitation workers are like a family and no action would be taken against them. All issues will be resolved through dialogue,” he said.A bench of justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Rekha Palli said the strike by sanitation workers is “being fuelled and driven by political consideration”. “Political leaders do not understand that they should have a commonality in their thinking. That has been breached and we are not naming any one party. This is very dangerous and has to be stopped. We will direct the police commissioner to take action,” the court said.The bench was hearing a plea by EDMC, seeking action against “miscreants” who were “illegally waylaying garbage removal trucks, threatening drivers and dumping garbage openly on the roads and streets”.The court, in terms of a direction issued in 2015 in a similar matter, directed the Delhi Police commissioner to constitute specific task forces in each ward in east Delhi, which will be headed by a police officer not below the rank of a sub-Inspector to oversee the removal of garbage by the agencies employed by the EDMC,It also cautioned the sanitation worker unions against taking law into their hands and directed the commissioner of the civic body to take disciplinary action against erring workers.EDMC, through its standing counsel Manu Chaturvedi, told the court that unions were protesting despite their salaries being cleared till December 2020. He said salaries for January 2021 are also being processed.Two unions—MCD Swacchta Karamchaari Union and All Municipal Corporations Staff Union—represented by advocate Jivesh Kumar Tiwari, told the court that all nine unions are ending their strike and want their grievances to be heard.“We have withdrawn our strike and our nine unions are getting back to work tomorrow (Saturday). Our petition has been allowed just five minutes ago when this matter is being heard and we are ready to sort out our differences,” Tiwari said.The court replied, “We are happy to hear this…However, we are observing that if the MCD employees have any grievance and resort to a legal strike, that does not entitle them to take law into their own hands and create anarchy”.“Everyone should realise that in a civilised society, such anarchy cannot prevail and it is essential to maintain rule of law and public order, so that all authorities including police can take measures to deal with the menace created by miscreants,” it added.The court will further hear the matter on March 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/anarchy-cannot-be-tolerated-in-civilised-society-says-hc-on-sanitation-workers-strike-101612549289645.html

Students of classes 10 and 12 were able to strictly follow Covid-19 instructions given to them due to which we are confident of re-opening classes 9 and 11 as well,” Sisodia, who is also the state’s deputy chief minister, said. Delhi’s schools reopened for classes 10 and 12 students on January 18 and recorded less than 50% attendance during the initial days.Although the government schools reopened on Friday for classes 9 and 11, the private institutions said they were still waiting for parental consent for students to return and may reopen by next week The Delhi government announced last week that the reopening of schools for classes 9 and 11 students so that students could have access to practical lessons and have assistance for internal assessments. Mary Jyotsna Minj, head of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, New Kondli, said her school saw around 66% attendance in both class 9 and 11. She also said that reopening classes 10 and 12 instilled confidence among parents and students leading to higher attendance. “We did not expect so many students to attend the classes on the first day. But I think students want to prepare for their periodicals which will begin from February 12. So, they wanted to come and clear their doubts before that. We will be calling students as per their sections from Monday,” she said. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of school at Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, said around 55% Class 9 students came to school on Friday and the attendance shot up to 60% for Class 11 students. “These figures are not bad as even during normal times we had around 85-90% attendance. So, if we keep the Covid-19 factor in mind, the numbers don’t show a huge drop. However, attendance has been thin in class 12 as many students are opting for self-study and the numbers haven’t been able to go beyond 40% there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cant-wait-for-zero-covid-case-day-says-sisodia-as-classes-9-11-reopen-101612549289051.html
05-02-2021||Other||Delhi not to be impacted by ‘chakka jam’, say farmer leaders||New Delhi: The three-hour ’chakka jam’ on Saturday afternoon to protest against the three farm laws will not impact Delhi and the national capital region (NCR), Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers unions which is spearheading the agitation, said on Friday. Farm leader Rakesh Tikait also said on Friday that there will be no blockade in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“Only national and state highways across the country will be jammed from 12 noon to 3 pm. Emergency and essential services like ambulance, school bus, etc. will not be stopped... All roads for entering into Delhi will remain open except where farmers’ protest sites are already located,” said a statement issued by Darshan Pal, a leader of SKM.The chakka jam will be a part of a series of events scheduled by the farmers’ groups to press their demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws passed by the Parliament in September to deregulate agricultural trade. On January 7, the farmers protesting at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and others took out a tractor march on the eastern and western peripheral expressways which form a ring around the national capital. On January 26, the protesters took out a tractor parade and barged into the city deviating from the routes approved by the police by breaking barriers and clashed with the cops at several points. Hundreds of farmers also reached Red Fort and vandalised the monument. Even though the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has assured that the event will remain peaceful, police have made extensive arrangements to meet any eventuality. Tikait said farmers in UP and Uttarakhand will only submit memorandums to the administration. He said they will be on “standby” in case they are needed to rush to Delhi’s borders at a short notice. “They (farmers in UP and Uttarakhand) can be called to Delhi (borders) anytime and they need to be on standby,” Tikait told a news channel.Tikait’s associate, Arjun Balyan Tikait, said the decision to keep UP and Uttarakhand was also taken in view of the sugarcane cultivation season.The statement issued by the SKM did not mention Tikait’s claim. While Darshan Pal remained unavailable for queries, one of his team members said that there was no conflict.“The farmers in some parts will not be involved in chakka jam because they are busy harvesting sugarcane. In some states, on the other hand, the chakka jam will be much more intense as farmers there will block internal roads as well,” said SKM media coordinator, Harinder, who goes by a single name.The chakka jam will take place between 12noon and 3pm and it will be “completely peaceful and non-violent”, SKM said. “Protesters are asked to not to indulge in any confrontation with the government officials or ordinary citizens,” said SKM leader Darshan Pal.The event will conclude with farmers honking from their vehicles continuously and simultaneously for one minute when the clock strikes 3pm.PREPARATIONS ON AT DELHI’S BORDERSWhile no specific activity has been planned for Delhi the three border points where farmers are protesting, the police as well as farmers were busy preparing for the event on Friday.At the Singhu Border, the police on Friday added yet another layer of barbed barricading, several hundred metres away from the main stage. At Tikri border too, the police set up an extra layer of barriers using concrete barricades and iron nails. They also installed layers of nets in anticipation of stone pelting by the protesters.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said in the backdrop of the Republic Day violence adequate security arrangements have been made at all border points. The police are also monitoring social media to curb rumours and coordinating with their counterparts in neighbouring states, Biswal said.Farm leaders urged their supporters in Delhi not to disrupt normal life in the city had a word of advice for office-goers in the NCR. “While we won’t be causing any trouble to commuters, and our chakka jam in NCR towns will be limited to the highways on the city periphery, we urge the public to reach their workplaces before noon and leave after the even ends at 3pm,” said Gurmeet Singh Bhattiwal, vice president of Bharatiya Kisan Union Ekta (Dakonda).“To avoid hassle, they should take internal routes because our focus will be on highways only,” Bhattiwal added.The protesters have also chosen some volunteers to explain the drawbacks of the three farm laws to those who will be stuck on the highways. “If someone gets stuck on the road, our farmers will offer them snacks and lunch and explain to them the problems with the farm laws,” said Mukesh Chander, senior vice-president of Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee.Farmer volunteers have also been instructed to ensure no disturbance to the shared and private vehicles plying along the protest routes. “They threw open their personal bathrooms to us and provided us water at a time when we needed it the most in the early days of our protest. The locals have sacrificed a lot for us and we will do all we can to reduce their troubles,” said Amandeep Singh, a farmer from Amritsar who is a volunteer at Singhu Border.Farmers appealed to their families and friends in the villages to ensure the success of ‘chakka jam’.“Our brothers and sisters in Punjab, Haryana and other states will be blocking roads leading to Delhi with tractors. We have requested for maximum participation,” said Sahil Kamboj from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha at Tikri Border.Rajinder Pal, from Baghpat, who joined the protest at Ghazipur after Republic Day, said it was time for the government to accept the demands of farmers. “We are only here to place one demand which is the withdrawal of the farm laws. We will make sure that none of our men get into any confrontation that may lead to violence during chakka jam. It will be a peaceful demonstration,” Pal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-not-to-be-impacted-by-chakka-jam-say-farmer-leaders-101612549229019.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Full-scale police deployment at borders ahead of chakka jam, all protest sites under heavy barricading||The farmer protest sites at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders have been hemmed in with multilayered barricading and are being heavily patrolled ahead of Saturday’s three-hour long nationwide highway blockade, “the chakka jam”, called by farmers to intensify their protest against the new farm laws.The Delhi Police on Friday reiterated that no permission has been granted to protesters for holding the chakka jam or any other demonstration in the city and legal action will be taken against those found disrupting the city’s traffic and law and order. The protest sites are under multilayered barricading with barbed wiring on top, concrete walls, trenches, nails boards drilled onto roads and netting to stop pelted stones, besides a heavy contingent of security personnel armed with anti-riot gear. These measures, the police said, were to keep the farmers from entering the national capital on Saturday. The police have also started monitoring content on social media to keep a watch on those spreading rumours or instigating people against the government and the police, senior officers said. Even though the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farm unions that are part of the ongoing agitation against the three contentious agriculture laws, has announced that “there will be no chakka jam inside Delhi”, police said they have tightened the security arrangements, especially on all borders connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, keeping in view the January 26 violence during the farmers’ tractor rally.Officers said checking of vehicles at the city border points has been intensified since Friday evening to ensure that protesters or antisocial elements were not entering the city for Saturday’s traffic blockade. Apart from thousands of Delhi Police personnel, nearly 15,000 personnel from the paramilitary forces of Rapid Action Force (RAF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) – all armed with anti-riot equipment – will be on duty to maintain Delhi’s law and order during the chakka jam, officers in the know of Saturday’s security arrangements said. “A full-scale police deployment will be in place at all borders and on streets across the city on Saturday. Traffic police personnel will also be deployed in full strength to regulate traffic. While our prime focus will be on maintaining traffic as well as law and order, those attempting to disturb these will be dealt with strongly as per law. We are in touch with the police force of other states as well,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.On Friday morning, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava held a meeting with senior police officers and reviewed security arrangements. Shrivastava, on Thursday, had attended a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah at the Parliament complex to review the security situation in Delhi-NCR ahead of the chakka jam. National security advisor Ajit Doval was also present at that meeting.Farmer unions on Monday had announced a countrywide “peaceful and non-violent” chakka jam on February 6 when they would block national and state highways for three hours (between noon and 3pm) in protest against the internet ban in areas near their agitation sites; harassment allegedly meted out to them by authorities; and other issues. They have declared that all emergency and essential services such as ambulances and school buses will not be stopped.Elaborating on the security arrangements, a senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said police personnel who will be on duty Saturday have been asked to report to their area of deployment by 7am. Every police station has been asked to keep ready for action at least one sub-inspector and four to five constables along with buses in which arrested or detained persons can be moved away.Police said they have intelligence inputs that protesters may deflate tyres of vehicles to cause jams on roads, all the police stations have been asked to keep air pumps with them for filling up deflated tyres. “Cranes have also been arranged to remove such vehicles and clear the traffic. Videographers and photographers will also be present for capturing the activities of protesters. We will also be using drones for aerial surveillance,” said the officer. According to the intelligence inputs, workers of various political parties and student organisations have planned a foot march from Shaheed Park near Delhi Gate to ITO during the chakka jam. “Anticipating that protesters may incite a confrontation with security personnel, we have asked our staff to remain calm and not get provoked in any manner,” a second police officer said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fullscale-police-deployment-at-borders-ahead-of-chakka-jam-all-protest-sites-under-heavy-barricading-101612549169028.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Govt floats tender to select agency for setting up 100 e-charging points||A day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a campaign to promote electric vehicles (EV) in the capital city, the Delhi government on Friday floated a tender to hire an agency for setting up 500 e-vehicle charging points across 100 locations within a year, informed power minister Satyendar Jain.Jain said the charging stations will be for both two-wheelers and four-wheelers, both private and commercial. Most of the chosen sites are located outside Metro stations and at bus depots in the city, he said.Jain further said, “This is the largest tender for public charging in India… We are working relentlessly towards the vision of making Delhi the EV capital of India. For the charging station project, the full power infrastructure cost will be borne by the Delhi government. Some of these charging stations will also double up as battery swapping stations. At least 20% of them will have the slower variety of chargers and 10% will have the faster variety in order to cater to all kinds of e-vehicles,” said Jain at a press conference on Friday.In a press statement, the Dialogue and Development Commission, a think tank of the Delhi government, said, “The ‘Switch Delhi’ campaign launched by CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday is a mass awareness campaign to sensitise each and every Delhi resident about the benefits of switching to e-vehicles. Under the policy, the government has offered multiple financial and non-financial incentives to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the capital.

05-02-2021||Mumbai||13 private hospitals in Mumbai shortlisted for Covid-19 vaccination: BMC||After getting applications from around 100 private hospitals to participate in the vaccination drive, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has shortlisted 13 private hospitals, which will be allowed to undertake vaccinations. The names of the 13 hospitals are yet to be released. On Friday, two more vaccination centres were added in Mumbai, at MW Desai Municipal Hospital in Malad and Shri Harilal Bhagwati Municpial Hospital in Borivli. The city now has 20 vaccination centres. With the third phase of Covid-19 vaccinations expected to begin in March or April, BMC has maintained that it would need the help of private hospitals. In the third phase, members of the general public who are above 50 years old or have comorbidities will be inoculated. On Friday, it was announced that 13 private hospitals have been shortlisted to participate in the vaccination drive and details of these selected facilities will be announced soon. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We have shortlisted 13 private hospitals for now in the city which will be allowed to undertake vaccination when the third phase for the general public starts. However, we are scrutinising applications of more private hospital, and this number will increase in the coming days.” Kakani added, “Currently, for the first and second phases, we are managing with civic-run hospitals for vaccination, but in the third phase when the general public is vaccinated, we will require help from private hospitals.” When asked how many citizens would be vaccinated per day once private hospitals are roped in, Kakani said the target would be decided once there was clarity on how much of the vaccine would be supplied to BMC in the third phase. Earlier, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had said around 1 lakh citizens daily would be vaccinated once private hospitals were involved in the vaccination drive. In its budget, presented on Wednesday, BMC said it planned to vaccinate a total of 1 crore Mumbaiites. As of Friday, BMC has vaccinated 69,590 beneficiaries, including healthcare (HCWs) and frontline workers. On Friday, 5,883 HCWs and 753 frontline workers received their shots. On the subject of the cost of the vaccines, Chahal said on Wednesday, “The Central government has kept in reserve ₹31,000 crore for Covid-19 vaccination, and I think this answers our question of from where we will get money for Covid-19 vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/13-private-hospitals-in-mumbai-shortlisted-for-covid-19-vaccination-bmc-101612548749654.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai far behind rural Maharashtra in its Covid-19 vaccination turnout||Rural districts in Maharashtra are recording a better turnout for inoculation than Mumbai, despite having better accessibility, shows data shared by the state health ministry. Officials said most vaccination centres in Mumbai have completed vaccinating their staff members in the first phase, the response of healthcare workers (HCWs) from other hospitals is poor.In the last four immunisation sessions, the overall turnout of beneficiaries in Mumbai has gradually dipped. On February 1, Mumbai recorded 93.4% turnout, which plunged to 80% the next day. On February 3, the turnout dropped further to 76% and on February 4, it went down to 54%.Data shows that more number of shortlisted beneficiaries are getting inoculated in rural districts than Mumbai. On Thursday, for instance, rural districts like Yavatmal (72%), Jalna (71%), Wardha (71%), Sindhudurg (58%), among others recorded a higher turnout than Mumbai. As per data of the state health department, Mumbai city (south Mumbai) ranked 32 among the 36 districts with the lowest turnout (40%) on Thursday.Officials have cited several reasons behind it. When the mass immunisation programme started on January 16, the primary focus was to vaccinate HCWs associated with the immunisation centres. After 20 sessions since then, most staffers have already been inoculated.“We have inoculated 90% of our staffers including senior doctors, resident doctors, nurses, ward boys, among others who came forward for vaccination. So, the flow of beneficiaries has decreased recently,” said a senior doctor from BYL Nair Hospital.Currently, most vaccination centres have started shortlisting HCWs from other hospitals. But many aren’t showing up for two reasons- centres are far from their hospitals and delay in intimation.“Some HCWs have planned surgeries or other commitments, so they often fail to reach the centre on the given day as it is a time-consuming affair,” said the officer.To address the issue, private hospitals have already approached the civic body seeking permission to start an immunisation programme in their hospital premises. “It will be more accessible for staffers to get vaccinated at the hospitals which will ultimately increase the overall turnout of the city,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital.From Thursday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) simultaneously started vaccinating frontline workers (FLWs) along with HCWs at 18 vaccination centres in the city. But due to the technical glitch in the centralised app - CoWIN, the FLWs were informed late about their scheduled appointment. As a result of this, only 58 people out of the 1,800 targeted came forward for vaccination on the first day.“Till Tuesday night, the application was functioning properly but later again, it started having technical errors, due to which the turnout of FLWs was less on Thursday. However, we have directed all staff to alert the beneficiaries manually, until the app is functioning properly,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.From February 8, the civic body is likely to start vaccinating police personnel in the list of FLWs. Also, walk-in for FLWs will be allowed soon under which any registered FLW on the CoWIN can directly get inoculated even if they don’t have an appointment for that day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-far-behind-rural-maharashtra-in-its-covid-19-vaccination-turnout-101612548630029.html

She was carrying a bag which contained the body of her one-year-old son, said police.According to the police, the woman boarded the train towards Vashi with the bag, at Chembur station after 10pm. As the train crossed the bridge before reaching Vashi station, she jumped out with the bag.“The fellow commuters raised an alarm and also informed the railway officers after the train reached Vashi station. The officers then rushed to the spot and found her lying near the creek. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, but she was declared dead on arrival, by the doctors there,” said a government railway police (GRP) officer.The woman was a homemaker, and her husband works with a construction firm. Her parents reside in Pune, said police. “The couple had tied the knot in 2013 and the son was born a year ago. Prima facie it appears that she killed the boy by slitting its throat before boarding the train. We will question her husband and parents,” the officer said.The Vashi GRP has registered a case under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the deceased woman.

05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Coming up, housing society for Chandigarh MC’s councillors, employees||The municipal corporation will be allotting its land for development of a housing society for its incumbent councillors, officials and employees.Under the proposed self-financing scheme, which got the go-ahead in the MC General House special meeting on Friday, the allottees will bear the cost of land and construction.Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said a detailed agenda item will be presented in the MC General House meeting, following which UT administration’s approval will be taken to use MC land for the scheme.Raising the issue of housing for councillors and MC officials, BJP councillor Shakti Devshali sought that a token amount for a housing scheme be added to the budget estimates for 2021-2022.“The housing scheme will be on the lines of the self-financing schemes in Punjab and Haryana for their MLAs. As Chandigarh does not have a legislative assembly, the scheme will be for councillors and MC employees,” said Sharma, adding that the flats for the economical weaker sections (EWS) will also be part of the scheme to cover all MC employees.A society, comprising councillors, officials and employees, will be formed to pitch in funds for the project for which land will be allotted on the prevailing collector rates.Costing of the project has yet to be worked out. “Only after land is finalised and the number of flats that can be developed on the site is decided, the project’s cost can be calculated,” said Sharma.Even though the Congress councillors didn’t oppose the move during the Friday’s meeting, party’s councillor and leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla, who was absent in the meeting, said, “The Congress will oppose any such move by the BJP. MC land should be used only for people’s welfare and not for councillors’ benefit.”Smart school for underprivileged kidsMC is planning to set up a smart school for the city’s underprivileged children. Estimated to cost ₹50 crore, the school will be on the lines of a similar facility in Pune. Apart from smart facilities, the budget will cover uniforms, books and stationery for the students. “Detailed project plans and land for the project will be finalised shortly,” said mayor Ravi Kant Sharma.Banquet hall in Industrial AreaAlso part of MC’s plans is a banquet hall on the plot in Industrial Area, Phase 1, where it currently runs a cattle pound. “The work on the cowshed in Raipur Kalan will be completed in the next five months. The Industrial Area cattle pound will be shifted there and a modern banquet hall will come up in its place. Besides benefitting area residents, it will help MC generate additional revenue,” said Sharma.Agendas for these projects will be presented in the next General House meeting, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/coming-up-housing-society-for-chandigarh-mc-s-councillors-employees-101612548209008.html

05-02-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka legislative council session extended, polls for chairman on Tuesday||The ongoing session of the Karnataka legislative council, that was scheduled to conclude on Friday, has been extended till February 10 as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal (Secular) alliance aims to complete the election process of a new chairman to the upper house.The two parties are now likely to further cement their alliance in the state and the upper house as the BJP has agreed to nominate and back Basavaraj Horatti’s bid to become the chairman.“I have been nominated by our party for the post of chairman,” Horatti said on Friday.An order by the Karnataka Governor’s office stated that the nomination for the chairman’s elections will be held on February 8 and voting will be held the following day.“The party has decided to back Horatti,” Kavatagimatt Mahantesh Mallikarjun of the BJP confirmed.The developments come barely a day after Pratapchandra Shetty of the Congress tendered his resignation as chairman after repeated bids by the BJP and JD(S) to unseat him over the last two months.The Congress had tried to push the no-confidence motion against Shetty to a vote to help “expose” the JD(S) and its alliance with the BJP.The Congress called JD(S) a party of convenience which will side with the highest bidder.“We will conclude the elections and Horatti will be made chairman, otherwise there was a chance of the JD(S) moving towards the Congress and that would have wasted all our efforts so far,” said a BJP leader, requesting anonymity.MK Pranesh of the BJP was elected as deputy chairman of the upper house with the backing of the JD(S) in the ongoing session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-legislative-council-session-extended-polls-for-chairman-on-tuesday-101612547156797.html

05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Ex-HPSC chief appointed as power regulator at hurriedly convened ceremony||Throwing constitutional norms to wind, the Haryana government appointed former Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) chairman RK Pachnanda as the chairman of Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) on Friday.Legal experts say that Pachnanda’s appointment is in clear contravention of Article 319 of the Constitution which prohibits member of a public service commission from holding offices on ceasing to be such members.Pachnanda, a retired IPS officer, was administered oath of office by state power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala at a hurriedly organised ceremony at Haryana Niwas on Friday evening. Only a few officers of the power department were present but none of the two HERC members were present.Article 319 says that a chairman of the state public service commission shall be eligible for appointment as the chairman or any other member of the Union Public Service Commission or as the chairman of any other state public service commission, but not for any other employment either under the government of India or under the government of a state.Former Haryana advocate general Ashok Aggarwal said the appointment has violated the spirit of the Constitution. “Prima facie, even though the HERC is a statutory body, one cannot say that it’s not a government employment. Whether such a move will hit the letter of law can be a matter of debate. But by all means, the move violates the spirit of the Constitution,” he said.Aggarwal said that the idea of putting a constitutional bar was to ensure independence and impartiality of members of the Public Service Commission by insulating them from allurement of a future employment under the government.Former advocate general Mohan Jain said that there was clear constitutional prohibition on chairman or member of a public service commission from holding offices once their term in the public service commission is over.“Appointments in HERC are done by the Haryana government. There is a certain amount of control that government exercises over the electricity regulatory commission,’’ Jain said.To justify its actions, the state government, however, has taken a legal opinion in the matter from advocate general BR Mahajan, who gave a green signal for Pachnanda’s appointment on grounds that HERC is a quasi-judicial body and does not fall under the constitutional bar.Reacting to the development, Congress general secretary and former minister Randeep Singh Surjewala said that by appointing Pachnanda as HERC chairman, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has committed gross unconstitutionality.“It is also an act of political malafide. In order to burden 2.5 crore Haryanvis with enhanced electricity rates, the Khattar government has committed this patent illegality and has trampled the Constitution, particularly Article 319, which prohibits such appointments,” Surjewala, a former power minister said.The Congress general secretary said that the hush-hush manner in which the oath was administered to Pachnanda after the illegally planned move was exposed by Hindustan Times proves guilt of the BJP-JJP regime.Former leader of Opposition and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala said that Pachnanda, a former West Bengal cadre IPS officer, is actually an appointee of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).“CM Khattar has acted as a rubber stamp in making this appointment which is a clear violation of the Constitution,” Chautala said.Terming the appointment as a shameful act, former minister Karan Singh Dalal said that this showed how much the Khattar government respects the constitutional tenets and the founding fathers of the Constitution, including Dr BR Ambedkar. “Pachnanda as a power regulator will now be used to ratify arbitrary power purchase agreements made by the government-owned power companies,” Dalal alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exhpsc-chief-appointed-as-power-regulator-at-hurriedly-convened-ceremony-101612542087885.html
05-02-2021||City||'Get vaccinated or face salary cut': Odisha district admin to healthcare workers||With 1 lakh healthcare workers in Odisha yet to be given the first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine before the February 10 deadline, a district administration in Odisha on Friday warned the healthcare workers that their salary would be withheld if they fail to get vaccinated.In a letter to the officials of Cuttack's SCB Medical College and Hospital, chief district medical officer, superintendent of Sishu Bhawan and CMC Commissioner, Cuttack district collector Bhabani Shankar Chayani said a large number of health workers/Anganwadi workers who have registered under different establishments are not turning up for the vaccination."As the percentage of vaccination of Cuttack district is one of the lowest in the state, it is causing a great embarrassment. Those registered under different establishments for Covid-19 vaccine should positively take the shot by February 10, failing which their salary/remuneration/stipend for the month will not be drawn,” the district collector said in his letter.The district collector advised the officials to sensitize the health workers/Anganwadi workers so that they come forward for vaccination.Cuttack is among the three districts in Odisha that have achieved less than 60 per cent of the vaccination target which began on January 16. The other two districts are Bolangir and Jajpur.Also read: 4G Mubarak! tweets Abdullah with mobile internet services being restored in J-KAdditional chief secretary, health department, Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra said such dire warnings by the Cuttack administration were necessary as the healthcare workers had volunteered for the jabs. "They can't back out just like that. After they registered on the CoWIN portal, the Centre sent the required number of vaccines," said Mohapatra, who got himself vaccinated on Friday. He hoped that all the 3.38 lakh healthcare workers who had registered their names on the CoWin portal would be vaccinated by February 10.The vaccination has slowed down among the Anganwadi workers in several districts as many of them are hesitant and unsure of the vaccine's efficacy. Several Anganwadi workers are also hesitant to take the shot as they feel there is no point in taking the vaccine when Odisha is reporting less than 100 Covid-19 cases every day and the number of active Covid-19 cases have dropped below 1,000. Of the 30 districts, Kandhamal and Nabarangpur districts have currently no active Covid-19 patients.Meanwhile, the state government braced for another massive Covid-19 inoculation drive from Saturday with Odisha Police DG Abhay set to receive the first jab. Apart from Abhay, SPs and collectors of all the districts will also be administered the Covid-19 vaccine.To instil confidence, the government has asked senior officials including DGP, collectors, SPs and others to take the vaccine and share a photo of the same on social media. Apart from police personnel, frontline workers of home, urban Development and revenue departments, besides other Corona warriors, would be administered the Covid-19 vaccine from Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/get-vaccinated-or-face-salary-cut-odisha-district-warns-healthcare-workers-101612540960067.html

05-02-2021||Jaipur||Farm laws being opposed across the country, should be withdrawn: Sachin Pilot||The resolution has also sought compensation for families of the farmers who have died during the protests which started in November last year.Addressing the Mahapanchayat, Pilot said, “While making these laws none of the state governments or farmers’ organisations were consulted. These laws were passed in Parliament in haste and imposed on the country. The government of India claims these farm laws are in the interest of the farmers but they are being opposed across the country.”“The farmers are protesting in a Gandhian manner but the way barricades have been put up, and electricity and water supply discontinued, it is unjustified,” Pilot said, adding that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and leader Rahul Gandhi have supported the farmers throughout the agitation.The Mahapanchayat, held under the banner of Kisan Mahapanchayat, submitted a memorandum to district collector demanding a repeal of the laws. “We will not step back, till these demands are met,” Pilot said.Friday’s gathering was the second Kisan Mahapanchayat to be held in Dausa in the past four days. Smaller Kisan Panchayats have been held in several parts of Rajasthan, including in the Jat dominated Shekhawati belt of the state.Condemning the violence that erupted during the tractor parade, Pilot said, “The opposition parties are supporting the farmers. The issue is not of a party or leader but of the farmers.” On Saturday, the Congress leader will address a Mahapanchayat in Bharatpur, Chaksu and Bayana, each.Targeting the Congress for allegedly misleading the farmers, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said, “Congress itself made such promises in the manifesto. The GoI is continuously holding talks with the farmers and is committed to resolve it on a positive note.”Ram Lal Jat, head of Kisan Mahapanchayat, Rajasthan, has appealed the farmers in the state to support Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’s call for a Chakka Jam (traffic blockade) on February 6.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the three farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/farm-laws-being-opposed-across-the-country-should-be-withdrawn-sachin-pilot-101612533944836.html

Residents allege that as growing leaves/branches obstruct their hoardings, they cut the branches, without getting the permission from the authorities. “We are following up the issue since 2019. Despite a case been filed, the civic administration has not taken any major step,” said Tanay Patekar, social activist who works with NGO Angholichigoli. Many trees have been trimmed or branches pruned at Kaspate chowk, Mankar chowk and Pimple Saudagar area. “We have written many mails, reminders to the civic administration, PCMC commissioner Shravan Hardikar, mayor Usha Dhore, PCMC sky sign and license department and garden department for taking action against these advertisers, but still await action,” Patekar said. PCMC garden superintendent Prakash Gaikwad said, “The sky sign and license department is the authority to look at this issue.” According to the Maharashtra Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1995, any person who defaces any tree, fence, wall, monument statue, building – on conviction to be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with a fine which may extend to two thousand rupees or both. “I am a regular commuter to Wakad-Hinjewadi road and every month I see a new hoarding and trimmed trees in front of it. It is disturbing, but is happening in most of the areas of PCMC,” said Saurabh Kakliya, IT professional. “We are going to conduct a joint meeting with the garden department to find out if the trees which are trimmed or cut were illegal. We have received a few complaints and will take appropriate action,” said Nilesh Deshmukh, assistant commissioner, sky and license department, PCMC. Juhi Sharma, PCMC resident said, “I have seen a tree reduced to half its height.

05-02-2021||Pune||IoT stars in global success of local firms||Pune: Most of us are using wearable devices, fitness trackers and seeking information or entertainment by instructing Alexa and Google with voice commands. Several such consumer and smart products are applications of Internet of Things (IoT) which will soon enable connected cars and home appliances in our day-to-day lives. Besides this consumer side, IoT has assumed much more significance in the enterprise domain. IoT startups are witnessing a surge in demand and investments in both consumer and enterprise domains. Scope for IoT startups is also huge in public sector where smart city projects are being implemented. There is a great opportunity for startups to explore the tremendous applications in the smart city ecosystem and program.The Centre for Industry 4.0 in collaboration with ministry of heavy industries has been set up at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). Pune is a manufacturing and automotive industry hub and a big advantage for the city is that there are a lot of small companies building software for industrial sector.----------------------Founders’ SayExpect a rapid push in IoT innovations in PunePune as a city has immense potential to become the focal point for the IoT revolution in India. We have a thriving ecosystem of both IoT and IT solution providers in our city. With the advent of VC firms like Pentathlon Ventures setting their base in Pune, we can expect a rapid push towards the innovations in the space of IoT in this region.The city has already produced some world-class Industrial IoT companies. Pune is an industrial powerhouse and a preferred destination for leading automotive manufacturers as well as global IT companies.Pune being at the crossroads between the automotive and the IT industry allows access to a wide talent pool with a blend of skill sets from hardware and software space. Access to this talent pool is quintessential to build cutting-edge IoT products that can excel globally.We have a multi-fold plan to invest towards infinite uptime’s growth trajectory and achieve higher benchmarks for customer satisfaction and value delivery. After our latest funding round, we plan to hire and build a team to drive our enterprise sales and expand our global footprint. We are also optimising our sales franchise model for higher performance and value. At the same time, we will invest deeper within the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) relationships.Raunak Bhinge, founder, Infinite Uptime----------------------------------International clients account for more than 50% of our business IoT is a big domain and has applications everywhere. There is a big surge in the industrial IoT segment – the smart factories and other digital initiatives in the enterprise domain. On the consumer side, personal entertainment and healthcare wearable devices in particular are witnessing a wave and a lot more is happening on the international level on the smart products’ front. Investments in IoT startups continue to be in mix. It is recognised as a growth area. On the national level, the industrial segment is getting more investment. Singapore and US venture capital firms and Indian investors are keen in funding enterprise domain IoT startups. But the depth is less in consumer side. Altizon has now gone global. Our international clients account for more than 50 per cent of our business now. We have got good investors like TVS Digital who are helping us grow as a company. Altizon has also got product recognition in the global market. Altizon has been recognised by Gartner in the 2020 Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT platforms. We have been listed by Gartner for the last three consecutive years. Vinay Nathan, co-founder and CEO, Altizon Systems -------------------------Investors’ SayNumber of investors is bullish on IoT growth trendsIoT enables us to get data about the physical world, which was not possible earlier. IoT essentially is built on the fact that sensors are making the physical world come alive. When this happens, and we have all latitude-longitude data, temperature data, speed data or whatever data which we never had before now we have new generation of companies, applications in technologies that are building to turn this data into insight.We are honestly seeing only the first generation of this in IoT. For past several years, we had Google and Facebook tracking the online data at a level of granularity. Imagine what could happen when the physical world comes alive at this level of granularity. The real-time information of the physical world around us and what it can do to companies, individuals, governments etc is the most exciting part of IoT. Number of investors is bullish on these trends. We will see a lot more, a completely new set of companies in this decade. Pune has seen a lot of growth in SaaS (software as a service) recently. The manufacturing ecosystem being so strong here is a great driver for new generation IoT and sensor driven companies in Pune. The ecosystem in Pune is developing fast and it will continue to evolve as more early-stage investors keep investing in companies. Vaibhav Domkundwar, CEO, Better CapitalPune has market and talent pool, lacks funding infraPune has a fairly large number of manufacturing units and a large IT talent pool. A lot of investment is happening in the enterprise domain of IoT especially in the automotive, pharma and food-tech companies. Pune has the market and talent pool, but lacks the funding infrastructure. The state government can play an active role in incentivising startups in cities like Pune.Shashank Deshpande, managing partner, Pentathlon Ventures------------------------------------Mentor Speak IoT startups have huge scope in smart city projects Due to the shutdown during Covid-19 outbreak, companies have realised that there is no alternative to going digital, including in the core manufacturing activities. Companies are upgrading to industry 4.0. Earlier IoT was a choice, but it has become a “must have” thing for companies. Our role is to educate and prepare a roadmap for these companies. Startups have a huge scope in the smart city projects too. They need to understand the landscape to successfully navigate it. Public authorities are now open to talk to innovators and startups and understand how they can solve the problems. Large companies have nurtured the startup ecosystem very well in cities like Bengaluru. There are a lot more accelerator programs and avenues to showcase products there. This is lacking in Pune.Sujata Tilak, director of smart manufacturing and IIoT division, International Society of Automation---------------------------------------------------Pune-based IoT startups, companiesCarIQ (A Varroc company), Balewadi•Founded in 2013 by Hrishikesh Nene and Sagar Apte•Acquired in 2019 by auto component manufacturer Varroc Engineering Ltd•CarIQ is an integrated connected vehicle solution provider to original equipment manufacturer, fleet owners and insurance companies. •CarIQ can help infrastructure providers and city planners to take maximum advantage of Internet of Things.Greenovative Energy Solutions (Greenovative Energy Pvt Ltd), Baner•Founded in January 2011 by Vinit Kulkarni and Harshal Samdani •Privately funded•Selected as winner of Maharashtra Start-up Week held in June 2018•Selected through Emerge-X in Microsoft’s initiative “Highway to a Hundred Unicorns”•Provides eco-friendly energy management solutions like monitoring energy usage across industrial, commercial, institutional and infrastructural facilities.Infinite Uptime (Infinite Uptime India Pvt Ltd), Aundh •Founded in 2015 by Raunak Bhinge•The industrial internet platform that automates predictive maintenance for industrial machines, provides an all-in-one industrial solution with hardware, cloud analytics, and control software to monitor equipment, diagnose problems, and drive smart decision making.•Raised $5.15 million in Series B funding in December 2020ShopWorx (Entrib Analytics Technology Pvt Ltd), Baner•Founded in 2011 by Kiran Nataraj and Swapnil Amritkar•ShopWorx is an end-to-end solution for manufacturing shop-floor management and analytics.

Some of these were ESOP taxation, angel tax, allowing institutional investors like LIC to invest in startups, GST reverse charge, removal of capital gains tax for new venture investments like in US or UK, waiver of surcharge on capital gains from startup investments etc. The residency requirements reduced to 120 days means that our NRI brain trust can more easily set up companies here.”ExtraaEdge co-founder Abhishek Ballabh said, “The budget brings quite a few good news for startups and small business. Tax holiday exemption and capital gains exemption is a much-needed relief post pandemic. There have been many steps taken by the government to help startups, which include broadening the definition of start-ups, simplifying regulations, providing income tax exemptions and setting up a ₹10,000 crore Fund of Funds run by SIDBI. Govt Start-up India Seed Scheme may also become a strong investment alternative, provided disbursement and allocation happens swiftly and regularly like a private fund. This will be a much-needed respite for working capital and growth needs of early-stage firms. The allocation of ₹5000 crore towards R & D is one of the highlights of this budget and can be committed to strengthening EdTech platforms and building a strong digital infrastructure for education.”FITTR founder Jitendra Chouksey said, “This year’s Union Budget has a strong focus on healthcare with increased spending. The budget has given due importance to the startup segment as well. The extension of tax holiday on revenue as well as investment was much needed during these challenging times. This will further foster the growth of startups in India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/iot-stars-in-global-success-of-local-firms-101612534467080.html

05-02-2021||Chandigarh||AAP hopes to sweep Punjab civic body elections with broom||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leadership in Punjab started its campaign for the civic body elections by sweeping streets in Bathinda on Friday. Punjab leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema and party legislators from different districts gathered at the local Arya Samaj with brooms, the AAP’s election symbol. Cheema said it is for the first time that the party has fielded candidates for local bodies across Punjab and looked forward to emerging as a major political force at the municipal corporation level. “The aim of starting the state-level election campaign from Bathinda is to highlight the failure of local Congress legislator and state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. Manpreet held the finance portfolio in the previous Akali regime and now in the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government, but the state coffers continue to remain empty. He has failed to bring any change in his own constituency,” said Cheema. He said the Bathinda MLA has failed as finance minister as people from all spheres, including state employees, are dissatisfied. Cheema said over the years, local bodies in Punjab have become synonymous with corruption and undue political interference has hampered developmental activities. Barnala MLA Meet Singh Hayer charged the Amarinder government with failing to fulfil the promises in the Congress manifesto. “The AAP has proved its model of governance in Delhi and is committed to introducing similar functioning in municipalities. It will make way for bringing a political alternative at the state government level and stands for transparency and accountability,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-hopes-to-sweep-punjab-civic-body-elections-with-broom-101612525826624.html
05-02-2021||Pune||Tale of three crime families of Pune - Taak, Dudhani, Kalyani: 31 members and 1,100 cases||The residential area under the water tank in Ramtekdi area of Pune looks like any other colony of shanties; close knit houses and small shops. That is the case in Vaiduwadi area of Hadapsar. What makes these places stand apart are some of the residents of these areas. At least 30 members of these three families, collectively, have a record of over 1,000 cases against them, as per the records maintained by the Pune city police.These two spots are known residential areas of members of three crime families that have earned a spot in the special books of the Pune police - Taak, Dudhani, and Kalyani.The family trio has makings of a multiple part series on an OTT platform - inter-familial rivalries, murder, theft, legacies, and ways of avoiding arrest.Every few months a press statement is issued by either the Pune city of Pimpri-Chinchwad police of some of the people from one or more of the three families getting arrested as a result of which multiple cases of vehicle theft and house break-in thefts are detected. Some names get repeated often, month-after-month, while new names get added every once in a while. Which begs the questions - how many of them are there? and why do they manage to evade longer jail time?The question is answered partially by the type of crimes that they commit as pointed out by Krishna Prakash, commissioner of Pimpri-Chinchwad police in a recent press briefing.“The crimes they commit are not considered as serious crimes in the court. Therefore, once the police custody is over, they make bail and go back to their old ways,” he said.Shedding light on their activities in Pune city, Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pune said, “We have many sikalgaris who habitually commit house break-in thefts in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, some of them having more than 40-50 cases too. Crime branch as well as police stations have made many successful detections in which sikalgaris were involved and a regular surveillance is kept on them. Stringent preventive action is under progress against habitual offenders.” Of the 33 people on the radar of Pune police, at least 12 have a record of over 50 cases against them. In a seemingly disproportionate statistic recorded by the Pune police, a 19-year-old has 91 cases registered against him. The 19-year-old, however, was killed in a fight among the youngsters of two families -Taak and Kalyani.As per the police record of the case, Paitarsingh Taak (19) was killed as a fallout of a fight that his brother Tilaksingh Taak (28) has with Vickysingh Kalyani (25). Tilaksingh had broken an arm of Vickysingh in a fight as a result of which, he was arrested, during which time, Vickysingh and three others hacked Paitarsingh to death on the night of July 23, 2020.Advocate Aslam Sayyed, who represents most of these men from all three families in the court, pointed out that the family members do not deny their involvement in most of the crimes. “This is how they make a living. They do not deny it. But they are falsely implicated in some of the cases definitely. Once marked as a criminal, it is difficult to get that tag off. And it is not like they want to either. They do have small businesses like fabrication, blacksmith, earth movers and pig-rearing. But those are not their main source of income,” said Advocate Sayyed.The Taak family is headed by siblings Ballusingh (30) and Ujalasingh (24) while the Kalyani family is headed by siblings Baitusingh alias Karansingh (24) and Ravisingh (22) and the Dudhani family is headed by Papasingh alias Charansingh (42), according to their lawyer. Some of the most notorious names in the list of those alive are Lakhansingh Rajputsingh Dudhani (36) a resident of Ramtekdi area of Hadapsar, who has a history of 81 cases. One of the youngest adults in the list of 11 living members of the three families who has over 50 cases against them is Sunnysingh Papasingh Dudhani (21) a resident of Birajdarnagar in Mopedvasti in Ramtekdi who has a history of 57 cases and is currently in the custody of Pune police in a series of house-theft cases. Pimpri-Chinchwad police arrested two lesser-known members of the Taak family, Surjeetsingh Rajpalsingh Taak (35) and Jeetsingh alias Jeetu Rajpalsingh Taak (24), both residents of Birajdarnagar in Vaiduwadi, Hadapsar, in another case after which a recovery of cars and stolen valuables collectively worth ₹30 lakh was made. The backdated list of crimes against these men is long and their allies including jewellers who are located outside of Pune and buy stolen precious metals from them are fixed, according to well-placed sources. The multiple off-springs are carrying forward the legacy of their elders with each crime they commit and each case they are falsely implicated in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/tale-of-three-crime-families-of-pune-taak-dudhani-kalyani-31-members-and-1-100-cases-101612523725585.html

However, the corporation needs permission from the Khadakwasla irrigation department and environmental clearance from the state to go ahead for the project.Due to Covid-19 pandemic , PMC is currently facing financial crunch for the development work. Therefore, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar has introduced a development model to take help of private players to ease the financial burden. Commissioner has stated that 11 roads and two bridges have been planned to be developed on PPP model as well as gardens through corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. Under the concept, PMC doesn’t need to spend money as private players will spend money and PMC will give credit notes which private players can use in building construction related activities to pay development charges, premium charges as well as transfer credit to developers. At present, there is no alternate road to reach Mundhwa, Hadapsar and Keshavnagar area through Koregaon Park. Due to developing Mundhwa and Keshavnagar area, North main road is facing traffic problems. To ease the traffic problem, the corporation has chosen a bridge of 5.5 kilometre parallel to the right bank of Mula-Mutha river and North Main road of Koregaon Park. The width of the road will be 30 metre as mentioned in the development plan of the city. Environment clearance and irrigation NOCAmar Shinde, executive engineer of the road department, said, “The proposed bridge has already been mentioned in the development plan of the city. It is parallel to the right bank of Mula-Mutha river. The bridge is divided into two portions- one is from Bund garden bridge to Aga Khan bridge and second starts from Westin hotel to Mundhwa bridge.”He further said, “Three kilometres of the bridge will pass through the riverbed and remaining portion of 2.50 kilometre is on land. For the land portion, we will have to acquire land. We will have to take permission from Khadakwasla irrigation department as the bridge is passing through the riverbed. Besides that, we will take environmental clearance from the state environment department. Right now, we have initiated a process with a floating tender to appoint a consultant.”Different from Vittalwadi road in riverbedPune municipal corporation received got a major setback during Vithalwadi to Pune-Mumbai National highway (NH-4) road construction which was passing through the Mutha riverbed.In 2014, NGT and Supreme Court had passed order to stop work and remove debris which was dumped to construct riverside road from Vithalwadi to Pune-Mumbai National Highway (NH-4) bypass in 2010. When asked about the similarity of bridges, Shinde said, “Both are different issues. There was a road constructed by putting debris in riverbed which was supposed to cause an obstacle to the natural water flow of the river. Here, there is no such issue. We are not going to dump debris in the riverbed.” RajendraKumar Mohite, chief engineer, water resource department, Pune, said, “We will mark the floodline in the riverbed. Bridge pillars have to be built so that it cannot create obstacles to river flow. We will check all necessary impacts on the river before sanctioning the plan, and we avoid giving permission in the blue line of the river.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ppp-bridge-from-bund-garden-road-to-mundhwa-in-pune-planned-to-ease-traffic-problem-101612522465736.html

They are indulging in malicious propaganda with neither substance nor truth."BJP must show material evidence of GoWB denying permission to their Yatra.

05-02-2021||Mumbai||Who is Nana Patole and why is he expected to lead Congress in Maharashtra?||Nana Patole, 56, the four-time legislator from Bhandara expected to be named as the next Maharashtra Congress chief, is seen as an aggressive leader from the Vidarbha region, an erstwhile stronghold where the party now faces strong competition from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He resigned as the Maharashtra assembly Speaker on Thursday after meeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ahead of his expected appointment in a day or two.Patole returned to the Congress in 2017, three years after he defected to the BJP. He defeated NCP’s Praful Patel from Bhandara-Gondia constituency in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on a BJP ticket. Patole hit the headlines in 2017 when he criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi before quitting the BJP. Within days of his re-induction, Patole was appointed as the Congress’s farmers’ wing chief. He was elected as an assembly member for the fourth time in 2019 and became the Speaker.Also Read | Nana Patole resigns as Maharashtra speaker, to be state Congress chiefThe Congress is believed to chosen Patole as it wanted an aggressive non-Maratha leader from the Vidarbha region for the role who could assert the party’s position in the competition among the state’s four major political parties--allies Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) as well as the BJP.The political space in Maharashtra is crowded and the party seeks an aggressive leader to make his presence felt. Many in the state Congress unit feel that the party lags behind Shiv Sena and the NCP, which have ambitious expansion plans.Patole belongs to the Kunbi community, which falls under the Other Backward Class category. The community is counted among the Congress supporters in the Vidarbha region.Patole has been vocal on the issues of farmers and is not seen to be allied to any group within the state Congress.A Congress leader said Maharashtra Congress was divided into two groups and pushing for the nomination of minister Vijay Wadettiwar and Rajya Sabha member Rajiv Satav when the change in the party leadership became apparent. “Incumbent chief Balasaheb Thorat’s group backed Satav. Former state unit chief Ashok Chavan’s camp supported Wadettiwar. Patole so far does not have a camp. He is not seen to be close to any of the established leaders in the state Congress--Thorat, Chavan or former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan,” said the leader, who did not want to be named.Thorat holds three key posts and wanted to be divested of his responsibility as the state chief.A second Congress leader said Patole will have a tough job as he will have to deal with top leaders like Ashok Chavan, Thorat, and Prithviraj Chavan. “...he has no strong support group in the state unit. His aggressive attitude may prove to be a hurdle in coordination with other parties in [the ruling] MVA [Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi] and also running the party unit,” the leader said, requesting anonymity. “There was friction between Patole and other leaders when he announced statewide rallies ahead of assembly polls in 2019.

The MLA said he was not aware of the case registered against him.“Some years-ago, I had met Bheel in a social function held in Neemuch, where he was a guest; after which we became acquaintances and confided in each other about our dissatisfactory relationship with our partners. Gradually, we became good friends before the MLA proposed me with marriage, which I refused. But he continued to repeat his proposal on several occasion, which I finally accepted on the condition that he will take permission from his family members,” reads the complainant’s statement.The complainant claimed that the MLA told her that he had parted ways with his first wife with her consent in the presence of community heads.“Further, we kept meeting in Neemuch and Udaipur in the last two years. On November 8, 2020, the MLA called me to say he had managed to convince his family members. After which, I reached an apartment in Udaipur, where he developed physical relations with me promising marriage. After that incident, he stopped picking my calls and gradually started avoiding me,” the woman said in the statement.Also Read: Rajasthan HC issues notice on illegal mining hazard near Indo-Pak borderShe further alleged to have been spurned by the MLA’s wife in the month of January, when she phoned the MLA.

The budget has no new project slated this year as the focus is merely on improving revenue and maintaining assets already created in the city. The budget will be reviewed mid-year when, depending on the financial and pandemic situation, new projects may be allotted. There is no increase in taxes. Dr Vipin Sharma, the municipal commissioner, said, “This is a realistic budget. We will get a clear picture on the Covid-19 situation in the next few months. As of now, the budget is tabled based on the present situation; we will revise it midterm if the situation improves. There are no new projects undertaken this year, we will only focus maintaining the assets already created.”Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress corporators and members of the standing committee created a ruckus in the special meeting called for budget presentation in Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), in Maharashtra.

To begin with, DDA has put up a list of 16 parks, including Hauz Khas, Asita-Yamuna riverfront, Sanjay Lake, Astha Kunj in Nehru Place, Swarn Jayanti Park in Rohini, two district parks in Dwarka, Coronation park in North Delhi, among others which can be booked for various cultural events.

05-02-2021||Patna||Bihar budget: Fiscal deficit to be near 4% due to Covid-19 induced borrowings||With the internal revenue collections and central devolutions dipping in this fiscal year owing to economic contraction due to Covid-19 pandemic, the Bihar government’s fiscal deficit for 2020-2021 is set to increase and hover around the 4% mark of the state gross domestic product (SGDP), said officials.The Nitish Kumar government, which is giving the final touches to the state budget, is hoping to cap the deficit around 4%, well within the permissible borrowing limit of 5% of SGDP-- allowed by the Centre in May last to give states more leeway in meeting their financial needs due to Covid induced lockdown and financial constraints.The Centre had allowed states to increase the borrowing limit by 2% above the 3% of GSDP under the FRBM (fiscal responsibility budget management act), by putting in certain unconditional and conditional criteria in the additional borrowing limit.“The deficit will increase as the borrowings have increased with less flow of internal revenue against the targets as well as the central devolutions. But it would not be more than 4% and could be even capped at 3.5% of SGDP this fiscal year. The assessment is still going on,” said an officer in the finance department on condition of anonymity.The state government has already borrowed ₹26,000 crore till January this fiscal as against the target of ₹28,000 crore, owing to the dip in internal revenue and devolutions. There are projections that the internal revenue target of ₹39,900 crore would fall short by ₹9,000 to ₹10,000 crore.This year’s budget outlay is expected to be around ₹2.15 lakh crore with chances of enhancement in the non-plan (committed expenditure) outlay with no marginal hike in the annual schemes( plan outlay) given the fund deficit.The deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, who is also the finance minister, held discussions with Bihar Chamber of Commerce, Bihar Industries Association, other business bodies and stakeholders as part of pre-budget consultations on Wednesday. The business bodies have given suggestions in relation to taxation, tweaking rules in taking input tax credit (ITC) under GST, simplifying the VAT forms and also reducing the road tax.Also Read: Duplication of beneficiary names on CoWIN app slowing vaccination drive in BiharMeanwhile, principal secretary finance, S Siddharth said the fiscal deficit would be kept well within the permissible limit as the cap has already been increased. “Even if the deficit is four percent, it would be in the permissible limit. We cannot go beyond the limit as the deficit limit is guided under an act,” he said.Incidentally, the finance department official said the state budget would show revenue surplus as like previous years indicating the fiscals in terms of meeting its commitments and other operational expenses are good. The state budget will be laid in the state assembly on February 22 during the budget session beginning February 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-budget-fiscal-deficit-to-be-near-4-due-to-covid-19-induced-borrowings-101612496020143.html
05-02-2021||Patna||Duplication of beneficiary names on CoWIN app slowing vaccination drive in Bihar||Duplication of names in the CoWIN application and glitches in beneficiaries receiving SMSs, carrying details of their vaccination slots, have contributed in slowing down Bihar's vaccination drive as the deadline to administer the first shot of Covid-19 vaccine to healthcare workers ends on Friday.By Thursday, Bihar had inoculated nearly 60% of its 4.64 lakh healthcare workers, who are on top of the priority list for the pan India Covid-19 vaccination drive that began on January 16.“The Co-WIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network) portal throws up names of beneficiaries who have already been vaccinated. Though this number is small, it pulls down our overall vaccination coverage,” said Dr Sanjay Kumar, professor and head, department of community medicine, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS).Dr Bimal Karak, former medical superintendent of the Patna Medical College Hospital, had also flagged the issue of duplication of beneficiaries’ names on the portal last month.All Covid vaccinations have to be done through the CoWIN app, a digital platform used for distribution of the vaccine.“In some cases, health care workers, who have not yet completed 28 days since their first shot of the vaccine, have received SMS, intimating them to take the vaccine. Such problems have been witnessed on the portal in the last few days, but we have been cautious enough to detect them,” he added.“Another common issue was non-receipt of intimation about vaccination through SMS. This was common among the lower-level health care workers, who had either changed their mobile number or their mobile number fed into the portal was wrong. As a result, they neither receive any SMS, intimating them about vaccination, nor do phone calls mature on their given number,” said Dr Kumar.The IGIMS, where chief minister Nitish Kumar had launched the state’s vaccination campaign, had achieved 60% vaccination coverage.The Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) had also achieved 60% of its vaccination target of vaccinating 2,500 healthcare workers.“Though the vaccination coverage has gone up from 30% in the initial days to 60% now, there is still some hesitancy among healthcare workers to take the vaccine. We made every effort to encourage those who were reluctant. Friday is the last date for administering the first shot of the vaccine,” said NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh.The Guru Gobind Singh urban healthcare centre, a district hospital in Patna, had achieved 50.3% vaccination coverage till Wednesday, said its superintendent, Dr Pashupati Kumar Singh. Private healthcare facilities in its close vicinity, having less than 100 healthcare workers, have been tagged to the district hospital for the vaccination purpose.Executive director, State Health Society, Manoj Kumar, the state nodal officer for vaccination, did not respond to calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/duplication-of-beneficiary-names-on-cowin-app-slowing-vaccination-drive-in-bihar-101612494364661.html
05-02-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to present budget today||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will present the state’s budget statement and vote on account in the legislative assembly on Friday. This will be the last budget presentation during the second term of the Trinamool Congress government. Assembly elections could be held in March – April this year. It is usually the finance minister who reads out the budget statement. But this year the state finance minister Amit Mitra will not attend the assembly due to health issues.

Dhankhar tweeted on Thursday that he has authorised Banerjee to perform all duties in the assembly related to the presentation of the annual financial statement for 2021-22 and the motion for vote on account. Meanwhile the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have decided to boycott the session on Friday as a mark of protest. “The ruling party is trying to stifle the Opposition. We are not allowed to speak, our questions are not being properly answered and the issues raised by us are not discussed,” said Abdul Mannan, veteran Congress leader and the leader of the Opposition in the assembly. Vote on account is done to seek a sanction for administrative expenditure. Although the budget announces a plan for the full year, this year because of the assembly elections, the expenditure approval will be sought over the next three months in the form of vote on account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/west-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-to-present-budget-today-101612493713632.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Delhi borders remain closed; traffic likely to be affected||Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu borders remain closed on Friday morning as farmers continue their agitation demanding withdrawal of the three farm laws. As traffic remains diverted, motorists will have to face heavy traffic jams in parts of the Capital, specially in east Delhi, where roads leading to Ghaziabad also saw heavy traffic on Thursday. Delhi Traffic Police officers said Delhi and Ghaziabad would have to face traffic jams as the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border has been completely closed. All the six lanes of Delhi-Meerut, NH-9 and NH-24 are also closed because of the UP Gate border blockade and vehicles entering Delhi from Ghaziabad are being diverted to the alternate border routes such as Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra, Loni, Kondli, Chilla, New Ashok Nagar, DND, and Kalindi Kunj, they said.Also Read | Will not enter Delhi, say farmers as police prepare for chakka jamHowever, they said, NH-24 road is kept open for traffic going to Delhi from Ghaziabad through Ghazipur roundabout. So, motorists entering Delhi from Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar or Apsara border can take a right turn from the Ghazipur roundabout and take NH-24 road from there to move towards south and central Delhi via Sarai Kale Khan and the Ring Road.“Also, commuters can take Vikas Marg after taking a right turn from under the Patparganj Industrail Area flyover from Anand Vihar-Ghazipur road. No traffic is being allowed on Delhi-Meerut expressway while NH-9 is kept open only during morning and evening peak hours when traffic remain heavy,” a traffic police officer said.Apart from the UP Gate border, Singhu, Tikri, Saboli and Piau Maniyari borders are also closed. Traffic police officials said that Jharoda and Auchandi borders are opened only during morning and evening peak hours while Lampur, Safiabad, Singhu school and Pall toll tax borders are open for the traffic.As traffic is expected to remain heavy on GT Karnal Road, Outer Ring Road and NH-44, traffic police have asked motorists to avoid these routes and take the alternate or diverted routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-delhi-borders-remain-closed-traffic-likely-to-be-affected-101612493473796.html

05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ agitation gathers momentum in Haryana, khaps back Tikait||The focus of the farmers’ agitation over the enactment of the three farm laws by Parliament has shifted to Haryana with farmers and khap leaders throwing their weight behind Rakesh Tikait, the BKU leader from Uttar Pradesh. The swing was evident at Wednesday’s mahapanchayat at Jind’s Kandela village, once the epicentre of a bloody farmers’ agitation over power bills waiver during the INLD rule, where farmers gathered in big numbers.Tikait will hold another mahapanchayat on Sunday at Dadri.In fact, farmers and khap leaders from Haryana are now holding the centre stage, literally overshadowing their counterparts from Punjab who were once spearheading the agitation. Emotional call was turning point As many as 115 khaps or clan-based bodies on Wednesday participated at the Kandela mahapanchayat. Tekram Kandela, head of the Kandela khap, who was the main organiser of the mahapanchayat, said 115 khaps out of Haryana’s nearly 160 bodies attended the meeting. “The agitation picked up pace on January 27 night when Rakesh Tikait gave an emotional call. In no time, Chandigarh-Hisar highway was blocked, and farmers started mobilising for Ghazipur. Since then, the numbers have been increasing,” Kandela said. Tikait emerging as face of agitation in Haryana A retired political science professor from Bhiwani, Anant Ram, said the farm agitation has picked up pace in Haryana in the last seven days once the khaps came out in support of Tikait. “In fact, Tikait has become the face of the agitation and Haryana’s khaps have come out openly in his support. The agitation has picked up momentum in entire Haryana, except parts of Ahirwal region. The farmers, mostly from Jat community, have made this agitation an issue of their pride and prestige after Tikait accused BJP’s Loni MLA Nand Kishore Gurjar of threatening the protesters to vacate the protest site at Ghazipur border. The Kandela mahapanchayat has proved that there is huge current among farmers against three farm laws and the BJP-JJP rulling government in the Jat heartland,” he said. Agitation turning into national agitation: Sampat SinghFormer Haryana minister and BJP leader Sampat Singh said the agitation got a shot in the arm after Tikait’s impassioned appeal. “I see it spreading out. Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are the new centres but it’s spreading to other states also. I would say it’s turning into a national agitation. It’s high time that the Central government acceded to the demand of the farmers. They should not be labelled as anti-BJP. Remember, they were the ones who helped BJP win 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana,’’ said Singh who as finance minister had negotiated with agitating farmers during the INLD reign. Congress leader Karan Dalal said 52 khaps from Palwal alone have lent their support to the agitation. “The agitation was on the brink of collapse after the January 26 episode. But it’s now spreading like a wildfire and will swallow the ruling BJP,’’ Dalal, a former minister, said. Rohtak-based political analyst Satish Tyagi said the agitators have gained sympathy from every section of society in Haryana. “Even women are turning up at large numbers. After the government stopped internet services, more people started gathering across toll plazas in Haryana. The farmers of central Haryana have accepted Tikait as their farm leader,’’ he said. Ruling combine leaders face boycott Farmers associated with 17 khaps in Jind had decided to socially boycott the BJP and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leaders. The Hooda khap had unanimously decided to restrict the entry of ruling party leaders. The Sarv Khap announced to send at least one person from each house to the protesting site.The Phogat khap has socially boycotted deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh and former Dadri MLA Rajdeep Phogat, who is a chairman in the BJP-JJP government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-agitation-gathers-momentum-picks-in-haryana-khaps-back-tikait-101612491973737.html
05-02-2021||Lucknow||Farm stir: Priyanka Gandhi visits kin of deceased farmer||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday urged the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government to repeal the three new farm laws instead of calling the farmers protesting against the laws “terrorists”.“If there is any bigger wrong other than the three farm laws, which the government should take back but is not doing so, it is that martyrs are branded as terrorists and the farmers’ agitation is seen as a political conspiracy,” Priyanka Gandhi said.The Congress general secretary on Thursday met the family of Navreet Singh, who died after his tractor overturned during a tractor parade on January 26 in New Delhi, and attended a prayer ceremony for him at Dibdiba village in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur district.“I have come here to tell this family that you are not alone. Every single countryman is with you, be it of any religion, and farmers of every corner of the country are with you and we are with you,” she said.Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and Congress legislature party leader Aradhna Mishra accompanied Priyanka Gandhi on her visit to meet Navreet’s family.“Navreet was 25. My son is 20. You have young sons who went there to show their solidarity with farmers. He (Navreet) did not come back because of an incident. I want to tell Hardip Singh (Navreet’s grandfather) that we will not allow the loss of your grandson go waste. This agitation will continue till these black farm laws are withdrawn,” said Priyanka.Hitting out at the Congress leader, UP BJP vice president Vijay Patha, “The BJP government is doing a lot of work to double the income of farmers and bring about an improvement in the law and order situation. She should show large heartedness and speak about good efforts of government.”“By supporting the cause of farmers, the opposition wants to target the government. It’s opposition for the sake of opposition. Instead of siding with farmers, the Congress should point out the flaws in the farm laws,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/farm-stir-priyanka-gandhi-visits-kin-of-deceased-farmer-101612477013992.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Light rain, thunder strike national capital||Delhi residents on Thursday woke up to light rain, followed by thunderstorm and strong winds in parts of the national capital. The swift winds proved a blessing as they helped reduce the pollution levels.India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings show that the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, received 0.5mm of rain till 5.30pm Thursday. The Palam observatory received 2.6mm rain, while Lodi Road received 0.1mm till 5.30pm.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said apart from light rain, many parts also saw thunderstorms in the evening. He said under the influence of a passing western disturbance, the temperatures also increased in the region. At the Safdarjung observatory, the minimum temperature on Thursday was 12.4 degrees Celsius, which was four degrees above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 23.2 degrees Celsius.“Generally, during the passage of a western disturbance, temperatures tend to increase. From tomorrow (Friday), the mercury will start falling once again. But there will not be a drastic fall. The minimum temperature will remain around 7-8 degrees Celsius,” Srivastava said.As the temperatures rose and strong winds blew over Delhi-NCR, the pollution levels started abating. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Thursday was 316, in the ”very poor” zone. This was, however, an improvement from Wednesday’s 330, also in the ”very poor” category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/light-rain-thunder-strike-national-capital-101612472495976.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Police asks DTC to review decision to recall buses||A day after the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) asked the police to immediately return all its buses taken on ‘special hire’ to maintain law and order in the city, the Delhi Police wrote to DTC asking it to review its decision as it may lead to obstruction in maintaining law and order.In the letter, special commissioner of police Robin Hibu said if any untoward incident happens in Delhi then DTC may be held accountable.A senior DTC officer confirmed that the corporation has received the letter after which DTC managing director met Hibu to resolve the issue. The DTC MD also raised the pending dues on the part of the Delhi Police amounting to about ₹10 crore with Hibu, officials said.Till Thursday, of the total 576 buses, over 350 buses provided to police and para military personnel were returned to DTC.Late Wednesday evening, the Delhi government issued a directive to DTC to seek prior approval before giving any of its buses on ‘special hire’ by the Delhi Police or any other organisation. The order came in the wake of 40 DTC and cluster buses getting damaged during the tractor rally by protesting farmers on Republic Day when the police used buses as barricades at several locations, including ITO and Akshardham.“As per direction of the authorities, 360 of total 576 buses provided to police and para military under special hire have been withdrawn to different depots. However, 216 buses are still with the security personnel in view of law and order situation,” said a senior DTC official.Normally, about 100 buses are provided by DTC to the police and para military forces. However, the number of buses went up to 576 after farmers started protest at Delhi borders, officials said.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticised the Aam Aadmi Party government on Thursday for withdrawing DTC buses given to the city police, saying chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is pushing the city into a state of anarchy for political gains, especially in Punjab and Delhi.The AAP which is the main Opposition party in Punjab has extended support to the farmer agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws.Several BJP leaders such as party’s national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, MPs Meenakshi lekhi, Parvesh Verma, Ramesh Bidhuri, Manoj Tiwari tweeted on Thursday with hashtag #KejriwalWantsAnarchy, criticising the decision to withdraw DTC buses.“India has a history of brave patriots from Prithvi Raj Chauhan to APJ Kalam & also has a history of Jaichand to Mir Jaffar. Recent action by Arvind Kejriwal to deny DTC bus services to police is a case in point which proves his anarchist credentials in support of Delhi seizure,” tweeted Meenakshi Lekhi, BJP MP from New Delhi.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta tweeted, “Delhi Police has always been a victim of cheap politics of Anarchist CM @arvindkejriwal. For their political interests, @aamaadmiparty has blamed Delhi Police for every act of violence in the city be it Jamia, JNU, Delhi Riots or Farmers protest violence. #KejriwalWantsAnarchy.”Gupta said Kejriwal was compromising with the safety and security of the people living in Delhi.Demanding immediate withdrawal of the order, BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, who is also the leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly, said, “The buses are needed by security forces. This is not the time to do politics. For political gains in Punjab, he shouldn’t push the city into a state of anarchy. The order should be immediately withdrawn.”Bidhuri added, “It is regrettable that Kejriwal neither went to ask the health condition of 300 police personnel injured during the Republic Day violence nor uttered a word of sympathy for them.”Despite calls and text messages, the AAP did not comment on the allegations by the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-asks-dtc-to-review-decision-to-recall-buses-101612472241874.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||9,494 get vaccine jabs in city, trial for front line workers starts||Delhi administered 9,494 Covid-19 jabs, out of the targeted 18,300, on Thursday, registering a turnout rate of 51.88%, which is around 12 percentage points higher than the previous day, even as the drive was opened up on a trial basis for front line workers.The 9,494 beneficiaries who got the shots on Thursday, include both health care workers and front line workers. But the government did not share data for beneficiaries under each category.On Thursday, 13 cases of adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI) were recorded, but none of them were severe in nature, senior government officials said.Health care workers are the first priority group for the inoculation drive, which was rolled out across the country on January 16. In Delhi, 240,000 health workers have registered for the vaccination.Front line workers come next on the priority list. They include police officials, fire officials, municipal staff, sanitation workers, schoolteachers and staff across all departments and agencies which were engaged in Covid-19 management. Delhi has an estimated 600,000 front line workers, of which around 350,000 have registered for vaccination so far, said data shared by senior government officials, who added that the registration drive for front line workers is underway.Last week, the Union government told states to consider starting vaccination for front line workers by the first week of February, following which the Delhi government scaled up its vaccination capacity on Tuesday by increasing the total number of vaccination sites from 106 to 183 and the number of vaccination days in a week from four to six“The trial run for vaccination of front line workers started today (Thursday) at least three vaccine centres in each of the 11 revenue districts. Few more centres will be roped in on Friday. We plan to start it full-fledged vaccines by Saturday. The front line workers will be eligible for shots in the same centres where health workers are being vaccinated. This is the reason why overall capacity for vaccination was scaled up,” said a senior government official.A senior official in the health department of the New Delhi Municipal Council said, “Registered front line workers will also be allowed for out-of-turn jabs, similar to the policy adopted for health care workers. The government is helping with the list of beneficiaries for all centres. The centres will have to ensure that records are properly maintained.”On Wednesday, Delhi had recorded the lowest vaccination turnout for a single day – at 40.25%. In Delhi, the highest single-day turnout was recorded on January 25, the fifth day of the drive, at 91.5%. Delhi had 81 vaccination centres then, which was increased to 106 on January 27.Government officials and experts attributed the recent decline in turnout to lack of awareness among beneficiaries about the new centres and decline in figures in several of the existing vaccination centres which, they said, suggest that they may have reached a saturation point. However, they said, the turnout is likely to go up once again now with doors opened for front line workers.Dr Namrata Makkar, deputy medical superintendent at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, said: “The turnout numbers should increase. Now that thousands of health workers have already been vaccinated in Delhi, the confidence-building exercise should be easier for front line workers and eventually the masses. In its awareness drives, the government should clearly deliver the message that how the vaccine is the biggest preventive measure against a potential second wave of the disease, which several countries across the world have witnessed.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “More centres will open doors for front line workers on Friday as part of the ongoing trial. It was a good decision to start with the trial and assess management-related issues. With time, the turnout numbers should go up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/9494-get-vaccine-jabs-in-city-trial-for-front-line-workers-starts-101612471643682.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Farm stir: Students miss online classes as internet remains suspended at Delhi, Haryana borders||For the past 10 days, 14-year-old Kunal Kumar, a Class 9 student of Government Senior Secondary School at Tikri border has not attended studies online as the mobile internet in the area remains suspended. While many school-going students in the area have turned to private tuitions in order to prepare for exams as only some of them have access to a Wi-Fi connection.Kumar, whose father works at a private firm, has not gone to school since the Covid-induced lockdown and had been studying online using his phone. But Republic Day onwards, following violent clashes between the protesting farmers and Delhi police, as the government snapped mobile internet services in several pockets of Delhi situated close to the borders where the farmers have been camping for the past 70 days, Kumar has not attended a single class.“Earlier, we used to take online classes from 8am to 1pm at our house, but now, because there is no network, I have not been able to attend classes for the past 10 days. We cannot download videos or study material. Now, students in classes 9-11 have been asked to come to school. Our final exams are scheduled to held next month. We are under pressure,” Kumar said.Prince Thakur, Kumar’s classmate, however, has made an arrangement. He visits his relative’s place nearby, who has a Wi-Fi connection. “With Wi-Fi, there are no problems. It is slow though but manageable. I only go there sometimes as my parents do not allow me to visit them daily,” he said.Both the boys and their friends who were playing in the neighbourhood on Thursday morning said their entire day is spent playing cricket, visiting protest sites, eating at langars there and loitering.Anil Kumar, a father of three, whose children study in class 6, 4 and in kindergarten, said they have no idea how things will turn out. “I have been regularly paying the fees, ₹500 per child for months. Throughout the year, there were only online classes and now, for the past ten days, they have also stopped. Left with no option I have to send my children for tuition so that they can prepare for their exams,” he said.Kumar, who runs a shop right next to the Tikri border agitation site, said because of the protest his earnings have also been hit. “To pay the school fee along with tuition fees and for the internet is difficult to afford,” he said.Adarsh Kumar, 17, a class 11 student who lives a few metres away from the agitation spot at Singhu border, hasn’t been able to attend his online classes for a week now. Due to the pandemic, Kumar’s offline classes at the nearby government school had been suspended since March and he was relying on worksheets as well as online learning.“The mobile internet here has been slow for the past few weeks but now it doesn’t work at all. We can send some messages on WhatsApp sometimes, but the signal is not strong enough to download files. So, I can’t access any reading material. I have been revising the old ones for a week now,” he said, adding that his sibling who is also in class 11 has to resort to the same.Though Kumar’s problems may resolve this week as the Delhi government on January 29 announced reopening of government schools for classes 9 and 11, many parents in Haryana are worried about the gap in learning that has been exacerbated by the mobile internet ban.Panipat resident Suman Malik, 38, mother of two who visits Singhu border agitation site at least four times a week, is one of them.“Not all schools have reopened in Haryana. While one of my sons has resumed his offline classes, the other one, who studies in a private school, cannot go for in-person classes. Online learning is the only option for him, and he has his exams next month. Besides, students cannot be expected to follow online classes for nearly a year and then just switch to offline classes after an internet ban. There has to be blended learning,” she said.While senior Delhi Police officers said mobile internet facilities were suspended on the orders of the ministry of home affairs (MHA), ministry officials said on Wednesday that there was no plan to further extend the suspension of internet beyond February 2. However, connectivity in areas near the protests sites continued to be poor on Thursday.Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said, “There are so many students who are staying at the protest site, and who have to attend online classes. They have not been able to study since the last one week due to the government’s inhuman and abrupt decision. We request the government to restore the internet connectivity for the sake of students.”In the evening, Samyukta Kisan Morcha also demanded the immediate reinstatement of mobile internet services. “Along with the agitating farmers, media persons and locals are facing a lot of trouble due to internet ban. Especially students are facing a big problem as their exams are approaching.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tikri-border-students-miss-classes-as-internet-stays-suspended-101612470743604.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body reserves 20,000 Covid vaccination shots for round two||To counter a possible shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to reserve 20,000 doses of both Covishield and Covaxin on priority for the second jab to be administered to healthcare workers (HCWs) inoculated at the start of the nationwide mass immunisation programme on January 16.Along with HCWs, BMC started vaccinating frontline workers (FLWs) from Thursday. The civic body has around 70,000 HCWs who are yet to be vaccinated in the first phase. Additionally, more than 200,000 FLWs have already registered on the CoWIN app for vaccination. For simultaneous vaccination of both groups, BMC needs more than 500,000 doses. However, till February 2, the civic body has 220,000 doses, which can cover only 106,000 individuals given that two doses have to be given 28 days apart.Although the civic body hopes to procure the next consignment of vaccine doses from the Central government within the next few days, officers have decided to keep aside 20,000 doses for the second shot.“This [reserving dose] is just a precautionary measure since HCWs who were vaccinated on January 16 will need to be given the second dose. Calculating a gap of 28 days from the first dose, the process is likely to start by February 14,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.As per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) rules, beneficiaries of both Covishield and Covaxin will have to take two shots. The first dose helps the immune system create a response against Sars-CoV-2 which causes Covid-19. The second dose further boosts the immune response to ensure long-term protection.In the last 12 sessions of the immunisation programme, 58,590 HCWs of 79,344 targeted have been vaccinated. From Thursday, BMC started vaccinating FLWs at 12 vaccination centres. At present, the civic body has set a target of around 10,000 inoculations every day that will be gradually increased.Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer, said the Centre will provide the next batch of vaccine doses in due course, which will then be dispatched to all districts as per their requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-reserves-20-000-covid-vaccination-shots-for-round-two-101612471031050.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Centre wants to rule over Delhi through back door channel: Sisodia||Delhi’s Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday attacked the Central government for “stealthily” approving a proposal to amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, which he claimed would give more powers to the lieutenant governor (L-G), undermining the city-state’s elected government.Addressing a digital press conference, Sisodia said the Union cabinet approved the proposal on Wednesday in an attempt to “snatch powers” from the elected chief minister and the Delhi cabinet and strengthen the authority of the L-G, who reports to the Centre. The Bill will now be tabled in the ongoing Budget session of Parliament, he said.The Centre’s move could lead to fresh friction between the office of the L-G and the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government which have squared off several times in the past six years over the extent of each other’s powers. The battle of primacy ended up in the Supreme Court, where it is still pending.“The Union cabinet has stealthily approved amendments to give so much power to the L-G that he can now stall any project or work initiated by the elected government in the Union territory. As per the Centre’s proposal, the final decision-making power will lie with the L-G and not the elected government,” Sisodia said.The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter.Specifically, the proposed law will clearly spell out the functions of the Council of Ministers and the L-G by giving more discretionary powers to the L-G. The proposed amendments suggest that the L-G could act in his discretion in any matter that is beyond the purview of the powers of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi in matters related to the All India (Civil) Services and the Anti Corruption Branch.If the legislation is passed, all the incentives offered to the people of Delhi by the AAP government would be taken away by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government, Sisodia warned. Under the current arrangement, following an order by the Supreme Court on July 4, 2018, the L-G is in charge of police, land, and public order, and the state government, the rest.The proposed law is “nothing but a backdoor channel being created by the BJP-led Central government to directly rule over Delhi. If this happens, then all the freebies and subsidies given by the AAP government will be snatched away from the people of Delhi. The BJP-led Centre will revoke our free power, water and bus rides for women schemes. It will also revoke the free treatment in Delhi government hospitals which every resident of the city is entitled to,” Sisodia said.He added that giving such powers to the L-G means empowering the Centre to rule directly over Delhi. Because Delhi is a Union territory, the L-G is appointed by the Union ministry of home affairs.“The Centre’s attempt to reduce the powers of an elected government is not just against democracy but it is also against our Constitution. The Constitution of India clearly states that barring three subjects - police, land and public order - all other subjects and works will be under the direct control of the elected government, which currently is that of Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party,” he said.Sisodia said that in 2015, the Central government misinterpreted the Constitution to claim that the L-G would run the Delhi government. When AAP challenged the interpretation in the Supreme Court, a constitution bench clarified that the elected government had the right to take decisions on all subjects except matters related to the police, land and public order, with the L-G only having to be kept informed about the Delhi government’s day-to-day decisions, Sisodia said. The court is yet to rule on who has control over the subject of services, which deals with transfers, postings and annual performance reviews of bureaucrats.“Now that it has no way out, the Central government is now keeping aside and overlooking the Constitution and the observations of the SC to directly rule over Delhi,” the deputy chief minister said.The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter.Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said all union territories are administered by the Central government through the L-G.“Delhi has very limited powers because of its nature as a union territory. It is something the Delhi government has to compromise with. The President administers it through the L-G and hence the assembly has very limited powers. But, it is true that it was unnecessary for the Centre to initiate such an amendment at such a junction when the Supreme Court has given a subject wise clarity on several issues. Maybe the central government is attempting to clarify the division of power further,” he said.The Delhi BJP said the Centre’s decision to amend the Govt Of NCT of Delhi Act is an important step to ensure proper governance in the national capital.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said repeated instances of conflict between the Arvind Kejriwal government and the lieutenant governor in the past six years have put the “prestige of the national capital and people’s lives and welfare at stake”.“The latest move by the Delhi government to withdraw DTC buses from police duty is a glaring example of why how national capital Delhi’s law and order and other serious administrative powers cannot be left to the state government. Steps being taken by Centre are important to maintain law and order and administrative control in the national capital,” he said.Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said when the Congress was in power at the Centre, the focus was strengthening the state governments. “But the current BJP government is creating a dictator-like regime and weak state governments are unable to stand before it.”“Arvind Kejriwal, who portrayed hinself before the public as someone who would fight against the government, is now proving to be a weak leader who cannot safeguard the interests of Delhi and its people. I want to ask him (Kejriwal), why doesn’t he sit on a protest against the central government now? Why doesn’t he fight for the rights of Delhi? Since this government came into power in Delhi, we have time and again seen weak leadership from the AAP government, and the BJP at the Centre is taking advantage of this,” Chaudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-wants-to-rule-over-delhi-through-back-door-channel-sisodia-101612470510946.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||How commuters are exposed to pollution||Commuters in the national capital who walk to their destinations or those who take autorickshaws are exposed to more than thrice the pollution that people who take the Delhi Metro, according to the findings of a study conducted by researchers from three British universities and three Indian institutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/how-commuters-are-exposed-to-pollution-101612469602775.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||January 26 violence: Soldiers, farmers... and now suspects||They live 120km apart in two villages of Punjab, and each owns a one-acre plot of farmland on which they grow wheat. Once soldiers in the Indian Army, the farmers now carry the tag of suspected criminals, having been picked out by Delhi Police as participants in the violence that marred Republic Day celebrations in the Capital.Until Saturday, the families of the two men, Gurmukh Singh and Jeet Singh, did not know each other despite them having served the army in the same regiment -- the Sikh Regiment -- for over two decades. Gurmukh Singh retired in 1984, Jeet Singh in 1989 after nearly two decades in the force.Events in Delhi on January 26, when a tractor rally by protesting farmers took a violent turn and chaos reigned on the streets of the Capital and at the Red Fort, brought them together.The two men are now united by FIR No. 31 registered at the Mukherjee Nagar police station for one act of violence that they were allegedly part of; they have been accused of assaulting police personnel and preventing them from performing their duty.Lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail, Gurmukh Singh,80, and Jeet Singh, 70, are the oldest among the 122 people arrested by Delhi Police for the violence. Gurmukh Singh is also the oldest prisoner within the high-security jail.Tens of thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at Delhi borders for over two months, demanding a complete roll back of the three agricultural laws. The farm unions say there are more than 150,000 farmers from Punjab. Kulwant Singh Sandhu of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said several hundred army veterans are among them.When a team from HT visited the homes of the two men in Punjab on Wednesday, the families did not deny the two were part of the protest, but said they could not have attacked or stopped the police from doing their duty.“My brother has fought in the 1965 India-Pakistan war. He served the army for more than two decades. He would not have attacked men in uniform,” said Gurmukh’s younger brother Gurcharan Singh outside his house in Fatehgarh Sahib.On Saturday morning, a neighbour called one of the village elders with the news “Fauji fadya gaya (soldier has been arrested”. Gurmukh is now a local supporter of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann faction) and is known as Fauji in his Samaspur Singha village.A video clip of Fauji, who retired as a subedar naik, leading a march- past of ex-servicemen near Singhu on the Delhi border on the morning of January 26, is also being widely circulated on the WhatsApp group of the villagers.Divided neighboursSome say Gurmukh may have taken part in the rioting. Others believe the police saw him as a leader among the ex-servicemen protesting against the laws and arrested him.“He was an aggressive man for his age. Maybe this was because of his years in the army. We have been told that he fought against Pakistan and China. He joined politics and was a supporter of SAD (Maan). But considering his age, the police should have released him,” said a neighbour who did not wish to be named.Gurmukh Singh’s family members said he had left for Singhu about a month ago. He told his family he would only return once the farm laws were repealed.“A man who fought for the country is now behind bars. But we are not feeling sad or bad. This is Punjab. If one family member dies in the line of duty, arrested while protesting in this case, another will go and take his place,” his brother Gurcharan Singh said.In Sangrur district’s Khanouri Kalan village, retired lance naik Jeet Singh’s house has now become the new haunt of villagers. It is at this two-storey house that villagers come together to discuss the case of Punjab residents arrested by Delhi Police.Jeet Singh’s wife, Balbir Kaur, 65, prepares tea for the young men from the village who have been coming to her house since the news of her husband’s arrest.“I am sure, the other elderly soldier’s (Gurmukh Singh’s) wife must also be busy dealing with such charged-up youngsters at her house,” Kaur said in her kitchen on the first floor.Outside the kitchen, a group of young men have gathered and are standing on the stairs. They claim they are here to tell Kaur that they are proud of her husband and would willingly join the protesters.‘Travesty’Jeet Singh’s family too heard the news of his arrest on Saturday. A jail officer called Jeet Singh’s son Veer and explained that his father had been booked .“My father served the army till his retirement in 1989. At a time during the 80s when many (Sikh) soldiers had deserted the army (after Operation Bluestar in 1984), my father proudly served the country. Yes, he was there at the protest, but he could not have indulged in violence,” said Veer Singh, who works at the local sub-divisional magistrate’s office as a guard.Veer Singh’s friend, a clerk at the SDM’s office, who asked not to be named because he is a government official, said: “ We are ready. We will work for the Punjab government from Monday to Friday. But weekends will be spent in Delhi.”On Wednesday afternoon, the villagers held a panchayat to encourage more young people to join their elders in the protests on the Delhi borders.Advocate Amar Veer Bhulkar, one of the lawyers who visited Tihar jail to meet the arrested protesters and is helping them fight the cases pro bono, said: “Two elderly men aged 80 and 70, who may physically not be able to assault anyone and yet (being) behind bars for alleged assault, is a travesty of justice. We have formed a team of lawyers in each district and will fight their cases right till the end.”Deputy commissioner of police (north west) Urvija Goel did not respond to requests for comment.The two families are not worried about the police case. They say they will join the other farmers at Singhu this weekend and won’t return until the government repeals the three laws.But one thing upsets them. Veer Singh said: “Our fathers fought for this country in their youth. The government disrespected them by putting such veterans in jail. This doesn’t hurt much. We are a race of fighters but when the media calls us Khalistanis and terrorists, imagine the feeling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/january-26-violence-soldiers-farmers-and-now-suspects-101612468519089.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||Green push: Delhi govt to lease only e-vehicles||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced that his government will, in the next six months, change its policy to lease only electric cars as part of an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric cars in the Capital.Kejriwal made the announcement at the launch of a new campaign -- Switch Delhi -- to spread awareness about the subsidies provided by the city administration on electric vehicles (EVs). The Delhi government currently leases more than 1,000 cars.Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said vehicles are one of the main contributors of air pollution in the national Capital, which suffers from a chronic bad air problem. The Delhi EV policy, announced in August last year, envisages that 25% of all new vehicle registrations should be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) by 2024.“We have to make EVs a jan andolan (mass movement) now. So, we are launching the Switch Delhi campaign today to create awareness about EVs. The idea is to convince people to switch from their current vehicles to EVs, which have zero emissions. I also urge the youth, who are looking to buy their first car or bike, to go for an EV as the Delhi government is giving huge subsidies and there is no road tax or registration charges,” Kejriwal added.The subsidies are based on battery capacity – ₹10,000 per kWh to the first 1,000 e-cars or electric four wheelers, with a cap of ₹150,000 per vehicle. Of the over 6,000 EVs (that include e-rickshaws, two-wheelers and cars) registered in the city since the policy was announced last year, only 2,653 have received the subsidies so far, data seen by HT showed. This data did not specify how many subsidies went to electric cars, but officials familiar with the matter said, “Due to the high cost involved, electric cars constitute the least of all EV sales in the city, and so, a significant proportion of subsidy on cars remains unused.”The government also announced a subsidy of ₹5,000 per kWh of the battery capacity up to a maximum of ₹30,000 for purchases of electric two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, rickshaws and freight vehicles. The government also announced a scrapping incentive for those who make the switch -- essentially paying them for their old vehicles. The incentive, ranging from ₹5,000- ₹7,500, is offered subject to evidence of matching contribution from the dealer or (Original Equipment Manufacturer) as per the policy.The chief minister also announced that the government will soon ask for bids to set up 100 charging stations across Delhi.The Capital currently has 72 charging stations that are managed by the government, civic bodies and private power distribution companies.A senior transport department official said that a centralised tendering system will be adopted to hire an energy operator to run, maintain and upgrade charging stations. “Land-owning agencies will be required to provide land for the installation of public EV charging stations,” the official added.Kejriwal urged companies having a large fleet of vehicles to shift to EVs. “I request resident welfare associations (RWAs), market associations and delivery fleets to participate in the campaign to promote the use of EVs and switch to such vehicles. The Switch Delhi campaign also seeks to convince companies, malls, cinema halls, restaurants... to get charging stations installed,” he said.Kejriwal said around 6,000 EVs have been bought in Delhi since the city’s EV policy was announced. Thus far, the government has paid out ₹9 crore in subsidies.On August 7 last year, Kejriwal announced the Delhi EV Policy 2020, with a focus on increasing the adoption of electric vehicles by incentivising the purchase of EVs. The target was to register 500,000 EVs in the city by 2024. Currently, around 122,000 electric vehicles are registered in the Capital, of which the majority are e-rickshaws.There are 150 models of EVs available in Delhi, with the least expensive car starting at a price of around ₹900,000.“This zero emissions mandate is needed to cut air pollution... But firm milestones are needed for time bound implementation. This move is an important message for green recovery post pandemic,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/green-push-delhi-govt-to-lease-only-evehicles-101612468182551.html
05-02-2021||Chandigarh||J&K’s Reasi to get the world’s tallest bridge in March||Two engineering marvels — the world’s tallest railway bridge over Chenab River in Kouri area and India’s first cable-stayed rail bridge — are coming up in Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir. While the bridge over Chenab will be ready by March, the rail bridge will come up in December 2022. The Konkan Railway Corporation Limited (KRCL) is building the Chenab bridge over a challenging 111km-stretch under the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) project. The bridges will connect the Valley with the rest of the country through railways. The project is being built at a cost of ₹27,949. An official of the Northern Railways, requesting anonymity, said, “Covering a stretch of around 111km in Jammu’s Katra-Banihal section, the bridge is being constructed 359m above Chenab’s river bed. It will be 35m higher than the Eiffel Tower (324m).” The length of the Chenab bridge will be 1,315 metres with 17 spans, of which the span of the main arch across Chenab river will be 467m. The viaduct portion comprises a straight and curved portion. The curvilinear portion is located on a 2.74-degree sharp curve. “For the first time in India, continuous welded girder steel has been used in the curvature.For construction of the arch of the bridge, a novel method of construction, which used a cable car, has been designed and commissioned. Two cable cars with a capacity of 20 metric ton each and 37 metric tons in tandem run on the 54 mm cables laid across the river valley and are connected through a 127m high pylon (tower) on Kauri-end and a 105m pylon on Bakkal-end of the river. Both pylons are 927m apart,” said the official. Around 27,051 metric tonnes structural steel has been used to build the bridge. “The launching of the main arch is a noteworthy endeavour as it entails carrying heavy segments (up to 32 metric ton) from the Srinagar-end of the workshop with the help of the world’s longest cable crane arrangement and executing work from both ends (Bakkal and Kauri).” “So far, around 90% of the main arch has been built. Of 550m, only 58m is left and we are confident of completing this engineering marvel by March this year,” the official said. The bridge has also been designed to deter terror activities in consultation with the defence research and development organisation (DRDO). All geological challenges have been successfully negotiated. Anji Bridge The Anji Bridge will be the country’s first cable-stayed bridge.It is around 80km from Jammu. The bridge posed a considerable challenge to engineers. In view of site conditions, the bridge has been divided into three parts — a 120m-long approach viaduct (called ancillary viaduct) on Reasi side, main bridge, crossing the deep valley (473.25m cable-stayed portion) and central embankment (94.25m), located between the main bridge and an approach (ancillary) viaduct. Anji Bridge has a single main pylon at a height of 193m from the top of foundation. It stands at a height of 331m above the river bed. The total length of bridge is 687m. It comprises a main bridge with a length of 473.25m. It will be an asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge balanced on the axis of a central pylon. The deck width of the bridge is 15m. The Anji Khad Bridge has support of 96 cables and has a cable length varying from 82m to 295m. Micro piles of 40m depth around the circumference of the 20 metre hybrid well foundation was used in the main pylon construction. The Anji Bridge has been designed to handle heavy storms and strong winds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jks-reasi-to-get-the-world-s-tallest-bridge-in-march-101612467433522.html
05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chitkara International School launches multilingual communication system||Chitkara International School introduced multilingual audio circulars, called “Chitkara Infobytes”, last week. The inclusion of Hindi and Punjabi narrations within the school’s communication system is expected to overcome language barriers and allow easy flow of information among the school’s stakeholders. With this initiative, the school aims to bring a change to the communication mechanism of schools in North India which continue to be highly English-centric. The step is also believed to improve the reach, receptiveness, and impact of the school’s interaction with the community at large.Drawing inspiration from Chitkara University’s content and language integrated lab (CLIL), the school is focusing on promoting linguistic diversity and equitable education for all. With Chitkara Infobyte, the school has reinforced the university’s mission of reducing and limiting communication gaps. Further considering it to be a takeaway of the recently-announced National Education Policy, the school is set to fulfill the policy’s goal of promoting multilingualism along with the sustainable development goal related to quality, inclusive and equitable education for all. Principal Niyati Chitkara said, “Chitkara Infobyte caters to the varying linguistic needs of our stakeholders and thus, stands as an aspiration-turned-inspiration for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chitkara-international-school-launches-multilingual-communication-system-101612467434120.html
05-02-2021||Other||Patwari office in Ambala Cantt cries for attention||The patwari office in Ambala’s Cantonment area is in a shambles with labourers taking over the vacant rooms, stray animals occupying the open spaces and unkempt trees growing all over the walls at this 100-year-old British-era building. Surrounded by modern eateries and shops, with an upcoming football stadium just a stone’s throw away, this building in Haryana home minister Anil Vij’s hometown craves for a makeover. The place is now office to nine patwaris of the constituency and is regularly visited by locals as nearly five villages comes under a patwari. While most of the patwaris were not ready to speak, one of them, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We have already spoken several times to almost everybody, but no one cares. Many reporters visited this place when a roof collapsed on the entry and next to my room. Thankfully, no one was hurt.”A retired patwari, Dal Singh Rana, who has worked almost for a decade here, said that every local has to visit a patwari at least once in his lifetime. “As the president of the patwari kanungo association, we’ve taken forward our requests for maintenance to the higher authorities, but there has been no redressal yet. There is no facility for toilets and even the public has to urinate in open,” he said. Swaraj Singh, a farmer from Machhonda village, who came for some paperwork at the office, said, “I’m afraid that building could collapse anytime. People like me have to visit this place frequently for our land issues.”Built in 1926, the land was part of Behari Lal Trust and had a dharamshala at this space till it was taken over by the administration after a legal battle, locals privy with the details said. Former councillor Omkar Pruthi said, “The building should be repaired or the officials could be shifted to another building urgently because any mishap can happen here. Hundreds of locals spend hours here daily and the condition of the building is pathetic.”While secretary of the Ambala Sadar municipal council, Rajesh Kumar, said that he’ll forward any demand for maintenance to the department concerned, DC Ashok Kumar Sharma said, “The issue is already in my notice. We’re analysing if the patwaris could be shifted to the new secretariat building nearby, or else we’ll start the maintenance work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patwari-office-in-ambala-cantt-cries-for-attention-101612467311306.html
05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh has low vaccination coverage, high Covid-19 positivity rate: Centre||Latest Covid-19 statistics paint a negative picture for the UT administration, as Chandigarh has been placed in the league of states and UTs where vaccination coverage is less than 30% and weekly Covid positivity rate is higher than the national average.According to the figures released by the Union health ministry on Thursday, only 22.5% vaccination coverage has taken place in Chandigarh so far, while positive cases versus tests carried out in the week gone by are 2.1% against the national average of 1.8%.“We are conducting almost 35,000 Covid-19 tests in a month, which has brought down the positivity rate from 20% last year to 2% now. We are satisfied with the testing as infection rate has gone down substantially,” Dr Amandeep Kang, director of health services, Chandigarh said.In all, so far over 2,20,000 tests have been conducted in Chandigarh and over 21,000 people have tested positive for the infection.‘Hesitancy remains’On the poor vaccination coverage, UT health secretary Arun Gupta said, “The respective departments are trying their best to educate and cover all beneficiaries, but reluctance among workers remains.”Officials working on the ground said despite a number of steps taken by the authorities, including counselling sessions and discussions to counter hesitancy among workers, most were not willing to be vaccinated.“We have started long-term counselling sessions for the health workers and are utilising all resources to encourage them to take the jab. The department heads are meeting every employee to come forward,” said Dr Kang.According to Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the community medicine department at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, reluctance about new vaccines has always been a problem and correct information and long-term counselling are the possible ways out.“As threat perception regarding Covid has decreased, low turnout for vaccines may be its fallout. We surely need a better communication strategy to motivate the beneficiaries to take the shot. As time passes, more people will come forward,” Dr Kumar added. Below 40% turnout for second day in a rowLess than 40% of the targeted beneficiaries turned up for Covid-19 vaccine for the second consecutive day on Thursday, even as vaccination sessions have been started for the frontline workers from the municipal corporation (MC) and police department.Against the target of 1,002, only 383 people (38.2%) were inoculated on Thursday. Among them, 344 were health professionals, 20 police employees and 19 from MC. On Wednesday, against the 1,004 people expected, only 314 (31%) were vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-has-low-vaccination-coverage-high-covid-19-positivity-rate-centre-101612467082002.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 157km of roads to be repaired in 2021-22, down from 289km last year||While the budgetary allocation for the road department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has remained almost the same in 2021-22 budget compared to the ongoing fiscal, the BMC has reduced its road improvement and repair targets by almost 45% this year. The BMC maintains around 2,055km of roads in the city, and every major and minor road is repaired or resurfaced using asphalt or concrete cement from the existing paverblocks. According to estimates presented in the budget on Wednesday, the BMC proposes to improve road network of 157km in the city and suburbs during 2021-22, which is less than the target of 289km set in 2020-21. In 2018-19, the BMC improved about 134km of road network, compared to 162km in 2019-20. As of December 2020, 123km of road network has already been repaired or improved. Prominent roads that were repaired are New Prabhadevi Road, Sagbaug Road in Andheri, LIC road in Borivli, Lake Road and Nrityanjali Road in Bhandup, Tribhuvan Road in Grant Road and road no. 25 in Sion. In 2021-22 while presenting the budget, the BMC proposed 157km of roads should be improved, of which 145km will be using cement and 12km asphalt. These roads include CP Tank Road near Marine Lines, Kallbadevi Road, stretches of Link Road, SV Road in western suburbs, Sion Pumping station road, St Anthony Road, Chembur etc. The roads and traffic department was allocated ₹2,279 crore in the ongoing fiscal of 2020-21, which came down to ₹2,231 crore in 2021-22. With the allocation coming down marginally, the number of roads to be taken for repair and improving also has gone down. The bridges department has got more attention owing to structural repairs proposed. The allocation was above ₹1,100 crore in 2020-21, compared to ₹2,200 crore in 2021-22. Rajendra Talkar, chief engineer of road department, said, “We have ongoing works that were stuck earlier and we are looking to complete them in the coming days. There is nothing like we doing less work, but we are just finishing all pending work, and have also proposed new work also.” Ravi Raja, Congress Corporator and leader of Opposition said, “The targets set by the BMC are always estimated, and there is a possibility of not meeting it exactly. The BMC should have realistic targets that can be completed.” Nikhil Desai, civic activist from Matunga, said, “We want to make Mumbai international financial hub and smart city, but we don’t give our citizens good roads. The BMC is maintaining around 2,000km of road network, and if they do their work diligently, Mumbai’s roads will last longer. But here our road repair work is done at a snail’s pace, and the quality is also poor.” P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner, said, “I do not know about the length going down, but we have increased our capital expenditure on road projects by around ₹250 crore. Our focus will be concretisation of roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-157km-of-roads-to-be-repaired-in-2021-22-down-from-289km-last-year-101612466951527.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Nana Patole resigns as Maharashtra speaker, to be state Congress chief||Nana Patole, Congress leader and legislator from Sakoli constituency in Vidarbha, on Thursday resigned as the Maharashtra Assembly speaker and is expected to be appointed the state’s Congress unit chief soon. The development, however, may lead to friction within the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition as Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said the three ruling parties — the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — will collectively decide on the new speaker. The development also means there will be an election for the post of speaker, which will turn into sort of a floor test in the Assembly for the three-party coalition. Patole, 56, handed over his resignation to deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal at the central hall of Vidhan Bhavan on Thursday evening. Before that, he met former party president Rahul Gandhi and other key leaders in Delhi on Wednesday. The party leadership spoke to the heads of Sena and NCP as the replacement of the speaker has to be dealt with by the ruling alliance. Congress is also expected to replace five working presidents as most of the incumbent working presidents have been accommodated in the state cabinet.“I have resigned from the post as per instructions from the party leadership. I am not aware about any changes in the responsibilities of working presidents,” Patole said.Patole hails from Vidarbha and has influence in the peasant Kunbi community. In several parts of the region, the community supported Congress in the 2019 Assembly elections. Patole began as a Congress leader, but then shifted to the BJP. He was elected as BJP MP in 2014 from the Bhandara-Gondia constituency, but later in December 2017, quit the party after criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and returned to the Congress. He was elected to the state Assembly in 2019 and was made speaker when the MVA formed the government.Patole’s resignation has necessitated election for the post of speaker. The three-party coalition which has clear majority in the 288-member Assembly will have to ensure that none of its MLAs vote against its candidate. If that happens, there would be questions raised over the stability of the government. Opposition BJP has been insisting that the MVA government will fall due to internal contradictions. Observers feel that there could be bargaining within the MVA for the post in exchange for ministerial berths. Though there are reports that Congress demanded the post of deputy chief minister, Pawar vehemently rubbished them. “We have been informed about the internal changes in the responsibilities in Congress. After Patole’s resignation, the post has fallen vacant and three parties will collectively take decision over new speaker,” he said in Delhi.“Pawar has not clearly said that his party may claim the post, but by keeping it in limbo, he wants to assert his authority in decision-making in MVA. It is obvious that there could not be an appointment of the new speaker without taking him into confidence and at that time, Pawar may have his choice on the name of the speaker, even though he/she is from the Congress. He would not want someone like Prithviraj Chavan to become next speaker,” said political analyst Hemant Desai.The Congress leadership had begun the process of changing state leadership last month by speaking to legislators and key leaders in the state. Incumbent president Balasaheb Thorat holds three key positions, including revenue minister and party’s legislative leader. Besides Patole, Rajya Sabha MP and All India Congress Committee’s Gujarat in-charge Rajiv Satav and relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar were in the race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nana-patole-resigns-as-maharashtra-speaker-to-be-state-congress-chief-101612466651306.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Government authorities should be secular with work: Bombay HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) observed that government authorities including police are expected to work with a secular mind and avoid a general fear of inviting trouble if the case involves religious feelings. The court also directed the police to register offence against trustees of Jagadamba Devi Charitable Trust, Mohota in Ahmednagar for illegal acts that fall under the Black Magic Act.The trustees had allegedly buried around two kilograms of gold in the name of Suvarna Yantras since 2011 and had misappropriated at least ₹25 lakh for performing related ceremonies. On February 3, a division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar while hearing a petition filed by social activist and former trustee Namdev Sahebrao Garad, 52, was informed by advocate AS Kale that the petition sought registration of a first information report (FIR) against persons on the trust for alleged misappropriation of precious metals and funds under the garb of performing religious rituals. The petition sought to excavate the precious metals buried under the idols of goddesses at the temple to check their purity. It also urged the court to direct the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the alleged offences by the trustees and monitor the same. It also sought records and audit reports of the trust between 2009 and 2019. Kale further submitted that the petition by Garad also mentioned a police complaint registered in 2017 by Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (ANS) over alleged illegal activity by the trust and stated that no action was initiated by the police. Senior counsel Rajendra Deshmukh for the temple trust, however, refuted the claims and said these were false allegations against the management. He said the management had earlier conducted an inquiry after complaints from Garad, but it was rejected. Since then Garad was resorting to pressure tactics, he said and urged the court to dismiss the petition.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that it was surprising that even the district judge, who was a member of the trust, accepted the proposals to construct structures for the ceremony involving burying of Suvarna Yantras. The court stated, “These days, complaints are received against many managements that they are not properly managing the trust and are spending the money and are disposing of the property of the trust illegally.” Referring to the instant case the court held that the activities of the trustees certainly fell under the prohibited acts mentioned under the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013, and the same was not permitted by the Maharashtra Public Trust Act. The court then chided the authorities saying, “The record of so-called inquiry made by the clerical staff of the trust office, inaction on the part of deputy charity commissioner in the case, show of inquiry made by police into the matter show the authorities have no courage to take action even when such serious thing has happened.” Citing the general fear in the minds of authorities which led them to avoid taking steps, the court held, “The general fear may be of different kinds, like the possibility that they may invite trouble as the matter involves religious feelings and it can be viewed as an act against God. In view of Article 51-A of the Constitution of India, this court holds that the authorities are expected to work with a secular mind in such cases and they need to adhere to the truth.” Suggesting that the authority needed to have a scientific approach in such matters and adhere to the provisions of law, the court said the authority could not accept religious propositions like the one made in the present matter. While disposing of the petition, the court directed the police to register an FIR based on the complaint made by ANS and directed that the investigation under additional or deputy superintendent of police be completed within six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/government-authorities-should-be-secular-with-work-bombay-hc-101612466412680.html
05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Bird flu: Chicken price rises in Chandigarh as normal demand resumes||With no case of avian influenza getting detected in the city and people resuming their consumption of poultry items, the price of chicken products has started to rise in market. And, with a shortage in supply owing to culling operations in the poultry farms of the region, it is expected that prices can further soar.Confirming that a rise in price is on the cards, president of the Sector 21 Meat Market Association, Ashish Kumar, said, “The price of broiler had fallen down to ₹150 per kg and it has shot up to ₹180 per kg in just about two days. There is a shortage from the back-end, and within a day or two, the prices can rise even higher.”Prices of broiler meat in other retail shops has gone even higher. At Chawla’s Chicken in Sector 46, the rate of broiler meat had gone as high as ₹230 per kg and as per the staff, it is on the lines of what the price was in December. “The demand for chicken products is going up, but it is still not as high as it was before the bird flu,” said Ravinder Kumar, manager of King Broilers in Sector 46.The price for eggs, however, remains mostly unchanged as confirmed by Sector 21 Meat Market president. Nitish Singla, the proprietor of a grocery store in Sector 48, said, “The demand for eggs still hasn’t picked up with the grocery stores so a tray of 30 eggs still costs ₹150, which was over ₹180 before bird flu was confirmed in the region. A rise in price can be expected but in a few days, not immediately.”Saying that people had started ordering chicken dishes in restaurants again, the city head of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI)’s Chandigarh chapter, Sunveer Sondhi said, “Bird flu was more of a mental block with people, and once people realised that eating cooked chicken dishes is safe, our sale picked up.” He added that restaurants are still taking extra care and cooking chicken dishes at a temperature higher than 100 degrees for the safety of the customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bird-flu-chicken-price-rises-in-chandigarh-as-normal-demand-resumes-101612466411629.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: One city, one body must for growth, revenue?||Making the civic body the single planning authority for Mumbai – a proposal sent by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to the Maharashtra government – could impact redevelopment of buildings, vertical and infrastructure development, while bringing in considerable revenue to the civic body, according to urban planning experts. If approved by the state, it could change the face of development in parts of Mumbai, such as Andheri (East), Goregaon and parts of east coast, Chembur and Charkop, among others. The proposal was mentioned in the budget presented BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday. Currently, the city has multiple planning authorities such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and BPT. There are many pockets in Mumbai where the BMC is not the planning authority. For example, the MMRDA is the planning authority for parts of Bandra Reclamation, Bandra-Kurla Complex and Nariman Point; many areas along the east coast of Mumbai are with Mumbai Port Trust, the Andheri East area is in the possession of MIDC, SRA is the planning authority for all slums in the city from Dahisar to Colaba, and there are 156 layouts of Mhada across the city. These authorities have to be approached for construction permits in these areas. Moreover, premiums and construction charges are paid to these authorities, at the time of new constructions or redevelopment. BMC’s Development Control and Promotion Regulations 2034 do not apply to these areas. Effectively, the Floor space Index (FSI) that these buildings can avail differs, and the mandatory open space requirement of a plot, at the time of construction, also differs. However, the BMC provides all civic amenities such as water supply, sewerage lines, roads, and fire no-objection certificate to buildings in these areas. Hussain Indorewala, assistant professor with Kamla Raheja Architecture Institute, said, “If Mhada is doing a redevelopment in its area, then BMC does not benefit from the premiums from construction, and other charges. But it is providing civic amenities, so perhaps the BMC is thinking that it should benefit financially as well. If you look at the DCPR, many parts of Mumbai were not included, as the planning authority for these regions rested with different bodies. So it will make planning more accountable, but the BMC seems to be thinking of this as means of raising revenue.”Indorewala added, “This means, when plans for infrastructure development and land use are being made in the city, the civic body will be able to plan land use and prescribe development regulations for the entire city. How this will translate on the field, in terms of details like transit-oriented development, remains to be seen. As execution of projects is likely to remain with the respective bodies, we can’t say the BMC won’t need to communicate with any bodies at all, if it becomes the singular planning authority.”Vilas Nagalkar, a senior city-based architect, said, “For example, the Oshiwara Business District had a higher FSI, meaning buildings in this area could be taller than buildings in the rest of Mumbai. After the DCPR 2034 was finalised, the BMC began to give higher FSI to commercial establishments, and the difference in FSI has now almost been neutralised, only now.” Moreover, bringing construction permits under one roof for all areas in the city will also impact the BMC’s rank in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business, according to experts. Shirish Sukhatme, a senior city-based architect, said, “Many construction permits are delayed as their processes are not streamlined. We have projects that are stuck for three plus years because of delay in coordination between the respective planning bodies while giving us permits.”Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap said, “The Congress is opposed to the idea of making the BMC the single planning authority in the city. Other agencies such as the MMRDA and Mhada have also significantly contributed to the development of the city and their rights should not be taken away. If they are not doing a good job, they should be improved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaione-city-one-body-must-for-growth-revenue-101612466292047.html

Around 57% of the 20,934 surveyed travellers said they preferred to return to a place they have already explored while 49% are aiming to hit a new destination within India. The survey also revealed that 52% Indian travellers plan to travel within the country in the next seven to 12 months. Commenting on the study, Ritu Mehrotra, regional manager, South Asia at Booking.com, said, “While it will be some time before travel returns to pre-pandemic levels, all signs point to the fundamental and enduring role that travel plays in all our lives. Looking ahead, staying closer to home and becoming familiarists rather than tourists will continue to be at the forefront of travel agendas. Rediscovering India and travelling like a local is what 2021 is going to be about.” According to the survey, Srinagar, Digha, Manali, Goa and Alibag are some of the top trending destinations for Indians travelling from February 1 to February 28, with a surge in staycations to nearby destinations. “The popularity of holidaying with pets, travelling with furry companions has been top of traveller’s minds in recent months, with the use of Booking.com’s pet-friendly filter more than doubling since travel restrictions began. With no sign of slowing down, the trend to travel with pets is one that we are likely to see continue throughout 2021 and beyond,” read a statement on the portal. The survey also found that 25% Indian travellers intend to travel outside the continent by the end this year, as opposed 12% respondents in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/most-travellers-prefer-travelling-to-familiar-spots-in-2021-finds-survey-101612466171197.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Reconstituted parking authority makes a comeback in Mumbai civic body budget||The Mumbai parking authority (MPA), the apex independent body that will be formed as per the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (2034), to regulate the street and off-street parking in space-starved Mumbai, has yet again found a special mention in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) budget 2021, presented by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday. The roads and traffic department has been allotted ₹1,600 crore in the budget 2021. The MPA will utilise funds from this budget head.The MPA was reconstituted in January this year. BMC has appointed Tata Insitute of Social Sciences (TISS), as the agency from where urban planners, traffic planners, urban designers, and geographic information system (GIS) designers are being roped in, to help with MPA’s work. The first meeting of the body, after it was reconstituted, took place on January 18.A senior civic officer from BMC’s traffic department said, “The body has not yet been legally formed. We have sought legal opinion about it. Presently, it has been given the timeline of one year to complete tasks at hand, which include ward-wise survey and GIS mapping of street and off-street parking and formulation of the parking policy, fee structure, among other things.”Since many stakeholders will be involved in the working of the MPA, including BMC, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), private bus operators, Regional Transport Office (RTO), Mumbai Police, and traffic police, the civic body is examining how to make the MPA a legally strong body. The MPA will bring all these stakeholders together. In the coming year, BMC will decide on the legal structure of the body. It may set up the MPA under the BMC Act by making amendments to the Act. All functions of parking within the city implemented by different authorities are proposed to be merged into MPA. Personnel from other departments will work on deputation in MPA to carry out its functions.An expert associated with the MPA said, “So far, a lot of work has already been done by MPA, which will be carried forward. For example, we were in talking with residential complexes to use their parking spaces on a paid basis. A lot has changed during the work from home scenario. Now, residential complexes may not have as much parking space, but commercial complexes will. So we are fine-tuning these details.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reconstituted-parking-authority-makes-a-comeback-in-mumbai-civic-body-budget-101612466051675.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court rejects claim over Dawood Ibrahim’s benami property||Mumbai city civil court dismissed a suit filed by Ahmed Vazir Parkar claiming ownership of Parkar Chamber building in Nagpada — a property listed by law enforcement agencies as benami property held by fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar, the mastermind behind the March 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai.The building was attached by the income tax (I-T) department in December 1996 to recover tax dues to the tune of ₹40.51 crore. The demand was raised by the department for assessment year 1990-1991. It claimed that the property was one of the benami properties owned by Dawood. According to central agencies such as the I-T department and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Dawood had acquired 23 properties Mumbai in the name of his family members, relatives and associates, who did not have any independent source of income.“It was alleged that Dawood had acquired the suit property (Parkar Chamber) as a benami property in the name of his brother-in-law Ibrahim Parkar, who ran a tea stall and did not have the financial capacity to purchase the suit property,” the agencies claimed while contesting Ahmed’s claim. Ahmed had, however, raised an objection before the I-T department claiming the property was owned by his family and that they had nothing to do with Dawood or his family. According to documents furnished by him, he was the only son of his parents and had inherited the property from them. However, his claims were rejected by I-T department. Meanwhile, in 2000, Dawood was declared as a proclaimed offender for his involvement in 1993 serial bomb blasts. The government had pointed out that in 2001 the property was added in the list of Dawood’s benami properties and was set to be auctioned. Before the auction could take place, Ahmed approached the city civil court in April 2001, relying upon documents related to transfer of rights in the property from 1937 onwards, whereby the said property was given on lease to one Abdulla Burhan for 999 years by the Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay.It was claimed that the property was later transferred to Sahabzadi Anwar Jehan Begum, who transferred it to Haji Vazir Mahommed Parkar in 1951. This is how, the plaintiff claimed, the property came to be owned by his family. However, the government pointed out that he had not showed any income from the suit property in his income tax returns for assessment years 1999-2000 and 2000-2001. The court, after going through the records, observed that there was no evidence that Ahmed’s family owned the property. In fact, after perusal of the documents produced by Ahmed, the court noted that the property was given on lease as there was no document to show that it was sold or the deed of conveyance for transfer of ownership. The court noted that the document only showed transfer of leasehold rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-rejects-claim-over-dawood-ibrahim-s-benami-property-101612465873060.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body explore new sources of income||Financial reforms, exploring new avenues of income, and recovery of dues are Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) ways of moving forward in cash strapped times. Looking at the budget trends of the past few years, the expenditure of the civic body has grown drastically, in the midst of a shrinking income.BMC’s capital budget in 2021 is 71% more than the previous year. In 2018-19, BMC’s capital expenditure was ₹5,432.24 crore, which was increased to ₹10,903.58 crore in 2020-21, and to ₹18750.99 crore in 2021-22. Similarly, BMC’s revenue expenditure has also increased to ₹20,276.33 crore in 2021, from ₹19,096.74 crore in 2020. On the other hand, in the past year, BMC saw a reduction of ₹5,876.17 crore in its estimated income, and received only ₹22,572.13 crore, instead of the estimated ₹28,448.30 crore. In light of its growing expenditure, BMC budget on Wednesday said “MCGM needs huge funds in future to meet the capital expenditure. Hence, it is a necessity of the time to seek other avenues of revenue.” These include new charges for municipal services (BMC is considering levying these charges and has not finalised it), financial reforms to make Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) more viable and creating a separate fee regulatory authority for timely revision of municipal taxes. BMC is also hopeful of recovering decade-old loans from state government and its various bodies.BMC is now looking at revising its scrutiny fee from the fire safety point of view and levying fire service fee, which will generate an estimated revenue of ₹140 crore and ₹20 crore respectively. Scrutiny fee will be levied for granting permission for providing fire and life safety measures in buildings, as per the Development Control and Promotion Regulation 2034, on the built-up area of the building. Considering the increase in the capital values of buildings, this fee will be revised. A fire service fee will be applicable for granting a no-objection certificate from the Mumbai fire brigade.BMC will also hire a consultant for financial reforms in BEST undertaking, to make public transport more viable, and revive the organization financially. This year, BMC has given BEST financial aid of ₹750 crore, and an additional ₹406 crore to pay pending gratuity of 3646 employees. In 2020-21, BMC had given financial aid amounting to ₹918 crore to BEST.BMC will also form a fee revision authority, an independent body for timely revision of all municipal charges and taxes. Municipal commissioner IS Chahal said on Wednesday, “We are loosing on a lot of revenue as municipal taxes and fees are not revised as per the requirement of the time. It becomes difficult sometimes, for elected bodies to take timely decisions about such revision. Along the lines of (Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission) MERC for electricity, BMC too needs to have a body that will take care of timely tax revision, that is binding on BMC.”Among expected revenue income, BMC is hoping to recover ₹1,600 crore from Slum Rehabilitation Authority, pending since 2008-09, as land premium and infrastructure development charges.The Maharashtra government also owes the civic body ₹5,274.16 crore, towards pending property tax dues, water charges and sewerage charges, and includes ₹3,629.83 crore as grant in aid from the education department. Chahal said, “We have been routinely following up with the state government and have received assurance that this money will be given to BMC soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-explore-new-sources-of-income-101612465871627.html

Modi is a prime accused in the case.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the money laundering case, claimed that Modi has diverted around ₹1,201.18 crore (USD 175.1 million) through Purvi. The agency had made Purvi and Maiank accused in the case and sought to issue NBWs against the two. The couple moved the special PMLA court for cancellation of the warrants against them on the grounds that they have now become approvers in the case.The court has asked ED to reply to their plea by February 11.ED, in its charge sheet, claimed that Purvi was an active participant in the generation of proceeds of crime and the activity of money laundering. It further claimed that Purvi was a director in Dubai and Hongkong-based companies which received funds obtained through letters of understandings issued by PNB in favour of Modi’s firms.Purvi has, however, maintained that she had no knowledge of the transactions. In a response filed before the designated court which is hearing ED’s plea for confiscation of Modi’s properties, she claimed she had nothing to do with the alleged proceeds of crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-nirav-modi-s-sister-brother-in-law-move-court-to-dismiss-nbws-101612465571694.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Delay in first-year law admissions after errors in seat allotment list||The state common entrance test (CET) cell on Thursday postponed the announcement of first seat allotment list for five-year Bachelor of Law (LLB) aspirants by a day after it received complaints of errors in students information. The CET cell has sought help from a third party, who audited the information shared by students at the time of registration. A new list will be released on February 6, said, officials. “The IT firm working with us to conduct admissions to law courses, both three years and five years, had stored all information of candidates based on the information shared at the time of registration. However, there were complaints of students’ information either going missing from the final form or showing wrong information, due to which we had to delay the seat allotment list by a day,” said a senior official from the state CET cell. He added that errors were rectified on Thursday and a fresh list for LLB (five-year law course) will be uploaded on CET website on Saturday morning. Work on LLB (three-year course) candidate information is still in process, and the seat allotment list will be released soon, said officials. Admissions to most professional courses were delayed by a few months this year, first due to the lockdown and then due to a petition filed in the Bombay high court for clarity on the status of the Maratha quota. In December, the registration process for most professional courses including law, engineering, architecture and pharmacy had to be delayed by a few weeks to give students time to make necessary changes to their admission form after the state government decided to continue admissions without the inclusion of the SEBC quota. “The state government is talking about bringing students back to college starting February 15, but are ignoring gross problems in the admissions process. The academic year is almost coming to an end, and CET cell has still not managed to start the seat allocation process for law. This is unacceptable,” said Sachin Pawar, president of the Student Law Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-delay-in-first-year-law-admissions-after-errors-in-seat-allotment-list-101612465391230.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: WR to install recording system to monitor local train crew||In a bid to increase safety of commuters travelling by the suburban railway network on the Western Railway (WR), crew voice and video recording systems will be introduced in the suburban local trains. The system will be installed in the cabins of motorman and guards with one camera installed inside cabins and one outside. Audio recording devices will also be placed inside both the motorman and guard’s cabin.The system will be placed in 110 trains. With this move, the zonal railway aims to scrutinise the operation of local trains. The system will monitor the actions taken by the motormen and guard including operations of train at speed restrictions, signal passed at danger (SPAD) when railway signals are red indicating a local train ahead, and also railway accidents.The ₹2.8-crore project has been approved by the railway ministry and has also been included in the Union budget 2021-2022. The Union budget has included installation and commissioning of video and crew voice recording system in driving cabs of electrical multiple unit (EMU) local trains. “The move will improve safety of passengers travelling by local trains and also let us inspect the local train while in motion,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, WR. Earlier, both the WR and Central Railway had held counselling sessions for motormen regarding safe operations of local train services. The sessions were operated after incident of SPAD occurred on the railway tracks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-wr-to-install-recording-system-to-monitor-local-train-crew-101612465332299.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||60,000 kids in Mumbai still don’t have access to online learning: Data||After 10 months since schools in the city closed, over 60,000 students across the city still do not have access to online education, data shared by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) education department has revealed. The data, which consists of details concerning BMC schools along with primary aided and unaided schools that function under the civic body’s jurisdiction, reveals that 50% students who are unable to join online classes do not have Android mobile phones. Over 20,000-odd students, despite having smartphones, are unable to join online classes as they cannot afford internet. Details obtained by BMC also revealed that till February 1, more than 37,000 students had reportedly migrated from the city, of which nearly 40% were not connected to online learning. Mahesh Palkar, education officer, BMC, said while teachers have been flexible in using various online platforms like Zoom and Google Meet, some students are left out from the classes altogether. “Some say they have migrated from the city while others have reportedly stated the inability to afford a phone or a data pack. Teachers reach out to such students through phone and various personal contact initiatives of the department,” he added. The civic body had appointed Palak Mitra (friends among parents) to reach out to students who are not in the online learning mode. There are nearly 13,000 Palak Mitra appointed by the schools, who coordinate with nearby children and ensure their learning by passing on materials and instructions given by the school. Similarly, over 12,000 students are trained to be peer supporters for their classmates. In all, 1,700 students cannot be contacted in all these months, as per the civic body.With schools remaining closed for students for the past 10 months, principals are worried about the academic loss of students who are not able to access online learning. “Students from low-income families and especially those who are weak in studies are likely to suffer a lot. We are hoping that local authorities permit schools to reopen at the earliest,” said the principal of a BMC school in the eastern suburbs. A survey conducted by BMC in August 2020 found that, 15% students from BMC schools had no access to online learning. While schools across state have reopened, those in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane are yet to reopen.

05-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra governor takes jibe at MVA govt over job to Kavita Raut||Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has once again slammed the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for not providing a government job to athlete Kavita Raut, who has represented the country in the Commonwealth Games. State sports minister Sunil Kedar said they had offered her a job but she wanted one based on her qualification, for which the state will have to tweak its rules and regulations. Kedar further said that they have started the process to make the desired changes.“If the state government and sports minister Sunil Kedar are not able to provide a job to Kavita Raut, then something is wrong. What is Maharashtra government doing if there are no teachers in tribal areas and their vacant posts are not getting filled?” the governor said while inaugurating a newly constructed building of tribal cultural bhavan in Nashik on Wednesday.Raut had met the governor and informed him that she was not getting a job in Class-1 category despite an assurance from the state government. She had also said that she has been trying to get a job since 2014, but her efforts were in vain.Following this, Koshyari on November 30 last year wrote a letter to the sports minister saying Raut was eligible for Class-1 category job and that the benefit based on her qualification should be extended. “She has represented the country in the Rio Olympics in 2016 and also brought glory in the Asiad and Commonwealth Games by winning medals. She comes from a scheduled tribe community and enhanced the glory of the country at international level without any support. Considering her track record, she is eligible for a Class-1 job. She is unhappy that sportspersons even less qualified than her were extended similar benefits time and again, but she is yet to get a job despite her efforts since 2014,” states the letter.Citing that Raut was working with ONGC as a first class officer, the governor added, “Please extend the benefits by appointing her as Class-1 officer.”Raut is a long distance runner and won the bronze medal in 10,000-metre race at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, the first individual track medal by an Indian woman athlete at the Commonwealth Games. She also won the silver medal in the 10,000-metre race at the 2010 Asian Games. In 2012, she was conferred with Arjuna award, one of the most prestigious sports awards in the country.Raut was not available for a comment.The sports minister however said, “We offered her a job but she requested for another one based on her qualifications, which is not possible under existing rules and regulations for recruitment. We decided to move her proposal as a special case but was told that the rules should be equal for all the sportspersons, and thus decided to amend the rules. She will get a job of her choice once the process is completed.”This is the second incident in the past one week when Governor Koshyari chose to take on the MVA government. Last week, he had said that allowing physical classes for schools and not for colleges and universities seemed contradictory.The governor is yet to clear the 12 names recommended by the state government in November last year for appointing as the member of the legislative council under his quota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-takes-jibe-at-mva-govt-over-job-to-kavita-raut-101612465151157.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Fuel prices rise again in Mumbai: Petrol costs ₹93.20 per litre, diesel ₹83.67||Fuel prices in the city are at an all-time high with one litre of petrol costing more than ₹93 on Thursday. While one litre of petrol was available at ₹93.20, diesel was priced at ₹83.67.The increase in fuel prices comes after eight days. The prices had remained constant since January 27, when a litre of petrol was priced at ₹92.86 and diesel ₹83.30. The surge in fuel prices irked both transporters and citizens who demanded that the state look into the matter immediately and take measures to control the surge in prices. “As diesel prices continue to surge, there is a strong resentment among the transport fraternity of India and they clamour for a strong action to press for their demands. The governing council meeting will be convened this weekend and we will finalise decisions [on actions to be taken]. The budget has also failed to assuage the tattered souls of road transport sector of India which is already financially-strained post lockdown,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, core committee, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).Citizens have also demanded immediate attention of the government. “If fuel prices are not controlled, they could soon reach ₹100 in the city. Residents are already suffering with financial constraints, and rising fuel prices are increasing their burden. The government should look into the issue immediately and reduce the prices,” said Dr Charu Jain, a Byculla resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fuel-prices-rise-again-in-mumbai-petrol-costs-93-20-per-litre-diesel-8367-101612464973150.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mangrove cell to act against debris dumping in Mahul following complaints||The state mangrove cell on Thursday visited Mahul in Chembur and found evidence of destruction of mangroves on government land. The visit was sparked by complaints by environmental activists of debris dumping and illegal construction on the protected land.“Following complaints from various agencies, our team visited the Mahul site on Thursday. We found debris dumped along the border of the forest. Some temporary structures have also been set up,” said Neenu Somaraj, deputy conservator of forest (mangrove cell).Somaraj said the mangrove cell will hold a meeting with the collector, revenue officials and the state forest department. “We will soon take action on the matter. Since the land belongs to the state government, we have to discuss with all stakeholders and decide on joint action on the restoration of the mangroves and wetlands. All the debris will be removed. We are also constructing a boundary wall that will protect the mangroves from further destruction,” Somaraj added.On Wednesday, Vanashakti, a non-government organisation (NGO), wrote to the state government and the mangroves cell, highlighting ‘extensive destruction of mangroves, wetlands and buffer zones in Mahul’. Citing that Vanashakti had documented the destruction, Stalin D, founder of the NGO, said, “Close to 700 truckloads of debris and mud has been dumped on mangroves and wetlands in an area of around 10 acres or more. At some locations, the dumped material is over 15 metres high. Construction pillars are also coming up on the reclamation. Illegal road admeasuring almost half a kilometre has been made by dumping debris on Mangroves near SRA building.”Stalin has demanded that the state forest department take control of all mangroves and buffer zones in Mahul with immediate effect, in line with the Bombay High Court (HC) order.In 2005, in an interim order, the HC had directed all mangrove areas on government land to be handed over to the forest department. HC reiterated its order on September 18, 2018. However, while district bodies are yet to hand over 1,592.8-hectare area (ha), state agencies such as JNPT have failed to transfer approximately 1,147 ha to the forest department falling under their jurisdiction.In December last year, Vanashakti had issued contempt notices to all Konkan district collectors, Konkan divisional commissioner, and state agency Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) for failing to hand over mangrove land under their jurisdiction to the Maharashtra forest department. In January this year, Vanashakti filed a petition in HC seeking immediate transfer of all mangrove lands to the forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mangrove-cell-to-act-against-debris-dumping-in-mahul-following-complaints-101612464971875.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt replaces Jalyukt Shivar with 3-year water conservation scheme||After scrapping Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan — a flagship scheme of the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government for water conservation, the Maharashtra government on Thursday cleared a new water conservation programme for restoration of irrigation sources having a capacity of up to 600 hectare (ha) in the state. The three-year programme will be implemented at an expenditure of ₹1,340 crore and has been named Chief Minister Water Conservation Programme (CMWCP). The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting on Thursday.Under the scheme, the state soil and water conservation department would complete repair and restoration of 7,916 structures in the next three years till March 2023. The work includes repairing small irrigation ponds, storage ponds, old malgujari ponds, village pond, percolation tanks, earthen nala bund, cement nala bund, storage bunds, setting up a pipe distribution system on non-repaired canals etc., said a senior official from the state soil and water conservation department.“The state government is expected to restore 806,985 TCM (thousand cubic metre) water storage and irrigate 166,184 ha land with the help of the new programme,” he added.Another official, requesting anonymity, said, “It is quite different from Jalyukt Shivar due to limited scope of work. No new irrigation work would be undertaken under the programme except those related to repair of existing structures. We would be repairing all the old and damaged irrigation sources in the next few years.”As of now, the duration of the programme is being determined only for three years. The state government will review the progress and decide whether they would like to extend it or not, he added.Launched in 2014, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan was expected to help improve groundwater table and make villages water sufficient in five years. Fadnavis had also announced that Maharashtra would be made drought-free by 2019. It was a convergence of several water conservation schemes run by the state government.Last year, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government decided to discontinue the scheme over “irregularities”. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in its report tabled in the state legislature last year, pointed out deficiencies in planning and lack of provision of adequate funds for maintenance of the works, failure to achieve water neutrality in drought-prone villages and increase in ground water level as intended. After this, the state government announced a probe into the alleged irregularities in the scheme and formed a special investigation team for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-replaces-jalyukt-shivar-with-3-year-water-conservation-scheme-101612464798093.html
05-02-2021||Mumbai||Not six but 78 doctors lost their lives to Covid-19 in Maharashtra, IMA tells Centre||The Indian Medical Association (IMA), a national voluntary organisation of doctors, has said the Centre is underreporting the number of doctors who have succumbed to Covid-19. According to the Centre, six doctors died of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, but the state chapter of IMA says 78 doctors lost their lives to the infection. On February 2, minister of state for health Ashwini Kumar Choubey said in Rajya Sabha that according to the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) insurance scheme, Covid-19 had claimed the lives of 162 doctors till January 22. Of these, six are from Maharashtra. Last year in March, the Centre had announced that all healthcare workers could apply for insurance under PMGKP, which would grant claimants up to ₹50 lakh in case of death. IMA has been seeking approval for private practitioners to be considered eligible for PMGKP, but the Centre is yet to grant this. In a letter dated February 3 and addressed to Choubey, IMA said its data shows 734 doctors lost their lives to Covid-19 across the country. In Maharashtra, 78 doctors, including private practitioners, have died of Covid-19, according to IMA. The organisation has asked the Centre to constitute a high-power committee to study the data on deceased doctors. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, IMA-Maharashtra, said, “Firstly, when the national IMA sought information on doctors who died of Covid-19 infection, the Union health ministry told us they didn’t have any such data. Therefore, around three months ago, we submitted state-wise data for their consideration. The data provided in Rajya Sabha is completely incorrect,” he said. “When the pandemic started, we were threatened not to close down our clinics or our registration would be cancelled. So doctors kept screening patients even without proper personal protective equipment (PPE). Rather than honouring the deceased doctors, the government is hiding the data,” said Bhondwe. HT has reported multiple cases of families losing their sole breadwinners with the death of private practitioners who contracted Covid-19 while screening patients. At present, IMA is collecting funds through crowdsourcing and from registered doctors. “We have been able to raise a large sum with the help of our doctors and will soon disburse the money to families of the deceased doctors,” said Dr Bhondwe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/not-six-but-78-doctors-lost-their-lives-to-covid-19-in-maharashtra-ima-tells-centre-101612464797075.html

The civic body also added six new vaccination centres, which are in Kasturba Hospital, Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Shatabdi Municipal General Hospital, the jumbo Covid-19 facility in Dahisar, BARC Hospital, SK Patil Hospital, and Maa Hospital. There are now 18 vaccination centres in Mumbai. The turnout dipped to 54% on Thursday, with 4,331 beneficiaries being vaccinated against the target of 8,064. BMC said technical glitches in the Co-WIN app meant few received notifications of the trial run for frontline workers. Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said walk-in vaccination would be started soon for frontline workers to increase turnout. BMC plans to vaccinate around 180,000 frontline workers in the second phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/phase-2-58-frontline-workers-vaccinated-in-mumbai-101612464670837.html
05-02-2021||Delhi||New wall-like structure at Tikri, police reposition nails at Ghazipur||On Thursday, a new wall-like structure came up at the Tikri border protest site, where hundreds of farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws for over two months. This structure was in addition to the existing multi-layered barricading, iron nails and barbed wires that have been installed by the police over the last one week in the area.While the police called it a “second layer of protection” to prevent the entry of farmers in the national capital, the protesters termed it as another attempt to “crush their movement”.The border that connects the Capital with Haryana already has multiple layers of concrete and metal barriers along with barbed wires to stop protesters from climbing up the barricades as well as nets to protect security personnel from stone-pelting.On Thursday, labourers were seen fixing wooden planks together on jersey barriers to construct a wall-like barrier. Police have also tied nets across the streets where the security personnel are stationed. The nets have been tied under the elevated Metro line covering both sides of the road.A police officer, who wished not to be named, said the metal barricades put together, between which concrete was filled, is one barrier and this will act as a second layer of protection. Joint commissioner of police (western range) Shalini Singh said that Delhi Police was committed to the safety and security of all people. “Accordingly, measures are being taken and the situation at the border is being continuously monitored,” she said.Preet Pal Singh, a farmer from Punjab, said the government may build hundreds of walls but that will only stop them from entering Delhi, bot withdraw their demands. “They cannot deviate us from our demand. We are here for our rights and for our lives. This government will have to understand that this will not help them get the matter resolved,” he said.Earlier in the day, police repositioned the nails that were hammered into the roads at the Ghazipur border protest site to keep farmers from entering Delhi. Explaining the reason behind the relocation of nails, DCP (east) Deepak Yadav said, “The nails were fixed initially at a spot where people wouldn’t venture earlier. But now that some people are moving around that point, we fear that the nails could become a hazard for them. So, just to ensure their safety, we are removing them and fixing them elsewhere.”At the Singhu border, security remained tight with multi-layered barricading and heavy police deployment on the Delhi side. Mobile internet services continued to remain suspended in and around the protest site for the sixth consecutive day on Thursday.The crowd at the protest site remained thin throughout the day. “It’s been 72 days since we (farmers) have been fighting against the three agri laws near the Delhi borders, leaving behind our homes, family and farming. But the government is not ready to fulfill our demands and hence our agitation will continue. We have been shuttling between our homes and the protest sites. It’s an eight-day rotation policy, meaning one person gets to stay for eight days at the protest site and spend the next eight day at their home,” said Gurcharan Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Bathinda.Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait also announced “One village, one tractor, 15 people and eight days policy” at the Ghazipur border on Thursday. “We need to make sure we have enough people here all the time. We need to prepare for the long haul. At least one tractor with 15 people should be here at the protest site from every village. They will stay here for eight days and then other people from their village will replace them,” he said.Several farmers were seen discussing the ongoing controversy after American singer Rihanna and Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg tweeted supporting the ongoing farmers’ agitation. Sandeep Singh, a farmer from Meerut, said, “It’s embarrassing for the government that people from distant lands are supporting us while it (government) is not ready to listen to our demands. The government is treating us like terrorists by installing barricades and nails and expecting that none will react to this injustice.”On Thursday, local businessmen and factory owners held a meeting with farm leaders at the Singhu border and requested that they should give them space on either of the two carriageways for movement of heavy vehicles. “We will discuss the issues raised by local businessmen in our next meeting. Our agitation is not meant to create problems for the public or destroy businesses. We will certainly address their demands and do whatever is possible,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Doaba (BKU-Doaba) president Manjeet Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-wall-like-structure-at-tikri-police-reposition-nails-at-ghazipur-101612461310179.html

Of the 21 stations on the Line, trains during peak hours will skip a total of 10 stations which usually have lower ridership. This, officials said, will reduce travel time between Noida and Greater Noida by nine minutes.Ritu Maheshwari, NMRC’s managing director, said: “These trains will skip stations which have low ridership during peak hours.”According to Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC, faster metro services will be available from the Sector 51 station in Noida and the Depot station in Greater Noida from 8am to 11am, and 5pm to 8pm from Monday to Friday.Stations where the metro trains won’t stop during peak hours are Sector 50, Sector 101, Sector 81, Sector 83, Sector 143, Sector 144, Sector 145, Sector 146, Sector 147 and Sector 148 . Officials said that QR tickets will not be sold at these stations during the peak hours mentioned above.The average travel time on the Aqua Line, from Sector 51 Metro to the Depot station and vice versa, is 45 minutes 43 seconds, which will be reduced to 36 minutes 40 seconds, thereby saving commuters around nine minutes. The travel time between Sector 51 and the Pari Chowk Metro Station is presently 37 minutes, which will be brought down to 28 minutes 30 seconds from Monday.Officials said the frequency of trains from Monday to Friday will remain the same, that is, 7.5 minutes during peak hours and 10 minutes during non-peak hours. On Saturdays and Sundays, the Aqua Line trains will continue to run at a frequency of 15 minutes, skipping no stations.The highest ridership seen this year so far on the Aqua Line was on January 11, with 11,511 passengers. The average daily ridership of Aqua Line before the lockdown was induced in March 2020 was 22,758, while the average daily ridership in December 2020 stood at 7,915.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/aqua-line-metro-trains-to-skip-10-stations-from-monday-101612460411776.html
05-02-2021||Patna||Bihar plans financial inclusion of rural women by scaling up Jeevika||Bihar has taken three initiatives aimed at financial inclusion of rural women associated with over 10.30 lakh Jeevika self-help groups spread across the state – the highest in the country – in the new fiscal.Last year, Bihar became the first state in the country to cross the 10 lakh mark for self-help groups of women under Jeevika, a World Bank supported poverty alleviation programme operational in the state since 2007 to make women self-reliant.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has been keen to use Jeevika as a tool of women empowerment since he became CM in 2005.In one of the big initiatives, Jeevika SHGs have been given the contract for supplying school uniforms to students from class 1-12 in state-run schools. Bihar has nearly 1.80 crore school children. While students of classes 9-12 get ₹1000 each annually for buying uniforms, those from classes 6-8 get ₹700 each, those from classes 3-5 get ₹600 each and students of classes 1 & 2 get ₹500 each.The education department last week issued an order that the uniforms – two sets for each student - would be purchased from Jeevika SHGs and clusters of the industry department at the local level in a phased manner from the next academic session. The funds given to the students in their bank accounts through direct benefit transfer (DBT) will be used for the purpose.This will give sustainable income generating opportunity to thousands of rural women, though officials admit that handling such huge quantities on a deadline would require close monitoring.Bihar’s Jeevika was a revolutionary model for women empowerment, and it would now get further fillip with initiatives for massive financial inclusion in the government’s Seven Resolves (Part-2) programme, said Bihar rural development minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary.With inclusion of over 50% women in the Panchayati raj institutions and schools as teachers, the government hopes to make Jeevika the nucleus of rural development, and involve the SHGs in a whole range of activities, viz animal husbandry, agriculture-related activities, tailoring, mask making, banking and running small enterprises among other things.“Apart from school uniforms, the government has also decided to settle ponds in the name of Jeevika SHGs for maintenance and fishery. This is another big step not only to boost income of rural women, but to also ensure their wholesome participation in the state’s ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ campaign. The objective is to make them the engines of rural economy,” Choudhary added.The minister said the third initiative announced by the CM is to let Jeevika Didis run the kitchen for hospitals across the state and other institutions. “The orders for all the three path-breaking measures have already been issued. ‘Didi ki Rasoi’ is running at quite a few places, but it has to be scaled up to cover all hospitals and also in other institutions,” he added.Also Read: Bihar panchayat polls likely in 9-10 phases, starting mid-March; no 2 child normBihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society (BRLPS) chief executive officer (CEO) and National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) director Balamurugan D said that modalities would soon be worked out with the education department for the supply of school dress to children as it would involve close monitoring at the district, block and panchayat-level stitching units.“During the Covid-19 pandemic, we got masks made by Jeevika. We have made an assessment that there are over 25,000 ‘Didis’ with tailoring expertise. Besides, we will also use those who were involved in tailoring outside state and have returned,” he said, adding Jeevika Didis had given a good account of themselves in financial management, availing bank loans of over ₹14,000 crore.A detailed guideline regarding the supply of school uniforms would soon be issued following consultation among the education, finance, rural development and industry departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-plans-financial-inclusion-of-rural-women-by-scaling-up-jeevika-101612423939300.html
05-02-2021||World||List of countries worst hit in aviation by Covid, India 3rd in domestic traffic||The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has recently said 2020 has seen the sharpest decline in air traffic demand in aviation history. This is not surprising given that international flights remained suspended for most of the year owing to Covid-19 pandemic. But future bookings have also not gathered pace is what the association has indicated in its latest report.The global traffic demand fell 65.9 per cent in comparison to the full year of 2019. The demand for future bookings fell by 70 per cent in relation to a year ago, it said. This huge fall has put extra pressure on the cash positions of the aviation industry and has delayed the time of recovery. The air traffic demand for international travel fell 75.6 per cent vis-a-vis 2019 with cumulative domestic air traffic demand down by 48.6 per cent compared to 2019.Countries and airlines worst-hit in 2020:>The sharpest decline in the international passenger market was seen in Asia Pacific airlines. The revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) fell below 80.3 per cent in comparison to 2019, the deepest decline for any region.> North America trailed with Year on Year (YoY) decline in the air traffic demand dropping by 75.4 per cent.> European carriers were hit next with the fall in full-year traffic by 73.7 per cent. In December, it saw a slight upturn in comparison to YoY decline in November due to the holiday season but the trend was soon reversed by the end of the month.Also Read | Asia’s fragile aviation recovery suffers due to resurgence of Covid-19> In the domestic passenger traffic market, the sharpest decline was witnessed by Australia with a fall of 69.5 per cent.> After Australia comes the United States with a fall in demand by 59.6 per cent and India comes third with the domestic air traffic demand falling by 55.6 per cent.IATA has predicted 50.4 per cent improvement on the demand of last year that could bring the industry to 50.6 per cent of 2019 levels. However, the risk of serious travel restrictions due to the emergence of Covid variants can limit this improvement to just 13 per cent of 2020 levels and at 38 per cent of the 2019 levels or the pre-corona era.“Last year was a catastrophe. There is no other way to describe it. What recovery there was over the Northern hemisphere summer season stalled in autumn and the situation turned dramatically worse over the year-end holiday season, as more severe travel restrictions were imposed in the face of new outbreaks and new strains of Covid-19.” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/list-of-countries-worst-hit-in-aviation-by-covid-india-3rd-in-domestic-traffic-101612540792135.html
05-02-2021||World||Former Suu Kyi ally says no betrayal in taking Myanmar junta job||A one-time ally of Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi said on Friday that she was no traitor for accepting a ministerial post with the junta that overthrew the elected leader this week.Social welfare minister Thet Thet Khine told Reuters the new military government was inclusive and committed to democracy in one of the first interviews that any member of the new government has given since the coup on Monday."The fact the armed forces say they will continue to act according to the law, we have to welcome it gladly," she said. "I am not betraying the country."Thet Thet Khine had fallen out with Suu Kyi in 2018, long before last year's election and had described the Nobel laureate as a "control freak" whose ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party could not fix Myanmar's problems.The army overthrew Suu Kyi on Monday and detained her, drawing international condemnation that included a call from the U.N. Security Council call for the release of the Nobel Peace laureate and other detainees.In Myanmar, the coup has prompted widespread anger and Thet Thet Khine, 53, has been branded a traitor in a torrent of online criticism that has brought calls for a boycott of her jewellery company.She gave no comment when asked about working for the generals.Thet Thet Khine split with the NLD in October 2019 and started her own party, the People's Pioneer Party, which failed to win a single seat in a November election won by the NLD in a landslide. In her constituency, she won only 7% of the vote.The military says it intervened after what it said was a fraudulent election. The poll body and NLD rejected its accusations.Thet Thet Khine said the military, widely known as the Tatmadaw, was managing the country until a fair election could be held and would continue the previous government's policies."The military is doing democratic acts and the civilian government that calls itself the democratic government did undemocratic things," she said."While the Tatmadaw is forming the government, they are working with inclusiveness. They invited ethnic groups, civilians, political parties and they assigned positions to people with competency."Thet Thet Khine has defended the generals previously, dismissing accusations they orchestrated genocide against Rohingya Muslims and calling international legal action for alledged war crimes unnecessary.Thet Thet Khine, who describes herself as an advocate for democracy, has also advocated a middle path that engages with the military, which ruled Myanmar for 49 years after a 1962 coup."For the military to back off gradually from politics, we have to help. If we fight them and chase them away, the country will not be at peace," she said."This is democratisation in progress. There are unavoidable difficulties in democratisation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-suu-kyi-ally-says-no-betrayal-in-taking-myanmar-junta-job-101612545586062.html
05-02-2021||World||H-1B visas: US postpones selection process changes, rescinds speciality criteria||The United States will continue the current format for selecting petitions for H-1B visas until at least the end of the year and the agency that oversees the programme has rescinded an earlier policy that required computer programmers to produce additional proof to establish eligibility as speciality professionals.The Department of Homeland Security has announced that instead of March 9, the changes in the selection process will now go into effect on December 31.“For the upcoming H-1B cap season, USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) will apply the current regulations (random selection) to any registration period that takes place before Dec 31, 2021,” USCIS, an agency overseen by DHS, said in an announcement on Thursday.The new selection procedure would have amended the lottery system of selecting petitions and would have prioritised higher-wage positions to ensure H-1Bs were granted only to highly skilled foreign workers, not to those with basic skills brought on low wages to replace local workers.Also on Thursday, President Joe Biden announced a larger annual intake of refugees, up to a cap of 125,000, from the 15,000-limit announced by President Donald Trump for 2021. Biden’s new limit, which comes into effect in October, is nearer to the 110,000 ceiling for 2017 fixed by President Barack Obama. Trump had steadily brought it down.Indians hired by US companies and US subsidiaries of Indian firms are by far the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 issued annually. Many of them stay on, sponsored by the employers for Green Card leading up to citizenship.The Trump administration had rolled out a series of measures to reform the H-1B visas to ensure it was not used by American employers to replace American workers with foreigners on low wages, as critics of the programme had long argued.In March 2017, the Trump administration issued a policy memo that said computer programmers — or those with a basic bachelor’s degree — will no longer be presumed to qualify for H-1B. Employers will have to provide additional proof to establish the beneficiary had skills for a “speciality occupation”, as H-1Bs were meant to be used.The USCIS announced on Wednesday it was rescinding that 2017 memorandum that had rescinded a “Guidance memo on H1B computer related positions”. A response is awaited from the USCIS to a request for details on who will be impacted exactly, and how. The agency has ordered its officials to discontinue the use of the 2017 memo to adjudicate petitions. And said, “further guidance will be forthcoming”.The Wednesday memo followed a December 16, 2020 order by the ninth circuit court of appeals overturning the USCIS’s denial of H-1B in one case calling it “arbitrary and capricious”. Though in denying the application, the agency had not cited the 2017 memo, “the denial followed its logic”.The Biden administration has rescinded, reversed and withdrawn many of Trump-era immigration-related orders of the Trump administration — from the Muslim ban to the border wall. Last month, the administration withdrew a Trump administration order that rescinded work authorization for certain H-1B spouses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h1b-visas-us-postpones-selection-process-changes-rescinds-speciality-criteria-101612545449275.html

In May, it will try to land in Utopia Planitia, a plain in the northern hemisphere, and deploy a rover to explore for 90 days.If successful, the Tianwen-1 will make China the first country to orbit, land and deploy a rover in its inaugural mission to Mars, further boosting China's space credentials after it last year became the first nation to bring back samples from the moon since the 1970s.China previously made a Mars bid in 2011 with Russia, but the Russian spacecraft carrying the probe failed to exit Earth's orbit and disintegrated over the Pacific Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-releases-space-probe-s-first-image-of-mars-101612543859184.html

Two are opening in California, and Slavitt said military personnel will arrive at those centers in a little over a week.The Pentagon has scheduled a news briefing later Friday to provide more information about the military role.Slavitt said support from the military will play a critical role in supporting vaccination sites, helping administer thousands of shots a day.Currently about 6.9 million Americans have received the full two-dose regimen required to get maximum protection from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. That translates to about 2% of the U.S. population.To reach widespread or “herd” immunity — about 70% to 85% of Americans must be vaccinated. The U.S. is in a race with the virus, which is also spawning mutations that may prove resistant to vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-will-deploy-troops-to-assist-covid-19-vaccine-drive-101612543326462.html

Economists in a Bloomberg survey had predicted a drop of 40,000. That’s on top of 52,700 jobs lost in December.The unemployment rate jumped to 9.4%, versus 8.8% previously and a forecast of 8.9%.A new round of restrictions over the last couple of months in some regions -- including stay-at-home orders and curfews -- have triggered fresh lay-offs that have stalled the recovery.Friday’s report wipes out months of gains, leaving employment about 4.5% shy of February’s levels.Still, Canada’s labor market is faring better now than it did during the first wave of restrictions in March and April, when employment fell by 3 million.Hours worked increased 0.9% on the month in January. Losses were entirely in part-time positions, with full-time jobs increasing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-loses-213-000-jobs-unemployment-rate-jumps-to-94-101612535211125.html
05-02-2021||World||US transportation mask rule violation to attract penalty of up to $1,500||The US transportation security administration (TSA) on Friday announced that the violation of transportation face mask requirement will attract a penalty of $250. The agency said that the fine can increase up to $1,500 for repeat offenders. The penalty structure was announced days after the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) issued a sweeping order requiring the use of face masks on nearly all forms of public transportation.“Regarding the civil penalty fine structure for individuals who violate the Security Directive, TSA will recommend a fine ranging from $250 for the first offense up to $1,500 for repeat offenders,” the TSA said in a statement.The face mask rule issued by CDC came into force on Tuesday under which passengers are required to wear a face mask in transportation hubs as well as on many commercial and public transportation networks. The rule extends to the domestic network of airports, flights operated by domestic and foreign air carriers with inbound flights to US ports of entry, and surface transportation modes like trains and buses.Read | Is wearing one mask enough?While US airlines have already taken the initiative to ban travellers who do not follow the face mask rule, the penalties by the TSA may be in addition to those imposed by transportation operators. The agency also said that it may seek a penalty amount that falls outside the $250-$1500 range, based on substantial aggravating or mitigating factor.“TSA has provided transportation system operators specific guidance on how to report violations so that TSA may issue penalties to those who refuse to wear a face mask,” it added.According to the CDC order, face masks should cover the nose and mouth and fit snugly against the sides without leaving any gap. It also states that face shields or goggles are not an acceptable substitute to a mask and may be used in addition to an acceptable mask. Medical masks and N-95 respirators fulfil CDC and TSA’s requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-transportation-mask-rule-violation-to-attract-penalty-up-to-1500-101612539882253.html
05-02-2021||World||US trade deficit rises to 12-year high $679 billion||The US trade deficit rose 17.7% last year to $679 billion, highest since 2008, as the coronavirus disrupted global commerce and confounded President Donald Trump's attempts to rebalance America's trade with the rest of the world.The gap between the value of the goods and services the United States sells abroad and what it buys climbed from $577 billion in 2019, the Commerce Department said Friday. Exports skidded 15.7% to $2.1 trillion, and imports fell 9.5% to $2.8 trillion.As president, Trump sought to narrow the gap by imposing taxes on imported goods on a scale unseen since the trade wars of the 1930s. The deficit narrowed slightly in 2019 but then ballooned last year as coronavirus restrictions hammered US exports of services such as tourism and education. Services exports dropped 20.4% last year.Still, the US ran a $237 billion surplus last year in services. But that was overwhelmed by a $916 billion deficit in trade in goods such as aircraft and auto parts.The politically sensitive deficit with China in the sale of goods fell 10% last year to $311 billion; Trump had imposed tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese imports to protest Beijing's sharp-elbowed efforts to supplant Western dominance in technology, an effort that US alleged included cybertheft.In December, the trade deficit dropped to $66.6 billion, down 3.5% from November. Exports rose 3.4%, and imports increased 1.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-trade-deficit-rises-to-12-year-high-679-billion-101612534036050.html
05-02-2021||World||Pakistani Taliban reunified splinter groups in Afghanistan, poses threat: UN||The Pakistani Taliban has worked with al-Qaeda to reunify several splinter terror groups in Afghanistan, a development that increases the threat to the entire region, according to a new report from a UN sanctions monitoring committee.The ability of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to bring together these splinter groups, comprising mostly Pakistani fighters, has increased its strength and led to a “sharp increase in attacks in the region”, said the report from the monitoring team that helps the UN’s 1267 sanctions committee assess activities of al-Qaeda and Islamic State.The report, released this week, also highlighted the Islamic State's activities in cyberspace in South Asia, including the publishing of Voice of Hind, an online magazine in English, and efforts by the group’s members in the Maldives and Sri Lanka.According to the report, UN member states “expressed concern at the rising number of ISIL sympathizers in cyberspace in South Asia” and noted that Voice of Hind was being published regularly since it was started in early 2020. “It has followers in Maldives and Sri Lanka, with the former also highlighted by member states as an arena for recruitment and operations,” the report said.The report added that the key Islamic State operative in the Maldives, Mohamed Ameen, is trying to forge links with the Khorasan unit of Islamic State in Afghanistan. Experts believe such a connection could increase the terrorist threat for all countries in the region, including India.Ameen's efforts are “consistent with the Al-Sadiq office objective of enhancing cooperation across the region”, the report said. The “Al-Sadiq office” is an Islamic State unit covering India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Central Asian states that is led by Shahab al-Muhajir aka Sanaullah, a former commander of the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network.“Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP)...was reported to have overseen a reunification of splinter groups that took place in Afghanistan and was moderated by Al-Qaida. This was expected to increase the threat to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the region,” the report said.Five groups - Shehryar Mehsud group, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar...Hizb-ul-Ahrar, the Amjad Farooqi group and the Usman Saifullah group (formerly known as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi) – pledged alliance to TTP in July and August last year, and this “increased the strength of TTP and resulted in a sharp increase in attacks in the region”.TTP’s fighting strength now ranges between 2,500 and 6,000, the report said. Though the report didn’t go into specifics, experts believe most members of the five groups united by TTP are of Pakistani origin.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said these developments could have worrying portends for India and its security interests, particularly in Afghanistan.“There is a history of terror attacks in Afghanistan in which elements associated with al-Qaeda joined hands with the Taliban to hit out at Indian interests in Afghanistan, including attacks on diplomatic compounds and the kidnapping of engineers. While there may not be any direct effect on Indian territory, Indian interests continue to be endangered, especially in Afghanistan,” he said.Patil said India also couldn’t afford to let down its guard given previous attempts by Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to create networks in the territory of friendly neighbours such as the Maldives.The UN report highlighted another issue that has been of concern to countries in the region against the backdrop of the planned drawdown of foreign troops in Afghanistan – the continuing relationship between the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda despite the peace deal signed with the US a year ago.“Member States report little evidence of significant changes in relations between Al-Qaida and the Taliban. Al-Qaida assesses that its future in Afghanistan depends upon its close ties to the Taliban, as well as the success of Taliban military operations in the country,” the report said.Al-Qaeda and its affiliates have 200 to 500 cadres spread across 11 provinces in Afghanistan, and the killing of several al-Qaeda commanders in Taliban-controlled territory “underscores how close the two groups are”, the report said. Among the al-Qaeda figures killed in Taliban-controlled areas was Mohammad Hanif, a deputy of al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-taliban-reunified-splinter-groups-in-afghanistan-poses-threat-un-101612532507569.html
05-02-2021||World||US employers add just 49,000 jobs as unemployment rate falls to 6.3%||US employers added just 49,000 jobs in January, a sign that that the viral pandemic retains a tight grip on the economy nearly a year after it triggered a painful recession.The tepid increase followed a decline of 227,000 jobs in December, the first loss since April. The unemployment rate for January fell sharply from 6.7% to 6.3%, the Labor Department said Friday. About half the drop occurred because some of those out of work found jobs, while others stopped looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed.Friday's figures reflect a faltering job market, slowed by a viral pandemic that is still causing consumers to avoid traveling, shopping, dining out, attending entertainment venues and engaging in other forms of face-to-face contact. Nearly 10 million jobs remain lost to the pandemic.Some states and localities re-imposed restrictions on businesses in December as cases spiked. Some of those restrictions were loosened in January, though perhaps not in time to affect the jobs report, which measures employment in the middle of each month.As hiring has slowed, many employers have continued to lay off workers. The number of applications for unemployment benefits, though declining for the past few weeks, remained at an elevated 779,000 last week.The hardships that millions of Americans are suffering trends have fueled President Joe Biden’s push for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which would provide $1,400 checks for most US individuals and a $400 weekly unemployment payment on top of state benefits. The package would also extend two federal jobless aid programs, from mid-March through September.The damage to the job market since March has widened financial inequality in the United States, especially hurting women and people of color. At the same time, Americans fortunate enough to have kept their jobs have amassed $2.3 trillion in savings — double the pre-pandemic total. That enlarged pool of savings could fuel a rapid rebound in spending as business restrictions are lifted and more Americans become more confident about shopping, dining out and traveling.Economists increasingly suggest that as vaccinations reach a critical mass in the coming months and the government provides further stimulus, the economy and the job market will strengthen much faster than they did after previous recessions. Bank of America estimates that growth could reach 6% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984.Some hopeful signs have emerged recently to suggest that the economy might be picking up a bit. Auto sales rose solidly in January. And a gauge of business growth in the service sector picked up to its highest level in two years. It also showed that services firms added workers last month. A separate measure of manufacturing indicated that factories are also expanding. So is spending on home construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-employers-add-just-49-000-jobs-as-unemployment-rate-falls-to-63-101612532800076.html
05-02-2021||World||Climate change may have had 'key role' in coronavirus pandemic: Study||Climate change may have played a "key role" in the transmission of the novel coronavirus to humans by driving several species of pathogen-carrying bats into closer contact, research showed on Friday.The virus, which has killed more than two million people and caused unprecedented global disruption, is thought to have originated in bats in Southeast Asia.Researchers from the University of Cambridge used temperature and rainfall data over the last 100 years to model populations of dozens of bat species based on their habitat requirements.They found that over the last century, 40 species had relocated to southern China, Laos and Myanmar -- the area where genetic analysis suggests the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 first appeared.Since each bat species carries an average of 2.7 coronaviruses, the researchers said 100 strains of coronavirus were now concentrated in this "hotspot" area."Our paper is a long way away from saying the pandemic would not have happened without climate change," lead author Robert Meyer of Cambridge's zoology department told AFP."But I find it difficult to see that this climate-driven increase in bats and bat-borne coronaviruses make something like this less likely to happen."While the precise chain of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans is yet to be determined, Beyer said the changing climate and habitat destruction in Asia had driven virus-carrying species into ever closer contact with human populations."It's two sides of a similar coin: we penetrate deeper into their habitat but at the same time climate change can have the effect that it pushes the pathogen in our direction," he said.'Complex risk'The study, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, urged governments to take measures including limiting urban expansion and farming, which it said would help to manage the risk of another pandemic of a disease endemic in wild animals.It also called for greater effort to mitigate climate change to avoid large accumulations of wild species near human habitation."The fact that climate change can accelerate the transmission of wildlife pathogens to humans should be an urgent wake-up call to reduce global emissions," said Camilo Mora at the University of Hawaii, who contributed to the research.Kate Jones, Professor of Ecology and Biodiversity at University College London, said Friday's research was interesting but that the pandemic was a result of a variety of factors."Climate change certainly has a role to play in changing species distributions to increase ecological hazard," said Jones, who was not involved in the study."However, spillover risk is a complex interplay of not only ecological hazard but human exposure and vulnerability."Habitat loss, for example, has also been a major driver in pushing wild animal species closer to human populations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-may-have-had-key-role-in-coronavirus-pandemic-study-101612531759850.html
05-02-2021||World||‘Not a word on Uighur’: Experts question silence of celebrities on China||A recent BBC report has revealed shocking details of how Uighur women are being "systematically raped" and tortured at China's Xinjiang camps. The US government has reacted to the reports and said it is "deeply disturbed" by the reports. The United Kingdom too has vowed action following the BBC investigation. British junior foreign minister Nigel Adams has said the BBC report revealed "clearly evil acts".China has not yet reacted to the reports but has so far denied the detention of Uighur Muslims and called these Centres camps for vocational training. The silence of international celebrities is also being questioned."New reports of atrocities on Uighur women have appeared which China has not denied. It comes in clear violation of human rights," former diplomat Kanwal Sibal said."A few days ago, in fact, the situation in Uighur camps in Xinjiang experienced what can be called genocide and to substantiate that there are credible investigative reports like the BBC one, which are coming out now. It's intriguing that there is no buzz about this in international media and also social media," China expert and editor of India Narrative, Atul Aneja said.Holding social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook partly responsible for not amplifying voices against the situation in Xinjiang, Aneja said, "It's absolutely unexplainable why both Twitter and Facebook are underplaying the developments at Uighur camps. The International Human Rights Council, the United Nations Security Council have to wake up to the atrocities unleashed at these camps, he said adding, "This is more than a wake-up call".The silence of celebrities on an issue like this has also drawn flak from experts in the backdrop of the statement issued by India's ministry of external affairs where it denounced international efforts to hurt India's democracy."It is the hypocrisy of the so-called international celebrities on castigating the Modi government on the farmers' agitation, which has been dealt with the utmost restraint. Their silence on the persecution of Uighur people is particularly notable as this is a women's cause, which these celebrity busybodies should have addressed for their own credibility," Kanwal Sibal said."The silence of Rihanna, Greta Thunberg who tweeted about farmers' protest in India makes me curious whether these international figures are acting alone. Or, whether there are forces behind them which pick up agendas, whether there is any grand geopolitical game behind this. In Iraq, Egypt, Libya, human rights were used as a cover for regime change. Is this the same line of thinking, one may ask," Aneja said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-word-on-uighur-experts-question-silence-of-celebrities-on-china-101612530031608.html

Addressing the vaccines issue from the perspective of a narrow national strategy might lead to a moral failure in meeting the needs of the most vulnerable across the globe," the appeal said.It was signed by Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, who is head of the Vatican's worldwide missionary arm and also CI president, Cardinal Peter Turkson, head of the Vatican's Integral Human Development department, and CI Secretary General Aloysius John.The appeal further summoned affluent nations to remit the debt of the poorest nations so that money could be diverted to improving national health systems.It said holders of vaccine patents should set up production hubs in Africa, Asia and Latin America to speed up delivery to the poorest populations.Rich nations that look after only their own good could face another crisis in the future if poorer nations are neglected now and the pandemic gets out of hand in the global south, it said.On Wednesday, the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility, which includes two U.N. agencies, said it had allocated at least 330 million doses of vaccines for poorer countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vatican-urges-un-security-council-meeting-on-covid-19-vaccine-access-101612531333284.html
05-02-2021||World||UK backs CureVac effort to make vaccine for Covid-19 variants||The U.K. government says it will support a German biopharmaceutical company's effort to develop vaccines to combat new variants of Covid-19, once again backing early-stage research into products meant to control the pandemic.As part of the deal, Tuebingen, Germany-based CureVac will produce the vaccines in the U.K. and supply the government with 50 million doses of shots that gain regulatory approval. The government did not say how much it was investing in the project.The announcement Friday comes as public health officials around the world raise concerns about new virus variants that are more contagious or resistant to existing vaccines.While viruses mutate constantly, most of the changes cause little concern. But scientists are closely tracking these mutations to make sure they quickly identify variants of concern.Earlier this week, drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said it would invest in CureVac for the development of new vaccines targeting emerging variants, using its messenger RNA technology to attack the disease. GSK said it plans to invest 150 million euros (USD 181 million) in the project.CureVac said its collaboration with the U.K. will support both the vaccines it is developing with GSK as well as another vaccine candidate it is developing with Bayer that is already in human trials.Authorities in England this week launched house-to-house coronavirus testing in targeted communities in a bid to snuff out a variant first discovered in South Africa before it spreads widely and undermines a nationwide vaccination program.Public health officials are concerned about the variant because it contains a mutation of the virus' characteristic spike protein targeted by existing vaccines. The mutation may mean the vaccines offer less protection against the variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-backs-curevac-effort-to-make-vaccine-for-covid-19-variants-101612531015151.html
05-02-2021||World||China 'expels' US warship from South China Sea, a first under Biden presidency||China on Friday said it has expelled a US guided missile destroyer from the South China Sea, a day after the same warship passed through the Taiwan Strait.The People’s Liberation Army’s southern theatre command issued a statement saying it deployed warships and aircraft to warn and drive away USS John S McCain from near the Xisha Island (Paracel Island in English) in the SCS region.The US Navy has said it was carrying out a lawful, “freedom of navigation operation”.Friday’s exchange is part of the war of words that has broken out between Beijing and Washington on the passage of the US warship through the region in the past 24 hours - for the first time since Joe Biden took over as President in January.Four years of Donald Trump’s presidency saw increased tensions between the world powers over a range of issues including disputes in the SCS region and Taiwan.China claims nearly the entire SCS, but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan (which China claims to be its breakaway region).Tian Junli, spokesperson of the Chinese theatre command, said the passage of the US warship “seriously” infringed upon China’s sovereignty and security, undermined regional peace and stability, and deliberately disrupted the “good atmosphere” of peace, friendship, and cooperation in the SCS maritime zone.In a statement, the US Navy said its warship was asserting international navigational rights in the SCS region.“On Feb 5 (local time) USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law,” Lt Joe Keiley, US Navy’s 7th Fleet spokesperson, said.“This freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging the unlawful restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam and also by challenging China’s claim to straight baselines enclosing the Paracel Islands,” Keiley said.The spokesperson added that China, Taiwan and Vietnam each claim sovereignty over the Paracel Islands.“All three claimants require either permission or advance notification before a military vessel or warship engages in ‘innocent passage’ through the territorial sea. Under international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention, the ships of all states -including their warships -enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea.”Keiley added: “The unilateral imposition of any authorisation or advance notification requirement for innocent passage is not permitted by international law. By engaging in innocent passage without giving prior notification to or asking permission from any of the claimants, the United States challenged these unlawful restrictions imposed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam. The US demonstrated that innocent passage may not be subject to such restrictions.”Meanwhile, China’s defence ministry has said that it has successfully conducted a land-based midcourse missile interception test within its territory on February 4, and “achieved the desired test objective. The test is defensive in nature and not targeted against any country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expels-us-warship-from-south-china-sea-a-first-under-biden-presidency-101612530807052.html
05-02-2021||World||In Saddam Hussein's strongholds that fought America, Iraqis fear a US departure||Abu Arkan Ibrahim picked up a rifle and joined the Iraqi insurgency against US troops when they occupied his hometown of Fallujah in 2003. He was badly burned in the fighting. Now, he fears the departure of the Americans he once battled.Over the past 17 years, the municipal employee has watched his city fall to the United States, al Qaeda, Islamic State and, most recently, Iraqi forces fighting alongside Iran-backed paramilitaries. Ibrahim said the presence of US troops in recent years helped suppress remaining Islamic State militants and rein in the Iran-backed militias - mutual foes accused by Iraqi officials of attacking locals. The US troop drawdown is creating a security vacuum, Ibrahim said, making Fallujah more dangerous.“I’d rather have the Americans here than the alternatives,” the 37-year old said.Ibrahim’s assessment is shared by many security officials, former fighters and residents in north and west regions of the country that comprise up to a third of Iraqi territory, former insurgent strongholds once loyal to Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein.They say Islamic State and the Iran-backed paramilitaries stand to gain most from Washington’s troop reduction. They point to an increase in attacks by Islamic State, and fear the Iran-backed militias will use this violence to justify entrenching themselves.Last month, the United States completed a reduction of its forces in Iraq to 2,500 troops. That’s about half the level of less than a year ago.Recent months have witnessed more than 25 deadly attacks that Iraqi officials attribute to Islamic State militants. Last month, the group staged its biggest attack in years with a suicide bombing in the capital Baghdad that killed more than 30 people.The US embassy in Baghdad declined to comment.The US-led military coalition of 80 nations battling Islamic State in Iraq said it carried out 10 strikes against militant targets in Iraq in December alone.A coalition official said there were no plans to reverse the drawdown and said Iraqi forces were capable of handling the ongoing Islamic State insurgency with current levels of coalition support.Washington’s contingent is the largest in the coalition force, which includes 900 troops from other countries. Still, the US presence in Iraq is tiny compared to the 170,000 troops it stationed in the country after its invasion.Parts of Iraq’s 300,000-strong military operate across the country’s western and northern areas. The paramilitaries number at least 100,000, with a significant portion in the north and west. Security officials and analysts estimate there are thousands of Islamic State fighters.One US official acknowledged the withdrawal over the past year has reduced American military capabilities in Iraq but stressed that US assistance has continued. “We’re still working hard to enable and support our Iraqi partners,” said the official, adding the Iraqis were already operating more independently.The official conceded Islamic State remains a determined enemy. “So it’s not a bloodless future,” the official said.The administration of President Joe Biden has given no indication it intends to significantly reverse the drawdown started under predecessor Donald Trump. The Pentagon said the Biden administration is conducting a review of numbers and position of troops, including in Iraq.An Iraqi government spokesman said the drawdown hasn’t affected its ability to contain Islamic State. “There is ongoing coordination” with the US forces that remain, he said.Most Iraqis oppose foreign influence. Some welcome the US withdrawal. But many, especially in Sunni regions, say they would choose a small American military presence over increased power for the pro-Iran militias.Paramilitaries aligned with Iran say the Islamic State insurgency against the Iraqi military requires them to stay in the Sunni-majority regions to fight the militants. They vow to drive foreign forces out of Iraq if Biden does not commit to a full withdrawal. The Iran-aligned paramilitaries deny involvement in any attacks or human-rights abuses.Islamic State fighters controlled nearly a third of Iraq between 2014 and 2017. They now occupy remote desert areas and mountain ranges. They regularly claim attacks that kill soldiers and Shi’ite militiamen in Iraq.Emboldened Islamic StateFallujah and other major cities in Sunni regions once held by Islamic State have begun to revive. Newly paved main roads run past busy shops and restaurants. But outside urban centres, buildings flattened in battle remain in ruins. Thousands of displaced families have not yet returned.Accompanied by his young son, Ibrahim spoke at a crowded Fallujah intersection that in October saw the city’s first motorcycle bomb in two years. Iraqi officials blamed Islamic State. There has been no claim or denial of responsibility from the group.“In recent months, we’ve seen more Daesh attacks across all these areas,” said Salah al-Essawi, a Sunni paramilitary commander in the area, using an alternative term for Islamic State. The attacks include an assault that killed two security personnel after the Fallujah bombing in October. Essawi and other Iraqi security officials attribute the killings to Islamic State, which hasn’t commented.Some Iraqi military officials say the rise in violence is due in large part to the reduced American presence.An Iraqi army officer who works with the US-led coalition cited an example of the Iraqi military’s reliance on America: a recent airstrike that killed a top Islamic State leader. It was a joint US-Iraqi effort, he said.“Our troops were pursuing him, but would have struggled to find where he was hiding if not for the US air support,” the officer said. He said the coalition carries out fewer air strikes against Islamic State targets than it used to.The coalition official said US-led forces provided air support to Iraqi special forces for that operation. The Iraqi government spokesman said the operation was led by Iraqi forces.Iran-aligned groupsShi’ite paramilitaries say that as Islamic State intensifies its insurgency, Iraqi forces need their help. The Iran-aligned groups are part of a Baghdad-run paramilitary umbrella that works alongside Iraqi security forces to police remote former Islamic State areas.“Many threats still exist and the duty of the factions is to deal with Daesh or any other foreign threat,” Nasr al-Shammari, a senior official in the Harakat al-Nujaba paramilitary, told Reuters weeks before Biden’s inauguration.Shammari wants the United States out, saying the presence of its troops fuels instability. Iraqis who want US forces to stay are a politically-motivated minority, he said.Many residents of Fallujah and nearby towns fear being caught up in reprisals for the increasing Islamic State attacks - both from Iraqi security forces and even more so from Shi’ite paramilitaries.Ibrahim said he has been detained by both over the years on suspicion of links with al Qaeda and Islamic State, which he denies.Essawi, the Sunni paramilitary leader, said the Shi’ite militias have been emboldened by talk of the US drawdown.

A follow-up procedure made it worse.Local Chinese media, The Paper, reported on Thursday that the hospital staff said that they were undergoing judicial procedures while an employee at the health bureau in Guangzhou said the incident was being investigated, The Paper reported on Thursday.According to Gao, she signed a contract to film two dramas but lost the jobs due to the results of her nose surgery, losing out on payment of 400,000 yuan ($61,879) in the process. “More importantly, I will also face a high breach of contract compensation of 2 million yuan,” she wrote on her Weibo account.According to state-run China Daily, the cosmetic surgery market in China reached 256 billion yuan ($36.71bn), growing at an annual compound growth rate of 30% in the past five years by the beginning of 2020.The report estimated that the Chinese cosmetic surgery market will hit 1 trillion yuan in 2025. Statistics show that the number of unqualified plastic surgery clinics in China exceeded 60,000 in 2019, six times that of regular clinics. About 40,000 medical accidents occur in these clinics every year, an average of about 110 per day, according to a report by Guangxi Daily.A large number of Chinese also go to South Korea for cosmetic surgeries every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-actress-shares-botched-nose-job-pics-online-to-warn-others-101612529546988.html
05-02-2021||World||Vote for new Libyan government heads into run-off at UN talks||Voting on a new Libyan interim government moved to a second, run-off ballot on Friday after none of the four slates of candidates won enough support to secure victory in UN talks aimed at helping end a decade of violence and division.The selection of an interim government is part of a UN peacemaking process based around holding national presidential and parliamentary elections in December in Libya, which has been engulfed in chaos since a NATO-backed intervention ended Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade rule in 2011.None of the four slates - each including a candidate for prime minister and three for a presidency council - secured 60% of votes from participants at the UN meeting near Geneva, the threshold needed to win outright in the first ballot.The two slates with the most votes now go forward to a run-off vote scheduled for Friday afternoon, where a straight majority will decide the winner, UN acting Libya envoy Stephanie Williams said.The list that won most votes in the first ballot had eastern-based parliament chief Aguila Saleh as head of a new presidency council and western-based interior minister Fathi Bashagha as premier. It will face a list that has Mohammed al-Menfi as council head and Abdulhamid Dbeibeh as prime minister.Since 2014 Libya has been split between warring administrations in the west and east, backed by foreign powers.However, with many factions in the country afraid to surrender influence they already hold, and with foreign powers invested in local allies, any new government chosen may rapidly come under pressure.All candidates for the new government have undertaken to hold national presidential and parliamentary elections on Dec. 24 in which they will not stand for office, and to appoint women to 30% of senior government roles.The United Nations publicly broadcast images of their signed pledges.UN acting envoy Williams said the four competing lists formed among candidates on Thursday were diverse and represented Libya's potential.However, some Libyans have been critical of a process which they view as being managed from abroad and which they fear will allow existing powermongers to cling to their influence."It's just a painkiller to portray Libya as stable for a while. But war and tension will certainly come back sooner or later so long as militias have power," said Abdulatif al-Zorgani, a 45-year old state employee in Tripoli.The latest UN process emerged from a Berlin conference last year and gathered pace in the autumn after commander Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based forces were repelled from a 14-month assault on Tripoli.It has also involved a military ceasefire but not all its terms of that ceeasefire have been met - a sign of continued mistrust on both sides and internal fractures within both camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vote-for-new-libyan-government-heads-into-run-off-at-un-talks-101612527812072.html

The German government is following the right course."Germany is facing growing pressure to repudiate Nord Stream 2 over the Navalny affair: at home, from the ecologist Greens - potential coalition partners for Laschet's CDU - and abroad from the United States, and much of Europe.Navalny, sentenced on Tuesday to 3-1/2 years in jail after a Moscow court ruled he had violated the terms of his parole, was arrested on Jan. 17 after returning to Russia from Germany where he was treated for poisoning with a military-grade nerve agent.Moscow has accused the West of hysteria and double standards over Navalny and told it to stay out of its internal affairs.Laschet stressed that he had criticised the attack on Navalny and his imprisonment, and also supported European Union sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis."We must guarantee Ukraine's geopolitical interests and secure our energy supply through this private-sector project," he said of Nord Stream 2.The project, set to launch this year, has split the EU, with some members saying it will undermine traditional gas transit state Ukraine and deepen the EU's energy reliance on Russia.Germany's ecologist Greens, the most likely coalition partner for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party after September's elections, have doubled down on their opposition to the pipeline following the Navalny affair.Laschet did not believe these differences would be a coalition deal breaker. "I don't think Nord Stream 2 will be a big election issue. Moreover, I think consensus with the Greens, for example, is possible."Laschet viewed Germany as "deeply anchored in the West" and saw the United States as "our closest non-European partner". As for China, Germany must criticise its human rights violations, he said. "But at the same time, we trade with China."Euro bonds, debt brakeOn Europe, Western Balkan states should retain the prospect of EU accession if they fulfil the entry criteria, Laschet said, adding: "Turkey is unfortunately moving further and further away from the rule of law principles of the European Union."He opposed introducing jointly issued debt, also known as euro bonds - a policy option some EU countries want to become a permanent tool after the bloc resorted to it to fund economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis."I don't see euro bonds. And with regard to the EU Commission's borrowing, I say: this is now a one-time thing for six years," Laschet said in a nod to taxpayers who don't want Europe's biggest economy necessarily on the hook for any bailouts to more financially challenged member states.On fiscal policy, Laschet rejected a proposal from Merkel's chief of staff to soften Germany's debt issuance law, allowing continued deficit spending, on grounds Berlin would be unable to stick to strict borrowing limits for several more years."The rules are good. The mechanisms contain the necessary flexibility - both the (EU's 1992) Maastricht Treaty and the debt brake of our Basic Law," Laschet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalny-affair-no-grounds-to-cancel-nord-stream-pipeline-says-german-cdu-chief-101612528405721.html
05-02-2021||World||US aiding Saudi defence despite Joe Biden's tough stance on human rights abuses||As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden laid out a tougher line on Saudi Arabia than any US president in decades. He said he would make the kingdom “pay the price” for human rights abuses and “make them in fact the pariah that they are.”But if Biden is making Saudi Arabia a pariah now, it's a pariah with benefits.While Biden announced Thursday he was making good on his campaign commitment to end US support for a five-year Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen, his administration is making clear it won’t abandon US military assistance for the kingdom and plans to help Saudi Arabia strengthen its own defences.His approach reflects the complexity of the US-Saudi relationship. While Biden is taking a tougher line than his predecessors, he and his foreign policy team recognise the US can’t allow relations to unravel. They see the importance of maintaining aspects of a military, counterterrorism, and security relationship seen as vital for security of both nations.“The United States will cooperate with Saudi Arabia where our priorities align and will not shy away from defending US interests and values where they do not,” the State Department said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.The aligned priorities have included a longstanding US emphasis on playing a lead defending the kingdom and its oil from attacks that would jolt the world’s energy markets and economies. US leaders also see Saudi Arabia as a regional counterweight to Iran.Biden said Thursday that the Saudi-led offensive in Yemen has “created a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe.” He said he would stop arms sales related to the Yemen offensive, but gave no immediate details what that might mean. At the same time, he also reaffirmed that the United States was committed to cooperating in the kingdom's defense.That will include helping protect Saudi Arabia's territory, critical infrastructure and shipping routes from the kingdom's opponents in neighboring Yemen, the Houthis, the State Department said. The Biden administration has yet to spell out how it plans to boost defense of the kingdom. Saudi Arabia points to missile and drone strikes and other cross-border attacks launched by Houthis in Yemen.Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat and critic of US involvement in the Saudi air campaign in Yemen, agreed that the US may still have a security interest in helping guard the kingdom.“Our focus should be providing basic defensive capabilities to help Riyadh defend itself from external threats, not fighting those threats for the Saudis," Murphy said.But the US should provide no “additional military support to Saudi Arabia unless we can clearly conclude that support...will not be used as irresponsibly as it has been in Yemen,” Murphy said. He called the kingdom an important partner nonetheless, and said he would work with the administration to reset relations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations.International criticism of Saudi Arabia has mounted since 2015, under King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Saudi Arabia that year led the United Arab Emirates and others in launching a war targeting Houthi rebels who had seized territory including the ancient city of Sanaa in Yemen, the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country. Saudi-led airstrikes since then have killed numerous Yemeni civilians, including schoolboys on a bus and fishermen in their fishing boats. The stalled war has failed to dislodge the Houthis and is deepening hunger and poverty. International rights advocates say Yemen's Houthis also have committed abuses, including repeated attacks on civilians.The CIA and others also hold the crown prince responsible for the murder and dismemberment of a US-based Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. The kingdom has imprisoned women who requested government permission to drive and other peaceful advocates. It detained numerous businesspeople and members of the sprawling royal family.Saudi Arabia has been conciliatory as the Biden administration settles in. It said Thursday it welcomes international diplomacy in the Yemen conflict. Its leaders stress the shared history and cooperation on intelligence, education and other matters. On Thursday, in what was seen as the latest gesture to Biden, the kingdom conditionally released two dual Saudi-American citizens held in a crackdown on civil society and shortened the sentence of a third, the State Department said. The latter, Dr. Walid Fitaihi, had been convicted of “disobedience” to the government."I believe we will have a great relationship with them, because all the pillars upon which the relationship stands are still there," Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told Saudi-funded Al Arabiya television about Biden officials.It was the Obama administration — focused at the time on closing a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia's rival, Iran — that greenlighted Saudi Arabia's military offensive in Yemen. American involvement with Saudi Arabia's command and control was supposed to minimize airstrikes on civilians, but often did not. Yemeni survivors displayed fragments showing it was American-made bombs that hit them. Some of those same Obama officials have since expressed regret, and are now in the Biden administration as it moves to end involvement with the offensive.It's not yet clear how far Biden will go in fulfilling his campaign pledge to stop the multibillion US arms trade with Saudi Arabia.Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the Democracy for the Arab World Now rights advocacy organization, said she was pleased at the administration's messaging so far involving Gulf countries and the Yemen war. The organization was founded by Khashoggi shortly before Saudis killed himWhitson said she would watch to see if the US maintained arms sales to the kingdom simply by rebranding offensive weapons as defensive, however.Ultimately, stepped-up US pledges to help Saudi Arabia build up its defenes could give the kingdom the face-saving cover it needs to give up on its Yemen offensive, said Steven Cook, a Middle East researcher at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.It could be “convincing the Saudis to declare victory and go home is really the only way,” Cook said. “Hold our nose and do it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aiding-saudi-defence-despite-joe-biden-s-tough-stance-on-human-rights-abuses-101612527333298.html

The PN has also contracted construction of eight Hangor-class submarines, four Type 054A/P ships and medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned combat aerial vehicles from China,” the Pakistani navy chief said.Pakistan is also looking to China to enhance its long-range anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare capability through induction of long-range maritime patrol jets, unmanned combat aerial vehicles and modernising our existing fleet with state-of-the-art weapons and surveillance systems, Niazi said.“We are also looking at acquisition of modern helicopters, corvettes and shallow-water attack submarines,” he said.Niazi also spoke on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and how the Gwadar port is the initiative’s lynchpin.Cooperating with the Pakistani navy gives China reach across the IOR and the Arabian Sea, close to India’s west coast. For Pakistan, it’s access to weapons and technology to counter India.“Chinese Navy hosts a number of modern and technologically advanced platforms in their inventory. Operating with these modern and high-tech platforms affords us an opportunity to refine our tactics and procedures,” Niazi said.“It is heartening to know that the PLA Navy now operates two aircraft carriers. The PN would like to conduct an exercise with these carriers whenever an opportunity arises. Moreover, the PLA Navy and PN ships regularly visit each other’s ports. In the same stride, the PN would continue to welcome further visits by PLA Navy ships, including aircraft carriers,” Niazi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-navy-balances-india-s-destabilising-role-in-indian-ocean-pak-navy-chief-101612528466879.html
05-02-2021||World||A glance at Marjorie Taylor Greene's incendiary words that led to her removal from House committees||Freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has been stripped of her committee assignments by the House Democratic majority over racist remarks, her embrace of conspiracy theories and her past endorsement of violence against leading Democratic officials.Greene, 46, is a newcomer to politics, and previously worked for her family's construction business in Georgia. She was labeled a “future Republican Star” by former President Donald Trump, whose political style she emulates. The House Democrats took the unusual step on Thursday.Here’s a look at some of Greene’s past statements and social media posts, many of which were deleted after the liberal group Media Matters unearthed them online.Las Vega mass shootingIn 2017, Stephen Paddock opened fire from a hotel room window overlooking an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas, killing 58 people. Afterward, Greene suggested that the shooting might have been staged.“How do you get avid gun owners and people that support the Second Amendment to give up their guns and go along with anti-gun legislation?” Greene asked in an online video. “You make them scared, you make them victims and you change their mindset and then possibly you can pass anti-gun legislation. Is that what happened in Las Vegas?”“I don’t believe (Paddock) pulled this off all by himself, and I know most of you don’t either,” Greene said.Space lasersIn 2018, a poorly maintained electrical grid sparked a California wildfire that killed 84 people. In a Facebook post in November of that year, Greene falsely speculated that darker forces were at work.Connecting a series of scattershot points, Greene suggested a bank controlled by the Rothschild family, who are Jewish, a utility company responsible for the fire and then-Gov. Jerry Brown had a compelling motive to spark the blaze: clearing the path for a high speed rail project Brown wanted. She also floated the possibility that the fires could have been started by “lasers or blue beams of light” shot down from space by allies of Brown who were said to be in the solar energy industry.“There are too many coincidences to ignore,” she wrote.Omar and TlaibIn February 2019, Greene appeared in an online video filmed at the US Capitol, arguing that Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan weren’t “really official” members of Congress because they didn’t take the oath of office on the Bible. Both women are Muslim.“I really want to go talk to these ladies and ask them what they are thinking, and why they are serving in our American government," Greene said. “They really should go back to the Middle East.”Tlaib was born in Detroit. Omar was born in Somalia and came to the US when she was 12, becoming a US citizen five years later.Hillary ClintonIn May 2018, a Facebook user purporting to be the mother of a New York police officer falsely claimed that the officer had seen a video taken from the laptop of disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner that showed Hillary Clinton and a top aide cutting off a child’s face. Greene “liked” the comment and replied, “Most people honestly don’t know so much. The (mainstream media) disinformation warfare has won for too long!”Nancy PelosiGreene once suggested in an online video that Pelosi could be executed for treason.“She’s a traitor to our country, she’s guilty of treason,” Greene says in the video, which CNN first reported. “And it’s, uh, it’s a crime punishable by death is what treason is. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason.”She also “liked” a January 2019 Facebook post that called for “a bullet to the head” of Pelosi.9/11 attacksIn November 2018, Greene shot a video in which she talked about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, referring to a “so-called” plane that crashed into the Pentagon. She added, “It’s odd, there’s never any evidence shown for a plane in the Pentagon.”She also “liked” a comment posted by a Facebook user in 2018 who falsely argued that 9/11 was “done by our own Gov.” Greene responded: “That is all true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-glance-at-us-lawmaker-marjorie-taylor-greene-s-incendiary-words-101612525744695.html
05-02-2021||World||Fiercely divided House kicks Marjorie Taylor Greene off both her committees||A fiercely divided House has tossed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off both her committees, an unprecedented punishment that Democrats said she’d earned by spreading hateful and violent conspiracy theories.Underscoring the political vise her inflammatory commentary has clamped her party into, nearly all Republicans voted against the Democratic move Thursday but none defended her lengthy history of outrageous social media posts.Yet in a riveting moment, the freshman Republican from a deep-red corner of Georgia took to the House floor on her own behalf. She offered a mixture of backpedaling and finger-pointing as she wore a dark mask emblazoned with the words “FREE SPEECH.”The chamber’s near party-line 230-199 vote was the latest instance of conspiracy theories becoming pitched political battlefields, an increasingly familiar occurrence during Donald Trump’s presidency. He faces a Senate trial next week for his House impeachment for inciting insurrection after a mob he fueled with his false narrative of a stolen election attacked the Capitol.Thursday’s fight also underscored the uproar and political complexities that Greene — a master of provoking Democrats, promoting herself and raising campaign money — has prompted since becoming a House candidate last year.Eleven Republicans joined 219 Democrats in backing Greene's ejection from her committees, while 199 GOP lawmakers voted “no.”Addressing her colleagues, Greene tried to dissociate herself from her “words of the past.” Contradicting past social media posts, she said she believes the 9/11 attacks and mass school shootings were real and no longer believes QAnon conspiracy theories, which include lies about Democratic-run pedophile rings.But she didn’t explicitly apologize for supportive online remarks she’s made on other subjects, as when she mulled about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi being assassinated or the possibility of Jewish-controlled space rays causing wildfires. And she portrayed herself as the victim of unscrupulous “big media companies.”News organizations “can take teeny, tiny pieces of words that I’ve said, that you have said, any of us, and can portray us as someone that we’re not,” she said. She added that “we’re in a real big problem” if the House punished her but tolerated “members that condone riots that have hurt American people” — a clear reference to last summer’s social justice protests that in some instances became violent.Greene was on the Education and Labor committee and the Budget committee. Democrats were especially aghast about her assignment to the education panel, considering the past doubt she cast on school shootings in Florida and Connecticut.The political imperative for Democrats was clear: Greene’s support for violence and fictions were dangerous and merited punishment. Democrats and researchers said there was no apparent precedent for the full House removing a lawmaker from a committee, a step usually taken by their party leaders.The calculation was more complicated for Republicans.Though Trump left the White House two week ago, his devoted followers are numerous among the party’s voters, and he and Greene are allies. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., hopes GOP victories in the 2022 elections will make him speaker. Republicans could undermine that scenario by alienating Trump’s and Greene’s passionate supporters, and McCarthy took no action to punish her.“If any of our members threatened the safety of other members, we’d be the first ones to take them off a committee,” Pelosi angrily told reporters. She said she was “profoundly concerned” about GOP leaders’ acceptance of an “extreme conspiracy theorist.”At one point, No. 2 Democratic leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland strode to the GOP side of the chamber carrying a poster of a Greene Facebook post from last year. “Squad's Worst Nightmare,” Greene had written in the post, which showed her holding an AR-15 firearm next to pictures of three of the four Democratic lawmakers, all young women of color, who've been nicknamed “The Squad."“They are people. They are our colleagues,” Hoyer said. He mimicked Greene's pose holding the weapon and said, “I have never, ever seen that before."Republicans tread carefully but found rallying points.McCarthy said Greene’s past opinions “do not represent the views of my party.” But without naming the offenders, he said Pelosi hadn’t stripped committee memberships from Democrats who became embroiled in controversy. Among those he implicated was Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who made anti-Israel insults for which she later apologized.“If that’s the new standard,” he said of Democrats’ move against Greene, “we have a long list.”Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Democrats were setting a precedent by punishing lawmakers for statements made before they were even candidates for Congress. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, warned, “You engage in wrong-speak, you’re in the Thunderdome,” a term for an enclosed wrestling arena.Committee assignments are crucial for lawmakers for shaping legislation affecting their districts, creating a national reputation and raising campaign contributions. Even social media stars like Greene could find it harder to define themselves without the spotlights that committees provide.Not all Republicans were in forgiving moods, especially in the Senate. There, fringe GOP candidates have lost winnable races in recent years and leaders worry a continued linkage with Trump and conspiracists will inflict more damage.That chamber’s minority leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., this week called Greene’s words a “cancer” on the GOP and country. On Thursday, No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota amplified that thinking.Thune said House Republicans needed to issue a “really strong” rebuke of Greene’s conspiratorial formulations. Republicans must “get away from members dabbling in conspiracy theories,” Thune said. “I don’t think that’s a productive course of action or one that’s going to lead to much prosperity politically in the future.”The fight came a day after Republicans resolved another battle and voted to keep Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., in their leadership. Pro-Trump conservatives tried removing her because she supported Trump's impeachment.The House resolution punishing Greene was barely over a page. It said House rules require lawmakers’ behavior to “reflect credibly” on the chamber and said Greene should be removed “in light of conduct she has exhibited.”News organizations have unearthed countless social media videos and “likes” in which Greene embraced absurd theories like suspicions that Hillary Clinton was behind the 1999 death of John F. Kennedy Jr. Greene responded, “Stage is being set,” when someone posted a question about hanging Clinton and former President Barack Obama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fiercely-divided-house-kicks-marjorie-taylo-greene-off-both-her-committees-101612526455105.html
05-02-2021||World||After Facebook ban, thousands in Myanmar take to Twitter to protest against military coup||Since Myanmar's new military rulers imposed a temporary blockade on Facebook on Thursday, thousands in the Southeast Asian country have joined Twitter, according to app downloads and a Reuters estimate.Many are using the platform and pro-democracy hashtags to criticize the army's takeover and call for peaceful protests until the result of November's election, which was won in a landslide by Aung San Suu Kyi's party, is respected.The hashtags #RespectOurVotes, #HearTheVoiceofMyanmar, and #SaveMyanmar all had hundreds of thousands of interactions by Friday, according to hashtag tracker BrandMentions.The junta seized power on Monday in a coup against the democratically elected government of Suu Kyi in response to what the army said was "election fraud."Military authorities banned Facebook Inc - which counts half of the population as users - until at least February 7th for the sake of "stability", after the junta's opponents began using the platform to organize.But it took several hours for internet providers to enforce the ban, during which time activists began creating Twitter accounts and sharing them on their Facebook profiles, according to a review of social media messages.Twitter was by Friday among the top five most downloaded apps on both the Google and Apple stores, according to data from research firm SensorTower.Out of around 1,500 new Twitter accounts reviewed by Reuters and activated in the last two days using Myanmar related hashtags, most identified themselves as being opposed to the military government, while a handful of accounts were pro-military and posted links to the junta's press releases.Some pro-democracy activists used the hashtag #MilkTeaAlliance, to appeal for support to cross-border youth movements pushing for democracy.The hashtag, which started in Thailand in April, is used prominently by Hong Kong, Thai, and Taiwanese activists, with Twitter becoming a key soapbox for the region's pro-democracy activists.Twitter declined to comment on the surge of users in Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-facebook-ban-thousands-in-myanmar-take-to-twitter-to-protest-against-military-coup-101612525442891.html

05-02-2021||World||UN chief names Michael Bloomberg climate envoy to rally action||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reappointed former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as his special envoy on climate ambition and solutions on Friday "to mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action" ahead of a global summit in November.Bloomberg was previously the UN special envoy for climate action between March 2018 and November 2019.

The United Nations in November will stage a crucial follow-up climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland.By then, countries are expected to commit to make deeper emissions cuts to deliver the goal of the Paris agreement.The reappointment of Bloomberg aims to "mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action" in the run-up to the Glasgow summit, the United Nations said in a statement.New US President Joe Biden has moved to bring the United States, the world's second-largest greenhouse emitter, back into the Paris deal.Washington formally left the accord last year but its role as a heavyweight in global climate negotiations had already stalled with the 2016 election of Republican President Donald Trump.Bloomberg "will engage government officials and members of the private sector and civil society to finalize and implement plans, particularly in high-emitting countries, industries and sectors, to vastly accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy," the United Nations said.He will also help deliver on Guterres' call for the "phase-out of coal in industrialized countries by 2030, and all other countries by 2040, underpinned by a just transition for affected communities and workers," the world body said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-names-michael-bloomberg-climate-envoy-to-rally-action-101612524603140.html

05-02-2021||World||US Senate passes budget plan to advance Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid aid package||President Joe Biden's drive to enact a $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid bill gained momentum early on Friday as the U.S. Senate narrowly approved a budget blueprint allowing Democrats to push the legislation through Congress in coming weeks with or without Republican support.At the end of approximately 15 hours of debate and back-to-back votes on dozens of amendments, the Senate found itself in a 50-50 partisan deadlock over passage of the budget plan. That deadlock was broken by Vice President Kamala Harris, whose "yes" vote provided the win for Democrats.Shortly before the final vote, Democrats flexed their muscle by offering an amendment reversing some earlier votes regarding the future of the Keystone XL pipeline and coronavirus aid to immigrants living in the United States illegally.With Harris presiding, she broke a 50-50 tie to win this amendment for her fellow Democrats.It marked the first time Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, cast a tie-breaking vote after being sworn in as Biden's vice president on Jan. 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-passes-budget-plan-to-advance-biden-s-1-9-trillion-covid-aid-package-101612523397892.html

The new policy memorandum rescinding the guidance follows an order from a US appellate court that overturned a decision by USCIS.The immigration services agency had denied an H-1B visa application from Innova Solutions that sought to hire an Indian citizen to work as a computer programmer. In the order, the US court of appeals for the 9th circuit noted that denial of H1-B nonimmigrant visa petition was arbitrary and capricious. The appellate court said that although USCIS did not explicitly rely on the guidance memo, the denial followed its logic.In a fresh memo to officers, the USCIS on Wednesday said that it is rescinding the 2017 policy memorandum effective immediately to “ensure consistent adjudications across the H-1B program.” The federal agency has directed its officers to not apply the earlier memo to any pending or new requests for H-1B classification, including “motions on and appeals of revocations and denials of H-1B classification.”Read | US delays H-1B selection final rule, lottery system to apply for upcoming seasonThe agency further stated that the memorandum does not remove USCIS officers’ discretion in making adjudicatory decisions and is intended solely for the guidance in discharging their official duties. “It may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable under law or by any individual or other party in removal proceedings, in litigation with the United States, or in any other form or manner,” the memo reads.In the past few days, the Biden administration has made a series of announcements related to H1-B visa, delaying the measures taken by the previous administration. The department of homeland security (DHS) postponed the implementation of proposed changes to the H-1B registration system and selection process until December 31, 2021. According to the DHS, the effective date for the proposed changes has been delayed to give USCIS more time to “develop, test, and implement the modifications.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uscis-rescinds-guidance-memo-used-to-deny-h-1b-visas-to-computer-programmers-101612523163604.html
05-02-2021||World||US warship sails near Chinese-controlled South China Sea islands||A U.S. warship sailed near the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in the disputed South China Sea on Friday in a freedom of navigation operation, the U.S. Navy said, the first such mission under President Joe Biden's new administration.China's military condemned the move, saying it had dispatched naval and air units to follow and warn away the ship.The busy waterway is one of a number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which include a trade war, U.S. sanctions, Hong Kong and Taiwan.China has been infuriated by repeated U.S. sailings near the islands Beijing occupies and controls in the South China Sea. China says it has irrefutable sovereignty and has accused Washington of deliberately stoking tensions.The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said the destroyer USS John S. McCain "asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law".The freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging the "unlawful restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam", it said.The Southern Theatre Command of China's People's Liberation Army said the ship had entered into what it termed the territorial waters of the Paracels without permission, "seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and security".The United States was "deliberately disrupting the good atmosphere of the South China Sea of ​​peace, friendship, and cooperation", it added.China took full control of the Paracels in 1974 after a short battle with South Vietnamese forces. Vietnam, as well as Taiwan, continue to claim the islands.Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines have claims to other parts of the South China Sea, where China has been building artificial islands and constructing air bases on some of them.The same U.S. ship involved in this mission earlier this week transited the sensitive Taiwan Strait, drawing an angry response from Beijing.Last month, a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group entered the South China Sea for what the Navy said was routine operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warship-sails-near-chinese-controlled-south-china-sea-islands-101612522068111.html
05-02-2021||World||Hong Kong imposes sweeping pro-China curriculum on schools||Hong Kong ordered schools to adopt a more patriotic curriculum and advised teachers to report any breaches of the city’s national security law, the government’s biggest move yet to overhaul the education system following the protests of 2019.The measures, announced late Thursday, seek to inculcate patriotism to kindergarten-age children through “story-telling, role-playing, drawing, singing, dancing and other activities.” Students as young as six will be taught to memorize offenses criminalised by the national security law, which was imposed on the city by China last year, including subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. The curriculum will cover all subjects from geography to biology.“The fundamentals of national security education are to develop in students a sense of belonging to the country, an affection for the Chinese people, a sense of national identity, as well as an awareness of and a sense of responsibility for safeguarding national security,” Hong Kong’s Education Bureau said in a statement.The new curriculum may also impact Hong Kong’s approximately 52 international schools, which largely cater to the city’s expatriate population. The government statement said that international schools have the “responsibility” to help their students “acquire a correct and objective understanding” of the law, without elaborating.No international school Bloomberg reached out to was available for immediate comment.Cutting off ‘Black Hands’Beijing has blamed Hong Kong’s education system for fostering dissent and fueling the months-long protests opposing the Chinese government’s increasing power over the former British colony. Hong Kong authorities have previously vowed to “cut off” the “black hands” -- including teachers -- deemed insufficiently patriotic.The Hong Kong government attempted to introduce a patriotic education curriculum in 2012, but shelved the decision following massive protests. The latest attempt to do so will bring the financial hub further in line with the education system in mainland China, where students are, for example, required to study the teachings of President Xi Jinping.University and high school students comprised a majority of the frontline protesters in the 2019 unrest, and people under 18 represented almost a fifth of the roughly 10,000 arrests made as of last December, according to data complied by Bloomberg. Students also organized protest activities including forming human chains and class boycotts, actions forbidden under the new rules.Ip Kin-yuen, a former lawmaker and a vice-president of the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, said that the new guidelines are “not conducive for learning or fostering the development of young minds,” and that in an environment where people are trying to avoid getting into trouble “the natural response will be self-censorship.”Owl videoAs part of its promotion materials, the government produced a 7-minute animation featuring an owl explaining the concept of national security, saying it covers all aspects of Hong Kong society including culture, cybersecurity, and ecology. The video also says that it’s the “right and duty of the Central Authorities to enact the National Security Law,” and that other countries have similar laws.Garrie Chow, a father with three children in Hong Kong schools, said the new curriculum means that students are “not allowed to have independent thinking.”In September, the English Schools Foundation, which operates 22 international schools in the city, released and distributed a 15-page set of guidelines directing teachers to tell students that the classroom isn’t a “safe space” for discussion or debate of the national security law, the South China Morning Post reported. ESF did not immediately respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment.Migration waveThe imposition of the new curriculum could add to the already surging number of people emigrating to places like the UK and Taiwan. Some parents and teachers have cited Beijing’s growing control over Hong Kong schools as a major reason for leaving.Jojo, a 37-year old Chinese and special education teacher who would only give her first name due to security fears, said she is seeking to relocate to the UK later this year, joining thousands of others who have already done so via a pathway made available to Hong Kong holders of the British National (Overseas) passport. She is part of a WhatsApp group with 120 other local teachers that helps educators obtain the skills and certifications needed to secure employment in the UK“The students will have to follow along (with the rules), but it will severely impact their personal relationship with us,” Jojo said. “They won’t trust us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-imposes-sweeping-pro-china-curriculum-on-schools-101612519871650.html
05-02-2021||World||China making cautious moves to save its investments in Myanmar after coup||After a military coup in Myanmar on February 1, China is again poised to be the "friend in need" it has always been in times of crisis for the country, reported Asia Times.China has made huge investments in Myanmar.In order to save its investments, China took the stand of 'understanding the coup' in Myanmar while globally the act was derided and condemned.Among the major projects that were on the table before the coup are a new railroad linking the Chinese border town of Ruili with Mandalay in Myanmar, and a China-financed deep-sea port at Kyaukpyu on the Bay of Bengal, which already also serves as a terminus for oil and gas pipelines that reach across Myanmar and flow into China's southern Yunnan province, reported Asia Times.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, at a news briefing on February 1 hours after Myanmar's elected government members were detained, said Beijing "noted what has happened in Myanmar and are in the process of further understanding the situation."He then went on to say that "all sides in Myanmar" should "appropriately handle their differences under the constitution and legal framework" in order for "political and social stability to be maintained."Meanwhile, the US President Joe Biden's administration quickly threatened to impose new punitive sanctions on Myanmar's coup-makers.Bertil Lintner, writing in an opinion piece in Asia Times viewed the Chinese move as a continuation of their support to the Myanmar military. China has already come to the defense of Myanmar's coup-makers and will likely see its interests grow under the new era of military rule, he wrote.China has been utilising the situation with utmost care to save its investments in Myanmar. Earlier also, China has helped Myanmar in its previous outrages, including the Rohingya refugee crisis that was condemned by the West. China had helped Myanmar after the Rohingya refugee crisis in 2016-2017, reported Asia Times.At that time, Aung San Suu Kyi's now-ousted National League for Democracy (NLD) was in power. Beijing had cozied up to her and her party before the coup because its policymakers and business groups found it easier to deal with them than the staunchly nationalistic military, known as the Tatmadaw, reported Asia Times.Myanmar, under Suu Kyi, joined China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) when Suu Kyi attended a forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May 2017. The two countries then signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly build the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) in 2018, aiming to further enhance bilateral cooperation within the BRI's framework, reported Asia Times.Lintner is of the view that China will not likely criticize Myanmar's new military government, even if its new direction and policies dent somewhat its interests and ongoing projects in the country.Even though Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of Myanmar's defense forces and now national leader under the emergency rule is wary of Chinese hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, recognizes that China is the only top foreign power he can rely on after his coup, Myanmar insiders say, reported Asia Times.As per Lintner, Beijing will thus likely not risk even the mildest hiccup in its relations with strategically important Myanmar, the only neighbour that via the CMEC provides it with ready access to the Indian Ocean for trade and an alternative avenue for its fuel shipments from the Middle East that travel mainly through the strategically fraught Malacca Strait.Moreover, Aung Hlaing latest move to appoint new Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin is a clear indication that he wants to move closer to China, said Lintner. Wunna Maung Lwin served as foreign minister from 2011 to 2016 under then-president Thein Sein.He visited China several times over that period and was the first to vouch for Chinese "economic corridors" to be built through Myanmar. During a visit in August 2015 -- before the NLD won its first election victory in November of that year -- he was quoted in a Chinese Foreign Ministry bulletin saying that "Myanmar thanks China" for its humanitarian support and "Myanmar cherishes China as a friend in need," reported Asia Times.Indeed, he is known for his anti-Western and pro-Chinese stance. At one point he even told Thein Sein not to meet then-US president Barack Obama, insiders say, reported Asia Times.Now Wunna Maung Lwin is back and his cordial relations with Chinese officials will likely prove pivotal as the West contemplates renewed sanctions and other punitive measures against the coup-makers. Hence, China is poised to benefit from the Myanmar military coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-making-cautious-moves-to-save-its-investments-in-myanmar-after-coup-101612518804078.html

05-02-2021||World||Covid-19: Russian vaccine team in talks with China on combination trial||Fresh off global validation of their Covid-19 vaccine’s extraordinary effectiveness, Russian developers are in talks with China’s CanSino Biologics Inc. to test a combined regimen of their shots to better protect against new virus strains, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The Russian Direct Investment Fund, a partner in the Sputnik V vaccine program, forged a preliminary agreement with the Tianjin-based vaccine developer and Petrovax Pharm Llc, owned by billionaire Vladimir Potanin, to conduct tests in Russia, four people said, declining to be identified as the information isn’t public. Petrovax is Cansino’s Russian partner.They are negotiating the design of the trial which would replace Sputnik’s second shot with CanSino’s, and may announce a plan as soon as this month, they said. Spokespeople for Petrovax and RDIF declined to comment, as did CanSino.Researchers are looking at whether combining different developers’ vaccines in a two-shot regimen produces results that are as good as, or better than, using the same product as a booster. That flexibility could help to relieve pressure on individual vaccine makers if they run into manufacturing difficulties. While the Sputnik V program already has success using different vectors for its two doses, it has faced challenges ramping up production amid an ambitious rollout.The prospect of a Russia-China tie-up could potentially offer developing countries a new tool to fight the pandemic and increase the two giants’ geopolitical influence as major western countries remain pre-occupied with their own crises.Also read| Covid vaccine Sputnik V turns out to be a scientific and political win for PutinOther tie-up plans are also progressing: the University of Oxford plans to start a trial combining vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc., while Russia will begin testing a mix of Sputnik V with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan next week.RDIF and the state-run Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which developed Sputnik V, are ready to cooperate with other producers to make their shots more effective, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Sputnik V co-developer the Russian Direct Investment Fund said in interview earlier this week.Dmitriev said that Sputnik V plans to cooperate with a Chinese vaccine maker, though he declined to identify the company.The Russian vaccine shows 91.6% efficacy, according to peer-reviewed interim analysis published in the medical journal The Lancet on Feb. 2. CanSino is preparing to release interim efficacy data before the Lunar New Year on Feb. 12. China’s other leading vaccines have shown lower protection rates, ranging from 50% to 80%.“Sputnik V was the first vaccine that offered so called heterogeneous boosting -- using two different vectors for two shots,” Dmitriev said. “Only this approach can help to fight new strains of the virus.”Sputnik V uses two different human adenovirus vectors for its shots, the second of which is the same as CanSino’s adenovirus platform. The Chinese vaccine is currently undergoing global Phase 3 trials, including in Russia with Petrovax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-russian-vaccine-team-in-talks-with-china-on-combination-trial-101612517546901.html

Merck is one of the world’s main suppliers of the custom lipid nanoparticles that are crucial to producing shots using messenger-RNA technology.German Chancellor Angela Merkel cited lipids earlier this week as a main constraint on scaling up mRNA vaccine production. CureVac NV Chief Executive Officer Franz-Werner Haas echoed those sentiments in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday, saying his company is facing challenges making more of its experimental Covid shot because the mRNA industry was so small a year ago and there are now calls for billions of doses.Also read | Covid-19 vaccine: Pfizer withdraws emergency use application in IndiaBottlenecks in the supply chain include components needed to make the genetic material for the shots, along with the lipid nanoparticles required to envelop that material, Haas said.

She would become the first woman to lead the organization.South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a news release Friday that its minister for trade, Yoo Myung-hee, will soon tell the WTO she is withdrawing her candidacy.The WTO, which makes world trade rules, announced in October that Yoo and Okonjo-Iweala were the two finalists to become its next director-general, ensuring a woman will fill the top job for the first time. The WTO had ben expected to announce a winner before the end of 2020, but the process dragged on because of disagreements between member states over the candidates, the South Korean ministry said.While it appeared Okonjo-Iweala had broader support, the WTO, which operates by consensus, which means that any single member country can block decisions.Also read | South Korea revamps social distancing rules amid fourth wave of Covid-19The South Korean ministry said Yoo discussed her candidacy with officials from the United States and other WTO member states before deciding to withdraw over “comprehensive” considerations.The previous WTO director-general, Roberto Azevedo of Brazil, made a surprise announcement in May last year that he would leave the job a year early, citing a “personal decision.” He left without a successor at the end of August.The Geneva-based WTO, which was created in 1995 out of the former General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has never had a woman director-general or national from Africa as its leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-trade-minister-drops-bid-to-become-wto-chief-101612516255873.html

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.Ambassador Sandhu said: “We have been engaging with the US administration and other stakeholders on issues related to movement of Indian professionals, highlighting the importance of people-to-people linkages and the contribution of Indian skilled professionals to the growth and development of the US economy, especially in the technology and innovation sector.“They have also been a critical component of the first responders providing Covid-19 related assistance in sectors such as health, information technology and financial services”.Responding to another question, Sandhu said that owing to the public health requirements in the initial days of lockdown, some travel restrictions were placed which were relaxed gradually.“Currently, there are no restrictions on travel to India for OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) card holders. Over four million strong Indian-American community has been playing a critical role in crafting the India-US partnership.“We deeply value their contribution and support in India’s development and further strengthening understanding and friendship between our two countries,” Sandhu added.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services can issue a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas in a year.

Yet hotel quarantine will come in to force more than 50 days after the South African strain was discovered," Labour's home affairs spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds said.Health minister Matt Hancock had discussed the policy with his counterpart in Australia, where quarantine was introduced in March 2020, the Health Department said. Officials would also seek advice from New Zealand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-hotel-quarantine-policy-to-start-from-february-15-101612513495312.html
05-02-2021||World||Turkey Uighurs fear sellout to China in exchange for vaccine||Abdullah Metseydi, a Uighur in Turkey, was readying for bed last month when he heard commotion, then pounding on the door. “Police! Open the door!”A dozen or more officers poured in, many bearing guns and wearing the camouflage of Turkey’s anti-terror force. They asked if Metseydi had participated in any movements against China and threatened to deport him and his wife. They took him to a deportation facility, where he now sits at the center of a brewing political controversy.Opposition legislators in Turkey are accusing Ankara’s leaders of secretly selling out Uighurs to China in exchange for coronavirus vaccines. Tens of millions of vials of promised Chinese vaccines have not yet been delivered. Meanwhile, in recent months, Turkish police have raided and detained around 50 Uighurs in deportation centers, lawyers say — a sharp uptick from last year.Although no hard evidence has yet emerged for a quid pro quo, these legislators and the Uighurs fear that Beijing is using the vaccines as leverage to win passage of an extradition treaty. The treaty was signed years ago but suddenly ratified by China in December, and could come before Turkish lawmakers as soon as this month.Uighurs say the bill, once law, could bring their ultimate life-threatening nightmare: Deportation back to a country they fled to avoid mass detention. More than a million Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities have been swept into prisons and detention camps in China, in what China calls an anti-terrorism measure but the United States has declared a genocide.“I'm terrified of being deported,” said Melike, Metseydi's wife, through tears, declining to give her last name for fear of retribution. “I’m worried for my husband's mental health.”Suspicions of a deal emerged when the first shipment of Chinese vaccines was held up for weeks in December. Officials blamed permit issues.But even now, Yildirim Kaya, a legislator from Turkey’s main opposition party, said that China has delivered only a third of the 30 million doses it promised by the end of January. Turkey is largely reliant on China’s Sinovac vaccine to immunize its population against the virus, which has infected some 2.5 million and killed over 26,000.“Such a delay is not normal. We have paid for these vaccines," Kaya said. “Is China blackmailing Turkey?”Kaya said he’s formally asked the Turkish government about pressure from China but has not yet received a response.Both Turkish and Chinese authorities insist that the extradition bill isn’t meant to target Uighurs for deportation. Chinese state media called such concerns “smearing," and foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin denied any connection between vaccines and the treaty.“I think your speculation is unfounded,” Wang said at a Thursday press briefing.Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in December that the vaccine delay was not related to the issue of the Uighurs.“We do not use the Uighurs for political purposes, we defend their human rights,” Cavusoglu said.But though very few have actually been deported for now, the recent detentions have sent a chill through Turkey’s estimated 50,000-strong Uighur community. And in recent weeks, the Turkish ambassador in Beijing has praised China’s vaccines while adding that Ankara values “judicial cooperation” with China — code, many Uighurs fear, for a possible crackdown.In the past, a small number of Uighurs have traveled to Syria to train with militants. But most Uighurs in Turkey shun jihadis and worry they are hurting the Uighur cause.Lawyers representing the detained Uighurs say that in most cases, the Turkish police have no evidence of links to terror groups. Ankara law professor Ilyas Dogan believes the detentions are politically motivated.“They have no concrete evidence,” said Dogan, who is representing six Uighurs now in deportation centers, including Metseydi. “They're not being serious.”Even if the bill is ratified, Dogan doubts there would be mass deportations, given widespread public sympathy for the Uighurs in Turkey. But he believes the chances of individuals being deported would go up significantly.Because of shared cultural ties, Turkey has long been a safe haven for the Uighurs, a Turkic group native to China’s far west Xinjiang region. Turkish President Recep Erdogan denounced China’s treatment of the Uighurs as “genocide” over a decade ago.That all changed with an attempted coup in Turkey in 2016, which prompted a mass purge and alienated Erdogan from Western governments. Waiting to fill the void was China, which is loaning and investing billions in Turkey.Signs of strong economic ties abound, big and small: An exporter with business in China was appointed Turkey’s ambassador to Beijing. A Chinese-funded $1.7 billion coal plant is rising on the banks of Turkey’s Mediterranean sea. Istanbul’s airport obtained the world’s first “Chinese Friendly Airport” certification, setting aside check-in counters to receive thousands of tourists from Shanghai and Beijing. And President Erdogan's once-fiery rhetoric has turned dull and diplomatic, praising China’s leaders for their assistance.China also began requesting the extradition of many more Uighurs from Turkey. In one leaked 2016 extradition request first reported by Axios and obtained independently by The Associated Press, Chinese officials asked for the extradition of a Uighur former cellphone vendor, accusing him of promoting the Islamic State terror group online. The vendor was arrested but eventually released and cleared of charges.Abdurehim Parac, a Uighur poet detained twice in the past few years, said even detention in Turkey was “hotel-like” compared to the “hellish” conditions he was subjected to during three years in Chinese prison. Imim was eventually released after a judge cleared his name. But he has difficulty sleeping at night out of fear that the extradition bill might be ratified, and called the pressure “unbearable”.“Death awaits me in China,” he said.Rising fears are already prompting an influx of Uighurs moving to Germany, the Netherlands, and other European countries. Some are so desperate they’re even sneaking across borders illegally, said Ali Kutad, who fled China for Turkey in 2016.“Turkey is our second homeland,” Kutad said. “We’re really afraid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-uighurs-fear-sellout-to-china-in-exchange-for-vaccine-101612511652611.html
05-02-2021||World||When will life return to normal? In 7 years at today's vaccine rates||When will the pandemic end? It’s the question hanging over just about everything since Covid-19 took over the world last year. The answer can be measured in vaccinations.Bloomberg has built the biggest database of Covid-19 shots given around the world, with more than 119 million doses administered worldwide. U.S. science officials such as Anthony Fauci have suggested it will take 70% to 85% coverage of the population for things to return to normal. Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker shows that some countries are making far more rapid progress than others, using 75% coverage with a two-dose vaccine as a target. Israel, the country with the highest vaccination rate in the world, is headed for 75% coverage in just two months. The U.S. will get there just in time to ring in the 2022 New Year (though North Dakota could get there six months sooner than Texas). With vaccinations happening more rapidly in richer Western countries than the rest of the globe, it will take the world as a whole seven years at the current pace.Bloomberg’s calculator provides a snapshot in time, designed to put today’s vaccination rates into perspective. It uses the most recent rolling average of vaccinations, which means that as vaccination numbers pick up, the time needed to hit the 75% threshold will fall. The calculations will be volatile, especially in the early days of the rollout, and the numbers can be distorted by temporary disruptions.For example, New York’s target date was briefly pushed out to 17 months this week after a winter blizzard prevented some from getting vaccinated (it’s now back down to 13 months). Likewise, Canada’s vaccination rate dropped by half in recent weeks following reports of delayed vaccine shipments. Based on Canada’s latest rate of inoculations it would take more than 10 years to reach 75% coverage. That might serve as a wake-up call to Canadian politicians and health officials, but it doesn’t mean the country is doomed to a decade of social distancing. Canada has contracts to buy more vaccine doses per person than any other country, and its vaccination rates are expected to climb. The pace is likely to accelerate further as more vaccines become available. Some of the world’s biggest vaccine-manufacturing hubs in India and Mexico are only just getting started. More than 8.5 billion doses of vaccine have been contracted by countries through more than 100 agreements tracked by Bloomberg. Only a third of countries have even begun their vaccination campaigns. Vaccinations protect against Covid-19 within a few weeks of getting the shots. But if just a few people in a community get vaccinated, the virus can continue to spread unchecked. As more people get the vaccine, groups of people start to build a collective defense against the virus so that isolated sparks of infection burn out instead of spreading into an outbreak. The concept is known as herd immunity. In the scientific community, there are conflicting definitions for when herd immunity is achieved. Is it when enough people are protected that it begins to have a measurable effect on the speed of transmission? That could begin well before 75% of people are fully vaccinated. Others define it as the point when outbreaks can no longer be sustained. For example, even if there’s a cluster of measles cases in an unvaccinated community, herd immunity prevents it from rippling across a country. How We Run the NumbersThe vaccines available today require two doses for full vaccination. Our calculations for coverage are based on two doses per person in the population but don't distinguish between first doses or second doses administered. Those breakdowns can distort daily vaccination rates and aren’t available in more than 20% of the countries we’re tracking.A new vaccine by Johnson & Johnson recently showed positive results using a single dose in a large clinical trial. If approved, we’ll adjust the number of doses required proportionate to its market share in each country. The vaccines haven’t been authorized for use in children — those studies are currently underway. Our calculator, like the virus, includes children in the population needed to be protected. One metric Bloomberg’s calculator doesn’t account for is any level of natural immunity that might result from recovering from Covid-19. It’s possible that hard-hit places might require a lower level of vaccination to prevent widespread transmission. While there’s evidence that people who recover from illness do retain some level of natural defenses, it’s unclear how much protection is offered or how long it might last. The vaccine is still recommended for people who have recovered from illness. The calculator is the latest feature from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Tracker. The projections are updated daily and are based on the average daily vaccinations in data gathered from 67 countries and the U.S. states and territories. Countries may be excluded when they are in the earliest stages of vaccinations or if they provide infrequent updates on their vaccination numbers. More than 119 million shots have been given. See the latest numbers on Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-life-return-to-normal-in-7-years-at-today-s-vaccine-rates-101612507662353.html
05-02-2021||World||India played a key role in shaping UNSC’s position on Myanmar coup: Sources||India is learnt to have played a pivotal role to “bridge” differing positions in talks that led to a statement from the UN Security Council on Thursday calling for the “immediate release” of Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi who has been detained by the military.India also left its distinctive stamp on the statement with key insertions, reflecting its known positions, drawing upon a long and strategic relationship with Myanmar, according to people familiar with the negotiations. They cited the use of the word “process” by the UNSC in its call for upholding “democratic institutions and process” as proof of India’s role, alongside the use of the phrase “dialogue and reconciliation”.India was able to engage with all members during the negotiations because of a general acknowledgement of its role, according to the same people. Washington has said it has had “daily ongoing conversations” with New Delhi since the military coup last Monday.The statement issued by the UNSC followed intense negotiations with China’s acquiescence not clear until the final hours on Thursday. There was some finger-pointing over a leaked draft statement, which triggered speculation that China and Russia were blocking it. China slammed it later, saying it was “shocked and baffled by the leak and the irresponsible rumours”.The western powers in the 15-member council had pitched for a more “condemnatory” statement, according to the people familiar with the talks. A leaked draft prepared by the UK, which holds the UNSC’s rotational chair for February, had described the overthrow of Suu Kyi, her arrest and related developments as a “military coup”, which has legal ramifications and triggers punitive measures. The United States has already decided to call the overthrow a “military coup” and is considering new curbs and sanctions.Other members such as Russia, China and Vietnam “didn’t want a situation where you start condemning and it becomes counterproductive” and they wanted to “be constructive”, according to the same people.India’s own view was that “the Security Council’s pronouncements should not become counterproductive (and) it has to be constructive”, they added.The UNSC statement, which is non-binding, said the members “expressed deep concern at the declaration of the state of emergency imposed in Myanmar by the military on February 1 and the arbitrary detention of members of the government” – including Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and others. It added, “They called for the immediate release of all those detained.”In the leaked draft, as reported by POLITICO, this paragraph was stronger and had said the members expressed “deep concern at the state of emergency imposed by the Myanmar military on February 1, and the detention of members of the legitimately elected civilian government, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, and civil society”.The draft had then gone on to say the members “condemn the military coup” and that they urge coup leaders to “immediately release those unlawfully detained”.That language, strong and forceful as it was, did not make it into the final statement. India played a key role there, based on its strategic relationship with Myanmar, ensuring what was acceptable to all the members, according to the people who spoke on condition of anonymity.The challenge, the people said, was how to you find that bridge between the two positions. “It is not as much language as what is acceptable to the 15,” one of the people familiar with the talks said, referring to the 15 members of the UNSC.“The members of the Security Council emphasised the need for the continued support of the democratic transition in Myanmar,” the UNSC statement said. “They stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. They encouraged the pursuance of dialogue and reconciliation in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-played-a-key-role-in-shaping-unsc-s-position-on-myanmar-coup-sources-101612503254355.html
05-02-2021||World||UN experts say Covid-19 upped extremist threats in conflicts||The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the threat from the Islamic State and al-Qaida extremist groups in conflict areas including Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, but the threat remains comparatively low in non-conflict areas despite a series of attacks in Europe, UN experts said in a new report.The panel of experts said in a report to the UN Security Council circulated Thursday that the threat continued to rise in conflict zones in the last half of 2020 because “the pandemic inhibited forces of law and order more than terrorists” who were able to move and gather freely despite Covid-19 restrictions.The panel said UN member states, which it didn't name, assess that as restrictions from the pandemic ease in various locations, “a rash of pre-planned attacks may occur.”“The economic and political toll of the pandemic, its aggravation of underlying drivers of violent extremism and its expected impact on counter-terrorism efforts are likely to increase the long-term threat everywhere,” the experts warned.The panel said Iraq and Syria remain “the core area” for the Islamic State group — also known as IS and ISIL -- and Syria’s northwest Idlib region where al-Qaida has affiliates is “a source of concern.”But the experts said Afghanistan remains the country “worst affected by terrorism in the world.”Despite initial optimism after the Feb. 29, 2020 agreement between the United States and the Taliban and the beginning of direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban last September, the panel said the situation in the country “remains challenging.”More than 600 Afghan civilians and 2,500 members of the country’s security forces have been killed in attacks since last Feb. 29, the experts said, and “terrorist activities and radical ideology continue to be a potential source of threats to the region and globally.”The panel quoted unidentified UN member states as saying the current number of ISIL fighters has fallen to between 1,000 and 2,200.While prospects of reviving its former offensive and holding territory “appear remote” ISIL has claimed responsibility for many recent high-profile attacks, it said.“Al-Qaida assesses that its future in Afghanistan depends upon its close ties to the Taliban, as well as the success of Taliban military operations in the country,” the experts said, estimating the number of al-Qaida members and their affiliates in the country at between 200 and 500 spread across at least 11 provinces.The panel said: “Afghanistan remains important to both ISIL and al-Qaida, and the peace process key to suppressing the long-term threat from both.”In Iraq and Syria, the experts said there is no indication that ISIL will be able to reconstitute its self-declared “caliphate” that once spanned a third of both Iraq and Syria and was defeated in 2017 “in the short to medium term."But they said the extremist group “will certainly exploit its capacity to remain in a region characterized by limited stabilization and reconstruction prospects.”An estimated 10,000 ISIL fighters remain active in Iraq and Syria “waging a sustained insurgency straddling the borders between the two countries,” the panel said.The majority of fighters are in Iraq but face pressure from the country’s security forces “rendering the country more difficult for ISIL operations” in comparison with Syria where the de-escalation zone in northwest Idlib remains “a limited safe haven,” it said.Elsewhere in the Mideast, the panel said al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula suffered setbacks in late 2020 and ISIL in Yemen suffered “substantial losses” in July and August, including its leader Abu Al-Walid Al-Adeni.The experts said Israel’s recent normalization of relations with some Arab countries “was used as a rallying narrative by terrorist organizations in the region” including al-Qaida groups which condemned leaders of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and called on their followers “to retaliate by attacking foreign interests in the region.” An ISIL spokesman also called on followers “to attack foreign nationals in Gulf states” though none have been reported yet, they said.The panel said the extremist groups have made progress recently mainly in Africa.“While terrorism continues to spread in West Africa, the region of Cabo Delgado in Mozambique is among the most concerning areas,” it said.In Cabo Delgado, the experts said fighters from the Islamic State Central Africa Province have taken over towns and villages, continue to hold the port of Mocimboa da Praia despite a sustained government offensive.Elsewhere in Africa, the panel said an ISIL affiliate “remains resilient in northeast Sinal despite heavy Egyptian military pressure.” In the Sahel, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara “suffered significant attrition” in confrontations and as a result of counter-terrorism operations but “its command-and-control capacity remains effective,” the experts said. And in Somalia Al-Shabab continues to target military operations and civilians.In Europe, the experts said attacks in Austria, France, Germany and Switzerland between September and November “underscored the enduring threat” from extremists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-say-covid-19-upped-extremist-threats-in-conflicts-101612500593302.html

Tournament officials on Friday said nearly all of them have so far tested negative for the virus.Australia has reported just under 29,000 Covid-19 cases and 909 deaths, far fewer than many other developed countries, because of strict border controls, widespread testing, social distancing rules and lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-ease-caps-on-returning-citizens-perth-exits-covid-19-lockdown-101612500437464.html
05-02-2021||World||Myanmar junta arrests senior member of ousted ruling party||A senior member of Myanmar's deposed ruling party has become the latest prominent politician arrested as the country's new military government confronts continuing resistance to its seizure of power.Win Htein, 79, is a longtime confidante of the ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and had publicly called for civil disobedience in opposition to Monday’s coup.He was arrested at his home in Yangon and and taken to the capital Naypyitaw, Kyi Toe, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, said Friday on his Facebook page.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, at least 133 officials or lawmakers and 14 civil society activists had been detained by the military in connection with its takeover. The NLD has said Suu Kyi and ousted President Win Myint are being held under charges that allow for their detention until mid-February.Win Htein told the Myanmar-language service of Britain's BBC radio in a call early Friday that he was being detained for sedition, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.“They don’t like what I’ve been talking about. They are afraid of what I’m saying,” he told the BBC.Also read| Fears raised over facial recognition use at Moscow protestsThe military government on Thursday morning had blocked access to Facebook in an evident effort to thwart protest organizing. Facebook is how most people access the internet in Myanmar and the company urged that it be restored.Still, signs of resistance were evident. Medical personnel have declared they won’t work for the military government. Anti-coup graffiti appeared in Yangon as well as flash protests on the streets, and a spirited protest by about 20 people occurred outside a medical school in Mandalay. Three people were arrested there, and Twitter posts that could not be verified said people were detained over the Yangon protests as well.Thousands of people in the capital Naypyitaw joined a rally in support of the military coup on Thursday, the latest of a number of events that aim to project an image of popular acceptance of the power grab.The takeover has been criticized by President Joe Biden and others internationally who pushed for the elected government to be restored.“The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized, release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications, and refrain from violence,” Biden said Thursday at the U.S. State Department in Washington, using Myanmar’s former name.Also read| Myanmar coup: UNSC calls for release of Aung San Suu Kyi, politiciansThe U.N. Security Council, in its first statement on the matter, “stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.” While the U.S. and others have described the military's actions as a coup, the Security Council's unanimous statement did not.The military seized power shortly before a new session of Parliament was to convene on Monday, declaring its actions were legal and constitutional because Suu Kyi's government had refused to address voting irregularities.

05-02-2021||World||Resistance to coup grows despite Myanmar's block of Facebook||Myanmar’s new military government blocked access to Facebook as resistance to Monday's coup surged amid calls for civil disobedience to protest the ousting of the elected government and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.Facebook is how most people access the internet in Myanmar and the company urged that it be restored.The military seized power shortly before a new session of Parliament was to convene on Monday and detained Suu Kyi and other top politicians. The takeover has been criticized by President Joe Biden and others internationally who are pushing for the elected government to be restored.“The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized, release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications, and refrain from violence,” Biden said at the US State Department in Washington, using Myanmar's former name.The UN Security Council, in its first statement on the matter, “stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.” While the US and others have described the military's actions as a coup, the Security Council's unanimous statement did not.The military has said it acted lawfully and constitutionally because the government had refused to address its complaints that last November’s general election, in which Suu Kyi’s party won a landslide victory, was marred by widespread voting irregularities. The state Election Commission has refuted the allegations.About 70 recently elected lawmakers defied the new military government on Thursday by convening a symbolic meeting of the Parliament that was prevented from opening. They signed their oaths of office at a government guesthouse in the capital, Naypyitaw, where about 400 of them were detained in the aftermath of the takeover. They have since been told they can return to their home districts.The unofficial convening was a symbolic gesture to assert that they, not the military, are the country’s legitimate lawmakers.Some expressed their anger and their determination to resist the coup as they left the guesthouse.“This violates the human rights of the whole citizenry. This is not a coup. This is a treason against the government. I will have to say that this is state treason,” said Khin Soe Soe Kyi, a member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party.The military put all state powers into the hands of the junta, including legislative functions, during a one-year state emergency. It also plans to form a new election commission to investigate its allegations of voting irregularities, to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency and to turn over power to the winner.Anti-coup graffiti appeared in the country's biggest city with “Don’t want dictatorship”’ scrawled on a wall on a busy street, and Yangon residents banged pots and pans and honked car horns in a noise protest for a third night.In Mandalay, a northern city known for its activist politics, a spirited protest by about 20 people in front of the University of Medicine was broken up by police. Three were arrested.Medical personnel have declared they won’t work for the military government. Health workers are highly respected for their work during the coronavirus pandemic that is taxing the country’s dangerously inadequate health system.The protests have revived a song associated with a failed 1988 uprising against military dictatorship. Myanmar was under military rule for five decades after a 1962 coup, and Suu Kyi’s five years as leader have been its most democratic period since them, despite continued use of repressive colonial-era laws.Videos posted on social media showed medical personnel and others singing “Kabar Makyay Bu” — or “We Won’t Be Satisfied Until the End of the World” — sung to the tune of “Dust in the Wind,” a 1977 song by the US rock group Kansas.Thousands of people in the capital Naypyitaw joined a rally in support of the military coup on Thursday, the latest of a number of events that aim to project an image of popular acceptance of the power grab.But Suu Kyi, the daughter of an independence hero and a pro-democracy activist for more than three decades, remains the country's most popular politician. Her party said the charge against her is possessing illegally imported walkie-talkies, which were found at her house and were believed to be used by her bodyguards.The charge, which carries a penalty of up to three years in prison, allows her to be held in custody until at least Feb. 15. Ousted President Win Myint is being held on a charge of violating a natural disaster management law. Suu Kyi is believed to under house arrest at her residence.Facebook users said service disruptions began late Wednesday night.“Telecom providers in Myanmar have been ordered to temporarily block Facebook. We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with family and friends and access important information,” Facebook said in a statement.In 2018, Facebook removed several accounts linked to Myanmar’s military, including that of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the new government's leader, because their content appeared to fuel hatred toward the Muslim Rohingya minority.

05-02-2021||World||Biden calls for expanded efforts to protect LGBTQ rights globally||US President Joe Biden on Thursday issued a presidential memorandum aimed at expanding protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and intersex (LGBTQI) people worldwide, including potentially through the use of financial sanctions."All human beings should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear no matter who they are or whom they love," said the memorandum, building on a 2011 directive issued when Biden was serving as vice president."The United States belongs at the forefront of this struggle - speaking out and standing strong for our most dearly held values," the memorandum said.While a presidential memorandum is largely symbolic, Biden campaigned on a pledge to pass LGBTQ rights legislation known as the Equality Act in the first 100 days of his administration and to make LGBTQ rights a top priority.The memo directs US agencies working abroad to work harder to combat the criminalisation by foreign governments of LGBTQ status or conduct, and directs the State Department to include anti-LGBTQ violence, discrimination and laws in its annual human rights report.Also read| World food price index rises in January, at highest level since July 2014: FAOIt calls for increased efforts to ensure that LGBTQ asylum seekers have equal access to protection, expanded training for US federal personnel, and potential increased use of priority referrals to expedite resettlement of vulnerable people.And it instructs agencies to consider appropriate responses, including the full range of diplomatic tools, and potentially financial sanctions and visa restrictions, when foreign governments restricted the rights of LGBTQ people.Biden announced the push during a forceful speech at the State Department, vowing to rebuild US credibility worldwide."To further repair our moral leadership, I’m also issuing a presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally," he said."We'll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals, included by combating criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers."Biden's campaign pledge included protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, ensuring fair treatment in the justice system and advancing LGBTQ rights globally.Biden has already issued an executive order that extends existing federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ people.White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said Biden “stands by” his pledge to sign the Equality Act in his first 100 days but noted that Congress would need to take action to pass a bill first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-calls-for-expanded-efforts-to-protect-lgbtq-rights-globally-101612498792178.html

The company's chief scientific officer, Paul Stoffels, said last month J&J was on track to roll out the vaccine in March."Upon authorisation of our investigational Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, we are ready to begin shipping," Stoffels said in a statement announcing the application.J&J said it had rolling submissions with several global health agencies and would submit a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application with the European Medicines Agency in the coming weeks.J&J's application raised hopes for fighting a pandemic that has claimed more than 451,145 American lives and over 2,271,152 worldwide.Also read| Social distancing might be more beneficial for individuals during pandemicShares of Johnson & Johnson rose about 1% in extended trading on Thursday, while Moderna was down 0.7% and Pfizer stock was little changed.The United States has agreed to pay $1 billion for 100 million doses, which J&J said it expected to supply in the first half of the year. The United States also has the option of purchasing an additional 200 million doses.The company said it has doses ready for delivery upon emergency approval. It aims to deliver 1 billion doses in 2021 with production in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India.In J&J's trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers conducted in eight countries, the level of protection against Covid-19 was 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa where variants are circulating.Those results compare with the 95% effectiveness of the two-dose vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech SE and Moderna.However, both those trials were conducted mainly in the United States and before the spread of new variants.J&J's main study goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization.J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response.The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA) that requires it to be stored in a freezer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-files-covid-19-vaccine-application-with-us-fda-101612494404649.html

05-02-2021||World||PDM announces march against 'puppet' Pak government on March 26||The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Thursday announced a long march against Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government on March 26. The march is seen as one of the major components of the opposition's anti-government movement, which began last year.According to Dawn, the alliance's leadership in Islamabad, PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said the opposition parties in the PDM will contest the upcoming Senate elections jointly."Caravans of long march will leave for Islamabad from across the country on March 26," Rehman said and added that the PDM had decided that "we will contest the Senate elections jointly; there will be a joint strategy for it and we will not compete against each other. We will field joint candidates."Dawn further reported that the opposition alliance chief said that the PDM will decide about the Pakistan Peoples Party's suggestion to move a no-confidence motion against the prime minister, as well as about resigning from assemblies, after the Senate elections.Rehman said that the opposition parties had decided to "stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the common man" against the rulers, whom he held responsible for a steep rise in the prices of electricity, gas, petrol and food items.Rehman and the alliance also rejected the one-member inquiry commission comprising retired Supreme Court Justice Azmat Saeed Sheikh set up by the government to probe the Broadsheet scandal, and "declares it an attempt by the government to mask its corruption", he added.The Broadsheet LLC, based in the Isle of Man, was hired by the NAB (National Accountability Bureau) during Musharraf's regime to trace out hidden assets of Pakistanis in foreign countries. The NAB signed an agreement with the Broadsheet but terminated it in 2003.The scandal proved that Pakistan has been plagued by corruption. Instead of targeting the corrupt, the Broadsheet was used for political gains and safe passage was given to the corrupt people to escape accountability through National Reconciliation Ordinance.Demanding an immediate decision in the Pakistan government's foreign funding case, Rehman said the prime minister's call for an open trial in the case was a "drama" because 18 of the party's bank accounts identified by the State Bank were being kept secret, according to Dawn."The opposition will continue its protest against the behaviour of the speaker and the chairman in the National Assembly and Senate and we will not cooperate with them in running proceedings of the house at any cost," the PDM president added.He said Transparency International, whose analysis Prime Minister Imran used to laud in the past, had today "declared him a certified thief".Accusing Imran Khan of seeking the biggest National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) in the foreign funding case, the PDM chief said "Foreign funding case is the biggest scandal in the country's history and Imran Khan is the main accused in the case."Pakistan Peoples' Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Sunday called upon the joint opposition party alliance to "force the removal of puppets", referring to Imran Khan and his cabinet.The PDM had organised several rallies including those in Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta, Multan, and Lahore since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pdm-announces-march-against-puppet-pak-government-on-march-26-101612491414117.html

It's a difficult time for me. I want to have thought things through a lot before I make decisions," Merkel told RTL/n-tv.Facing fierce criticism from some German media, especially top-selling daily Bild, Merkel had earlier spoken to a group of Germans about the crisis and effects of the lockdown, including some distraught parents who were struggling to cope.Yet Merkel, who won praise for her handling of the first wave of the crisis, warned that although the situation was moving in the right direction, patience was still needed."I see some light at the end of the tunnel ... But we must be very, very careful to ensure so many people don't die on the last stretch," she said, adding it was too soon to say how long Germany's strict lockdown would be needed."I would love to impart some good news," she said. "But there is no point in awakening false hope so I always try to be realistic," she said.Germany has registered more than 2.2 million cases and nearly 60,000 deaths related to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-do-wake-up-at-night-germany-s-merkel-kept-awake-by-coronavirus-decisions-101612487299232.html
05-02-2021||World||In Biden's first diplomatic address, 'message' for Russia and China||U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday promised a new era after the scattershot foreign policy of his predecessor, Donald Trump, declaring "America is back" on the global stage in his first diplomatic address as president.In his speech, Biden signaled aggressive approaches to China and Russia, urged Myanmar's military leaders to halt their coup , and declared an end to U.S. support for a Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen."American leadership must meet this new moment of advancing authoritarianism, including the growing ambitions of China to rival the United States and the determination of Russia to damage and disrupt our democracy. We must meet the new moment ... accelerating global challenges from the pandemic to the climate crisis to nuclear proliferation," said Biden.Trump angered European and Asian leaders with tariffs, fracturing of global alliances, and threats to withdraw U.S. troops. He did little to push back against a wave of authoritarianism in some countries.After a Trump-inspired mob attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, protesting Biden's election win, foreign allies and rivals alike expressed doubts about the health of American democracy.Biden's speech on Thursday was a full-throated attempt to vanquish those doubts, and convince Americans of the value of a forceful international approach."Investing in our diplomacy isn't something we do just because it's the right thing to do for the world," he said. "We do it in order to live in peace, security and prosperity. We do it because it's in our own naked self-interest."Biden's choice of the State Department as venue for his first big diplomatic address was an important symbol of the value he places in career diplomats, who Trump largely saw as opponents."American alliances are our greatest asset. And leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies and key partners once again," Biden said.Biden in his early days has attempted to repair what he has called the damage to America's standing around the world, rolling back Trump policies. He is working to revive the Iran deal, and renewed U.S. membership in the Paris accord and the World Health Organization.He challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin."I made it clear to President Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyberattacks, poisoning its citizens, are over," he said.Trump had initially sought a warm relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping but differences over trade, Hong Kong and what the U.S. military calls Beijing's destabilizing and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea prompted a rift.China, which is expanding its military and working to grow its influence around the world, is perhaps Biden's biggest international challenge as he begins his presidency. He called Beijing "our most serious competitor.""We'll confront China's economic abuses, counter its aggressive, coercive action to push back on China's attack on human rights, intellectual property and global governance. But we're ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so," he said.Not all U.S. allies may be happy at the sharp turn in U.S. foreign policy, including Poland, where Trump once pledged to deploy U.S. troops, or a host of nations that have criticized heavy-handed intervention by Washington in the past."We are a country that does big things. American diplomacy makes it happen and our administration is ready to take up the mantle and lead once again," said Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-touts-muscular-foreign-policy-in-first-diplomatic-speech-101612485874039.html

They called for the immediate release of all those detained, the Security Council said in a statement.It emphasized the need for the continued support of the democratic transition in Myanmar and further stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law."The members of the Security Council expressed concern at the restrictions on civil society, journalists and media workers. They also called for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need, including through the re-establishment of United Nations relief flights," the statement added.Council reiterated their strong support to regional organizations, in particular, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and welcomed the ASEAN Chair's Statement dated 1 February. They also reiterated their support to the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar for her good offices."The members of the Security Council reaffirmed their strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Myanmar," the statement read further.Days after the coup by Myanmar military, the police on Wednesday charged San Suu Kyi for "illegally" importing at least 10 walkie-talkies.The New York Times reported an official from Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party as confirming that the leader has been charged with an obscure infraction: having illegally imported at least 10 walkie-talkies.Myanmar's military launched the coup on Monday morning after days of escalating tensions between the government and the military in the aftermath of last November's general elections.San Suu Kyi-led National League for Democracy (NLD) claimed an overwhelming victory in the polls, securing over 80 per cent of the seats, according to media reports. However, the military and some political parties disputed the results, alleging that the polls were marred by irregularities.According to media reports, the detentions started in the early hours of Monday (local time), with political leaders held in Yangon and other cities across Myanmar, and soldiers said to be out on the streets and at prominent landmarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-unsc-calls-for-release-of-aung-san-suu-kyi-politicians-101612484798032.html
05-02-2021||World||Trump rejects call to testify at his impeachment trial||Former President Donald Trump's lawyers on Thursday rejected a request from Democrats to testify at his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate next week, dismissing their invitation as a "public relations stunt."Democrats in the House of Representatives accuse Trump of inciting insurrection when he urged supporters to "fight" his election defeat before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, fought with police and sent lawmakers scrambling for safety.Five people died, including a Capitol Police officer."The president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding," Trump adviser Jason Miller told Reuters. In an open letter, Trump's attorneys, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, called the request a "public relations stunt."The attorneys this week rejected the impeachment charge and asserted that Trump's claims his Nov. 3 election defeat was the result of widespread fraud - which were baseless - were protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.Democratic lawmaker Jamie Raskin, the lead House impeachment manager, wrote in a letter to the Republican Trump and his attorney inviting the former president, who left office on Jan. 20, to provide testimony under oath."If you decline this invitation, we reserve any and all rights, including the right to establish at trial that your refusal to testify supports a strong adverse inference regarding your actions (and inaction) on January 6, 2021," Raskin wrote.Castor told Reuters that Trump was within his rights in rejecting the request."The burden is on the House to prove their case," Castor said. "I’m not going to help them meet their burden."Several senators said it would have been a bad idea for Trump to testify. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a vocal Trump ally, told reporters: "I don't think that would be in anybody's interest."For two months after losing his re-election bid to Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump loudly argued that he lost due to rampant electoral fraud, claims that were rejected by multiple courts and state election officials.Trump's lawyers and most Republican senators have challenged the constitutionality of the trial. They have said the Senate does not have the authority to hear the case because Trump has already left office and cannot be removed.Such an argument would allow Republican senators - who hold half the seats in the chamber - to vote against Trump's conviction on procedural concerns instead of directly supporting his comments.A two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate would have to support the charge to convict Trump, meaning 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats in backing it.The Senate impeachment trial of Trump, the first U.S. president to be impeached twice, is due to begin on Tuesday.Trump's first impeachment trial, on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress after he appeared to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, resulted in an acquittal last year by the Senate, where Republicans held the majority at the time and denied Democrats' attempts to present witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rejects-call-to-testify-at-his-impeachment-trial-101612484526020.html
05-02-2021||World||Biden set to accept more refugees after years of Trump restrictions||U.S. President Joe Biden will seek to raise annual refugee admissions to 125,000 in the coming fiscal year, he said on Thursday, a more than eight-fold increase after former President Donald Trump slashed levels to historic lows.Speaking at the U.S. State Department, Biden also said he would approve an executive order to build up the country's capacity to accept refugees in the face of "unprecedented global need."Biden has pledged to restore the United States' historic role as a country that welcomes refugees from around the world after four years of cuts to admissions under Trump. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates there are 1.4 million refugees worldwide in urgent need of resettlement.During his presidency, Trump portrayed refugees as a security threat and a drain on U.S. communities as he took a series of measures to restrict legal immigration.Biden is confronting a refugee program hobbled by Trump's policies, which led to the closure of resettlement offices and the reassignment of program staffers. Trump's actions also disrupted the pipeline of refugees to the United States, a situation exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.Biden said the goal of 125,000 refugee admissions - up from 15,000 this year under Trump - would be for the coming fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2021."It's going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged," Biden said. "But that's precisely what we're going to do."Biden also intends to propose increasing the refugee ceiling for this year following a consultation with Congress, according to a White House fact sheet released on Thursday.Biden's refugee order will rescind Trump policies that "limited refugee resettlement and required excessive vetting of applicants," according to the fact sheet.Among those policies will be a 2019 Trump order that required U.S. states and localities to consent to receive refugees, two people familiar with the matter said.The rollback of that Trump order will be partly symbolic since a Maryland-based federal judge blocked it nationwide more than a year ago, a decision that was upheld in January by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Biden's order, the text of which was not immediately available, will take steps to increase U.S. capacity to process refugee applications, the fact sheet said.The order is expected to highlight the role of climate change in the displacement of people around the world, the people familiar with it said.Former President Barack Obama, whom Biden served under as vice president, set a goal of admitting 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. But Trump cut that number by more than half after taking office months later and steadily reduced refugee admissions in each year of his presidency that followed.Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a Maryland-based refugee resettlement agency, said in a statement that Biden's decision to raise the refugee ceiling would be "lifesaving for hundreds of thousands fleeing violence and persecution."Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a Republican with hardline immigration views, criticized Biden's planned refugee increase in a written statement, saying it would "put American jobs and safety at risk during a pandemic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-set-to-accept-more-refugees-after-years-of-trump-restrictions-101612484288208.html

The United States military will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,” Keiley said.Taiwan’s defence ministry confirmed the passage without identifying the vessel.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the country was “closely monitoring” the situation. Wang said China would “…continue to be on high alert at all times, respond to all threats and provocations at any moment, and will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity”.Beijing views any ships passing through the strait a breach of its sovereignty; the US and many other nations view the route as international waters open to all.China claims the democratically run Taiwan as its own territory and has repeatedly expressed anger as Washington stepped up support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships.On December 31, two US warships sailed through the strait, drawing a protest from Beijing. It came almost two weeks after a Chinese aircraft carrier group used the same waterway.Tensions between the two countries have risen in the last few years, in part as a result of the pandemic blamed on Beijing by former president Donald Trump, and the trade war.The latest passage warship comes two days after China’s top diplomat called for Beijing and Washington to put relations back on a constructive path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-biden-first-us-warship-sails-via-taiwan-strait-101612469104697.html

Approximately ₹30,000 subsidies are to be given for 2/3-wheelers while ₹1.5 lakh for 4-wheelers. We are starting the 'Switch Delhi' campaign today to make people aware of clean vehicles," Kejriwal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-floats-tender-to-set-up-500-ev-charging-points-at-100-locations-101612545707172.html
05-02-2021||India||Congress says ‘nails’ at Delhi’s border will not deter farmers||The Indian National Congress while reiterating its support to the farmers and their 'Chakka jam' scheduled on February 6 criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party and said that farmers will not be afraid of the barricades installed at Delhi’s borders.“The farmers who have made a place in the 'hearts' of India will not be afraid of the 'nails' of the BJP government,” Congress’ tweeted on its social media handle, referring to the barricades and spikes placed at Delhi’s borders aimed at stopping farmers from crossing into Delhi. Delhi Police have stated that these barricades have been put up as a precautionary measure after a planned tractor march turned violent on January 26.The party has already extended its support to the road blockade proposed by the protesting farmers, which will be held between 12pm to 3pm across the nation, except in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The farmers’ unions have assured that essential services will not be affected during the blockade.Opposition parties have criticised the government after Delhi Police set up barricades and voiced their protests against the farm laws in Parliament which led to the several disruptions in Lok Sabha proceedings for the fourth day in a row.Congress MP from West Bengal Adhir Ranjan Choudhury demanded that the government should hold a standalone session to discuss the farm laws. “We've urged the government for a separate discussion in Lok Sabha over farmers’ agitation. All kinds of things are discussed in Motion of Thanks to the President’s address. Our only demand is that separate discussion be held over farmers’ issue after Motion of Thanks,” Choudhury was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“We do want a discussion but the government should say that there will be a stand-alone discussion on agriculture,” Choudhury further added.People familiar with the developments told news agency ANI that the government on Friday agreed to discuss the issues related to the farmers’ agitation and farm laws in Parliament when the session reconvenes.Union minister for agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar criticised the Opposition and said that during discussions held in the Lok Sabha none of the lawmakers was able to point out the flaws in the farm laws. He said, “As far as the farm laws are concerned, I was in Rajya Sabha today and I noticed that no one is ready to say what is ‘black’ in the ‘black laws’. If you are protesting against the law, then discussion should be held on its provisions. Unfortunately, this is not happening.”Farmers have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 for more than two months at Delhi’s borders. They fear that these laws will decrease farmer incomes and pave the way for corporate farming along with hurting government procurement of crop yields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-says-nails-at-delhi-s-border-will-not-deter-spirit-of-farmers-101612544737159.html
05-02-2021||India||Mamata presents vote on account, announces pension for all ahead of Bengal polls||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Friday sought a vote on account for ₹2.99 lakh crore as she opened the doors of state exchequer for common people ahead of the assembly polls, showering the farm sector with sops and wooing the elderly and widows with pensions.The opposition BJP staged a noisy walkout shouting 'Jai Shri Ram' slogan, while the Left-Congress combine boycotted her speech. Both termed the largesse an "election manifesto".Banerjee presented the vote on account in the absence of Finance Minister Amit Mitra, who is not keeping well.The estimates for the first few months of the new fiscal, starting April, will be taken up for discussion over the next two days before the assembly passes it.Banerjee, while criticising the Centre for not extending "necessary help", insisted the state tirelessly undertook welfare measures for its people.The TMC supremo, who is locked in a tug of war with challenger BJP ahead of the elections over claiming the legacy of Bengal icons, said her government will construct an Azad Hind Munument in Kolkata, Jai Hind Bhavans in districts and a State Planning Commission after legendary freeedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose. She announced an overall outlay of ₹215 crore for the projects.Seeking to reach out to a vast section of the electorate, Banerjee announced old age pension for all people above the age of 60 years and widows aged over 18. An amount of ₹1,000 crore was earmarked for this. She, however, did not specify the amount they would get as pension.She said her government proposed to create 1.5 crore new jobs.Recalling Bose's famous slogan "Give me blood, I will give you freedom", she asked the people to "keep faith in me, and I shall give you unconditional and selfless service with utmost dedication".She said 20 lakh houses will be built for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and their dwellings upgraded for which ₹1,500 crore will be allocated.Banerjee said ₹50 crore has been allocated for madrasas recognised by the government but not aided by it.Seeking to reach out to farmers against the backdrop of peasants' protests, Banerjee said annual assistance to each farming family under the 'Krishak Bandhu Scheme' will be raised from ₹5,000 to ₹6,000."We also request the central government to immediately release and distribute the financial assistance under the Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana," she said. The West Bangal government had only recently agreed to implement the scheme in the state.The chief minister said the Swasthya Sathi card scheme of the state government which provides for cashless health cover, will be renewed every three years. ₹1,500 crore has been allocated for the scheme, she said.She said 100 new schools will be set up in tea gardens of the state besides 100 new English medium schools in areas with concentrated population of SC and ST communities.Free rations to people distressed because of Covid-19 will continue even after June 2021 for which ₹1,500 crore has been allocated.She also announced setting up of community kitchens named 'Maa' for the state's poor and earmarked ₹100 crore for it. These kitchens will provide food at a nominal price, but did not specify the amount a beneficiary will have to pay for each meal.Banerjee announced creation of West Bengal Highway and Bridge Corporation which will be entrusted with construction of new bridges and highways. She also said ₹150 crore will be spent on upgrading the Andal airport.Rural roads spanning 46,000 km will be built over the next five years, she said."It seemed like the CM was presenting the annual budget and not a vote on account. It was absurd as she was making announcements without proper budgetary allocation," state BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.Left Front's leader in the House Sujan Chakraborty said it was "laughable" to see her announce ambitious schemes when the tenure of her government was to expire in a couple of months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-presents-vote-on-account-announces-pension-for-all-ahead-of-bengal-polls-101612544759422.html
05-02-2021||India||'India, Bangladesh have unique model for regional cooperation': Shringla||India and Bangladesh have forged a unique model for regional cooperation that withstood the problems of the Covid-19 crisis and facilitated robust exchanges in recent months, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Friday.Addressing the inaugural function of the 3rd Bangladesh Film Festival at Kolkata that Bangladesh information minister Hasan Mahmud attended, Shringla said the two countries were cooperating closely in dealing with the pandemic, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is looking forward to his visit to Dhaka in March to join the celebrations marking 50 years of Bangladesh’s independence.“India and Bangladesh have together charted a unique model for regional cooperation, quite unparalleled in South Asia. The India-Bangladesh bilateral relationship has withstood the test of time, and even as the world undergoes great upheaval in the post-pandemic era, our relationship grows from strength to strength, a fact clearly demonstrated by the robust exchanges that both sides had in recent months,” he said.Despite the limitations imposed by the pandemic, both countries had a successful prime minister-level virtual summit and a meeting of the Joint Consultative Commission co-chaired by the two foreign ministers.Also read: 4G Mubarak! tweets Abdullah with mobile internet services being restored in J-K“I was also able to travel twice to Dhaka last year to exchange views with our partners in Bangladesh. Cooperation is moving forward inexorably. Our prime minister is looking forward to his visit to Dhaka,” Shringla said.Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had also attended a virtual conference of leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) hosted by the Indian premier to evolve a coordinated response to the pandemic in the region.“Following the conference, we have had exchanges and training programmes for healthcare personnel and worked with Bangladesh for supplying PPE kits, masks and test kits. India-made vaccines are being supplied for the benefit of the people of Bangladesh,” Shringla said.A 122-member tri-services contingent from Bangladesh had joined the Republic Day parade last month, evoking the “inspiring memories of 1971, when the people of India and Bangladesh fought shoulder to shoulder against grave injustice and tyranny,” he added.Bangladesh’s father of the nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, played a key role in building bilateral relations and Shringla quoted from his speech in Kolkata on February 6, 1972, “This victory would not have been ours if the people of West Bengal, Tripura, Assam, Meghalaya did not extend their unstinting support to my people...This victory would not have been possible if the government of India had not been behind us. What you have done, we can never repay.”Shringla described 2021 as a momentous year for both countries, as Bangladesh is celebrating the birth centenary of Rahman, and commemorating the 50th anniversary of its Liberation War. The year also marks the 50th year of diplomatic ties and Prime Ministers Modi and pm Hasina have decided to jointly celebrate these events, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-have-unique-model-for-regional-cooperation-shringla-101612544476534.html

Union health ministry shared those video messages on its official Twitter handle.On the pace of vaccination, the National Task Force member said that the pace, which is fastest in the world, has been kept slow as the ministry wanted to take stock of the hiccups and gradually iron them out. "India has the capacity of immunising five to eight million people per day. We have inoculated over 17 crore children in a week several times a year during our pulse polio drive. But the pace has deliberately been kept low," he said.#LargestVaccineDrive #VaccineVarta Hello @_Sethi_Rishabh, here is my response to your question on the pace of COVID immunisation 👇 https://t.co/s9UiyE2oob pic.twitter.com/1vAK92NNUgOn the need of vaccination for those who have already had Covid-19, he said, "It has been found out in India that 1/3 of those who have contracted Covid-19 do not develop antibodies required. And even if one does, no one knows how long those antibodies are going to protect you," Dr Arora said.Second Covid-19 vaccine shot to be administered from Feb 13Talking about 'herd immunity' in Delhi, he said, "Nothing can be said with certainty on herd immunity and so this can't be an excuse to skip vaccination."Allaying fears over Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, which does not yet have the efficacy data, Dr Arora said, "Drug regulators across the world have this provision to grant emergency use authorisation to vaccines which have their phase one and phase 2 data. No corners have been cut in giving the authorisation. In fact, it has been found that Covaxin develops more immunity than many other vaccines."Answering questions on whether people suffering from co-morbidity issues should take the vaccines, Dr Arora said, "People with co-morbidity issues should take the vaccine as they are at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19. But if you have some doubts, one can consult a doctor before getting the dose."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-pace-deliberately-kept-low-explains-icmr-doctor-101612543998566.html

Trinamool Congress members remained seated on their benches.Around 4.15 PM, Birla adjourned the House till 6 PM.With no letup in the protests when the House reconvened in the evening, the Speaker adjourned its proceedings till Monday after his plea to opposition members to go back to their seats went unheeded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disruptions-continue-to-affect-lok-sabha-proceedings-on-day-4-101612541328288.html
05-02-2021||India||4G Mubarak! tweets Abdullah with mobile internet services being restored in J-K||High-speed mobile internet is being restored across Jammu and Kashmir after almost eighteen months. J-K government spokesman Rohit Kansal stated the same on Friday evening.In a tweet, Kansal, who is principal secretary PDD and spokesman of the J-K government, said, "4G mobile internet services being restored in entire J&K"."4G Mubarak! For the first time since Aug 2019 all of J&K will have 4G mobile data. Better late than never," tweeted NC vice president and former J-K chief minister, Omar Abdullah.4G Mubarak! For the first time since Aug 2019 all of J&K will have 4G mobile data. Better late than never.The demand for the restoration of high-speed internet has been growing in the Union territory from past many months, not only the local BJP leadership, Apni Party leader Altaf Bukhari and NC president Farooq Abdullah had also demanded restoration of 4G internet in J-K. Bukhari had recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. Recently, in the Unified Command headquarters meeting in winter capital Jammu, the decision to restore 4G in J-K was taken by the government.In August last year, highspeed internet was restored in two districts of Jammu and Kashmir after it was snapped by the government when the special status under Article 370 of the erstwhile state was revoked on August 5, 2019, and the region split into two Union territories.High-speed internet was restored in Ganderbal and Udhampur districts based on the parameters laid down by the Special Committee constituted by the Supreme Court on May 11, 2020.Also read: For flouting Covid-19 norms, organisers of Nadda’s meeting booked in KeralaEarlier, the two districts had been identified based on the inputs from the law enforcement agencies in the context of the parameters laid down by the Special Committee for considering calibrated easing of restrictions in limited and comparatively less sensitive geographical areas.Last year on August 11, the Centre had informed the Supreme Court that it will lift restrictions on high-speed 4G mobile internet services in one district each of Jammu and Kashmir divisions after August 15 on a trial basis. The Supreme Court was hearing a petition in June, filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals, a non-government organisation, which sought the initiation of contempt proceedings against the Centre and J-K administration for the failure to comply with the top court’s May 11 directions to review restrictions on mobile internet speed in the Union territory.Mobile phone, landline and internet services were disconnected in Jammu and Kashmir on August 4, 2019, a day before the Centre withdrew its special status and divided it into two Union territories — Jammu and Kashmir with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one.The government gradually restored the communication lines. Landlines were restored between mid-August and September 2019 and postpaid mobile services were back on October 14. Short messaging service (SMS) on all mobile phones in Kashmir, and broadband internet services in government-run hospitals were restored from January 1, 2020. 2G mobile internet services were restored across the Valley on January 25, 2020, around six months after the revocation of the special status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4g-mubarak-tweets-abdullah-with-mobile-internet-services-being-restored-in-jk-101612538733474.html

Earlier police also registered cases against organisers of the ‘Aisawarya Kerala Yatra’ led by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.When asked about this Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan justified the action saying the police were doing their duty. He said in minister’s public meeting all participants were checked and mandatory distancing was kept. "We have seen recently that the opposition leader was carried to the stage by party supporters. Such events never take place in CPI(M). He should have restrained over enthusiastic workers,” the CM said. Later Chennithala said there were two sets of law, one for the ruling party and another for opposition and his party will oppose it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-flouting-covid-19-norms-organisers-of-nadda-s-meeting-booked-in-kerala-101612535822445.html

Check here||The ministry of road transport and highways on Friday has issued a draft notification for the accreditation of driving training centres which will allow drivers to get their licenses without appearing for a test if they are from those particular centres. While the rule, which is still in draft, may seem that it intends to make getting driving licenses easier, it actually aims at producing specially trained drivers."Further, the Ministry has also provided that, any individual on successful completion of driver training from such centres, will be exempted from the requirement of driving test while applying for a driving licence," as per the official ministry release.The road transport ministry is celebrating road safety month from January 18 to February 17, 2021 to spread public awareness regarding road accidents and fatalities caused due to the negligence of road safety.The theme of the Road Safety Month this year is 'Sadak Suraksha-Jeevan Raksha'."The step will also help the transport industry to have specially trained drivers, which will improve their efficiency and reduce road accidents," the ministry in the release added.Also Read | Road safety network appeals for launch of new missionThe ministry also said that the draft notification dated January 29, 2021, has been uploaded on the official website of the ministry for public consultation and will be formally issued after this stage.The ministry aims to reduce road accidents in the country by half by the next four years. Union minister Nitin Gadkari addressing the National Road Safety Council meeting earlier this week said that reducing accidents is not a gradual process and every stakeholder should treat it as a top priority with immediate effect.The minister suggested a three-day compulsory training of engineers of the ministry, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Public Works Department (PWD) and several other agencies associated with road construction and management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-you-get-your-driving-licence-without-test-check-here-101612525907669.html

As per a notification issued by the AP government, panchayat polls would be held in 3 villages of Tala Ganjeipadar, Patu Sineri and Fagun Sineri villages under Kotia on February 13 and 17. The poll notification also changed their names to Ganjaibadra, Pattuchennuru and Pagulchennuru respectively.An embarrassed Odisha government on Thursday night transferred Koraput district collector Madhusudan Mishra and brought in Abdal Akhtar as the new collector.While over the last few years, Koraput district administration has extended mobile network and started road connectivity work to these disputed border villages, the Vizianagaram administration too started similar road development projects near the border at Salur.Odisha and Andhra Pradesh are locked in a territorial dispute over Kotia gram panchayat since 1960. Though Kotia Gram Panchayat has 28 revenue villages, Odisha mistakenly did not survey 21 villages during its formation in 1936. At the time of creation of Andhra Pradesh in the year 1955, those 21 villages were also not surveyed by Andhra resulting in perpetual dispute over those bordering villages.Meanwhile, opposition Congress slammed the state government for failing to take concrete steps to resolve the dispute. "If Andhra Pradesh conducts GP election and elects sarpanchs, Zilla Parishads and members here, nothing is more shameful than this. Most of the Kotia people are leaning towards Andhra as they are getting deprived of basic amenities from Odisha government. Andhra Pradesh is focussed on Kotia only for its gold mines. Locals of the region are also inclining towards the neighbouring State as Odisha government has done no concrete developmental works. Instead of just launching projects, CM Naveen should visit Kotia to review the ground situation,” said Congress MLA of Jeypore, Taraprasad Bahinipati.Former BJP leader from Koraput, Jayaram Pangi said earlier Andhra Pradesh used to nominate a sarpanch, ward members and samiti members in these villages. "However, from this year, they are formally conducting elections by setting booths, filing nomination and organising voting.”Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the state may have failed to grasp the importance of Kotia. “We have not given due importance to the developmental needs of the people of the area. I had visited Kotia earlier and discussed with the local people. I had also requested CM to call an all-party meeting on the issue of border dispute. This is the right time to resolve the dispute,” said Pradhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-unveils-welfare-projects-for-villages-caught-in-border-row-with-andhra-101612534974872.html

High-speed internet connection was disrupted in the erstwhile state in August 2019, before the Centre revoked the stat's special status by abrogating Article 370. On August 5, 2019, the state was turned into a union territory. The move to restrict high-speed internet services was taken back then and though 2G services were restored to several places, high-speed services were not restored. 4G mobile internet services being restored in entire J&K @diprjk4G internet services will be restored from Friday as J&K principal secretary (power and information) Rohit Kansal said in his tweet.In August 2020 — a year after suspension — the J&K administration started restoring high-speed internet services by few districts at a time. Ganderbal and Udhampur were the first districts to get high-speed internet.In April 2020, the Centre had told the Supreme Court that the decision on restoring 4G internet in J&K can not be made overlooking the militancy in Jammu and Kashmir.4G Mubarak!

"Better late than never," he wrote.The internet shutdown which was imposed on August 4, 2019, was a preventive measure. First, the landlines were restored in J&K.

05-02-2021||India||5 including 2 women held for extortion bid of ₹50 lakh from Kumaon jeweller||The Nainital police claimed to have solved a case on Friday in which ₹50 lakh was demanded from a woman jeweller in Haldwani in an extortion bid, police said.According to the police, a phone call was made from Sitarganj jail by a caller who is serving life imprisonment.Preeti Priyadarshani, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Nainital said, “Five people including two women have been arrested in an extortion case. A call was made from the central jail so we will seek remand of the prime accused shortly.”Reeta Khandelwal of Jai Guru Jewellers of Haldwani had lodged a complaint with Haldwani police station on Monday that a caller had demanded ₹50-lakh from her. He introduced himself as Dallu and threatened her of dire consequences if his demand was not fulfilled, she added.The SSP said the caller’s number was put under surveillance and the number was tracked to the central jail of Sitarganj but it was registered in the name of Durga Prasad of Rudrapur who sells socks as a vendor in the main market. When he was questioned, he revealed that he never used the SIM of the number.He also revealed that two men Mahendra Gangwar and Narendra Gangwar who sell SIMs near his shop took the relevant documents to revive his old SIM.Later, it came to light that Mahendra and Narendra handed over the revived SIM to their friend Deepak Rathore whose brother Rahul has been serving life imprisonment in central jail of Sitarganj, said the SSP.Earlier, Rahul who was in jail had planned to demand money from the rich to enhance his dominance in crime in the area. To implement the plan, he shared his thoughts with his friends Ankita and Anjali and asked them to arrange a fake SIM. Both used to visit the jail frequently to meet him, the SSP said.Ankita and Anjali contacted Rahul’s brother Deepak and revealed Rahul’s plan. Deepak arranged a SIM through his friends Mahendra and Narendra and handed it over to Ankita. Ankita later gave the SIM to Rahul in jail.Deepak Rathore and Mahendra of Khera colony Rudrapur, Narendra of Rampur, Ankita of Azamgarh and Anjali of Agra (UP), have all been arrested. All of them have been booked under IPC Sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) and 120B (whoever is a party to criminal conspiracy).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-including-2-women-held-for-extortion-bid-of-rs-50-lakh-from-kumaon-jeweller-101612529655530.html

Referring to the nails planted at the farmers’ protest site in Ghazipur, Chaudhury said the same nails will end up marking the ‘political coffin’ of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)."These are not nails being put on the roads going to Delhi, these are nails being put into the political coffin that is being made for the BJP," Chaudhury said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Chaudhury accused the government of not paying heed to their own politicians on the ground, who are in touch with the common people and can sense their rising anger."It is a totalitarian administration. They are not even listening to their own political people on the ground. If you speak to BJP MLAs or MPs off the record, they are not happy and they can feel the angst rising in the people of India, in the common man who voted for (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi," the former MP said.Chaudhury who is quite active on Twitter criticised Indian celebrities for releasing statements of solidarity following the international outrage on the government’s handling of the protests.“Celebrities who have pawned off their brains and now are tweeting similar statements should first look up the meaning of sovereignty. A nation’s power is diminished when the government is cruel towards its providers. Friends, let’s exercise control over our governments instead of letting governments control us.” Chaudhury tweeted on Friday.The Ghazipur border which is one of the three protest sites has witnessed heavy fortification and nails have been affixed to keep farmers from entering the protest site. On Thursday the nails were relocated to ensure farmers’ safety. DCP (east) Deepak Yadav told HT that, “The nails were fixed initially at a spot where people wouldn’t venture earlier. But now that some people are moving around that point, we fear that the nails could become a hazard for them. So, just to ensure their safety, we are removing them and fixing them elsewhere.”Chaudhury has been attending Kisan mahapanchayats and protest sites and had extended support to Bharatiya Kisan Union when the union was thinking of withdrawing protest from the Ghazipur site after being pressured by the local administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nails-on-bjp-s-political-coffin-rld-leader-on-farmers-protest-101612529087276.html

05-02-2021||India||Amid rumours of KTR taking over as Telangana CM, KCR calls party meet on Sunday||An extended state executive committee of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi has been convened in Hyderabad on Sunday amid intense speculation that party president K Chandrasekhar Rao will step down soon and anoint his son K T Rama Rao as the next chief minister of Telangana.An official statement from the party on Friday said the meeting would be held at 2 pm on Sunday at Telangana Bhavan, the state headquarters of the TRS, under the leadership of KCR, as the chief minister is popularly known.Apart from the state executive committee members, the meeting would also be attended by all the cabinet colleagues of KCR, MPs, MLAs and MLCs, state-level corporation chairpersons, Zilla Parishad chairpersons, mayors, municipal chairpersons, district cooperative central bank chairpersons and district cooperative marketing society presidents.The meeting will discuss issues like membership renewal, appointment of party committees from village-level to the state-level and election of party president etc. “Besides, arrangements to be made for the conduct of the party’s annual plenary on April 27 and other institutional issues will also be discussed at length,” the party statement said.The sudden decision of the TRS president to convene the state executive committee meeting and invite all major party functionaries comes at a time when party leaders have been openly talking about KTR becoming the next chief minister of the state.For the last few days, several party leaders including ministers and MLAs have been pitching for KTR, presently the working president of the TRS, taking over as the next chief minister. They said KTR had all the qualities of becoming the CM.While assembly deputy speaker T Padma Rao described KTR as “chief minister-in-waiting” and extended advance congratulations to him on a public platform, state health minister Eatala Rajender said in an interview to a local television channel that KTR would definitely become the CM soon and he had already been discharging 90 per cent of his father’s responsibilities.A senior leader of the TRS, on condition of anonymity, said there is every possibility that the topic of KTR replacing his father as the chief minister might come up for discussion at Sunday’s state executive committee meeting.“It could be a strategy of KCR to see that the issue is raised at the meeting and he would seek their opinions before taking a decision on announcing KTR as his successor, so that the entire transfer of power from father to son appears to be a democratic process,” the leader said.The executive committee meeting might also discuss revamping of the party organisational structure so as to entrust new responsibility in the party to KCR’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha, who got elected as legislative council member recently, and nephew T Harish Rao.However, there is still uncertainty over the timing of KCR stepping down in favour of his son as the chief minister. The party leaders are planning to celebrate KCR’s 67th birthday on February 17 in a big way, including carrying out a massive “homam” with 10,000 invitees at Lal Bahadur Stadium in Hyderabad.“There is talk in the party that he might hand over the reins to his son the following day. But there is also talk that he will resign in favour of KTR at the TRS plenary to be held on April 27,” the party leader quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rumours-of-ktr-taking-over-as-telangana-cm-kcr-calls-party-meet-on-sunday-101612525697596.html

05-02-2021||India||Former bureaucrat’s book reveals behind-the-scenes of Covid-19 management||What is it like to run India’s Covid-19 management campaign or the flagship Swachh Bharat Mission? Former bureaucrat Parameswaran Iyer, who until August headed one of the empowered groups formed to respond to the pandemic, has revealed some behind the scenes details of the challenge in his newly-released book Method in the Madness.Iyer was the drinking water and sanitation secretary till last year and headed the Covid group for logistics management set up in April. An Uttar Pradesh cadre officer, he resigned in 2009 from the Indian Administrative Service to work with the World Bank. Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought him back in 2016 and assigned him the role of ending open defecation. Also Watch | On The Record with Modi’s ‘Swachh Man’ Parameswaran IyerIyer writes in the book that there were always unexpected surprises. For instance, Iyer writes about how roping in Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan for the Covid-19 awareness campaign had at least one hiccup. Bachchan has been the star spokesperson for the Swachch Mission, an initiative to build toilets and stop open defecation across the country, from the start. Having an iconic star as a brand ambassador was a boost for the awareness campaign but Iyer did not start off all that well. “I did manage to trip a few times when it came to engaging with him. I still cringe about his response when I recall it: he wrote that I had got the spelling of his last name wrong.’’However, there were bigger embarrassments to deal with. During the [Covid-19] lockdown imposed on March 24, the government wanted to use a Lancet study that showed a longer shelf-life of the virus in human faeces. Iyer and his team thought they could use this to push their own messaging about the importance of using toilets instead of defecating outside. They approached Bachchan, who delivered a video message to them in just 24 hours. The government cashed in, they sent it to all channels, and also asked Bachchan to share it on his social media platforms. And then it started to go horribly wrong.Iyer writes that he got a call from health secretary Preeti Sudan just hours after channels started carrying the message. “We hadn’t counted on the panic it would cause. Each message was followed by TV anchors exclaiming that now even flies could carry the corona virus!’’ writes Iyer. “We had gone ahead and shaken everyone with the message that now, thanks to excreta-carrying flies, they were not even safe at home. The Ministry of Health spokesperson made a categorical statement that Covid-19 was not a vector-borne disease and could not be transmitted through flies.’’Iyer did not just have to delete all government posts related to that message but writes about making the call to Bachchan to ask him to delete it from his Twitter account too. “He did not once let on that he was upset or disappointed but simply did as I requested,’’ writes Iyer. Fortunately for the government, Bachchan did not stop making public service announcements.HT reached out to Bachchan’s office for comments but is yet to get a response.Iyer also worked with another Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar for the un-lockdown campaign. During the making of a public service announcement about returning to work in June, Iyer writes that he had to delete “an unparliamentary” line. Akshay’s character was supposed to scold someone wearing his mask incorrectly by saying: “Oh Sarpanchji, kachhe bhi kya aise pehente ho? Naak toh dhak lo! [Oh Sarpanch, do you also wear your underwear like this? Cover your nose please]!” Iyer writes that Akshay Kumar called him to say: “My wife is very annoyed with you right now.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bureaucrat-s-book-reveals-behind-the-scenes-of-covid-19-management-101612525345884.html

Sawant’s comments come a day after he had alleged that ”external forces” were fuelling the protests by locals against the government’s plans for three linear infrastructure projects -- railway and highway expansion as well as a fresh power line cutting through the Western Ghats and protected sanctuaries. Also Read | In Goa’s water row with Karnataka, Sawant vows not to bow to any pressure“Today, Mollem has become not just nationally but internationally famous for various reasons.We wish to tell everyone that we are more concerned about Mollem, Goa and to save Mollem, the people of Goa are more than enough,” Sawant said. “If we preserve our treasures, like the Dudhsagar waterfall and the Mahadev temple, and show them to people, we can reap the benefits by attracting tourists,” he said.On Thursday, even as there has been nationwide pushback against international celebrities tweeting in support of the farmers’ protests on Delhi borders, Sawant had said, “Goa has been a victim of propaganda for the past several months, which has been significantly fuelled by external forces. Some of the Opposition parties in Goa have also been motivating such external forces to create an unrest in the state. No propaganda shall derail our sincere efforts towards building a progressive state.” Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary -- Goa’s oldest wildlife sanctuary declared as protected back in 1967, that was later bifurcated to carve out the Mollem National Park --is spread over 240 square kilometres of Western Ghats forest and includes attractions like the Dudhsagar Waterfall, a multi-tiered waterfall among the highest in the country, and the 12th century Mahadev Temple of Tambdi Surla. The standing committee of the ministry of environment and forests in April last year granted its approval to the diversion of forest land from notified wildlife sanctuaries in Mollem along Goa’s eastern frontier with Karnataka for three projects -- the doubling of an existing railway line between Hubli in Karnataka and Vasco da Gama in Goa, the expansion of the National Highway 4A between Belgaum in North Karnataka and Goa and a power line. The approvals were met with demands that the projects be scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerned-about-region-not-protesters-goa-cm-on-infra-projects-101612525106134.html

I was least concerned about the political affiliation of the selected candidate. The UGC and university norms were overlooked,” Dr Tharamel wrote in his post.However, university Vice Chancellor PK Dharmarajan has dismissed allegations as baseless and unwarranted. He said it was part of a campaign to portray the prestigious varsity in bad light.The Save University Campaign Committee, a body fighting corruption in varsities, which took the issue to the Governor said in the interview held on January 21 for the post of assistant professor (Malayalam), which was reserved for the Muslim community, many candidates with better qualifications and more research papers to their credit appeared.They were overlooked to appoint Ninitha flouting all norms, said M Shajir Khan of the Save University Campaign Committee.Rajesh later denied any involvement in the issue and said his wife had joined the varsity a week back and nobody had raised any objections when the rank list was published last month. He said since the VC had issued a detailed reply no other explanation was needed on his part.Opposition parties have also criticised her appointment. “Centres of learning excellence are getting reduced to centres to accommodate spouses of party leaders,” said BJP state president K Surendran, adding such backdoor entries were rampant.Youth Congress and Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha workers carried out protest rallies at several places.Two-time MP Rajesh was defeated in 2019 elections from Palakkad.Last year the high court had annulled the appointment of CPI(M) MLA AN Shamseer’s wife Shahana as assistant professor in Calicut University. Higher Education Minister KT Jaleel had landed in a big row in 2018 after his cousin KT Adeeb was appointed the GM of the State Minorities Development Finance Corporation. Later he was forced to resign.The appointment of Jeeva Anandan, son of CPI(M) leader A Ananthan, as MD of the Kinfra Apparel Park last year also courted controversy.The ruling CPI(M) has denied allegations, saying in some cases people who spent 10-15 years in temporary posts have been made permanent on humanitarian basis and no party affiliation was involved in this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appointment-of-cpi-m-leader-s-wife-at-sanskrit-varsity-triggers-row-101612521315824.html

The company had made a presentation before the committee regarding its application for emergency use approval of its Covid-19 vaccine that it is manufacturing along with the German biotechnology company- BioNTech. However, it did not work out, and the company decided to withdraw its application for time being.Also Read | Study decodes how Sars-Cov-2 mutates, escapes antibodies“In pursuance of the Emergency Use Authorisation of its Covid-19 vaccine, Pfizer participated in the subject expert committee meeting of the Drug Regulatory Authority of India on February 3. Based on the deliberations at the meeting and our understanding of additional information that the regulator may need, the company has decided to withdraw its application at this time,” a Pfizer company spokesperson said in a statement.“Pfizer will continue to engage with the authority and resubmit its approval request with additional information as it becomes available in the near future. Pfizer remains committed to making its vaccine available for use by the Government in India and to pursuing the requisite pathway for emergency use authorisation that enables the availability of this vaccine for any future deployment,” the statement added. Officials in CDSCO in the know of things confirmed the development, and said that the main point of contention was that the company wanted waiver of local trials. “Their data is robust but it is always good to know how the product will work or behave in the local population, for which the regulatory authorities ask for bridging studies. So far, no foreign product has been allowed for import and to be marketed in India without a local study. It doesn’t have to be a large study, just a small study. But it is important,” said one of the officials, requesting not to be identified. Pfizer-BioNTech is a two-shot mRNA vaccine to be given 21 days apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-withdraws-application-for-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-india-101612521325182.html

There was record rainfall in the start of January. This time in the north there were western disturbances. And in the south there were easterly winds. In some places they interacted. There was clouding. Because of this maximum temperature reduced and minimum temperature increased. Cloudy days are cooler than normal,” added Pai.Also Read | January was unusually warm for entire country except NW IndiaAlso, the weather department noted that the mean temperature in southern peninsular India was 1.07 degrees higher than normal this year. The mean temperature of the southern peninsula is 25.30 degrees Celsius. And in January 2021, the recorded mean temperature was 26.36 degrees CelsiusThe average minimum temperature for central India in January 2021, which includes Maharashtra, was recorded at its third-highest since 1901. The average temperature for central India is 13.56 degrees Celsius whereas the reported temperature this time was 14.82 degrees Celsius, 1.25 degrees above normal.Speaking about the variations, OP Sreejith, scientist, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group, said the reason behind the variations is the Madden–Julian oscillation which the region experienced mainly in the beginning of January. The Madden–Julian oscillation is the largest element of the intraseasonal variability in the tropical atmosphere.“We also recorded exceptional rainfall due to Madden–Julian oscillation. The minimum temperature is higher so the mean temperature is also on the higher side,” said Sreejith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unusually-warm-january-could-be-indirect-result-of-global-warming-imd-scientist-101612521205408.html

05-02-2021||India||Why did Twitter delete Kangana Ranaut’s tweets?||Microblogging site Twitter on Thursday removed two of actress Kangana Ranaut’s tweets related to the farmers' protests. "We have taken action on Tweets that were in violation of the Twitter Rules in line with our range of enforcement options," Twitter said in an official statement.In one of the now-deleted tweets, Ranaut was responding to cricketer Rohit Sharma’s statement of solidarity against the rising global criticism of the three farm laws that farmers have been protesting against. In another tweet that has been removed by Twitter, Kangana wrote: "I feel so elated. I don't remember being so happy/excited ever, the cancer in the body of this nation we were looking for has been located, identified and now the process of eradication will start, together we will see through this. Not just survive but also thrive. Jai Hind." Both tweets have been flagged and deleted by Twitter, with a message displayed at their places, saying. "This Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules".Why were the tweets deleted?The microblogging site removes tweets if they violate Twitter's policy. The policy states that if a tweet is found to be violating rules and yet to be deleted by the owner of the account, it will be hidden behind a notice. A country’s authorised entity — in most cases the government — can also request Twitter to remove tweets or entire accounts for justifiable reasons. India recently asked for certain accounts related to the farmers’ protest to be taken down, and Twitter had initially obliged. After taking internal cognisance of the accounts, they were not found to be violative of any Twitter policy and were restored.“We may sometimes add a notice to an account or Tweet to give you more context on the actions our systems or teams may take. In some instances, this is because the behaviour violates the Twitter Rules. Other times, it may be in response to a valid and properly scoped request from an authorized entity in a given country.” Twitter says on its website.Twitter can delete or remove a tweet if it falls under the following categories.Violence: Threatening to inflict violence on any individual or group can cause a tweet to be deleted or an account to be suspended, temporarily or otherwise. Ranaut’s tweet on OTT series Tandav was categorised as violent and her account was temporarily suspended. Twitter clearly states “We also prohibit the glorification of violence”.Hateful conduct: Promoting hatred against any ethnicity, race, gender, identity, sexual orientation invites action from Twitter. Ranaut has on occasion labelled the protesting farmers as ‘Khalistanis’ and ‘terrorists’.Abuse/harassment: Users face action if they are found to be engaging in the targeted harassment of someone, or inciting others to do so.Apart from these safeguards which Kangana's tweets violated, Twitter flags posts on terrorism, child sexual exploitation, suicide, or tweets with sensitive media, adult content etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-did-twitter-delete-kangana-ranaut-s-tweets-101612519063914.html

Why was he arrested?||Comedian Munawar Faruqui was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on Friday, more than a month after he was arrested allegedly for hurting religious sentiments in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore city. The 30-year-old Faruqui and four other people were arrested on January 1 just before he was about to start his performance at a cafe in the popular 56 Dukan locality of Indore. One more person was arrested later. The case was filed based on a complaint by Eklavya Gaur, the convenor of the Hind Rakshak Sangathan and son of Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Malini Gaur.Faruqui, who is from Gujarat’s Junagadh, was booked under sections 188, 269, 34 and 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for organising the event without permission, flouting Covid-19 safety norms and hurting religious sentiments, according to Gaur’s lawyer. Gaur had said that he and his associates had gone to watch the show where the alleged indecent jokes were made about Hindu gods and goddesses and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. There is no confirmation for such a report as yet.Also read| Supreme Court grants interim bail to comedian Munawar FaruquiAnshuman Shrivastava, the lawyer for Faruqui and Yadav, said on Tuesday that the allegations levelled against his clients are "vague" in nature.

Faruqui later moved a writ petition before the top court challenging Madhya Pradesh High Court’s order denying him bail.A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice RF Nariman also issued a notice to the Madhya Pradesh government on Munawar's plea challenging the high court order refusing to grant regular bail to him.

05-02-2021||India||In divided colours of Congress, emergence of ‘Kerala lobby’||For a long time, the “Kerala lobby” was synonymous with hardliners in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) who would oppose any tryst with the Congress, its arch rival in the state. In the past three days, the Congress too, has witnessed the emergence of a “Kerala lobby” in its parliamentary camp—hardliners who played a key role in deciding the party’s floor strategy in Lok Sabha. Fifteen out of 51 seats of the Congress in Lok Sabha belong to MPs from Kerala. According to at least five Congress MPs, even as a section of the party was not opposed to the idea of allowing a debate on the President’s speech in the Lower House, many MPs from Kerala, especially those who have been elected for the first time, preferred a harder stance on the demand for a separate debate on the farm laws. Also Read | Farm debates marked relatively smoother day of Parliament: All you need to knowOn Wednesday morning, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha leadership of the Congress had received a missive from Rahul Gandhi: the party should continue protests if the government doesn’t accept the Opposition’s demand for a separate debate for farm issues. But minutes later, the Rajya Sabha leadership of the Congress, along with other Opposition parties, negotiated with government managers to extend the time for a debate on the President’s speech by another five hours. The debate started after the suspension of Question Hour and Zero Hour. Congress leaders in Lok Sabha, however, took a different tactical line and continued to disrupt the Lower House, asking for a separate debate on farm issues before the House began discussions on the general budget. Now, the Congress leaders of both Houses are blaming each other, widening fissures within the party that has often seen conflicts among senior and younger leaders. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has signalled his approval of the party’s stand in the Lower House. In a meeting with some Opposition leaders, negotiations gained pace hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi told a meeting of protesting Opposition leaders that they are on the “right path” and a separate discussion on the farm issues is “absolutely essential”. Gandhi also allayed apprehensions that many Opposition MPs might stop coming to the House if continuous disruptions persist, and said, “we will ensure that MPs come to Lok Sabha.” “We could have found a solution to the impasse and a debate would have also helped us to put forward our views. But many in the party believed that we must continue the protests,” said a senior Congress MP who hails from north India. Another Congress MP said, “Some of our colleagues argued that since elections are due in Kerala in April-May, such protests would help the party in the polls.” As the Lower House deadlock continued on Thursday, Birla called Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi and his deputy Arjun Ram Meghwal for a marathon meeting. But a solution couldn’t be arrived at. Some Rajya Sabha leaders of Congress, however, maintained that their stand was “correct” and that their Lok Sabha counterparts were “too rigid”. “Parliament is for debate, not fight. We have made the same points in our debate. Rajya Sabha leaders did the right thing. We found a solution. Neither before nor after the President’s speech but during the debate,” said a senior Congress leader in Rajya Sabha. Taking a cue from Rajya Sabha, where the debate is going on smoothly, the government has proposed extending the allotted time from 10 hours to 15 hours in Lok Sabha too, but the Opposition hasn’t agreed. They want an exclusive discussion on farm issues before the House takes up the budget discussion next week. Lok Sabha is staring at a situation wherein the House could approve the President’s speech without any debate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was scheduled to reply on Friday, is unlikely to address the Lower House. Lok Sabha proceedings washed out for the third consecutive day as the Congress stuck to their demand for a separate debate on farm protests even as the government wanted to address the issue in the all-encompassing debate on the President’s speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-divided-colours-of-congress-emergence-of-kerala-lobby-101612518204999.html

It will be a three-hour-long symbolic protest. People who will get stuck will be given food and water and will be explained the jam peacefully, the union has said.However, as their tractor march on January 26 broke the vow of a peaceful protest and led to a violent stand-off in the Capital, the Delhi Police are leaving no stones unturned to maintain the law and order situation in the Capital.

05-02-2021||India||Ahead of polls, Tamil Nadu CM offers farm loan waiver of ₹12,110 crore||The ruling AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu on Friday waived ₹12,110 crore loan taken from cooperative banks by 1.64 million farmers in the state. Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami made this announcement during the last day of the assembly session on Friday. The state is headed for assembly elections in April-May. The CM added that the scheme would come into immediate effect to reduce the burden on debt-ridden farmers who are currently affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, two cyclones in the state since November, and the monsoon. Also Read | Rajiv Gandhi assassination: President to take call on convict’s plea, says govt“I am also a farmer, I’ve a lot of affection for farmers,” said Palaniswami. “It is my responsibility to help farmers to continue their work.” In 2017, the government had provided ₹2,247 crore as relief to drought affected farmers, he added.The AIADMK government, which is in alliance with the BJP, has backed the three new farm laws. The DMK-led Opposition has criticised and questioned how Palaniswami as a farmer could support the bills. DMK president MK Stalin last month promised waiving of farm loans if his party was elected to power. The DMK has protested in support of the agitating farmers in Delhi and led a day-long hunger strike in December. The DMK boycotted the entire assembly session which began on February 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-polls-tamil-nadu-cm-offers-farm-loan-waiver-of-rs-12-110-crore-101612514904759.html

05-02-2021||India||Anyone speaking truth dubbed as traitor, anti-national, repeal farm laws: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Friday charged that anyone speaking the truth is dubbed as a "traitor" or "anti-national" and that cases of sedition have been slapped against those criticising the government.Participating in the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in Rajya Sabha, Sena member Sanjay Raut said farmers fighting for their rights have been branded as anti-nationals or Khalistanis.He said the farmers, who were known as 'warriors' when they fought the Mughals and the British, are now dubbed as anti-nationals when they are fighting for their rights on Delhi's borders.Raut said farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, who are sitting on the borders of Delhi, are fighting for the peasants from across the country and demanded that their voice be heard and the farm laws be repealed."We heard minister Dharmendra Pradhan asking us to listen to the truth. For the last six years, we have been listening to the truth, even the untruth dubbed as truth. The atmosphere in the country today is such that anyone writing the truth is dubbed as traitor and anti-national," he alleged."Cases of sedition are slapped on anyone asking questions from the government," he charged, citing examples of MPs like Sanjay Singh and Shashi Tharoor and journalists and writers.Raut said it seems that the government has changed the Indian Penal Code and replaced all its provisions with only those of sedition.He charged that cases of sedition are being lodged against everyone these days and people are booked under the law even for domestic violence cases.The Shiv Sena member further said that the government is trying to defame anyone trying to say something."Defaming the farmers' agitation is not a good thing for the country, for farmers and for all," he said.The Sena member said even though they respected the prime minister, who has got a majority to rule, "but, the majority is not run by arrogance," he said.He said everyone was ashamed by the incidents of violence that took place on Republic Day and asked why those behind the incidents of disrespecting the national flag have not been nabbed so far."Why is Deep Sidhu, responsible for disrespecting the national flag, not been caught yet. At whose behest he is acting?"Over 200 farmers are lodged in jail after being booked for sedition and not Sidhu. Over 100 youth are missing and whether they have been killed in encounters," he asked.Raut accused the government of sheltering those who violated the Official Secrets Act by leaking details about the Balakot strike while referring to a journalist and an actress.On the President saying no one can stop India from progressing if the country unites, he said when thousands of farmers have united for their rights why is the government trying to "break their unity and defaming" their agitation."When the farmers are uniting and fighting for their rights, you see anti-national acts in them and you term them as traitors. They are not anti-nationals or khalistanis.Till the time this movement is alive, the nation will remain alive and this 'andolan'," he said."If you would have built such barricades at the international borders, as those put up at Delhi borders, China would not have dared to come into Indian territory," the Sena member added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anyone-speaking-truth-dubbed-as-traitor-anti-national-repeal-farm-laws-shiv-sena-101612514123684.html
05-02-2021||India||Battle to begin with repeal of farm laws, says Mo Dhaliwal who created ‘toolkit'||Mo Dhaliwal, the founder of the Vancouver-based Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) that created the controversial ‘toolkit’ tweeted by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, is looking to use the farm protests in India to fuel the separatist Khalistani movement, according to a police officer probing attempts to fan the separatist movement under the garb of the farmers' agitation. This lingering suspicion, the officer suggested, was confirmed by a recent video clip of Mo Dhaliwal where he is seen mobilising support for the agitation, as well as the separatist movement.“If the farm bills get repealed tomorrow, that is not a victory. This battle begins with the repeal of the farm bills, it does not end there. Let no one tell you that this battle is going to end with the repeal of the farm bills. That is because they are trying to drain energy from this movement. They are trying to tell you that you are separate from Punjab, and you are separate from the Khalistan movement. You are not,” Mo Dhaliwal says in this video clip, reportedly shot during the group’s protest outside the Indian consulate on 26 January.HT cannot confirm the authenticity of this video. Dhaliwal asked for his reaction to the police charge against his group, initially agreed to an interview with HT but later said he will issue a statement instead.Also Read: In probe against Khalistanis, NIA examines people linked to farmers’ protestsThe farm protests on the borders of national capital Delhi began on November 26 over three laws that aim to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce by setting up free markets. Farm unions, however, say they will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices and make them vulnerable to exploitation by corporate giants. They have rejected an offer to suspend the operation of the laws for 18 months, insisting that the laws be repealed.Mo Dhaliwal and his group, PJF, came into sharp focus this week after Swedish activist Greta Thunberg tweeted a document that detailed an action plan for online and offline protests linked to the ongoing farmers’ agitation that started in November end. The first document, complete with links to tweets that people could use on social media, was mostly focused on Republic Day celebrations in India on January 26 that the group intended to commemorate as a global day of protest. She deleted this document and later uploaded what a police officer described as an updated and sanitized version.The Delhi Police on Thursday cited the first document, or toolkit, to file a criminal case alleging criminal conspiracy and sedition. It didn’t name any suspects.The toolkit, the officer quoted above said, had to be seen in the context of the background and motivation of its creators. The video gives an insight into the objectives of the group that has been trying to build public opinion on social media against the Indian government.“The farm protests for them is just an excuse to mobilise support for their separatist agenda,” he said.Mo Dhaliwal’s video clip appeared to support this contention.In this, Dhaliwal attempts to persuade the younger members of his audience at the protest to keep an open mind to the demand for Khalistan.“The reason why the Khalistani people are so passionate about this (farm protests) is because 40-50 years later, we are seeing the truth that they predicted in the 1970s. In the 1970s, they wanted an independent land so that we wouldn't have to live through this movement. My request to all the young people is: Don't close your eyes to each other, don't close your heart to each other. Don’t close your minds to each other. If you see somebody with a sign that you don’t understand, that has this ‘bad word’, Khalistan, on it, ask questions, learn…understand... Nobody wanted to be a terrorist… They are trying to separate us from each other… We are here for the independence and sanctity of Punjab,” Dhaliwal is heard saying in the video.Dhaliwal isn’t the only one.Counter-terror officials, who have been talking about intelligence reports of separatist elements infiltrating the farm protests for weeks, said other pro-Khalistani individuals and groups had been active at various levels too.The Delhi Police had earlier declared that they had already identified at least 300 handles from Pakistan that were trying to mobilise protesters at the Delhi borders with the hashtag -- Support Khalistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battle-begins-with-repeal-of-farm-laws-says-pro-khalistani-mo-dhaliwal-who-created-greta-thunberg-toolkit-101612512728576.html

These people [AIADMK] are not courageous,” said DMK leader R S Bharathy.Chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami met Governor Banwarilal Purohit on January 29 with a petition reiterating the state government’s recommendation for the release of all seven convicts in the case.

He moved the Supreme Court in 2016 for an early decision on the plea. On January 21, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Purohit, orally informed the court that the Governor will decide on Perarivalan’s petition within three to four days. The court’s short order later said four weeks, which was altered to a week the following day.But an affidavit submitted in the Supreme Court said that Purohit recorded on January 25 that the President is the “appropriate competent authority to deal” with the request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajiv-assassination-dmk-slams-aiadmk-for-delay-in-decision-on-convict-s-plea-101612511234664.html

05-02-2021||India||January was unusually warm for entire country except NW India||Only northwest India recorded below normal temperatures this January compared to the southern peninsula which was significantly warmer than normal; central India and northeast India.The mean temperature in January over northwest India was 11.75 degrees C (°C), 0.22°C below normal; the maximum temperature was 17.93°C, 0.40°C below normal and the minimum temperature was 5.57°C, 0.04°C below normal.When compared to the rest of the country, northwest India was the only region that recorded a harsh winter, but other regions recorded substantially above normal (average for 1971 to 2021 period) temperatures, according to India Meteorological Department’s (IMD’s) analysis. This was mainly a result of unusual rains in northwest India and south peninsula in January, experts said. The mean temperature over south peninsula was 26.36°C, 1.07°C above normal; over central India it was 21.55°C, 0.87°C above normal and over northeast India, it was 17.19°C, 0.69°C above normal.Overall, India recorded the fifth warmest January following 2016, 2009, 1958 and 1931, according to IMD’s analysis.

In December, the temperatures were near normal for almost all regions.The report is also likely to show that south peninsula made a record in terms of rainfall this January. “In the first two weeks of January, there was widespread rain in northwest India due to an intense Western Disturbance and also extremely widespread and heavy rains in southern peninsula due to easterly activity. So there has been a lot of clouding. When there is a cloud cover, the heat is not able to escape from the surface at night.

People in a particular state are misinformed,” Tomar said while addressing the Rajya Sabha.Tomar also said the farmers were being misled that others would occupy their lands if the laws were implemented. “Let me know if there is a single provision in Contract Farming law which allows any trader to snatch away the land of any farmer,” he said.With regard to the Minimum Support Price (MSP), which has been the core issue of the farmers’ movement, the Union minister said that it was being provided at 50% more than the production cost and the Centre ensured that requisite investment reaches the agriculture sector.We have started to provide MSP, 50% more than the production cost.

Growing rapidly, the illegal mining area now extends to within 500 meters of the international border fencing, the petition says.It alleged that the state government was issuing permits for excavation of minerals at some areas situated barely one km away from the international borders.Also Read: Rajasthan: Frontline workers will have to give reason for not getting vaccinatedThe petition further alleged that due to the illegal mining, huge pits have been created near the border area, which can be used for hiding or for construction of transborder tunnels. The pits near the border, mostly in Bikaner district, are 20ft to 40ft wide at some locations which can cover movement of suspicious persons, shielding them from the soldiers positioned at the BSF checkposts at the border.The petition further argues that these huge pits may also pose a serious hurdle to the movement of Indian Army soldiers near the international border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-hc-issues-notice-on-illegal-mining-hazard-near-indo-pak-border-101612508504399.html

A bench of Justice RF Nariman and Justice BR Gavai also stayed the production warrant in a case against him in Uttar Pradesh.Faruqui had alleged in his petition that the police did not follow the procedure for arrest as laid down by the top court in its 2014 decision in Arnesh Kumar vs the State of Bihar. As per this decision, the arrest should be preceded by initial investigations by the police officer to assess the genuineness of the complaint.The 2014 decision also said that proper facts and reasons should be presented before a magistrate by the officer within 24 hours of the arrest. The magistrate, in turn, is to be satisfied that the condition precedent for arrest under Section 41 Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) has been satisfied and it is only thereafter that he will authorise the detention of an accused.Faruqui and four others were arrested on January 1 following a complaint by the son of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator, alleging he had passed objectionable remarks about Hindu deities and Union home minister Amit Shah during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore on New Year's Day. One more person was arrested after that.The high court, in its order passed on January 28, had refused to grant him bail noting that to "promote harmony" is one of the constitutional duties.

The suits are designed to be worn for extended periods while continuing to operate in a combat environment.DRDE joint director and head of test and evaluation Manisha Sathe said, “In NBC defence technologies, these are the first Indian Standards developed by DRDE. Earlier, the DRDE had developed various test methods for different NBC items as per the desired requirement and specification. After meticulous experimentation, methods have been developed and validated. Developed methods were further submitted for standardisation.”“Under the Protective Textiles Sectional Committee, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has published IS 17377 in two parts in 2020. This standard also provides relative ranking or material screening information about the ability of test materials to resist chemical war breakthrough,” she added.“This will also promote ‘Make in India’. It is expected to fulfil the long-pending needs of services. Developers, vendors and new startups in this field will assist them in streamlining their procurement and products. It will also ensure that only acceptable quality reaches the user which leads to a reduction in fatal casualties to the securities forces,” said AK Singh, director DRDE.This work has been successfully done by a team of DRDE scientists Manisha Sathe, joint director and head of Test & Evaluation Division, Shiv Prakash Sharma, Dr Prabhat Garg, Dr Virendra Vikram Singh, Pushpendra Sharma and other technical staff of TED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drde-develop-standard-for-nuclear-biological-chemical-war-protective-clothing-101612504929368.html

05-02-2021||India||Farmers' protest: India may seek help from Canada in Greta toolkit probe||India is likely to ask Canada for assistance in the investigation into the antecedents of individuals and groups responsible for creating a toolkit for those supporting the agitation against the farm laws, especially if it is linked to violence on Republic Day in New Delhi, Indian officials aware of the matter said. If the Delhi Police were to charge persons based in Canada in this regard, such a request is tenable under the mutual legal assistance treaty India has with Ottawa, they added. “We will take it up with the Canadian government when we need the cooperation of law enforcement agencies in Canada,” said an official, who did not wish to be named.The toolkit tweeted by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and then deleted is linked to the Vancouver-based organisation Poetic Justice Foundation or PJF. HT reached out to the founder of PJF Mo Dhaliwal, who agreed to an interview but then said he will issue a statement instead.The toolkit is in support of the farmers’ agitation, and ostensibly to raise its profile internationally. PJF has also worked in coordination with the World Sikh Organisation, or WSO, which has been critical of India for several years, and, as per the Canadian Encyclopaedia, wanted to “create an independent nation — Khalistan”, when it was founded.PFJ’s co-founder, Anita Lal, joined WSO as its Director of Community Development on February 1. The organisations along with two others have also issued a press statement criticising actions of the Indian government following the violence on January 26, including arrests of journalists and cutting off of internet connectivity at points of the Delhi border where protesting farmers continue to gather.According to an interview with a campus journal, Dhaliwal is an alumnus of the University of Fraser Valley in British Columbia. He also worked briefly in Silicon Valley before returning to Vancouver. Dhaliwal also founded the Vancouver International Bhangra Celebration Society and was director of the strategy at Skyrocket, a branding web design agency in Vancouver.In an interview on January 26 to the Canadian network Global TV, Dhaliwal claimed the #AskIndiaWhy campaign was launched to “create awareness so that with the world’s eyes on India”, the government is “less likely” to undertake “any extreme violence” against the agitating farmers. Such “scrutiny”, he said, was required so that “India does not massacre the protestors standing against these laws.”The website launched to undergird the global campaign, AskIndiaWhy, was a recent development and PFJ asked people to “tag a celebrity, politician or influencer” to make some “noise” over the matter.PFJ’s website appears to be temporarily down. The AskIndiaWhy site displays a Sikh Sovereignty section, with its page linking to publications from the Khalistan Centre. The Centre’s web presence, at Khalistan.org, prominently says, “Mobilising the Khalsa panth to effectively achieve Khalsa Jee De Bol Baalay through the establishment of an independent Khalistan.”Dhaliwal, described as a community activist, was also the moderator for a panel discussion last year titled Khalistan, a conversation on trauma, racism, and sovereignty, organised by PFJ. Among the participants was Moninder Singh of the British Columbia Gurdwara Council, who also founded an organisation called the Sikh Liberation Front. In an interview with HT in 2018, he said, “The Khalistan movement doesn’t necessarily have to be associated with violence. Self-resistance, resistance against the state, self-defence — these modes sometimes require people to resist in many different ways including armed struggle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-protest-india-may-seek-canada-help-in-greta-toolkit-probe-101612504094299.html

According to the charge sheet, reviewed by HT, when Sarith, who worked as public relations officer at the consulate between September 2016 and September 2019, was given the responsibility of clearing import cargo of diplomats and he found out that consignments of the Consulate were exempted from Customs inspections. Suresh, who was working as secretary to the Consul General, and Sarith decided to use this channel for smuggling gold for which they roped in a smuggler -- Ramees KT, who was earlier booked in a gold smuggling case in 2014 at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. For facilitating smuggling through import cargo of the Consulate, Suresh and Sarith fixed their commission as $1,000 for every kg of smuggled gold. During a meeting in June 2019, it was decided that Ramees will form a gang to collect funds, provide logistical support and to recruit more people both within India and the UAE for smuggling gold in large quantity, according to the NIA charge sheet. Also Read | Kerala CM’s ex-principal secretary M Sivasankar gets bail in gold smuggling caseTo check the secrecy and reliability of diplomatic cargo route, the accused even sent two trial consignments without gold on July 14, 2019, from Dubai. Sarith, who had left the Consulate by September 2019, took with him a sample letter pad of the Consulate General, in which authorisation letters on behalf of Consul General of UAE were prepared with forged signatures of the diplomat and seal of the Consulate General, NIA says. The forged authorisation letters were issued by Sarith with the assistance of Suresh and were sent to Dubai for facilitating booking of consignments there. For sharing the forged letter and coordinating the smuggling activities, the accused persons had formed a Telegram channel “CPM Committee”. After the gold consignments were delivered to co-accused in Thiruvananthapuram, commission was handed over to one Sandeep Nair, of which a major part was taken by Sarith and Suresh “on the pretext of giving to the diplomat”, the charge sheet reveals. It was UAE Consul General who had written to various authorities including the Customs about Sarith’s forgery activities after noticing the same in April 2020. The UAE had informed that Sarith had resigned from the PRO job in September 2019 itself. In all, the accused persons had smuggled 167 kgs of 24 carat gold between November 2019 and June 2020. The scandal was unearthed after the last consignment of 30.244 kg gold, which arrived on June 30, 2020, was seized by the Customs. The NIA has also mentioned in the charge sheet that after tasting success in smuggling gold from the UAE, the accused persons were preparing to smuggle gold from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Malaysia as well as African countries. NIA officials who didn’t want to be named said that they are further investigating the case to find out any political links of arrested persons. The agency had filed a charge sheet against 20 people, including Sarith and Suresh, on January 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-accused-used-uae-consulate-seal-to-forge-papers-101612498513896.html

Here is all you need to know what Washington said on the ongoing farmers’ agitation at New Delhi’s borders for the first time since it began in November and continuing global spotlight on the issue:•The carefully worded response by Joe Biden’s administration also encouraged a “dialogue” between farmers and the government to end the agitation•The agitation has been getting global attraction with international celebrities such as pop star Rihanna and green activist Greta Thunberg tweeting in support of the protesters.• India said the comments by the US must be seen in their entirety while pointing out that State Department “has acknowledged” India’s steps towards reforms, which have emerged as a point of contention. • The government also appeared to draw parallels between a farmers’ rally on January 26 that plunged into chaos and the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by Donald Trump’s supporters protesting election results that declared his defeat in the presidential race.• The State Department did not mention anything specific to three new farm laws that have triggered the agitation.It appeared supportive of reforms. • Tens of thousands of farmers have camped at Delhi’s borders, demanding the repeal of the three laws passed by Parliament in September. Eleven rounds of talks between the protesters and the government have failed to break the impasse.

Clashes broke out in several places, including the 17th-century Red Fort and the ITO intersection.On that day, internet services were suspended, albeit temporarily, at three key protest sites — Singhu and Tikri (on Haryana border), and Ghazipur (on Uttar Pradesh border). Services were suspended again on January 29 for two days and then extended till February 3.After the violence, authorities stepped up security at the protest sites, placing iron spikes and steel barricades to prevent the agitators from entering Delhi.• The agitation gained the global spotlight after Rihanna, who has 101 million followers, tweeted a CNN news report about internet curbs on Tuesday. • Valerie Vaz, an MP of Britain’s Labour Party, wrote a letter to foreign minister Dominic Raab to reiterate the concerns of her constituents regarding events related to the farmers’ protest.• Vaz asked Raab to contact the Indian government “as a matter of urgency regarding these concerning events”. The Indian-origin MP was among 35 British lawmakers to take up the farmers’ protest with Raab before he visited India in December.• On Wednesday, India said criticism by foreign celebrities and attempts to “mobilise international support” against the country on the government’s handling of the protests without ascertaining facts were “neither accurate nor responsible”. • In a rare statement, the external affairs ministry contended that “vested interest groups” were trying to enforce their agenda, referring to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others”.

Under the influence of these systems, widespread light to moderate rain and snow with thunderstorms, lightning, and hail was likely over the Western Himalayan region till Friday evening.Interaction of the Western Disturbance and lower level southeasterlies from the Bay of Bengal was likely to cause fairly widespread light to moderate rain and thundershowers with isolated thunderstorms, lightning, and hail in Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh on Friday and parts of central and east India till Saturday.Also Read | Wildlife officials feed birds in freezing KashmirDry north-westerly winds were likely to blow over northwest India from Friday onwards bringing chilly winds from the Western Himalayas. This will result in a fall in minimum temperatures by 4-6 degrees Celsius (°C) in northwest India during the next three to four days, IMD said in its bulletin on Thursday.“There has been snowfall over Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. When the wind direction changes on Friday temperatures are likely to fall significantly once again due to cold north-westerly winds which will be blowing from the direction of snowclad Himalayas. The minimum temperature in Delhi could be around 7°C on Saturday. But from Feb 8, temperatures will rise again because another Western Disturbance is approaching on Feb 12,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre. He added that cold wave conditions are unlikely in northwest India.The minimum temperature in Delhi on Friday at 5.30am was 9°C, down from 12.4°C a day earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/light-rain-snowfall-expected-over-next-24-hours-in-parts-of-nw-india-101612494313862.html

Even if I am not given the ticket, I will remain active in the party as a dedicated worker, Sonal Modi had told reporters.Prahlad Modi had justified his daughter's decision, saying all his family members are free to take their own decisions."This is not a case of nepotism. My family never used Narendra Modi's name for our benefit. We all earn our own bread and butter."Even I run a ration shop. I have not visited Narendra Modi's bungalow after he became the PM, let alone my children," Prahlad Modi had said.The BJP's state parliamentary board on Thursday finalised candidates for the six municipal corporations.A list of 576 BJP candidates for the poll-bound corporations Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar was released.On February 1, the BJP had said it will not give tickets to relatives of ruling party leaders.Also, the BJP had said it will not consider party workers who are above the age of 60 and those who have finished three terms as councillors for tickets.Elections to the half-a-dozen municipal corporations will take place on February 21, while voting for 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats will be held on February 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-niece-fails-to-get-bjp-ticket-to-contest-ahmedabad-civic-polls-101612490515647.html
05-02-2021||India||One in 5 Indians exposed to coronavirus, says sero survey||At least one in five (21%) Indians above the age of 18 years has been exposed to the coronavirus, according to Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) third nationwide sero survey that tested samples from 28,589 people for antibodies between December 17, 2020 and January 8, 2021. Among health care workers, the seroprevalence was 25.7%.The numbers represent a sharp jump from the previous rounds — the first sero survey (conducted in May-June 2020) showed 0.73% seroprevalence, while the second one (August-September, 2020) showed overall prevalence of 6.6%. A serological test is to detect whether a person has antibodies to the Sars-Cov-2, which would indicate a past infection.Experts said the findings of the report show that a large proportion of the country – nearly 80% – remains susceptible to the virus.In children between the ages of 10 and 17, the prevalence was 25.3%, and people above the age of 60 showed a prevalence of 23.4%, the report showed. In the general population, the prevalence was higher in urban slums (31.7%), followed by non-urban slums (26.2%), and rural areas (19.1%).More women had antibodies compared to men, with a prevalence rate of 22.7% and 20.3% respectively.In the general population, 28,589 individuals were tested for antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Additionally, 7,171 health care workers were also covered. The second group included hundred health care workers each from taluk hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres, etc, for each district covered in the country.Doctors and nurses were affected the most with a seroprevalence of 26.6%, followed by paramedical staff (25.4%), field staff (25.3%), and administration staff (24.9%).Presenting the findings of the report at a media briefing, ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava pointed out that a large proportion of people remained susceptible to catching the infection.Experts echoed the views. “If 20% of the country has been exposed, then there are 80% who are still not exposed to the virus. That means we cannot afford to drop our guard. Covid vaccination has just started and there is still time before a significant percentage of population develops antibodies against the virus,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The findings released on Thursday are from the third round of pan-India sero surveys conducted by ICMR. It was conducted in the same 700 villages, 70 districts from 21 states that were selected during the first and the second round of surveys, ICMR said.“(The results of the latest sero survey) reflect the situation in the pre-vaccination period as vaccination drive started on January 16. The most sensitive test was used, and it was the same test that was used in the United States and showed the sero prevalence of 14.3%,” said Dr Bhargava.“A large population still remains vulnerable to the virus, and vaccination is the key along with Covid-19 appropriate behaviour to stop the spread of the virus,” he added.More than 4.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have already been administered across the country in the past 18 days. Of the roughly 9.7 million (9,631,637) health care workers registered to be given a jab against Covid-19, about 45% (4,391,826) have received the first dose of the vaccine so far.“We had estimated the number to be 10 million but when health care workers database was created on Co-WIN then it turned out to be 9,631,637 health care workers in all. So, this is the number that needs to be given both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine in the initial phase,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary.Thirteen states have covered at least 50% of their health care workers. Madhya Pradesh leads the states with 73.6% of health care workers being given the first dose in 18 days. It is followed by Rajasthan that has immunised 67% of its health care workforce, according to data from the Union health ministry.Some states are yet to catch up; and there are 11 such states that have not been able to vaccinate more than 30% of its health care workers. Puducherry is still at 12.6%, followed up Manipur at 12.8%, and Meghalaya at 15.2% of its health care workers. Among bigger states, Tamil Nadu is also currently at 23.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-in-5-indians-exposed-to-virus-says-sero-survey-101612490263785.html

This indicates that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has lost her grip over the state and fear losing the throne," he said.In a statement on Thursday, Subhash said the 25-day rath yatras have been proposed to create awareness among the people, but the state government was making all-out efforts to stop the BJP programme by several means."Even before BJP gets approval for the yatras, TMC leaders filed a petition in the court seeking not to give permission considering the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows how the Mamata Banerjee government is trying to prevent BJP leaders from taking out yatras," Subhash said, adding that the campaign launched by the senior BJP leaders has sent ripples in the TMC leadership and hence they wanted to stop BJP 'by hook or by crook'.Reacting to Mamata Banerjee's comments that the defectors from the party were "greedy" and they left before she drove them out, the BJP leader said Banerjee was losing ground in the state and by declining permission for the Rath Yatras, she was giving wrong signals to the people on the faith of democracy."The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Haldia on February 7 to participate in the BJP's 'Jan Sabha' would be a boost to the party cadre in West Bengal," he added. This Monday, BJP West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh has announced plans to roll out five 'Parivartan Yatras' across West Bengal from February 6."Five 'yatras' have been decided till now. The last one will go from Kakdwip to Kolkata," Ghosh told ANI after a meeting with members of the party's core committee at his residence in Delhi, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be invited for the conclusion of the last Rath Yatra.He further said that permission had been sought for the rath yatras from the state government, and if denied, the party may go to court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-s-attempt-to-stall-rath-yatras-cowardly-bjp-leader-101612485863521.html

The agitation has picked up pace in the district and we are expecting a larger crowd than the Jind’s meeting here.”The three Khaps of Dadri district — Sangwan, Phogat and Sheoran — have socially boycotted Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh and former Dadri MLA Rajdeep Phogat.Experts said that Tikait’s decision to address mahapanchayats in areas dominated by the Jat community will send a signal to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-JJP alliance in the state.Rajendra Sharma, professor of political science at Maharshi Dayanand University, said, “The Kandela rally has sent out a loud and clear signal to the ruling BJP-JJP coalition government about the unrest among the Jats, the dominating farming community of Haryana.”Meanwhile, in Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli district, officials denied the protesting farmers to hold a mahapanchayat in the district on Friday. The administration has also banned large gatherings till April 3.The farmers’ unions have said they will go ahead with the meeting against three controversial farm laws despite the administration’s refusal.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-to-address-2nd-farmers-mahapanchayat-in-haryana-s-dadri-on-feb-7-101612477335992.html
05-02-2021||India||Govt has empowered farmers: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday listed out all that his government has done to empower India’s farmers in the 2021 Budget and in prior years, in another outreach to protestors demanding the repeal of three contentious farm laws aimed at opening up agricultural markets.For one thing, the government has decided to connect at least 1,000 mandis (agricultural markets) to the eNAM online agricultural trading platform to turn the markets into centres of profit for farmers, the prime minister said in a speech by video link to mark the centenary of the Chauri Chaura event, a landmark moment in the history of India’s freedom struggle.“Now, when farmers go to mandis to sell their produce they will be able to do so with ease at any place across the country,” said the Prime Minister, who released a stamp to mark the centenary.In addition, Modi noted that the Centre had allocated ₹40,000 crore for the development of rural infrastructure in the budget for financial year 2021-22, which has been described by many economists as a growth-oriented package aimed at boosting the pandemic-ravaged economy.”Farmers will directly benefit from investment in the infrastructure sector,” the PM said. “The decision of the Centre will make farmers atmanirbhar (self-reliant). Agriculture will turn into a profitable venture for farmers.”February 4 marks 100 years of an event that took place in Chauri Chaura, a village in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh, known as United Province in British India, when a large group of protesters participating in Mahatma Gandhi’s non-cooperation movement clashed with the police, who opened fire. In retaliation, the protestors set fire to a police station. The incident left three civilians and 22 policemen dead. Days later, a saddened Gandhi halted the non-cooperation movement.Modi said the fire lit by the protestors was not confined to the police precinct. It reached the hearts of the people of India, infusing them with the desire for achieving independence from colonial rule.Modi’s speech has come amid protests by thousands of farmers massed on the borders of the national capital demanding the repeal of three contentious laws pushed through by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.The laws aim to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce by setting up free markets, which will co-exist with regulated markets, allow food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements.Farm unions say free markets under the laws will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices and make them vulnerable to exploitation by corporate giants. The Supreme Court put the three laws on hold on January 12.In his speech, Modi said farmers had contributed record foodgrain production during the pandemic year, and become the base of progress achieved by the country.Modi said the Swamitwa Yojana (Ownership Scheme) launched by the government in Uttar Pradesh last year will also benefit farmers, who will receive documents of ownership of their land and houses. The ownership document will not only raise the value of their property, but they will also get loan from banks with ease, Modi said.“Efforts of the government are changing the scenario in the Gorakhpur region, known as the land of revolutionaries. Earlier, factories were closed, roads were damaged and hospitals remained closed. Now, the Gorakhpur fertiliser factory is starting. Farmers will benefit and young people will get employment, :he said.Modi said the Budget will enable the country meet the challenges on the road ahead in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Before the budget was presented, several experts said the country faces a crisis and the centre will have to increase taxes, put the burden on the common man. But the centre ensured that no burden was put on the people,” Modi said.The Centre has, instead, decided to increase spending to accelerate development. “Expenditure will be on construction of wide roads to connect villages with towns, mandis and markets; construction of bridges, laying of railway tracks, starting new trains, buses; improvement of education; to provide more opportunities of employment to the young,” he said.He also mentioned India’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and its vaccination drive from which, Modi said, several countries were drawing lessons. Alongside manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines, India is exporting them to countries who need them, he said.“Now, the Centre is working to provide quality medical facilities to people in rural areas so that they do not have to go to cities for treatment of minor health problems. To ensure that they do not face any problem in getting medical services, a big decision has been taken in the budget -- now modern testing laboratories will be established in each district and people will get health services in villages too. The Centre has increased the budget allocation for the health sector,” he said.Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the Prime Minister should also have paid tribute to the 150 farmers who have died in the course of the protest, accusing the government of betraying farmers. “Farmers across the country have united to launch a movement against the government, he said.Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati has demanded a repeal of the three laws in solidarity with the protesting farmers, the party’s general secretary Lalji Verma said. “Instead of talking with the farmers, the central government is trying to suppress their movement. It clearly shows the anti- farmer attitude of the central government,” Verma said.Samajwadi Party’s national president and former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said the Bharatiya Janata Party should take a lesson from the Chauri Chaura movement, and repeal the three laws.Hem Chandra Singh, president of the Purvanchal Kisan Union, said that instead of talking to the farmers, the Centre was trying to suppress their agitation, which is against the spirit of the freedom struggle and the ideals of Chauri Chaura activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-has-empowered-farmers-modi-101612476548007.html
05-02-2021||India||Facebook, Twitter: Platforms or media companies?||Twitter’s decision to take down several posts in relation to the farm protests and its criticism has brought the spotlight back on a crucial debate relating to how social media companies are classified: they claim to be technology platforms, but how they moderate – and curate by way of algorithmic prioritisation — their content is similar to editorial decisions exercised by media companies.On Thursday for instance, the social media company took down tweets of Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut. Earlier in the week, it temporarily blocked some accounts in India before unblocking them on the grounds that the company believes in “protecting public conversation and transparency”, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. “We have taken action on tweets that were in violation of the Twitter rules in line with our range of enforcement options,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement.Growing intervention by tech ‘platforms’The classification of social media companies is crucial because they are at present beyond the regulatory scope that extends to media companies, requiring the latter to follow guidelines on speech and expression — a structure that experts have long held is crucial since mass media has large influence on politics and culture.Not only do these companies decide who gets to post what, they influence and regulate which content is amplified and which isn’t.The companies, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others, base their characterisation as technology platforms on two main pillars: that the content they host is not generated by them, and that code – not human intervention – determines how it is displayed. Their moderation is based on self-drawn guidelines meant to combat hate speech and unlawful media.At the core of this characterisation is Section 230 of Communications Decency Act in the United States, which has physical jurisdiction over the world’s biggest tech companies. It lays down that internet companies will not be held liable for the content they host, and that they cannot be held liable for good-faith efforts to hide, remove or filter user-generated content. This law has been regarded as the bedrock for an open, free internet.Too much or not enoughBut increasingly, their moderation has been debated. One such example is the decision by Facebook and Twitter in 2020 to block access to a news article about then presidential candidate (and current President) Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Critics condemned the companies for blocking a report that a news organisation deemed fit to publish, while the companies cited rules against carrying material obtained through hacking or illegal sourcing.At the same time, the platforms – particularly Facebook – have been criticised for not doing enough in some other circumstances: They were criticised for not curtailing conspiracy theory groups such as QAnon and hate collectives such as the Proud Boys, which were among those that laid siege to the US Capitol on January 6.In a 2017 paper published in First Monday, a peer-reviewed open access journal for research on the Internet, public and tech policy experts Philip Napoli and Robyn Caplan write that treating social media companies as tech firms ignores the social aspects and influence of their reach, as also the fact that their main revenue source is content, the same as media companies.“The framing of social media platforms and digital content curators purely as technology companies marginalises the increasingly prominent political and cultural dimensions of their operation, which grow more pronounced as these platforms become central gatekeepers of news and information in the contemporary media ecosystem” they write.In the paper, Napoli and Caplan argue that traditional media roles of “1) production (exemplified by content creators such as news outlets and television studios); 2) distribution (the process of moving content from producers towards consumers); and, 3) exhibition (the process of providing content directly to audiences)” have now merged and evolved due to digitization of media.They also target the defence that computer code is responsible for editorial functions, and that there is no human intervention. “The asserted absence of direct human editorial involvement helps to further this perception of distance from, and/or neutrality in, the content selection process — a model that is presumably fundamentally different from the kind of direct (and human) editorial discretion that has been a defining characteristic of traditional media companies.”But, they add, “simply because the mechanisms for exercising editorial discretion — for gatekeeping — have changed doesn’t mean that the fundamental institutional identity of the gatekeepers should be recast”.A crucial similarity between these social media companies and media companies is the centrality of advertising as a revenue source, Napoli and Caplan write.Changing nature of media, technologyThe debate, however, also needs to account for the changing nature of media and communications and the centrality of user-generated content – a factor the authors of the paper also recognise. “One could just as easily argue that it is necessary and appropriate for our understanding of media companies to evolve to fully encompass the structure and operation of these platforms”.But regulatory parity may be necessary, and appears to have been identified in some manner by big tech leaders. In December, 2016, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described Facebook as “not a traditional media company”. Google in a 2005 regulatory filing stated, “We began as a technology company and have evolved into a software, technology, Internet, advertising, media company”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-twitter-platforms-or-media-companies-101612476121092.html
05-02-2021||India||Will not enter Delhi, say farmers as police prepare for chakka jam||Farm unions agitating against three agriculture laws announced on Thursday that no protester will enter Delhi during a three-hour nationwide highway blockade on February 6 in a bid to avoid a repeat of the clashes and violence witnesses on Republic Day.Farmers in Punjab and Haryana drummed up support for the chakka jam, scheduled between 12pm and 3pm on Saturday, held village-level meetings and deputed special security volunteers to avert any clashes with security forces.In Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah met national security adviser Ajit Doval and Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava inside the Parliament complex to review the security situation.The Centre had already conveyed to Delhi Police that additional central paramilitary forces are on standby if required. Currently over 60 companies (6,000 personnel) of central paramilitary forces are assisting Delhi Police at the borders.Farm leaders said cultivators camping at Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur borders, and those who will join them by Friday, will carry out the chakka jam at their respective venues.“Farmers will block the highways in their respective states and no attempt will be made to enter Delhi. In case anyone gets stuck during the chakka jam, they will be served water and food by the farmers. We will also explain to them the reason behind our protest and what the government is doing with us,” Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said at the Ghazipur border.During this chakka jam – the first big event by the agitators after the Republic Day tractor rally went out of control and protesters ran riot on Delhi’s streets – farmer leaders assured that they will not stop ambulances and fire brigades.“We would like to request the people to cooperate with farmers on February 6, just for three hours, and let’s do our protest peacefully,” said Manjeet Singh Rai, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Doaba).Many farmers said they will ask family members and supporters to block roads peacefully in their home states. “We are already sitting on a highway and we will continue doing so. We need people to participate in the chakka jam in different parts of the country. We are urging people to stay back at their places and support us from there,” said farmer leader Jagtar Singh Bajwa.Farmer leaders held meetings with people in various states to discuss the plan to avoid the scenes from Republic Day, when farmers ran riot during a tractor rally on Republic Day, storming the Red Fort and hoisting the Sikh flag from its ramparts.“From the security point of view, farm leaders, as well as volunteers, have been visiting all tractor trolleys and tents and telling people to remain non-violent. Volunteers in security duty will remain present at the border points to ensure nobody crosses the line,” said Lakhbir Singh, a farmer leader.Rai said that to strengthen their numbers, announcements were made in villages in Punjab that R1,500 will be collected as a fine from people who didn’t visit Delhi borders.“This announcement is having an impact now as many farmers have come from those villages in Punjab from where not a single participation was made in the past 70-71 days. We don’t want our agitation to die in the absence of protesters,” said Rai.Farmers at the Tikri border also said that they will avoid getting into confrontation. “Only anti-social elements resorted to violence on Republic Day. For the past two months, farmers had been protesting peacefully and the same will continue on February 6,” said Bijender Pal, a farmer from Mansa in Punjab.Across Punjab and Haryana, farmers held meetings. Response was especially enthusiastic in Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar as local people thronged toll plazas. “This agitation is at its peak and we need your support to win it,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni in Kurukshetra district. He said block-level meetings were held to fix responsibilities and they were finalising locations to block highways.In Delhi, police officers said that their strengthened security arrangements, deployment of security personnel and closure of the three borders will continue. The protest sites have turned into fortresses with police digging trenches, putting up barbed wire fences, concrete barricades and hammering beds of nails on roads.A senior police officer, who did want to be named, said intelligence inputs were being received that farmers may try to enter Delhi from several borders for the chakka jam and stopping them may lead to confrontation with the police.“Whenever there is a call for any such event (nationwide chakka jam), Delhi Police always make security arrangements to maintain law and order and avoid inconvenience to the public. Our police personnel will be deployed at the borders and on the streets across the city to manage traffic and security,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.In Haryana, district administrations across the state said they were making arrangements to deal with the situation. “We are holding talks with farmers and urging them not to block Delhi-Chandigarh, National Highway 44 as this may cause problems for thousands of commuters”, said Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-enter-delhi-say-farmers-as-police-prepare-for-chakka-jam-101612475668219.html

05-02-2021||India||Study decodes how Sars-Cov-2 mutates, escapes antibodies||The Sars-Cov-2 evades antibody response due to deletions in its genetic structure, triggering minute changes in the spike protein that the virus uses to infect cells, according to a study published by researchers from University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in the journal Science on Thursday.The findings offer some clues on how the virus changes: the researchers found that much of the mutation occurred at the same spots in a sequence, “spots where the virus can tolerate a change in shape without losing its ability to invade cells and make copies of itself”.The deletion occurs when the virus replicates and because the coronavirus has a faulty biological “proofreader”, the deletions are not caught. “You can’t fix what’s not there,” said study senior author Paul Duprex, director of the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh. “Once it’s gone, it’s gone, and if it’s gone in an important part of the virus that the antibody ‘sees,’ then it’s gone for good.”The study was carried out by looking at the case of an immunocompromised patient, who had a recurrent infection for 74 days before ultimately succumbing to the disease. The authors say in the report that a “cat and mouse” game between the person’s immune system and the virus turns into a co-evolutionary dance that helps the fittest of mutations to eventually survive.At least three variants of the virus, carrying a constellation of mutations, are of concern globally at the present. Among these, two carry a mutation known as E484K that lab tests and clinical trials suggest could lead to a decrease in potency of vaccines.The researchers said it remains to be seen how much the virus will go on to mutate. “How far these deletions erode protection is yet to be determined,” said Kevin McCarthy, assistant professor of molecular biology and molecular genetics at Pitt, and an expert on the influenza virus. “At some point, we’re going to have to start reformulating vaccines, or at least entertain that idea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-decodes-how-sars-cov-2-mutates-escapes-antibodies-101612475007824.html

The Union government, in its action taken report on the commission’s report tabled in Parliament, has accepted most of the recommendations, and overtly rejected none. The 15th FC had the onerous task of devolving resources at a time when the pandemic has devastated the economy, shrinking the resource pie. The chairman of the 15th FC, NK Singh, spoke to Zia Haq about the report. Edited excerpts:What were the philosophical underpinnings and approach of the 15th FC? Your report states that “stability and predictability of resources is an essential component of good long-term budgeting for both Union and States”. The history of the Finance Commission is embedded in the legacy of unalloyed confidence and trust. When the Constituent Assembly in its debates was unable to come to a conclusion of how the resources were to be divided between the Union and states, various mechanisms were considered at that time. Earlier it was said that nothing was shareable, except income tax, and you know the finance commission in a sense is older than our Constitution, because the Independence was in 1947, whereas the Constitution came into play only in 1950. So, there was a period they had appointed an interim chairman of the finance commission under CD Deshmukh because the Constituent Assembly had asked him to do it. He had given a certain framework on the division of resources. Then the Constitution got adopted and the 1st FC under KC Neogi was constituted. Since then it has had an unbroken legacy, an unbroken record embedded in bipartisanship, fair play and has been totally ideologically neutral.In terms of receiving the requests, each of the states and the Union government… and then looking at what would be their expenditure, looking at their likely revenue, what would be a fair distribution of these resources between the entities of the Union and the states, and thereafter what would be a reasonable basis for allocation. And if there were obvious gaps after the revenue expenditure of the state had been calibrated in an optimum way and the revenues had been projected in a somewhat optimistic way. Now, if there were inescapable gaps, what amount of it was reasonable to fill up by taking recourse to Article 275 of the Constitution, by way of revenue-deficit grants.Thereafter, two big changes took place. One was that the third tier (urban local bodies and panchayats) was brought into play by the two constitutional amendments (73rd and 74th), which assigned responsibilities to the FCs and second, the Disaster Management Act 2005 was enacted and it became customary for assignment of resources for disaster management. Also, it gave greater latitude to the President in asking the FC’s views on any other matter which the president may choose in the interest of sound finance. Over these 72 years or so, the dynamics of the Indian economy have changed enormously. From an economy originally depended on imported foodgrains and scrambling for shortage of foreign exchange to an economy, given the liberalisation and successive crisis, that has matured and evolved, we see that the needs and obligations from the states have increased.There are two important points. One is the recognition that the Union government had obligations that went beyond the strict interpretation of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution (which specifies allocation of subjects between Union and states, containing three lists: Union list, state list and concurrent list), namely what went beyond what was assigned to the Union government in terms of taking care of national priorities of the states. The birth of centrally sponsored schemes and the central outlays… these were important changes. Second was that the number of states increased rather significantly, many states required special treatment particularly, those who have a small population, hilly terrain etc. So these transformative changes have led to the evolution of the role, responsibility and obligation of the FCs.What states look forward to most in every report is the devolution formula, which you have maintained. It’s 41%, with a 1% downward adjustment (from 42% earlier) because of two new Union territories. You assigned a weight of 12.5% for demographic performance, which is the inverse of the fertility rate. You have said the 2011 Census better represents the needs of states. Was the biggest challenge for you was to not penalise efficient states, demographically speaking, at the cost of the inefficient? When the 15th FC was constituted, there were great worries. In the terms of reference, the President asked the commission to use the data of the 2011 Census in respect of the population criteria if population was to be used as a criterion for purposes of the assignment of the horizontal distribution. Then, there were strong protests by some states, particularly the southern states, because they would be big losers because they had controlled population well. It was argued that it would result in rewarding the inefficient and penalising the efficient. It was a challenge to therefore deal with this conundrum. We had no option because use of the 2011 data was a given fact by the president. It is the president’s right to assign a particular way in which we look at the criteria. Now, what are the options we had?One option, which was a hypothetical option, was... in total neglect of any past practice to ignore population completely as a criterion and to do it on the basis of some other criterion. The Constitution doesn’t bind me to use any particular criterion. But then we came to the conclusion that let us see what else could we have used.Some suggestions were made that maybe we could do it on the basis of per capita income. The result would have been that again the states that have the lowest per capita income would have the highest population density. In effect it would have meant that those states where rates of growth had been poor would get rewarded unduly and states with higher growth rates would get penalised. So the income distance criteria would begin to also mirror this phenomenon.So we went back to the drawing board and said, why not take the bull by the horn? Why not face the problem squarely and say, yes, there’s an X amount which used to be historically given on the basis of weightage to population in the horizontal formula and now we have to use the 2011 (population data) and break that into two parts. One part you give it on the basis of population, whatever weight you assign, and two, you actively reward states that have managed their demography better; which reflects what? Namely, greater investments they have made in girl-child education, managed their health parameters better, and have got a better governance matrix. So, in many ways assigning a positive weight in demographic management embedded the investments those states had made in the social sector particularly health and education. We found that in this way we would be able to mitigate any adverse consequences to some extent of what would be the outcome.Broadly speaking, in this horizontal distribution, there are three important factors which we have pointed out in the report. We have sought to balance need, efficiency and equity. The population reflects the need; the weight given to geographical area represents the need; the income distance criterion, namely the per capita income, represents the equity part. In what way are we rewarding efficiency? By giving weightage to the demographic criteria and also giving some weightage to the fiscal achievements to the state. So in some ways therefore if you look at these, each of these criteria...the forest area also represents the need... are evenly divided in some ways.Many of the southern states were extremely nervous about what would happen to them. They feared that they would be penalised for getting their population under control. Do you think you have adequately addressed those concerns now? Adequacy is a subjective norm. The best way this would have been addressed is a situation where we hadn’t used population as a criteria at all. But then I explained you would have had other kind of choices. Instead of saying ‘adequately addressed’, let me say ‘reasonably mitigated’, or ‘responsibly mitigated’. The concern of the southern states was not only the award of the 15th FC, but they looked a bit ahead -- that if, for the purpose of the delimitation of the constituencies, this was going to be the pattern of using the most contemporary population census data, what would happen in terms of the nature their representation in Parliament and the size of their Assemblies, and therefore the number of the seats they would elect to Rajya Sabha. That was fortunately not a concern with us but I know that embedded in their minds was also this particular concern.You could say that we have tried to in some ways redressed this in a manner we considered appropriate. In spite of what we did as we had done, to mitigate this , it turned out to be that many of the states would have had a huge yawning resource deficit. That is why, ₹2.95 lakh crore given by way of revenue-deficit grants... if you look at the states who are beneficiaries of this, huge amount has gone to Andhra Pradesh, huge amount has gone to Kerala.Kerala was one of the states where the demographic management was one of the best. Some has gone to Telangana. The way we have calibrated these revenue-deficit grants, we looked at this... as you can see there’s one full volume in the report devoted to the states. We subjected each of the states to very careful scrutiny, then we worked out what would be the minimum inescapable revenue expenditure, we compressed that and calculated the maximum amount of resources that they were likely to generate on a normative basis and concluded that this is the inescapable gap between the inescapable minimum expenditure and what is likely to be the optimum revenue. We have therefore assigned revenue-deficit grants. A fair amount of that has gone to states who would have been the unaddressed factor in spite of the mitigation on account of the use of the 2011 data. Have we succeeded totally? One classic example to be honest is that we have not been able to take care of, for instance, Karnataka because it has managed its finances in a reasonable way and their expenditures have very low and their revenues have been reasonable. So I have no answer to this question. A state like Karnataka I was not able to give revenue-deficit grant. I couldn’t reinvent a formula to overcome this handicap. I did try to address the concerns of Karnataka by giving them some state-specific grants for the rejuvenation of lakes and water bodies and some important places, particularly rejuvenation of Bangalore and Mysore.Do you think some states would still have reasonable grounds to complain? Sure, I think that is quite legitimate. We must also recognise that for many FCs, the weightage given to per capita income was much more than what we have given. If we had stuck to those weightages, their injury would have been far more significant. The issue of equity would have got greatly compromised. The lowest per capita income is of Bihar. Bihar, UP and Rajasthan, these are known as the really backward states. You would recall that in the earlier government, they appointed a committee under Raghuram Rajan to come up with the multiple index on the backwardness of states. In that multiple index Raghu had done at that time, Bihar and Odisha were at the rock bottom. In this case, Odisha has also done better subsequent to Raghu’s report; Odisha has managed its demography also well; so Odisha is not too happyMaybe this will get mitigated when some of their special projects, such as the cyclone, get addressed.You have recommended a fiscal glide path whose imprint is more or less clear in the Budget. You have also recommended a committee to review the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM). What prompted this? In the FRMB committee, which I chaired, what we were aiming at then and also during the terminal period of the 15th FC, was to look at the debt-to-GDP (ratio) to be 60% -- 40 for the Central government, and 20 for the states. We had done a calibrated fiscal-deficit trajectory which would enable this level of debt to be reached. So that’s now embedded in history, and overtaken by events in a very dramatic way. We are no more in that world.The world has changed in some important respects: The pandemic permanently changed the structure of the global economy. When I chaired the FRBM committee, the focus was the central government and as far as the states were concerned the committee said this would be left to a subsequent FC. I didn’t know then I was going to head that FC. But investors look at the general government debt. FDI looks to general government. So that FRBM which had reference to the central government, where states were not in the picture, has changed. That’s why I proposed that we need to have a fundamental re-look at this overall framework, the changed global context and the changed national context in which we make the states and the central government equal partners. That is why I have not given a point (for fiscal deficit) both for the central government and the states, but a range (of fiscal deficit).Why had I suggested a fixed point in the FRBM committee? The reason is in parliamentary democracies, the tendency is to adhere to the upper end of the range given the populist pressures for public outlays.That logic doesn’t hold good anymore. Giving fixed number is to build in inflexibility and I am increasingly coming around to the view that this framework needs not to be pro-cyclical, it needs to work in accordance with the tandem of the cycle; and therefore a cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit and debt norm would be more appropriate. I have given the states a leeway to go up to 4% and taper down to 3% (fiscal deficit) much later. I have given a 0.5% leeway for purposes of reform in the power sector. Why did I select [the] power [sector]? When I visited all the states, the giant and the gorilla in the room is power. Look at any state’s finances, it is the power sector and unbridged financial gaps in the power sector that is critical. The 0.5% headroom for borrowing by states was quite in line with what we had experienced during our visit to states. If there is a shortfall in Goods and Services Tax compensation, and states have to borrow, that should not be debited against what we have proposed i.e. 4% and 0.5. The important thing I realised is that there no point in any debt framework which doesn’t involve the partnership of the states.Given the events of the last year, do you think our thinking of fiscal mathematics not just in India but the world has undergone a change? I would say yes. Who else, if you think among the global economists, write and have written continuously on this? I am not going to an extreme version like Larry Summers (former chief economist of the World Bank)... no Larry is not one who may be regarded as a fiscal fetishist, but there were others like Stanley Fischer (former vice chair of US Federal Reserve). Stan has been writing and saying that the entire literature in relation to the fiscal issue by eminent economists has undergone a rethink in terms of the importance of the role of public outlays, particularly on the need for them to play a proactive role on rejuvenating of infrastructure and more importantly employment, given in terms of what (labour-saving) technologies have done and also in terms of health and education. So I agree with you that the literature on fiscal policy has undergone a change.To give you an anecdote, I was invited to give a lecture to the finance ministers of all Commonwealth countries. The title of my lecture was fiscal forbearance. People talk of monetary forbearance. But I talked of fiscal forbearance in times of this kind, which represents in some ways the changing ethos. Similarly, in the last OECD fiscal networking conference, the thinking on this fiscal issue has been an evolving one. OECD has been one of the flag carriers with regard to adherence to fiscal policies. The Germans have had a very strong influence if you recall. So all that... I agree entirely has undergone and is undergoing a change. In our federation, it’s much more important for the states to become increasingly involved in all of this. If I were to ask you a hypothetical question, that if there was no implicit guarantee upon the charge of the consolidated fund of each individual state government, don’t you think that the market would have displayed their hesitation. For instance, if we looked anecdotally at the debt today of Punjab, it’s so high, and yet Punjab successfully borrows market development loans because there is an implicit state guarantee and unlike the US constitution, there is no such thing as federal bankruptcy. California can get bankrupt, I cannot imgaine any state becoming bankrupt. The issue of the sovereign guarantee -- that’s why I think we need to consider the states and the Centre in a holistic way.The hobbling implementation of GST has been a structural problem and the 15th FC has made key recommendations to reform it, including simplifying the inverted duty structure. Your comments. I have a feeling that there is deep realisation on the part of the finance minister, reflected in the statement I have seen by the revenue secretary on this issue of GST, and he was asked this pointed question maybe by your paper, about the 15th FC recommendation in our fairly robust chapter on resources (Chapter 5, Volume I), and what he intended to do. He said ‘these are all work in progress’ and because of the pandemic, the GST Council has not been able to deliberate on them. I think clearly on this whole story of invoice matching, you could see the budget talking on this, on invoice manipulation, and in terms of much better compliance... you see there are fundamental issues of the inverted duty structure, there are issues of moving towards a more standardised set of rates. I am not wanting to take the extreme view of one rate only but you can have one standard rate, one merit (goods) rate and one which may be called the penal rate but no more than three (rates) and we have said so. It is our expectation and sanguine belief that our key suggestions would be considered by the GST Council. It is of vital concern. I’m happy to say the finance minister and finance secretary are acutely aware of all of this and will take it as soon as things return to normalcy.You have said that the efficiency measure of the GST is around 50% and can be taken up to advanced economy benchmarks of 60%. What else will it take? The literature on how and what has been called the revenue-neutral rate and there’s been a lot of debate on this. I recall that years ago, when the idea of GST had begun to take shape and I was still the revenue secretary, we had worked out a revenue-neutral rate, which was in the region of 14-15%. The average rate what we see now is 11%. What I mean really is that these are not necessarily raising rates but these are within the entire basket that you need to recalibrate in a manner which would approximate what would be regarded by economists a revenue-neutral rate. That would mean a deeper rationalisation in many ways. So I believe that the GST Council which I had the privilege to address once also believed that future FCs should have a greater partnership with the GST Council because the two are very intimately connected.You have looked at the whole idea of defence in somewhat innovative way and recommended creation of a non-lapsable defence and security fund. On defence, we got special terms of reference. It was not, so to say, spontaneous. I had the experience of working in the ministry of home also looking after paramilitary forces. In that sense I have a little bit of hangover. I realised having been expenditure secretary that there was a huge mismatch between the expenditure cycle and financial cycle of the defence ministry. The procurements are so complicated and the need to be clear of any controversy that by the time they are ready, the finances are not there. There is this inherent mismatch with regards to capital expenditure. Also, I realised the need for predictability and stability for the capital expenditure on the defence side. Keeping pace with technology often meant that they need a resource. So I played with many ideas. The other thing was how to make states partners in this process.The issue of defence really transcends any list. I obtained many legal opinions on this. I obtained the opinion of (Kesava) Parasaran. When I had gone to the late Mr Jaitley, for whom I had great affection, I asked him that there is this complex issue which is troubling me; he said there is only one person who will know but will not give you the opinion. I said why, because he is 93 years old. Yet, I rang up Parasaran, who gave important opinions. One, he said I cannot play around what is in the divisible pool and there’s nothing I can to do to impose any condition on the resources from the divisible pool and that will have a constitutional infirmity. Second, he said there’s no question that the defence of India is of paramount responsibility.So then we were hard put to fund resources. I visited some of the defence establishments. I visited Pangong, Leh, I saw some of the stuff. We said we must create a non-lapsable defence fund and to bridge this asymmetric cycle. I had done so for the road cess. That’s how I came up with the non-lapsable fund and the funding of it. In defence funding what I have done, before the fund becomes a part of the divisible pool, you understand the gross revenue reciepts (GRR) and gross tax revenue (GTR), I calibrated the GRR by 1% and got the amount which I wanted, and added it to the monetisation of the surplus defence land, added it to the proceeds of the disinventment of defence units, and added it to the liabilities of different entities which owed to defence establishments. So four sources of income outlined towards the creation of a non-lapsable fund.Can you talk about any discomfort that states have right now with the new kind of fiscal federalist architecture that’s come in where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to sort of segregate matters of financial management of states? I think that area also needs a rethink. Do you think if I had asked you the hypopthetical question that the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution (the part which divides domains into central, states and joint Centre-states jurisdiction) has outlived its purpose, what would be the answer? In my view, yes. The Seventh Schedule decided to classify between the three categories... what would be in the exclusive category of the Union, exclusive domain of the states, and what would be in the concurrent list. There was a degree of clarity in that. Over a period of time, you have really transgressed from one end to the other. Most of the centrally sponsored schemes are subjects which are classic subjects in the domain of the states, such as employment, food, education. You have now standalone parliamentary legislation, which are justiciable, in areas such as employment like MNREGA, you have given a major boost to resources for right to education. Take for example a function number one for states, which is law and order. They have taken up a whole new centrally sponsored scheme under health. So the Seventh Schedule requires a revisit. So does the entry under Article 282 of the Constitution which has been used and misused for having all the centrally sponsored schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-interview-we-ve-sought-to-address-needs-efficiency-equity-says-nk-singh-101612474412528.html
05-02-2021||India||Rajiv Gandhi assassination: President to take call on convict’s plea, says govt||The mercy petition of AG Perarivalan alias Arivu, one of the convicts serving life sentence for the assassination of former PM Rajiv Gandhi in May 1991 will be decided by the President, the Centre informed the Supreme Court on Thursday.Perarivalan’s mercy petition was pending with the Tamil Nadu governor since December 30, 2015. After a delay of more than five years, the governor on January 25, 2021 decided that the competent authority to decide on Perarivalan’s remission was the President. Without specifying any time-frame, the Centre further stated, “The proposal received by the central government will be processed in accordance with law.”Perarivalan had moved the SC in 2016 for an early decision on his pending remission plea. The court took serious exception to the five-year delay on part of the governor to decide the convict’s plea. Finally, on January 21, 2021 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing governor Banwarilal Purohit informed the court that the governor will decide Perarivalan’s petition within a week. Ahead of the hearing of the case next week, the Centre in an affidavit informed the court saying,“The governor of Tamil Nadu considered all the facts on record and after perusal of the relevant documents, recorded that the President is the appropriate competent authority to deal with the said request.”Perarivalan was among seven persons convicted by a Special TADA court for being part of the conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-president-to-take-call-on-convict-s-plea-says-govt-101612474090741.html

They were hearing a petition filed by Jayalalithaa’s legal heir and nephew J Deepak against an act promulgated by the state government to convert her residence, Veda Nilayam, in Chennai’s Poes Garden into a memorial for the leader who died in December 2016.“Personality cult is not something great for a republic... or Constitution,” Banerjee said when advocate general Vijay Narayan, appearing for the state government, spoke about the late leader’s personality, leadership and role in empowering women. Narayan also said that several governments had preserved the homes of eminent personalities after converting them into memorials. When he mentioned Shakespeare’s home as an example, the chief justice countered that UK Prime Minister Churchill had no memorial to his name.The court made an oral observation that there could be one memorial for Gandhi, one for Jawaharlal Nehru and one for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. “But if you keep extending it you would have memorials for deputy chief ministers also!”the judges remarked, as quoted by Bar and Bench.The high court had allowed the Tamil Nadu government to proceed with the January 28 inauguration of Veda Nilayam as a memorial but did not allow public entry until further hearings on the case. The court observed that it was constrained to allow the opening so that it does not cause difficulties to the government ,which had already made arrangements for the inauguration.On January 27, the state government also inaugurated a Rs, 80-crore mausoleum for Jayalalithaa at her burial place on Chennai’s Marina beach.The court agreed to the AG’s submission that Jayalalithaa had contributed greatly to Tamil Nadu, but said it can’t keep adding memorials. “There are several judges who make contributions. What will happen if court space is used to put up statues,” asked Banerjee. “There are already so many portraits in this chamber.” The next hearing in the case is after four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/personality-cult-not-great-for-republic-high-court-on-jaya-memorial-101612473874151.html
05-02-2021||India||Delhiwale: Thela, as his biography||Carts are regular sights in this city of street hawkers. Usually they are but a broad plank of wood plonked over four wheels. But Veeru Bhai’s fruit cart—or thela, as he calls it— is different. Yes it is of wood and wheels, but it is much smaller than the common variety, and looks like one of those trolleys that apron-clad maître d’s push around in elegant restaurants.“I made this cart on my own,” says Veeru Bhai. This afternoon he is going about a central Delhi street with his cart decked up with fruit salad, each disposable bowl containing sliced pieces of kiwis, strawberries and dragon fruit.A native of Allahabad in UP, Veeru Bhai, 53, has been wheeling about Delhi’s streets with his fruity offerings for decades. In fact, this cart is an important part of his biography. He made it in 1994, the year he arrived in the city. The cart looks its age, the tires are weary and almost flat. “They still work after all these years,” Veeru Bhai declares defensively. In a way, this shabby-looking cart is the map of his Delhi. He bought the wood from the Peti Market near Angoori Bagh. He bought the tires from the Cycle Market in Chandni Chowk—which in fact is a popular place to buy and repair cycle rickshaws. “I bought the nails and bolts to patch the cart together from the cycle market too,” he adds. Veeru Bhai brought it all together into a thela at his home in Choti Mor near Lajpat Rai Market, in two days flat.Showing a secretive closet underneath the cart, he says it’s a “tehkhana, where I keep the extra fruits.”Yet, it is true that this cart is not exclusive to Veeru Bhai, and that quite a few other fruit hawkers roam around with carts thus designed. The fruit salad seller agrees graciously, clarifying that none of these carts is mass produced. “Hawkers either make them themselves, like I did, or they get it made from people who know how to make it... somebody like me.”Indeed, he charges ₹1,200 for making such a cart. That his skill in this craft is outstanding is visible from his own work tool. In a time when everything comes with an expiry date, “my old thela is still going on,” he says, pushing the cart ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-thela-as-his-biography-101612473106264.html
05-02-2021||India||Delhi: FIR against two children’s homes for ‘abuse and irregularities’||A first information report (FIR) was registered on Wednesday against two care homes for children after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) reported a host of abuse and irregularities such as sexual abuse, using the children for anti-CAA protests, not providing them the right living conditions, Covid-19 norms violations, among others, the police said.The police identified the two homes as Umeed Aman Ghar, a home for boys, and Khushi Rainbow Home, a residence for girls -- both based south Delhi.“The NCPCR conducted inspections at the two homes on October 1 and submitted their findings to us. We did a preliminary enquiry after that and registered an FIR under the Juvenile Justice Act and the section 188 (disobedience to an order passed by a government servant) at Mehrauli,” Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south) said on Thursday.According to Priyank Kanoongo, chairperson of NCPCR, the two homes are run by Centre for Equity Studies where activist Harsh Mander is a director. Kanoongo accused the officials of the two homes of trying to “derail” the enquiry process by saying that Mander was not connected to them.While Mander remained unavailable for a response despite repeated phone calls and a text message, a response sent by the management of the homes said that Mander only conceived the Rainbow Homes Programme (HRP) under which the children are cared for.The management said the NCPCR was trying to malign the reputation of HRP as Mander is a “known critic of the government and its policies”, they added that Mander was no longer associated with the “day-to-day running” of the programme.Kanoogoo said there were shortcomings in how the children at the home for boys were kept and the arrangements for their toilets and bathrooms despite several incidents of sexual abuse.The management of the homes said none of the three known cases of sexual abuse between 2012 and 2016 involved the staff there and was perpetrated by inmates. They said all cases were brought to the notice of the authorities and led to registration of FIRs.But DCP Thakur said that there were reports of sexual abuse continuing and not being reported. However, no cases of sexual abuse was found in the home for girls.Kanoogoo, as well as the findings of an inspection by NCPCR on October 1, pointed to alleged irregularities in the financial aspects of the two homes, the living conditions of the children and flouting of several applicable laws.Other allegations, the DCP said, was of the children being sent to attend anti-CAA protests, not having necessary measures in place to deal with Covid-19 and foreign nationals visiting the homes.The management denied any financial irregularities, and said that no children were sent to attend any protests and there were no set rules or standard operating procedures (SOPs) for several shortcomings that the commission noted during the inspection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-fir-against-two-children-s-homes-for-abuse-and-irregularities-101612472859653.html
05-02-2021||India||43 FIRs in R-Day violence, 13 being probed by special cell: Delhi police to HC||The Delhi Police on Thursday informed the Delhi high court that 43 FIRs have been registered in the Republic Day violence, out of which 13 have been transferred to the special cell.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was told by the police, represented by Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, that provisions of UAPA have also been invoked in some cases involving banned organization “Sikhs for Justice” and investigations is on.The submissions were made while hearing a plea seeking a probe into the violence during farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day and the alleged lapse in security, which resulted in a religious flag being hoisted at the Red Fort.The court declined to hear the plea and asked the petitioners, three Uttar Pradesh residents, to withdraw the petition or face costs. It said that a crime can happen in a fraction of seconds but the investigation takes time, while adding that it was to analyse the mindset of such petitions.“So you started typing the petition right after the incident on January 26 noon? Do you know how much time is given for investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code? You are a lawyer. How much time is given for an investigation?”“You expect the investigations to be completed within two days of the incident? Does the government have a magic wand which it will wave and everything will be done? Should we dismiss it with cost or will you withdraw,” the bench asked advocate Vivek Narayan Sharma, appearing for the petitioner.Man arrested for R-Day violence gets bailA Delhi court has granted bail to a man arrested for allegedly being part of unlawful assembly and conducting riots in the Uttam Nagar area during the tractor rally on Republic Day. The court stated that “no fruitful purpose would be served by curtailing the liberty of the accused”.Additional sessions judge Dheeraj Mor, while granting bail to one Sandeep Kumar, said that the Investigating officer’s report is “conspicuously silent” about his previous criminal involvement.“Therefore, there is no reason to doubt the submissions on behalf of the accused that he has clear antecedents. He is no more required for the investigation of this case. In the aforesaid circumstances, no fruitful purpose will be served by further curtailing the liberty of the accused,” the judge said in his order of February 3.The judge also noted that co-accused Gurvinder Singh, with the similar allegations as that of the accused, was released by the police after giving a notice.Kumar, through his counsel, advocate Kapil Chaudhary, had contended his client was falsely implicated in this case and he was just a bystander at the spot of occurrence. He said that Kumar was neither part of the unlawful assembly nor he was involved in the riots.The counsel said that Kumar owns a shop of iron rods at Kakrola, Dwarka Mor, New Delhi and he was not part of any agitation.However, opposing the bail application, additional public prosecutor Satvinder Kaur, told the court that the accused was part of unlawful assembly that committed riots and caused injuries to nine police personnel. She said that the members of the unlawful assembly also damaged the public property including the cluster buses.The police had earlier released a list of over 120 arrestees after allegations that several protestors were illegally detained without even informing their families.Advocate Harpreet Singh Hora said that their legal team has been providing legal aid since the first day of the arrests of several farmers and this type of orders give them hope.“Additionally, the bail reinforces our faith that the people who have been wrongly implicated in these cases shall get justice. What we are doing is upholding the law and we will strive to fight cases of these farmers till this reaches a logical conclusion,” he said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over two months now against the three farm laws.The tractor parade on January 26 that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/43-firs-in-r-day-violence-13-being-probed-by-special-cell-delhi-police-to-hc-101612471992469.html
05-02-2021||India||Creators of ‘toolkit’ booked for conspiracy and sedition||The Delhi Police on Thursday said they have registered a first information report (FIR) to probe a “toolkit”, or document, that allegedly detailed an action plan for online and offline protests linked to the ongoing farmers’ agitation, including those during a tractor rally in the national capital on Republic Day.The toolkit was tweeted by Swedish environment activist Greta Thunberg along with a post in support of the agitating farmers.At a news briefing, Praveer Ranjan, special commissioner of police (crime), said the FIR against the creators of the toolkit mentioned charges of criminal conspiracy and sedition, but did not name any individual. He was responding to a question that if police had registered a case against Thunberg.Hours earlier, as reports of an FIR against Thunberg were flashed by multiple news outlets — police later clarified the FIR was against unknown persons — the 18-year-old activist posted: “I still #StandWithFarmers and support their peaceful protest. No amount of hate, threats or violations of human rights will ever change that. #FarmersProtest.”During the media briefing, Ranjan pointed to a “copycat execution of the action plan detailed in the toolkit” in the past few days, including the protests on January 26 that plunged into chaos. He said an initial probe revealed that the document was created by pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF).HT could not find any verified social media handle or contact number of PJF. The group’s website did not have any contact details. Ranjan did not specify who exactly would be probed or how the investigators planned to go about it.The toolkit became a talking point after Thunberg shared a link to the document on Wednesday, deleted it, and then again posted an updated link on Thursday.“Here’s an updated toolkit by people on the ground in India if you want to help. (They removed their previous document as it was outdated.),” Thunberg, who has supported the farmers protesting against three controversial agricultural laws, said.The updated toolkit, which HT has seen, gave a brief description of the ongoing farmers’ agitation and called upon people to participate or organise on-ground protests, post tweets supporting the agitation, contact legal representatives and sign petitions. It did not appear to be out of the ordinary as guidelines for online protest campaigns go.The farmers’ agitation has been getting global attraction with international celebrities such as pop star Rihanna and activist Thunberg tweeting in support of the protesters. Actor Amanda Cerny, singers Jay Sean and Dr Zeus, and US sporting icons Juju Smith Schuster, Baron Davis and Kyle Kuzma supported the farmers. They were joined by lawmakers from the UK, the US and other countries.Police are probing the contents of the first “toolkit” that was brought down, according to officials who did not want to be named. Officials did not explain how international celebrities and lawmakers became a part of the campaign.Ranjan said the toolkit had an action plan that called for “digital strikes through hashtags” on or before January 26, “tweets storm” from January 23, and “physical action” on January 26, among others.“Design of the author of the toolkit is to create disharmony among various social, religious and cultural groups and encourage disaffection against the government of India. It also aims at waging social, cultural and economic war against India,” he said.The FIR was registered by the cyber cell of the Delhi Police under the Indian Penal Code’s sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 124A (spreading disharmony), 153 (provocation with intent to cause riots) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups).Ranjan said the toolkit was noticed by the police while monitoring social media accounts peddling “hateful and malicious content” related to ongoing the farmers’ protest.“During our negotiations with the farmer leaders (before the tractor march on Republic Day), we had made them aware that vested interests were using the agitation to spread disaffection and hatred towards the Indian government,” he said.Vikram Singh, former director general of Uttar Pradesh Police, said the FIR was “perfectly in order” as the toolkit was part of a “concerted international effort against the country”.“Agitations are welcome, but the toolkit was actually meant to serve as a call for violence even as it left many things unwritten,” Singh said.An Indian security assessment, seen by HT, suggested that a coordinated campaign involving “a number of global celebrities”, was being run in the backdrop farmer’s protest. According to the assessment, the “content and the campaign” were being designed and run through www.askindiawhy.com. It added that this website was managed through another platform called Poetic Justice Foundation, allegedly run by a Canadian Khalistani who runs a PR agency and is close to politicians in Canada.“While the campaign takes the cover of farmers protest, content is designed to play on the same three fault lines that have been used to target India particularly by Pakistan, viz. the Sikh, Muslim and the Dalit agenda...,” the assessment said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/creators-of-toolkit-booked-for-conspiracy-and-sedition-101612470028794.html
05-02-2021||India||Facebook gets new notice to appear before Delhi Assembly committee probing riots||The Delhi Legislative Assembly on Thursday issued a fresh notice to Facebook India, this time avoiding specific notice to its Vice-President Ajit Mohan, by asking a senior, responsible officer from the company to appear before the Peace and Harmony Committee examining the Delhi riots that took place in February last year.The fresh notice was placed by the Assembly before the Supreme Court, which is hearing a plea filed by Mohan and Facebook India challenging the notice summoning him to depose as a witness before the Committee. The three-judge bench headed by Justice SK Kaul took the fresh notice on record and said, “The specific challenge to the earlier notices of September 10 and September 18 would not stand as those notices stand substituted with the fresh notice.”For the Delhi Assembly, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi continued arguments for the second consecutive day. During the hearing, the bench, which also comprised of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, told Singhvi, “You have improved your situation with the new notice now.”On Wednesday, the bench had hinted that Mohan’s petition suggested that the notice issued to him by the Assembly compelled him to appear and depose as a witness before a non-statutory. The bench had raised queries on whether the Assembly intended to specifically call Mohan or anybody in his place. Singhvi had pointed out to the Court that the notice never required only Mohan to depose but any senior, responsible person from the company capable of assisting the Committee.In this backdrop, the fresh notice was issued requiring Facebook to depose before the Committee through a senior, responsible person. Singhvi argued the larger issue raised in the petition where Mohan has questioned the power of the Committee to summon him. This argument was based on the peculiar character assigned to the Delhi Assembly which has been denuded under the Constitution from legislating on three subjects – land, law and order and police.In his two-hour s arguments, Singhvi led the bench through various entries in the State List and Concurrent List, by which the Delhi Assembly derives its power to discuss and debate on the issue in question. “I (Assembly) am discussing a subject not to the pleasure of the Central government. To say that I can’t even discuss is a matter of legislative dignity.” He cited Entry 1 in State List dealing with public order, which is distinct from law and order. Again, he cited Entry 1 in Concurrent List which gives a sweeping power to State Assemblies to legislate on the subject ‘criminal law’. On Wednesday, Singhvi cited Entry 39 in State List by which Assemblies can enforce attendance of witnesses for purpose of recording statements.The bench told Singhvi, “Ultimately, what is to be decided is what the Peace and Harmony Committee is doing falls within those territories of which you (Assembly) have been excluded. There is peculiarity with Delhi due to exclusion of some entries (land, law and order, police). Reading of the entries have to be such that it will not amount to encroachment into excluded entries.”The arguments in the case will continue on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-gets-new-notice-to-appear-before-delhi-assembly-committee-probing-riots-101612468672035.html
05-02-2021||India||Rajya Sabha debates, but no end to Lok Sabha impasse||HRajya Sabha members debated the new farm laws for the second day on Thursday along with the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis and the subsequent migrant workers’ crisis.The Upper House debate proceeded smoothly even as the Lok Sabha deadlock continued. Speaker Om Birla called Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury and parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi and his deputy Arjun Ram Meghwal for a marathon meeting, seen as a last-ditch effort to salvage the debate in the Lower House where the PM is scheduled to reply at 5pm on Friday.“I want to draw the attention to the farmers’ agitation today, despite the adversities of the weather,” Congress MP Deepender Hooda said in the Rajya Sabha. “There have been 11 rounds of talks with the government. There has been no resolution to the issue, instead 194 farmers have been martyred.”Hooda said the government failed to express a single word of condolence for those who lost their lives.“This government has lost the faith of the people,” he said. Hooda drew Parliament’s attention to the barricades erected by Delhi Police at the borders of the national capital. “Despotism can never defeat democracy. The farmer of a country can never be a serf.”BJP MP Jyotiraditya Scindia lauded the Prime Minister’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis and other challenging issues since he came to power for the second time. “Jammu and Kashmir has been freed from historical chains and over 1.5 crore people have received the benefits of central schemes,” he said. He added that the PM had rolled out visionary reforms. “The Ram mandir will be a symbol of a new and strong India,” Scindia said.Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the PM had taken every crisis head-on. “The mandate of the country has been vested in the PM not once but twice in the national elections. Modi ji has worked for energy justice that the farmers will benefit from,” said Pradhan. “India is also working to develop alternate energy in the form of hydrogen fuel.”Congress MP Digvijay Singh raised the issue of the farm laws and said that democracy was being suppressed in the country. “We respect the mandate you have, but the way in which dissent, which is the backbone of a democracy, is being suppressed in our country is deplorable,” Singh said. “The foisting of cases against farmers, journalists, activists and such needs to stop.”He was backed by Trinamool MP Derek O’Brien who said the government had failed to uphold the sanctity of Parliament. “Members had asked, as is procedure, for the bills to be referred to a select committee, but the government never did that. Political administration is the purview of the Prime Minister and the home minister. This government has failed on many counts, including handling of the Covid-19 crisis and the economy.”O’Brien said he had prepared a draft to repeal the three farms laws.The DMK’s NR Elango said the government was violating the federal structure with the farm laws. “The farm laws occupy the field of the state’s power,” Elango said “The government legislated them in tearing hurry and farmers’ interest was not considered.”The laws, farmers say, will only aid private enterprises and hurt their livelihoods. The opposition has demanded a repeal of all three laws, but the government has agreed to a waiver for 18 months, during which it says the legislation will be re-examined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-debates-but-no-end-to-lok-sabha-impasse-101612467626231.html
05-02-2021||India||Budget proposal for investment limit to affect 0.3% of 45 mn EPF subscribers||The Budget proposal to impose ₹2.50 lakh annual limit for tax-free employee’s contribution in provident funds (PFs) will affect only 0.3% of total 45 million subscribers of Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) having combined deposits of over ₹62,500 crore, two finance ministry officials said.These 1.23 lakh employees provident fund (EPF) accounts have on an average a corpus of ₹5.92 crore per person. They are earning huge sum – on an average Rs. 50.3 lakh per account holder per annum – which is tax free with an assured 8% interest, they said requesting anonymity.“About 0.27% people are using the retirement fund in a very scheming manner at the cost of the salaried class and other taxpayers. This anomaly was required to be corrected,” one of them said.Out of this minority group, the highest contribution is made by an individual [name withheld] with over ₹103 crore in his account, followed by two with over ₹86 crore each. The top 20 high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) have about ₹825 crore in their accounts while top 100 HNIs contributed more than ₹2,000 crore, he said.The Budget 2021-22, presented in the Parliament on Monday by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, rationalised tax-free Income on provident funds.“In order to rationalise tax exemption for the income earned by high income employees, it is proposed to restrict tax exemption for the interest income earned on the employees’ contribution to various provident funds to the annual contribution of ₹2.5 lakh. This restriction shall be applicable only for the contribution made on or after 01.04.2021,” the annexure to her budget speech said.The decision to remove the tax exemption on provident fund contributions of ₹2.5 lakh and above in the budget has been based on the principle of equity among the contributors. “Since any tax exemption is provided through taxpayers’ money, it was unfair to allow a small group of HNIs to misuse a welfare facility and earn wrongfully tax free income as assured interest return, adding that average normal EPF or GPF [General Provident Fund] contributor would not be affected by the removal of anomaly in the system prevailing over a long period of time,” the official quoted above said.Quoting Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Pramod Chandra Mody, HT reported on Thursday that along with EPF, this rule will also be applicable to all government employees covered by GPF. India has three main provident funds -- EPF for the organised sector, GPF for government employees and PPF for all resident Indians.“The Budget proposal will not have any impact on PPF subscribers as PPF contribution cannot be more than ₹1.50 lakh per annum,” said Naveen Wadhwa, deputy general manager at Taxmann, a tax research and advisory firm. PPF is a social security fund for general public.The Budget has done away with this disparity of paying huge sum of tax-free interest to HNIs at the cost of honest average salaried class contributor and taxpayers, a second official said. “Several HNIs have been parking huge sums -- more than a crore of rupees per month -- to misuse the provision of assured high interest without paying any tax. This distortion has been corrected,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-proposal-for-investment-limit-to-affect-0-3-of-45-mn-epf-subscribers-101612467312433.html
05-02-2021||India||US says it supports reform but cautions against curbs||The US on Thursday weighed in on the ongoing farmers’ agitation at New Delhi’s borders for the first time since it began in November-end, saying peaceful protests and unhindered access to information, including the internet, were hallmarks of a “thriving democracy”, but at the same time backed reforms that would increase efficiency of Indian markets and attract more private investment.The carefully worded response by Joe Biden’s administration also encouraged a “dialogue” between farmers and the government to end the agitation that has been getting global attraction with international celebrities such as pop star Rihanna and green activist Greta Thunberg tweeting in support of the protesters.The external affairs ministry said the comments by the US must be seen in their entirety, while pointing out that State Department “has acknowledged” India’s steps towards reforms, which have emerged as a point of contention. The government also appeared to draw parallels between a farmers’ rally on January 26 that plunged into chaos and the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by Donald Trump’s supporters protesting election results that declared his defeat in the presidential race.“We recognise that peaceful protests are a hallmark of any thriving democracy and note that the Indian Supreme Court has stated the same,” a US State Department spokesperson said in Washington in response to a request for comment from US media. A version of it was provided to HT. “We encourage that any differences between the parties be resolved through dialogue.”In New Delhi, a US embassy spokesperson echoed a similar response.The State Department did not mention anything specific to three new farm laws that have triggered the agitation (now in its 71st day), but appeared supportive of reforms. “In general, the United States welcomes steps that would improve the efficiency of India’s markets and attract greater private sector investment,” the spokesperson said.“We recognise that unhindered access to information, including the internet, is fundamental to the freedom of expression and a hallmark of a thriving democracy,” the spokesperson added, a remark that came in the backdrop of internet curbs at protest sites.Asked about the US position at a news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Any protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse.”Describing India and the US as vibrant democracies with shared values, Srivastava added: “The incidents of violence and vandalism at the historic Red Fort on January 26 have evoked similar sentiments and reactions in India as did the incidents on the Capitol Hill on January 6 and are being addressed as per our respective local laws.”He said “temporary measures” on internet access in parts of the National Capital Region were “undertaken to prevent further violence”.Michael Kugelman, South Asia expert at leading think-tank Wilson Center, Washington’s comments were unlikely to trouble the Narendra Modi government.“What strikes me about these comments is their neutrality. Aside from some soft criticism that the State Department made about the internet blocks...they don’t convey anything that New Delhi would find disagreeable. Washington is essentially saying it agrees with India’s new farm laws and with any peaceful protestors that may oppose them,” Kugelman said.Milan Vaishnav, South Asia expert with Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, “I actually found the State Department statement to be quite balanced. While the statement reiterates the right of Indians to peacefully protest, it also expressed its support for the underlying motivations of the farm reform bills. In my view, I think U.S. diplomats threaded the needle very well. I would also add that the MEA seems to have also picked up on this--highlighting, in its response, U.S. support for continued market reforms in agriculture. The MEA statement also links the Jan 26th incursion at the Red Fort to the January 6 Capitol insurrection, a not-so-subtle message that the U.S. is facing its own domestic infirmities.”Tens of thousands of farmers have camped at Delhi’s borders, demanding the repeal of the three contentious laws passed by Parliament in September. Eleven rounds of talks between the protesters and the government have failed to break the impasse. Protesters say the laws will hurt their livelihood and leave them at the mercy of big corporations. The government defends the laws as necessary for long-overdue reforms in the agriculture sector.On Republic Day, violence broke out during a tractor rally by farmers after a section of the protesters veered off the routes agreed with police and resorted to vandalism. Clashes broke out in several places, including the 17th-century Red Fort and the ITO intersection.On that day, internet services were suspended, albeit temporarily, at three key protest sites — Singhu and Tikri (on Haryana border), and Ghazipur (on Uttar Pradesh border). Services were suspended again on January 29 for two days, and then extended till February 3.After the violence, authorities stepped up security at the protest sites, placing iron spikes and steel barricades to prevent the agitators from entering Delhi.The agitation landed in global spotlight after Rihanna, who has 101 million followers, tweeted a CNN news report about internet curbs on Tuesday. Meena Harris, an American lawyer and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, actor Amanda Cerny, singers Jay Sean and Dr Zeus, and US sporting icons Juju Smith Schuster, Baron Davis and Kyle Kuzma supported the farmers. They were joined by lawmakers from the UK, the US and other countries.On Wednesday, India said criticism by foreign celebrities and attempts to “mobilise international support” against the country on the government’s handling of the protests without ascertaining facts were “neither accurate nor responsible”. In a rare statement, the external affairs ministry contended that “vested interest groups” were trying to enforce their agenda, referring to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others”. It didn’t name anyone.While Indian movie stars such as Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn said citizens should focus on the government’s efforts to resolve the farmers’ crisis, others appeared to be on the opposite side of the debate. “If one tweet rattles your unity, one joke rattles your faith or one show rattles your religious belief then it’s you who has to work on strengthening your value system not become ‘propaganda teacher’ for others,” actor Taapsee Pannu posted.The tug of war continued on Thursday. Opposition parties stepped up attack on the government even as leaders of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched a counter-offensive.“The issue is not Rihanna or Greta Thunberg or any individual. The issue is the manner in which the government is countering the farmers’ protests as though they were an invading army,” senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram tweeted. “There are many Gretas among Indian women and girls, but they are shackled by poverty, social constraints and fear. Sooner than later, India’s Gretas will find their voices and speak in favour of the farmers,” he added.Late on Thursday evening, farm leader Rakesh Tikait said, “If some foreigner is supporting the movement, then what’s the problem? They are not giving or taking anything from us.”In Nagpur, BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis told reporters that there was an international conspiracy to defame India and spark chaos and unrest in the country. “How an international conspiracy is going on has been revealed with the tweets. India is being defamed using the platform of farmers’ protest,” Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Valerie Vaz, a senior MP of Britain’s Labour Party and sister of former lawmaker Keith Vaz, wrote a letter to foreign minister Dominic Raab to reiterate the concerns of her constituents regarding events related to the farmers’ protest. The Indian-origin MP was among 35 British lawmakers to take up the farmers’ protest with Raab before he visited India in December.Vaz asked Raab to contact the Indian government “as a matter of urgency regarding these concerning events”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-says-it-supports-reform-but-cautions-against-curbs-101612466863173.html
05-02-2021||India||Bengal’s top Muslim clerics want paper ballots in polls, question EVMs||The West Bengal Imams’ Association and clerics from the famous Furfura Sharif shrine in Bengal’s Hooghly district want paper ballots to be offered as an option to voters in addition to electronic voting machines (EVM) in the assembly polls due in April-May.“I appeal to chief minister Mamata Banerjee and members of the state assembly to use provisions laid down in Article 328 of the Constitution and pass a law that will offer voters the option to use ballot paper if they do not wish to use EVMs. Article 328 empowers state legislative assemblies to frame laws in regard to assembly polls,” Md Yahiya, chairman of the state imams’ association told HT on Thursday.“The budget session of the state assembly will commence on Friday. We are writing to the chief minister and the assembly speaker, urging them to place a bill that will give voters an option. The Maharashtra government is working on this. India’s voters and opposition parties lodged complaints against use of EVMs several times in the past. Many countries have discarded the machines. In a country as big as ours, polls cannot be held solely with machines,” said Yahiya.Of about 40,000 mosques in Bengal, clerics from at least 26,000 are members of the association.Article 328 says: Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and in so far as provision in that behalf is not made by Parliament, the Legislature of a State may from time to time by law make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, the elections to the House or either House of the Legislature of the State including the preparation of electoral rolls and all other matters necessary for securing the due constitution of such House or Houses.The Furfura Sharif shrine is one of the most popular places of pilgrimage in Bengal. It is built around the mausoleum of Pir Abu Bakr Siddiqui. It also has a mosque built in 1375 and draws millions during the Urs festival and the annual fair dedicated to the Pir. Urban development minister Firhad Hakim visited Furfura Sharif on Tuesday when the mazaar authorities distributed clothes and blankets among 10,000 people. Hakim also delivered a speech.“We support the imams. If people in Europe and America can use ballot paper why do we need machines? People should be given the option of voting in the traditional way since questions have been raised about EVMs,” said Pirzada Jiauddin Siddiqui, a scion of the Pir’s family and son of Allamah Kutubuddin Siddiqui, the most senior among the clerics at Furfura Sharif.The demand from the clerics attains significance since Bengal’s Muslim population stood at 27.01% during the 2011 census and is projected to have increased to around 30% now. According to surveys done by the TMC and the BJP, a swing in Muslim votes can influence poll results in as many as 120 assembly seats.Among the districts where the Muslim population is substantially high are Murshidabad (66.28%), Malda (51.27%), North Dinajpur (49.92%), South 24 Parganas (35.57%), and Birbhum (37.06%). There are a large number of Muslim voters in East and West Burdwan districts, North 24 Parganas and Nadia as well.Senior TMC leaders did not want to comment on record on the development. “This is a serious issue. The assembly polls are conducted by the Election Commission of India. The legal provisions need to be studied,” a cabinet minister said on condition of anonymity.Former advocate general of Tripura and now a Rajya Sabha member, eminent lawyer Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya welcomed the demand.“I do not see any reason to oppose it. We always welcome technology but freedom of the people is more important. The Maharashtra government is working on the process of reintroducing ballots. Why shouldn’t the Central government come forward and say that it will return to the ballot paper system? I also argued before the Calcutta high court in a recent case that candidates should be allowed to file nomination papers and fees online. This will reduce pre-poll violence to a large extent,” said Bhattacharya.Siddiqullah Chowdhury, a minister in the TMC government and president of the Jamiat Ulema -e–Hind’s Bengal unit, however, said there are too many legal knots.“The demand raised by the imams’ association is not something that can be met easily. I do not think anything will come out of it,” said Chowdhury.Union home minister Amit Shah has announced that his party will oust the Mamata Banerjee government by winning over 200 of the state’s 294 seats while Banerjee’s election strategist Prashant Kishor recently tweeted that he will give up his job if the BJP’s tally crosses 99.The Bengal BJP said the demand is part of an effort to steal the limelight and makes no sense.“We have full faith in the present system. The arguments put forth against EVMs are irrelevant since none of the parties that raised issues could prove anything. Those raising this demand again are only trying to hog the limelight,” said Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the Bengal BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengals-top-muslim-clerics-want-paper-ballots-in-polls-question-evms-101612466343969.html
05-02-2021||India||India responds to Pakistan Army chief's ‘hand of peace’ with call to end terror||India on Thursday responded to the Pakistan Army chief’s offer of a “hand of peace” and call for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue by saying the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror to facilitate good relations.Addressing a graduation ceremony at the Pakistan Air Force Academy on Wednesday, army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa had said Pakistan is firmly committed to the ideal of mutual respect and peaceful co-existence.“It is time to extend [a] hand of peace in all directions,” Bajwa said, according to an official statement. Pakistan and India must “resolve the longstanding issue of Jammu and Kashmir in a dignified and peaceful manner” in line with aspirations of the Kashmiri people and “bring this human tragedy to its logical conclusion”, he added.Asked about Bajwa’s remarks at a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava reiterated India’s stated position that there couldn’t be any talks as long as Pakistan failed to end cross-border terrorism emanating from its territory.“Our position is well-known. India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence,” Srivastava said.“The onus is on Pakistan for creating such an environment,” he added.Bajwa’s remarks marked the latest overture by the Pakistani side for talks to address bilateral tensions and the Kashmir issue. Relations between the two sides nose-dived after the Indian government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019. In response, Pakistan decided not to post an envoy in New Delhi and asked the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad to leave.Even before that, relations were damaged by the February 2019 suicide attack at Pulwama, which killed 40 Indian troopers and was blamed on Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). India retaliated with an air strike on a JeM base within Pakistan, triggering aerial battles a day later that resulted in the shooting down of an Indian jet fighter.The two sides have not held any substantive dialogue since the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Track II and back channels contacts too have stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-responds-to-pakistan-army-chief-s-hand-of-peace-with-call-to-end-terror-101612464578678.html
05-02-2021||India||Punjab, UP lock horns over Mukhtar Ansari’s custody||The Uttar Pradesh and Punjab governments have locked horns in the Supreme Court over custody of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari.A Bahujan Samaj Party MLA from Mau in the UP assembly, Ansari is wanted in the state for trial in 14 criminal cases, but he continues to be lodged since January 2019 in a jail in Punjab where he was named in an extortion case.While the Yogi Adityanath government has complained about the trial not proceeding in UP because of Ansari’s absence, the Punjab government has now filed an affidavit in the top court, refusing to hand over his custody.The Punjab government has cited Ansari’s health -- he is reportedly suffering from hypertension, diabetes, back pain, skin allergy and depression,-- to shoot down the UP government’s plea.Demanding dismissal of the UP government’s writ petition in the SC, the Amarinder Singh government has maintained that it was acting as per medical opinion and that there was no “pre-conceived conspiracy” to keep Ansari away from UP.Filed through the jail superintendent of the Rupnagar prison where Ansari is currently lodged, the affidavit stated that the writ petition by UP was not even maintainable in law since the state could not claim infringement of its fundamental rights on account of Ansari’s detention in Punjab.The Punjab government acknowledged that Ansari was required in UP for trial in 14 criminal cases on charges of murder, extortion and under the Gangster Act, but remained firm that the law empowered the jail superintendent to abstain from complying with a judge’s order to hand over custody of a prisoner on account of sickness.“The responsibility of ensuring safe custody, wellness and good health of respondent no.3 (Ansari) while in custody is solely of the answering respondent (jail superintendent) and that all decisions taken were as per the mandate of the law, tempered with the express medical advice regarding the condition of the health of Ansari,” read the affidavit, filed last week before a bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan.Out of 26 production warrants issued by UP courts for Ansari’s appearance, the Punjab government has claimed that 10 were not received by the jail authorities. On many other dates of trial proceedings before the UP courts, Ansari had been advised “bed rest” by government doctors and medical boards in Punjab due to his health, as per the affidavit.The Punjab government has also admitted that Ansari has not even applied for bail in the extortion case registered nor have the police been able to file a charge sheet since registration of the FIR in January 2019. Notably, under the law, Ansari is entitled to come out on bail only on the ground that there has been no charge sheet filed in the case so far. But he has chosen not to apply for bail.The Supreme Court, which had in December issued notices to the Punjab government,and Ansari, will take up the matter next on February 8.Ansari, in an application to a trial judge in Agra in October 2019, stated that he apprehended he could be killed on the way if he was taken to a jail in UP from Punjab. He requested that he be allowed to appear through video-conferencing. In the cases where the trial courts have allowed his plea, Ansari was being produced through video-conferencing.Bharatiya Janata Party’s Mohammadabad (UP) MLA Alka Rai told HT: “This is unfortunate that a state government is impeding the course of justice and refusing to send Ansari to face trials in UP by citing diseases such as sugar and hypertension. Can these ever be ailments of the kind that can stop someone from travelling? The big question is why Ansari and his relatives are being shielded by Congress governments in Punjab and Rajasthan? Is it fair on a state to protect someone facing over a dozen criminal cases and deny victims of crime their right?”Alka Rai is the wife of the slain MLA Krishnanand Rai, who was shot dead in 2005. Ansari was accused of killing her husband but later acquitted in the case.“Medical advice should be respected, unless proven otherwise. But since the matter is subjudice, we will abide by the court’s order,” Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-up-lock-horns-over-mukhtar-ansari-s-custody-101612462030336.html

05-02-2021||Today's||Ind vs NZ? It’s down to the wire||The present: A home series against England is on and India is surely looking to dominate the visitors (what fun!). The past: Memories of an astounding series win in Australia are still as fresh as the bruises on Cheteshwar Pujara.The future: India and New Zealand look set to clash for the first-ever ICC World Test Championship (WTC) title this June. It’s not necessary in sport that the two best teams of the time meet in the final of a tournament or league, but if India do make it to the final against New Zealand, that’s exactly what we’ll get. The two are, at the moment, Test match giants in a league of their own. The inaugural WTC may have run into a once-in-a-lifetime threat in the form of Covid-19 (and almost run aground), but a bit of adaptation and some vagaries of luck could bring us to this breath-taking pass. Kane Williamson and his Black Caps were only assured of a place in the WTC final this week when Australia pulled out of a three-Test tour of South Africa citing concerns about the Covid-19 numbers there. India may miss out on the final, of course. Virat Kohli and his men need to win at least two Tests in the four-match series, and ensure that England don’t win both the other matches, to get to the WTC final.Meanwhile, Australia needed to win at least two of the three Tests and stop South Africa from winning a single match, for a sure shot at the finals. They could still get there, if England win at least two matches. England have a chance if they win at least three of the four matches in the series. New Zealand, on the other hand, flattened both West Indies and Pakistan in home series wins to claim enough points under a WTC scoring system that was revised to reflect the disrupted realities of cricket being played during a pandemic. In some ways, it was that jaw-dropping win at the Gabba that made India a frontrunner for a place in the final, and, crucially, dropped Australia a few decimal points behind New Zealand (after they were docked points for slow over rates). The team that has won more Tests than any other in the last decade may miss out on the WTC final partly due to a rule that penalises wasting time. The irony! But let us shed no tears.Instead, let us consider the delicious possibilities of a match between two teams with a penchant for taking things to the wire. New Zealand and India have a lot in common as cricketing units. They fight for every inch and are fearless in battle. India proved that in Australia. New Zealand proved it during the heart-stopping 2019 ICC World Cup final. Both teams are led by clear-sighted captains with a great drive to win, but also a rock-solid commitment to fair play. There is perhaps no one more loved in world cricket right now than Williamson, whose Brooklyn-hipster urban-lumberjack beard barely conceals the kindest smile in the sport. Kohli is far too abrasive to be loved as universally, but behind his streetfighter belligerence is a man who picks up his toughest opponent when he falls (remember him appealing to the crowds to not pick on Steve Smith?). Williamson and Kohli are also two of the finest Test batsman in the world right now and this would be a spectacular match-up for that reason alone. Add to that two teams bursting with skilled batsmen and fierce fast bowlers, grit and experience, youth and exuberance. If India’s find of the season is Mohammed Siraj and his crafty bowling full of angles and movement, New Zealand’s most recent discovery comes in the form of a nearly 7-ft-tall fast bowler who picked up 11 wickets in his last Test. His name is Kyle Jamieson and he also took a fifer in just the second Test of his career, against India last year. If we have Jasprit Bumrah’s blistering pace and movement, they have Trent Boult, who partnered Bumrah in the Mumbai Indians squad in the last Indian Premier League. If India have Pujara as the bedrock of the Test middle order, New Zealand have Henry Nicholls in that pivotal batting spot. Williamson himself is only dealing in centuries, sometimes in double hundreds. In the single inning he has played this year, against Pakistan, he scored 238. There’s some uncertainty over whether the WTC final will be held at the Lord’s or Southampton’s Rose Bowl. Lord’s has history on its side of course, but its limpid wicket will not do justice to the fiery bowling both sides have to offer. The Rose Bowl is no bowler’s paradise either. Yet, at least for one side, the London ground may prove to be a nervous place to be in. After all, what could go wrong with New Zealand in a major final at the Lord’s?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/ind-vs-nz-it-s-down-to-the-wire-101612534227674.html
05-02-2021||Today's||Dealing with Resolution fatigue: Life Hacks by Charles Assisi||Most studies confirm that by this time of year, at least 80% of people have broken their New Year resolutions. I’ve been among them, numerous times. The only reason I no longer am is that I don’t make resolutions any more. After much experience of why it is a bad idea, and much reading that confirms it is, I have decided to go with the belief that it isn’t a lack of will power that leads us to break our resolutions — it’s usually the nature of the resolutions themselves. Most are so very myopic. The most common promises to the self tend to fall into three groups — losing weight, living more healthily and managing money better. There are two core problems here — a). You can’t wake up overnight an altogether different person and b) the decision isn’t always up to you. Resolutions tend to operate in absolutes and make no room for the people in our lives, the interpersonal relationships we must nurture, the investments we must make in our social groups. We have identities in each of these domains and each of those identities operates differently, with different priorities and goals. When we pursue one absolute goal, our other identities begin to suffer. And it is only a matter of time before they rebel and the resolution suffers. So if you’re suffering from resolution fatigue, consider this question: Has your resolution compelled you to give up other parts of your identity? If the answer to that is yes, it is time to revisit the resolution, tweak it, and treat it as a work in progress. There are tried-and-true mental models that can be deployed along the way. The Theory of Constraints is one of my favourites. One example of how this works was when the founder and publisher of Random House bet $60 in 1960 that Dr Seuss couldn’t write a children’s book in 50 words. Dr Suess accepted the bet. He retreated and emerged a year later to deliver Green Eggs and Ham. The book went on to sell 8 million copies and is now acknowledged as the fourth-best-selling children’s hardcover of all time. My limited submission here is that all of us face constraints. If the stated resolution is to lose weight and you’re struggling, with a voice in the head asking you to give up because time is a constraint, re-examine with honestly how much time you can really spare. And use that time, because it will add up in the long term. To ensure you do, deploy the Pledge and Radical Inflexibility. These are models that emerge from the writings of legendary management teacher Clayton Christensen and Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time. Christensen pledged to his family he would not work on Saturdays and would spend time with them instead. He stuck to that pledge to his dying day. Buffett communicated to everyone he did business with that was radically inflexible on price would not negotiate. Deploying models such as these, both have communicated through their writings, rescued them from decision fatigue. In an attempt to deploy these learnings, I applied a constraint on myself — that I would not engage with the screen before 9 am. I’ve been radically inflexible about it too. The early days were tough because I like to start early, and not having visibility on what the day may look like makes me feel terribly uncomfortable. It was just a matter of time before the head started to work its way around this constraint. I now maintain a monthly and weekly calendar that I review at regular intervals. With this one change, pockets of time began to open up in the mornings that are allowing me time to reflect, course-correct, think about the long-term. This is time I am unwilling to give up on now. It is good not just for me but for everyone around me as well. What is evident to me now is that the time invested here helps nourish my other identities as well. It’s also made it clear to me that I underestimate the effort required to complete a task, and overestimate the time I have on hand. That is why I have also borrowed a model that prudent financial planners deploy when thinking about the future — they inflate the prices of everything. As a thumb rule, I now inflate the time it will take me to complete a task. In doing so, I find that I have fallen into a virtuous cycle: I sometimes end up with even more time on my hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/dealing-with-resolution-fatigue-life-hacks-by-charles-assisi-101612524445821.html
