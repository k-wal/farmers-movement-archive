On Wednesday, the police also arrested one suspect, Dharmendra Singh Harman, a resident of Delhi, who was identified from the several video clips of the clashes at the fort, a senior officer said. Police said they have identified more than 260 vehicles, including nearly 100 tractors, which were part of the rally and involved in the violence at the fort and other places in Delhi when protesters clashed with the police after breaking barriers and entering the city from Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri.“We have announced R1 lakh against Sidhu, Jugraj and two others because they appear to be the key conspirators. Raids have been conducted at many places in Punjab and other states, but the suspects are absconding. The family members of some of them are also untraceable,” said a senior officer, requesting anonymity.Investigators who declined to be named explained that the rewards were in two categories – ₹1 lakh and ₹50,000 – for different suspects even as teams of Delhi Police failed to locate these eight suspects despite multiple raids at locations in Delhi-NCR, Punjab and Haryana. A case was registered after the violence at Red Fort at the Kotwali police station and a special investigation team of the crime branch was handling the probe. Officers said the raids to arrest the suspects are still on.Among those who carry a reward of ₹1 lakh are Jugraj Singh from Punjab’s Tarn Taran, who has been identified as the one who hoisted a farmers’ union flag and a religious flag at Red Fort; Deep Sidhu, Gurjot Singh and Gurjant Singh.Police said that ₹50,000 reward each will be given for information leading to the arrest of four other suspects identified as Jajbir Singh, Buta Singh, Sukhdev Singh, and Iqbal Singh. All the eight men are wanted in the same case registered under sections pertaining to offences such as rioting, attempt to murder, attempt to commit culpable homicide, dacoity and criminal conspiracy, apart from vandalising the historic monument. Two cases were registered in connection with the violence and vandalism at the monument during the rally in which more than 40 police personnel were injured.The announcement of the rewards has been made through separate order issued on Tuesday against each of the eight men by deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Chinmoy Biswal, who has now been transferred to the crime branch and appointed the spokesperson of the city police.Many video clips and photographs showed protesters clashing with the security personnel and hoisting the religious flag on the monument. In the videos, Sidhu was also seen among the protesters.A second police officer associated with the investigation said that of the eight suspects, five belong to Tarn Taran from Punjab and the police have not ruled out the possibility that they “carried out the act of vandalism and violence” at the Red Fort as part of a “pre-planned conspiracy”. The other three suspects are from Haryana’s Karnal (Sukhdev Singh) and Punjab’s Muktsar (Sidhu) and Ludhiana (Iqbal Singh).Investigators said that of the 260 vehicles identified so far, notices have been sent to many of their owners. Also, notices have been sent to nearly 200 people, including farm leaders, who were part of the farmers’ tractor rally. They were asked to record their statement or join the investigation “However, none of them have responded to the notices so far,” the officer added.A total of 44 cases have been registered in connection with the violence at Red Fort and other places in Delhi during the rally and an incident on January 29 when a group of persons, claiming to be locals, entered the protest site at Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police.Police said they have arrested 124 people in connection with the violent incidents that left 510 security personnel injured.On Tuesday, the police said they have seized 14 tractors that were a part of the rally.On January 28, Sidhu denied the charges against him through a Facebook post. “...We all were peaceful and were exercising our democratic rights to protest peacefully, we were under the leadership of our farmer union leaders. We did not damage no property also no personal life was harmed or threaten everything was peaceful nobody disrespected our national flag. Stop portraying this incident in any bad manner or bad light...(sic)”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-announce-cash-rewards-for-info-on-deep-sidhu-7-others-in-red-fort-violence-case-101612376935428.html
03-02-2021||Delhi||Most North MCD staffers to continue strike till all salary dues are cleared||Employees of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, except for sanitation workers and nursing and paramedic staff, have decided to continue their strike, demanding that they be paid salaries that are pending since October. The move comes after unions of nurses, paramedic staff and sanitation workers called off their strike on Saturday, after their salaries dues were cleared by the civic body. All employees of the civic body have been on an indefinite strike since January 7. Representatives of the Confederation of MCD Employees Union, an umbrella body of civic body staffers said teachers, engineers, horticulture department workers, and clerical staff, among others, will continue their strike indefinitely, since they have only been paid for a month. “The civic body cleared the pending salaries of only sanitation workers and nursing and paramedic staff. However, other employees have only been given a month’s salary. Additionally, only a month’s pension has been cleared for retired employees,” said AP Khan, convener, Confederation of MCD Employees Union, adding that the workers would strike work till all their dues are cleared. There are nearly 55,000 employees in the north corporation and the civic body spends around ₹360 crore per month on salary payments. Deepak Sharma, executive member of the confederation and a representative of the teachers’ union, said that nearly 30,000 employees are still on strike -- they are coming to office but not working. He said these employees have been hit the worst, since they have been paid for just a month, despite being enlisted for non-teaching tasks such as Covid survey related duties and ration distribution, among others. There are nearly 9,000 teachers across 714 primary schools of the north corporation. Schools are closed to students, but teachers have to go to schools to register their attendance. Jai Prakash, mayor north civic body, said, “Salaries of all employees are being released one by one. Agitating employees should understand that the municipality is undergoing a financial crunch, but still arrangements are being made to clear pending salaries. Those protesting should call off the strike and return to work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/most-north-mcd-staffers-to-continue-strike-till-all-salary-dues-are-cleared-101612376878277.html

03-02-2021||Noida||Tweets by international celebrities: Farmers welcome support but say it’s our fight||Ghaziabad: Most of the farmers camping at the UP Gate protest site on Wednesday said that they were unaware about the tweets made by American pop singer Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg in their support. However, they said that the tweets by the two internationally renowned personalities would help their cause. Most of the traditional farmers who remain away from the social media said that it is their fight with the government, and they will continue it. “We don’t know who Rihanna is. But If someone is listening to our voices, it means that our protest has caught attention of many people and we thank them for their support. However, it is our own fight, and we will continue to protest peacefully,” said Rajpal Sharma, national general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). The farmers from different states, including UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab, are camping at the site since November 28 to press for their demands for repeal of the Centre’s three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. On Tuesday, Rihanna shared a news article on the farmers’ protest and tweeted, “Why aren’t we talking about this?” Similarly, activist Greta Thunberg too extended her support and wrote, “We stand in solidarity with the #farmersprotest in India.” Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of UP Gate farmers’ committee, was busy looking after the dais and activities after BKU leader Rakesh Tikait left for a Mahapanchayat at Jind in Haryana. “We still have internet connectivity issues here and not been able to send our videos and pictures. If international personalities tweet messages, it means that people understand our situation. It also means that the government should leave its hard stance now and support farmers’ demand. This is why people are tweeting and even holding panchayats across many cities. Our movement is gaining popularity,” Bajwa said. Some of the net savvy youngsters like 19-year-old Arshdeep Singh, a native of Kichha in Uttarakhand, were of opinion that the tweets by international celebrities will have no effect. “It is our own fight. We are sticking to it and not going home till the farm laws are taken back. There have been voices raised for the farmers’ movement in the past, but the government did not budge. I feel that the tweets by the two celebrities will have no impact. But we are motivated that people outside the country are raising our issues,” he said. The social media was abuzz with claims and counterclaims over the tweets of the celebrities as Rihanna has about 101 million followers while Thunberg has about 4.7 million followers. “I thank Rihanna for her comments... The farmers’ agitation had already been internationalised since the onset. International celebrities are very sensitive about different issues, including social issues. I would urge celebrities of our country as well to come out and support cause of farmers,” Dr Udit Raj, national chairman of All India Confederation of SC/ST Organizations, said at the UP Gate. Amid the claims and counterclaims, the ministry of external affairs was also quick to react. Its official spokesperson, Anurag Srivastava, issued a statement with two hashtags, #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda. “Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken. The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “A very small section of farmers in parts of India have some reservations about these reforms. Respecting the sentiments of the protestors, the Government of India has initiated a series of talks with their representatives. Union Ministers have been part of the negotiations and eleven rounds of talks have already been held. The government has even offered to keep the laws on hold, an offer iterated by no less than the Prime Minister of India,” the statement further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/tweets-by-international-celebrities-farmers-welcome-support-but-say-it-s-our-fight-101612376876549.html
03-02-2021||Noida||Pedestrians worst hit by heavy barricading at Delhi-UP border||Ghaziabad: Thirty two-year-old Poonam Chaudhary on Wednesday was seen making swift passage through a small jungle area adjacent to the farmers’ protest site at UP Gate. Chaudhary said that she works at a hospital in Ghaziabad’s Vaishali and wanted to go back home before it turns dark. Like her, many other pedestrians made their way through the small area after the Delhi Police put up large barricades and barbed wires in the past two days. The wires have also been extended through the jungle area while heavy fortifications have already come up on adjacent roads and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway after the incidents of violence on the Republic Day in Delhi during the tractor march by the protesting farmers. “I wish to go home as quickly as possible as this area is isolated, and I need to go to my house which is about 8km away. There is no means of transport here and we have been passing through this stretch for the past two months as the expressway remains blocked due to farmers’ protest. It is a fight between the government and the farmers, but people like us are the sufferers,” said Chaudhary, who also has to attend night shifts in the hospital. Like her, many other pedestrians cross the barbed wires as local made a small passage through by pressing the wires with the help of bricks and stones. “This is not all. We also have to further cross a trench which is freshly dug up to keep protesters away. This is about 10 feet and if anyone falls in, they will end up with broken bones. We don’t know when this will end,” said Shanta Devi, a colleague of Chaudhary, who is from nearby Ghazipur. The farmers are camping at the UP Gate protest site since November 28 last year, and have occupied the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the expressway since December 3. After the violence on the Republic Day, the Delhi Police has heavily barricaded the entire UP Gate area with hardly any space left even for pedestrians. The Delhi Police commissioner, SN Shrivastava, on Tuesday had said, “I am surprised when tractors were used on January 26 and police were attacked and barricading was broken, no one raised questions. What we did? We have just strengthened the barricades so that they should not be broken time and again.” Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of UP Gate farmers’ committee, said that situation at the border is like an “undeclared emergency.” “There is heavy barricading at the border and even sharp iron nails have been fixed. It is suspected that it is a ploy to turn locals against us. The situation is sort of undeclared emergency. On our part, we have no plans to go to Delhi,” Bajwa said. “We have our volunteers who regularly check and try to spot anti-social and unruly elements,” he added. As a result of blockade of the expressway, majority of commuters are getting diverted to the Kaushambi border near Anand Vihar from where they can enter East Delhi. However, the woes of commuters as well as pedestrians are not likely to end soon. The protesting farmers have already given a call for “Chakka jam” on February 6. Farmer leaders on Monday announced a nationwide ‘chakka jam’ for three hours. They said that it is a call for blockade of state and national highways to protest against the suspension of internet and heavy barricading at agitation sites and also to push their demands for repeal of new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pedestrians-worst-hit-by-heavy-barricading-at-delhi-up-border-101612376877242.html

A case was registered at Noida’s Cyber police station on Wednesday. The complainant, Sarfaraz Nawaz Saifi, who runs an AC repair shop, is a resident of Masoori in Ghaziabad. In the complaint, he said that on January 17 last year, he received a friend request from a woman named Satlora Pace. “I accepted her request without suspecting a foul play. Pace introduced herself as an officer in US Army presently posted in Afghanistan,” he said. The two persons started talking to each other using messenger app and through emails, police said. Saifi said that one day Pace informed that she had a bag having US $1.5 million and she can’t carry all the money to the US due to legal complications. “Pace said that if she carried the money to the US, the customs department will quiz her and she may lose her job. She said that she would send the money to me,” he said. Pace had shared a bank account number and asked Saifi to pay ₹77,000 as customs clearance fee. “I believed the woman and made the payment. Soon, I received a call from another woman Mona Singh, who identified herself as a customs officer and asked me to deposit ₹1.98 lakh in a bank account to clear the parcel,” he said. The victim discussed the issue with Pace and finally made this payment too, the police said. The complainant said that he then got another call from a person named Krish William, who also identified himself as a customs official, and asked him to get a tax clearance certificate by paying ₹4.95 lakh. Saifi said that he again paid the money. However, the gang members continued calling him and demanding money for different clearances. The complainant said that he lost ₹29.97 lakh in this online fraud to the gang. Recently, Saifi filed a complaint at a local police station, which forwarded it to Noida’s Cyber police station, as it specialises in the investigation of cyber crimes. Triveni Singh, superintendent of police (cyber crime), said that a case has been registered against three suspects under sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of IPC and Section 66 of IT Act. “We are investigating the case. The suspects would be arrested soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-loses-30-lakh-to-web-acquaintance-in-customs-clearance-scam-101612376575368.html

03-02-2021||Noida||Air quality improves, yet remains in very poor category in Noida, Ghaziabad||Noida: Air quality in Noida and Ghaziabad improved on Wednesday with better ventilation, and pollution monitoring agencies expect further improvement in the next two days. However, it remained within the “very poor” category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB’s) air quality index (AQI).According to the weather department, stronger and warmer easterly and south-easterly winds on Wednesday led to better dispersion of the pollutants. The pattern is expected to remain the same on Thursday. Added to this is a western disturbance in the northern states.A western disturbance is a storm originating from the Mediterranean Sea which brings sudden winter rain to the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent. This, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is likely to bring about rain on Thursday evening.“Due to the western disturbance in Himalayan states, the wind direction in the national capital region (NCR) change from the cold north-westerly to warmer easterly and south-easterly. The wind speed on Wednesday was also good around 18 kmph during afternoon hours that lead to quick dispersion of the particles. The wind speed will remain good for next two days as well,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre,IMD.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on a scale of 0 to 500, on Wednesday was 339 against 372 a day earlier. Greater Noida’s AQI was against 345 against 379 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 388 against 394 on Thursday. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The three cities – Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad - have been suffering either ‘very-poor’ or ‘severe’ levels of air quality since January 13, while the best air quality last realised was under ‘moderate’ category on January 4. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the surface winds will be supportive of further dispersion of the particle pollutants till February 6. “Surface winds have improved as forecasted and is east and north-easterly in direction. Under the approaching western disturbance isolated rain is expected tomorrow. The improved ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively for the next three days. AQI is likely to improve to the lower end of the Very Poor to Poor category for the next two days. AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate but in the lower end of the Very Poor category on 6th February,” said the SAFAR statement on Wednesday.According to the weather analyst, certain regions of NCR, including Noida may see light rains to drizzling (too low to measure) towards Thursday afternoon and evening, the temperatures will remain well above the season’s average. The current active western disturbance will have its effect till February 5.“The minimum temperature will be higher than the season’s average which currently is around 9 to 10 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature will drop however from February 6 onwards but there will not be any cold wave and the maximum drop in the mercury will be within season’s average,” said IMD’s Srivastava. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature of Noida soared by 4 degrees Celsius. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 12.1 degrees Celsius, against 8.4 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature for Noida was recorded at 25.2 degrees Celsius against 27.2 degrees a day earlier. For NCR, the average minimum and maximum temperature based on Safdarjung observatory was 10.4 degrees Celsius – two degrees above the season’s average, and 26.1 degrees Celsius, four degrees Celsius above the season’s average respectively. The minimum and maximum on Thursday is expected to hover around 11 and 24 degrees Celsius respectively||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-improves-yet-remains-in-very-poor-category-in-noida-ghaziabad-101612375735813.html

A probe in the case is underway,” said Kumar.Yadav’s body was sent for an autopsy, the police said, adding that the autopsy report would confirm the cause of death.The police said that the it can be a case of an accident because the spot where the body was found was below a staircase which did not have any railing. However, all angles are being probed, said the police.“The family has not filed any complaint yet. A case will be registered as soon as they do file a complaint,” said SHO.Yadav’s body was handed over to the family following the autopsy, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-man-found-injured-outside-friend-s-house-succumbs-probe-on-101612375735176.html

Enforcement officials said that three earthmoving machines were deployed and they were supported by over 100 police personnel. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that 25 under-construction houses in various stages, 15 shops and 150 plinths were demolished in Sneh Vihar, Defence Colony and two more colonies being developed on Damdama Road. “Several complaints in this regard were received by the department and consequently, action was taken. Illegal constructions would not be allowed,” he said. The drive started around 12.30pm and continued till late evening, said officials. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement, said that their team reached Sneh Vihar first and despite the presence of a large crowd, they managed to carry out the work. “The demolitions carried out in Defence Enclave were the maximum, as several shops and houses were getting constructed there,” he said.

03-02-2021||Gurugram||Vaccination of Gurugram’s front-line workers to start||The district health department will start the second phase of Covid-19 vaccinations with the inoculation of front-line workers — Gurugram police personnel, employees of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), and revenue department staff — on Thursday. At least 1,100 front-line workers are likely to be covered on the first day, including at least 500 sanitation staff from the MCG, 500 police personnel deployed at borders and at least 100 revenue department staffers who have been involved in the Covid-19 management. Health officials said that only Covishield will be given on Thursday to the front-line workers and those above the age of 50 have been given priority in the lists. The vaccination of front-line staff will take place alongside the ongoing vaccination of healthcare workers, at public and private health facilities. The health department has already given vaccine jabs to almost 23,000 healthcare workers in the district. On Thursday, almost 650 health staff have to be covered at 31 session sites. On Wednesday, 627 of the 700 targeted healthcare workers turned up to receive their jabs at 21 sites. Officials said the inoculation of healthcare workers has already reached a saturation point in the district. Therefore, to retain the pace of vaccination, ensuring minimal vaccine wastage, the health department will begin the inoculation of almost 18,000 registered front-line staff. “Vaccination of front-line and healthcare workers will continue simultaneously at 44 identified locations. For front-line workers, office buildings or community centres near their workplace have been chosen to ensure the staff can reach the vaccination site anytime from 9am to 5pm,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. For Gurugram police, session sites have been set up at five spots — the police commissionerate, DCP traffic tower, police lines, police stations at Sohna and Manesar. To facilitate vaccination of MCG workers, five sites have been set up at the MCG’s Sector 34 office, community centres in Sector 27 and Sector 10A, Islampur and Sukhrali. For the employees of revenue department, inoculation will be held at the Mini Secretariat building. “The vaccination sites have been set up based on the facilities suggested by the respective departments,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “The staff can walk in easily at specific vaccination sites allocated to the particular department. Police personnel can walk in at any of the five sites. An MCG worker can do the same. Each of these sites has been provided with the complete list of registered vaccine beneficiaries,” said Singh.According to him, the three departments have been told to circulate messages regarding the inoculation. “Besides messages regarding vaccination being circulated through Co-WIN, the respective departments have been told to inform their employees about vaccination through their WhatsApp groups or text messages,” said Singh.Dr Ashish Singh, chief medical officer, MCG, said that messages have been circulated through sanitation inspectors and supervisors at the MCG level. “Over 6,600 sanitation workers, firefighters and cremation staff, among others, have been registered. They have been encouraged to come forward for the vaccination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccination-of-gurugram-s-front-line-workers-to-start-101612374476857.html
03-02-2021||Gurugram||Farmers to block highways, take over tolls||Farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur near Jaisinghpur Khera at the Haryana-Rajasthan border said that they would hold a “chakka jam” (blockades) across both the states on February 6, on the call given by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha. Farmers from Rajasthan also plan to make toll plazas free in the state, on the lines of Haryana and Punjab, from February 6. Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September last year. They say they fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Sharing plans about the chakka jam, Naveen Sohlot, a farmer from Bawal, said that the National Highway-48 (NH-48) will be blocked along with other roads that are currently being used for traffic movement. “Our plan is to hold the chakka jam on NH-48. Currently, we have kept a service road open for movement of ambulances and other emergency vehicles. Traffic is also moving in the area through local roads. We will be closing off the local roads for three hours on February 6. There will be no traffic movement during the chakka jam,” said Sohlot. Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that chakka jams will take place across villages and towns. “We are reaching out to people in different villages. The blockade will take place at multiple levels. Khaps are organising meetings in different places and coming out to support,” said Madhav. Ranjit Singh Raju, the coordinator of Rajasthan’s Grameen Kisan Mazdoor Samiti — one of the farmers’ bodies under the Samyukta Kisan Morcha — said that blockades will take place for a duration of three hours on February 6. “Chakka jam will take place on both national highways and state highways. Following the chakka jam, people will take over tolls in Rajasthan, like Haryana and Punjab,” said Raju. He said that nearly a month ago, farmers had stopped toll collection at various places — Hanumangarh, Ganganagar and Bikaner in Rajasthan. “We are calling on the residents of Rajasthan to recognise their strength and stop toll collection. They should make the government understand the power of common people,” said Raju. He said that support for the farmers’ agitation was pouring in from states beyond Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, and that people are holding meetings to strengthen the movement. “Haryana has been taking part in the agitation since the beginning. Now, we are getting massive support from Uttar Pradesh as well. The chakka jam and all other future activities will compel the government to pay heed to farmers,” said Raju.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-to-block-highways-take-over-tolls-101612374476311.html
03-02-2021||Gurugram||NHAI imposes ₹3-cr penalty on Sohna road contractor for mishap last year||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) imposed a ₹3-crore penalty on the contractor responsible for building the Sohna road elevated project, a section of which crashed near Vipul Green condominium on August 22 last year.The authority withdrew its decision to debar the contractor -- Oriental Infrastructure Ltd -- from participating in future projects after it agreed to pay the penalty and to follow other recommendations, including improving its standard operating procedures (SOPs). The order was passed on January 27 but made public on Wednesday.NHAI project director (Gurugram) Shashi Bhushan confirmed the penalty but did not comment on the decision to revoke the debarment.Another senior NHAI official privy to the matter, however, said that the contractor had submitted that the decision to debar it was too harsh and requested it be withdrawn.“The authority considered its submission in light of the report of the expert committee (that looked into the incident) and decided to withdraw its decision,” said the NHAI official. “The onus of rectification, however, was imposed on the contractor at its own cost.”A senior official from Oriental Structures Pvt Ltd, not authorised to speak to the media, said, “We have taken all corrective measures and included more safety measures to prevent such incidents in future. The SOP has also been revised. We have also paid the penalty.”The 21.66 km-long Sohna road project has two parts — an underpass and an elevated road from Subash Chowk to a point beyond Badshahpur. The second part comprises the expansion of the 12.72-km road from Badshahpur to Sohna and will involve the construction of flyovers and underpasses at major crossings to ensure smooth movement of vehicles on the entire stretch.On August 22, 2020, a concrete span between pillars 10 and 11 crashed and work was suspended. No one was injured in the incident.An expert committee formed by the NHAI looked into the incident and submitted its recommendations. In the first week of last September, the company was debarred from participating in NHAI project bids.On Tuesday, the NHAI said that in order to deal with the lapses in highway development, it has issued a strict policy to decide penal action against defaulting firms and personnel .It said that a graded penal action will be taken against the defaulters in cases of minor lapses, major incidents and major failures resulting in loss of human lives. In case of a major lapse leading to loss of human life, fine up to ₹10 crore and debarment of the firm/personnel up to three years along with rectification by the defaulting contractors, concessionaires on their own cost may be imposed.For major lapses where no casualties are reported, rectification by the defaulting contractors, concessionaires on their own cost and /or debarment of firm up to one year with penalty up to ₹5 crore along with debarment of concerned personnel for up to two years from NHAI projects has been provisioned. The authority has made a detailed list for such actions for major and minor lapses, said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nhai-imposes-3-cr-penalty-on-sohna-road-contractor-for-mishap-last-year-101612374475685.html
03-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG develops app to track toilet facilities in city||After receiving a large number of complaints from residents regarding the state of toilets in the city, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has developed an app for its staff to monitor the facilities. Officials, especially those with the sanitation wing, have been tasked with covering the city’s 122 toilets and inspect each for cleanliness, water and electricity connection, working taps, switches, and availability of toiletries. Subsequently, they will have to upload photos in the app for verification. “People have been lodging complaints with the MCG that the toilets are not clean, locked, or do not have running water or electricity connection. To overcome this, we hence decided to develop a QR-code based internal app where it would be mandatory for sanitary inspectors or assistant sanitary inspectors to upload photos of clean and working public toilets,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), MCG.Kumar said that the objective behind uploading photos of “clean and functioning” toilets is to maintain some level of supervision and ensure that the sanitation inspector or assistant sanitation inspector are getting the toilets cleaned and ensuring that all provisions are present inside the facility regularly. The app developed last week, however, does not have a name.The condition of toilets has been a major concern, especially, over the past three years. In July 2018, the only time a survey of public toilets was carried out, MCG officials had found that 60 of the 99 public toilets in the city did not have continuous water and electricity supply due to which the facilities were of little use to the public. In May 2018, during a surprise inspection, the then MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav had also found many public toilets across the city to be locked, prompting MCG to terminate and penalise several of their contractors.There are 122 MCG toilets in the city, of which 111 are public toilets and 11 are community toilets.The public toilets are open from 6 am-10 pm while the community toilets are open 24x7. Besides the app, Dr Harbhajan Singh, SBM team member, MCG, said that the civic body has also linked itself to two government apps, the SBM toilet locator and Swachh Haryana app.“Toilets of only those cities that have been certified ODF++ by the central government are included in the SBM toilet locator app. From the app, residents can navigate their way to the closest public toilet. Further, the MCG has also linked itself with the Swachh Haryana App, where a dedicated section for public toilets is available. In this section, residents can lodge complaints such as unclean toilets, toilets operating without any water supply or electricity connection, or toilets in need of repair,” said Singh.ODF (open defecation free) ++ certifies that a city is free of open defecation and that all sewage in the city is properly managed and treated, without it being discharged in stormwater drains, water bodies or vacant plots.Gurugram was certified as ODF++ in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-develops-app-to-track-toilet-facilities-in-city-101612374475096.html
03-02-2021||Gurugram||One killed, three critical in accident near Bilaspur crossing on NH-48||A 36-year-old woman was killed while three others, including two children, were critically injured after a speeding canter hit the car they were travelling in near the Bilaspur crossing on Tuesday morning. The police said that the driver of the Hyundai i10 lost control of the vehicle due to the impact, following which it collided a stationary truck on the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway. A family of four was on its way to Jodhpur in Rajasthan, to visit the man’s parents, when the accident took place, around 8.30am. The police said that the spot where the collision took place is among the most dangerous spots in the city, from where 11 such incidents, including three fatal ones, were reported last month. Shesh Kumar Dixit, the woman’s father-in-law, said that an unidentified person called him from his son’s phone and informed him of the accident. He also claimed that the caller told him that passersby were stealing from the injured. “I asked him for details but he was in a hurry, as he was shifting my family members into an ambulance. He asked me to rush to Gurugram and said that some passersby had stolen cash and valuables from the car and my daughter-in-law,” said Dixit, who lives in Jodhpur.The four of them were taken to a private hospital in the vicinity, where doctors declared the woman brought dead. The man and the two children were shifted to a private hospital in Sector 38. The injured are undergoing treatment and are in the intensive care unit of the hospital, the police said on Tuesday evening.The woman has been identified as Nidhi Dixit (36). Her husband, Sharad Dixit (37), works as a manager with a five-star hotel in Sohna, who, along with their children — seven-year-old Aarav and five-year-old Anika — is set to be operated on, Dixit said. Naveen Kumar, the station house officer of Bilaspur police station, said that they received a call from a passerby after which a team and PCR vehicle deployed at the crossing was sent to the spot. “The canter had left from the spot and we could not identify it as there are no CCTV cameras at the spot. Eyewitnesses, in their statement, said a speeding canter had hit the car from behind,” he said. Kumar said he was not aware of the theft as the complaint did not mention anything in this regard, but he would investigate if the family was robbed. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death by negligence) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the unidentified driver, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/one-killed-three-critical-in-accident-near-bilaspur-crossing-on-nh48-101612374417458.html
03-02-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram records warmest day of the year||The city experienced its warmest day of the year on Wednesday, with the minimum temperature rising to 13 degrees Celsius, up from 9.4 degrees Celsius on the previous day, while the maximum temperature increased marginally to 24.5 degrees — four notches above normal. Warmer conditions are likely to persist till at least February 5, along with thunderstorms and rain. As per official forecasts, there is a 75% probability of 3 to 5 mm rainfall on Thursday. Experts explained that Wednesday’s uptick in mercury was under the influence of easterly winds that are currently sweeping through Delhi-NCR. “There is a fluctuation in the wind direction which typically happens a few days before the passage of a western disturbance. Easterly winds are not as cold as westerly winds, and they have had a warming effect. It will remain warm for two to three days. Formation of rain clouds over Delhi-NCR will also trap heat,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Delhi.Chilly conditions are likely to set in once again from February 6, when the minimum temperature is expected to remain between 8 and 9 degrees Celsius, due to residual moisture in the atmosphere after rain. “This will also result in foggy mornings, which have been the norm in north India over the past couple of months. Shallow to moderate haze, fog and mist will continue for another week, but afternoons will be clearer,” Srivastava said. The maximum temperature is expected to dip to about 21 degrees Celsius over the next two days, but will start rising rapidly after the weather system has passed. The IMD’s seven-day forecast for Gurugram predicts a maximum temperature of 26 degrees Celsius on February 9. However, officials clarified that cold wave conditions — which occur when the minimum temperature falls to 4 degrees Celsius or below — are highly unlikely. “We are past that point of the winter. Cold wave conditions are not going to come back, as they started abating in late January,” Srivastava said.Air quality in the city improved slightly on Wednesday but remained in the very poor category, with an air quality index (AQI) of 304, down from 324 on Tuesday. Further improvement is expected under the influence of rain and fluctuating winds, which are expected to touch speeds of 12 to 16kmph. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to improve further and crossover from lower end of very poor to poor category on 04.02.2021. The air quality is likely to remain in poor to moderate category on 05.02.2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-records-warmest-day-of-the-year-101612374416883.html
03-02-2021||Gurugram||Bilaspur Chowk remains an unresolved black spot||Each time an accident was reported at the Bilaspur crossing in January, local agencies responded with an intervention in an attempt to make the stretch safer. However, a month and six deaths later, the situation is yet to change.The police, regional transport authority (RTA) and the erstwhile Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ) — a state government programme on road safety — have repeatedly identified Bilaspur crossing as a black spot. Teams from the police and RTA visit the accident spots after each fatality to prepare a spot report and to document the reason for the accident. The police said they had first identified the crossing as a black spot six years ago. Accidents are still regularly reported from this spot due to speeding and absence of a pedestrian bridge, due to which people are forced to walk on the main carriageway. A road stretch is termed as a black spot if more than five fatalities are recorded in a 500-metre stretch over a three-year period.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that they have been asked by the deputy commissioner to submit recommendations and action report on steps taken to reduce accidents. “We have found several reasons for accidents on this stretch and the same has been submitted to the district administration and RTA recently. We can control the traffic movement but cannot make engineering changes or construct the pedestrian bridge. The lack of a pedestrian crossing is leading to accidents as movement of heavy vehicles is high on the stretch due to it being an industrial area,” he said. Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner, said they are examining all black spots again and will try to rectify the problem in a specific time. “Before that, we will hold a meeting with all stakeholders of road safety to see how to reduce road fatalities in minimum time,” he said. Rao said they have asked those running eateries to ensure that vehicles are not parked on the expressway and to allot parking spaces for truckers, failing which they would face action. However, the police also admitted that rash driving remains a major concern. On the other hand, RTA officials said they have flagged the concern to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Public Works Department (PWD), which are responsible for maintaining the stretch, but no action has been taken yet. They are also analysing the data to pinpoint reasons for the accidents and suggest solutions. Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, said that they are aware of accidents happening at the spot and have discussed the issue in monthly road safety meetings. “Our teams are coordinating with NHAI and PWD and have raised engineering issues. This time, we will ask for a deadline from the authority concerned and will ensure the engineering issues are resolved,” she said. HVZ had stated in a report that stretches at Bilaspur Chowk are not properly fenced, due to which pedestrians as well as two-wheelers continue to cross the highway at any point.Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert and a member of HVZ, which stopped functioning last year, said, “NHAI, the road owning agency, is well aware of the road safety hazard at this location. However, nothing has been done to improve the safety of this high-risk location and we continue to observe loss of lives at this spot. All these deaths are preventable, provided we act right.”HVZ had recommended road markings along with signages, stronger enforcement and long-term measures, such as intersection redesign, along with proper pedestrian and cycle crossings, to reduce the fatalities. The volume of traffic is high on the stretch as several factories are located on both sides of the expressway. Ishan Gogoi, programme coordinator, Raahgiri Foundation, who has conducted audits of the spot in the past, said that Bilaspur Chowk remains an unresolved blackspot due to its mixed traffic use, ranging from heavily loaded trucks transporting goods from one city to another, to public and private vehicles, and pedestrians. “The accident victims have mostly been pedestrians and cyclists, due to lack of proper pedestrian crossings and traffic calming measures, which are extremely necessary at intersections such as these. Also, with Bilaspur being a hinterland for Gurugram city, it isn’t paid much attention to infrastructure-wise,” he said. Daily commuters on the stretch said the authorities should install speeding metres and deploy police to monitor the traffic movement. “Arrangements, such as marking crossings with paint, should be made so that pedestrians can cross the junction without much difficulty. There is no pedestrian amenity here and we have to cross the main highway amid traffic, leading to mishaps,” said Ram Kumar, the floor manager of an automobile company located in the vicinity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bilaspur-chowk-remains-an-unresolved-black-spot-101612374415721.html
03-02-2021||Gurugram||Local cable operator booked for damaging Airtel fibre network||The police on Tuesday registered a case against a local cable operator for allegedly stealing fibre-optic cables of telecom company Bharti Airtel and damaging its broadband infrastructure in the city. Officials of Bharti Airtel, the complainant, alleged that a local cable operator in New Colony area of Old Gurugram is harassing their staff and damaging their infrastructure, inconveniencing customers. The New Colony police have registered an FIR under Section 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code.The company officials, in their complaint, alleged that they had started providing broadband services to Sector 7 since last March, following which the local cable operator had allegedly been threatening their staff and damaging the infrastructure. They said that complaints were filed last March and April, over a similar incident, wherein the underground fibre network was allegedly snapped at several points and their staff abused. OP Galhotra, group director (security), Bharti Airtel, said, “We have shared all details with the authorities including CCTV footage and hope that these perpetrators will be brought to task. Sabotaging reliable internet connectivity at a time when it is most needed by customers in times of Covid-19 is most condemnable and also impacts the ease of doing business.” KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that they have received several complaints from the company in the last few months. Due to lack of evidence, no case was registered. “In the recent case, residents have recorded videos where some people are seen damaging and stealing cables from different spots. People are more dependent on internet connectivity as they are operating from home and children have online classes. The cable operator was intentionally damaging the cables as he had suffered losses due to the connections provided by the company,” he said. Residents said that the local cable operator had a monopoly till last March. “When Bharti Airtel laid cables, we immediately applied for the connection,” said Ravi Mahajan, a resident of New Colony, adding that the cable operator has threatened many residents of dire consequences as they have collected evidence against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/local-cable-operator-booked-for-damaging-airtel-fibre-network-101612374416310.html
03-02-2021||Gurugram||District administration initiates a new road safety programme||Similar to the concept of Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ), city road safety experts, along with the district administration, have initiated a road safety programme specifically for Gurugram district known as Safer Streets for Gurugram (SSFG).As a part of the programme, road safety experts would survey all stretches across the city to identify black spots, accident-prone stretches, reasons behind collisions, types of collisions, and, accordingly, suggest engineering or infrastructural changes to concerned public authorities for implementation during district road safety meetings.HVZ, a collective for road safety experts commissioned by the government and funded by private partners, had seized operations in July last year due to lack of funding. Since then, there has been no road safety programme in Gurugram.“Our operation will be similar to HVZ, except for the fact that it will be carried out at the city level rather than at the level of the state. Micro operations will help us in allocating our resources better and ensure that they are executed swiftly on ground. We have set a target of carrying out engineering changes in at least 10 intersections or junctions across the city annually,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, road safety expert, SSFG.Bhatt further said that the operations for auditing all stretches across Gurugram have commenced, following which a detailed data report would be submitted to the district administration, along with the details of those points from where the highest number of road fatalities are being reported.“In the audit, we will analyse all the FIRs registered across the city over the past three years, where fatal accidents have taken place. Through studying the data, we will identify stretches where the most number of accidents have taken place. Next, we shall undertake on-site visits to determine the reasons behind the road crashes,” said Bhatt.For example, an analysis of the three-year FIR data between 2016 and 2019 revealed that the Khandsa Chowk had the highest number of road fatalities anywhere in the city, during this time period. Upon site visits and auditing the stretch, it was identified that lack of pedestrian fatalities at the junction on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway was the main cause behind road fatalities. Subsequently, on recommendation, a foot-over-bridge (FOB) was built at the junction.Bhatt further said that the only addition or difference in operations between HVZ and SSFG is that in the latter, focus on making intersections or junctions safer for the crossing of pedestrians and cyclists through engineering changes would also be prioritised.Bhatt added that SSFG has started working with Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority GMDA) for redesigning four key crossings — Sector 44 intersection, Bristol Chowk, Kanhai Chowk, and Ambedkar Chowk.As per HVZ data, the total number of road fatalities in Gurugram was 484 in 2017, 469 in 2018, and 401 in 2019 Last year, 375 fatalities were reported from Gurugram roads, as per Gurugram police data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/district-administration-initiates-a-new-road-safety-programme-101612374415170.html

03-02-2021||Delhi||Road Safety Month: One for the road, and safety of denizens||Don’t be surprised if you are in the Millennium City and spot someone dressed as a panda, holding a placard that reads: Follow Traffic Rules. Isn’t this a cool way to educate one about road safety? As part of 32nd National Road Safety Month (January 18 to February 17) this panda is stationed at Gurugram. Several volunteers are also stationed at various spots, to spread the message of road safety rules. They hold placards with messages such as ‘Don’t Drink and Drive’. In the Capital, Delhi Police is observing Road Safety Month on the theme of Sadak Suraksha – Jivan Raksha. In association with Indian Head Injury Foundation, they recently distributed helmets to two-wheeler riders. Mandeep Randhawa, Additional CP (Road Safety), Delhi Police, says, “There are 119 accident prone zones in Delhi. During the month, awareness programmes are being organised at all accident-prone zones to spread the message of road safety and importance of traffic rules. Virtual sessions for awareness of school children are also being conducted. Apart from this, an online seminar on road safety was also conducted by students; they performed various activities such as plays, poems etc.”Several such programmes are being organised to sensitise the public. “Past few decades, we’ve been trying to educate people on road safety rules. But it’s not creating the right impact. And, we see the road traffic fatalities increasing every year in India,” says Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder, Raahgiri Foundation, adding, “Though police challans defaulters the whole year, during this month, they are doing it more aggressively. We pick three intersections every week and follow zero tolerance on speed, red light jumping and wrong side.” In another fun activity, denizens recently witnessed a fun flash mob in Gurugram’s Galleria Market, organised by Teens of Gods, to highlight road rules.

03-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi-NCR groups resume hiking, cycling, in the new normal||The pandemic, made everyone miss working out outdoors, and cycling, walking, running in groups. But as soon as phases of Unlock began, groups were formed to exercise together albeit with safety precautions; and those groups that existed even in the pre-pandemic times, became more active. Some of the groups in Delhi-NCR share how they are working out in smaller groups with precautions in the new normal. Treasure hunt in forestsHiking every Sunday to Aravalli forests is a group, Moon Walkers of Gurgaon, which sprouted during the pandemic. “The group was formed by a few hardcore walking enthusiasts, to be away from city’s hustle bustle and to indulge in some forest bathing. We’ve explored some beautiful trails in the forests of Bhondsi, Rithoj, Damdama, Mangar, Sehjawas, Khor, Panikot, and Asola Bhatti,” says Prabhat Verma, founder of the group. Long hikes every alternate weekCycling Musketeers is another Gurugram-based group that mushroomed during the lockdown. Sarika Panda Bhatt, one of the group members, says, “We generally have bigger group walks and rides on weekends for about 50km. On weekdays, three-four of us either walk or cycle in and around the city; sometimes we do about 25-30km, or a 5km run at Aravallis. But we try to cycle at least three days a week and go for a long hike every alternate week.” No hugs or handshakes!Rajiva Lochan Singh, founder of Noida-based Joggers and Walkers Club, says, “The most important learning for us in the pandemic has been to better our immune system, which needs exercising. But the main problem is social distancing! We took to cycling in the unlock days wearing masks, and gradually returned to walking and running. Now four-five of us ride three times a week. On Sundays we opt for long-distance rides, and rest of the days we do mid segment rides, for 30 to 40kms. We’ve still not resumed group runs, and as soon we come back home, we sanitise our shoes, wash hands, and put clothes for washing in one corner. Missing how we could earlier hug or shake hands!” Kms after many monthsThe group Noida Expressway Walker had stopped group walks in the third week of March last year. Pradeep Panda, founder of the group, says, “In September 2020 we restarted walks maintaining social distancing. Many members have joined back now as they know the importance of group walking. A 10km walk is common for most. Occasionally we do 15km, 18km and 21km walks. Due to fog, we shifted our walks to afternoon two months back, and encourage all age categories to adopt walking as their regular fitness activity. We hope to motivate others to restart walking.” Author tweets @NainaArora8Follow more on Facebookand Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhincr-groups-resume-hiking-cycling-in-the-new-normal-101612356833467.html

During the 2020 lockdown, most denizens turned home chefs. And some, like Arora aunty, used the time to start their second inningings! Gurugrammer Anita Arora, an ex lecturer in the Haryana Education Services, is one such inspirational example who revived her passion for cooking, and turned it into a business venture. That too at a time when the pandemic confined most of us indoors, feeling dejected. But, this 68-year-old didn’t let the virus douse her spirits, and recently went viral on social media. “For me, cooking was always a passion,” she says, adding, “My father used to cook, too! Gajar Ka Halwa, Urad Dal Pinni, Moong Daal Pinni... thodi thodi cheeze bana liya karti thi sath mein. Aajkal bachhe bahar rehte hain, toh thoda time nahin hota unke paas. They then eat fast food and not nutritious food. Savere savere cornflakes doodh liya aur chal diye kaam pe. But have a Pinni, which is not just healthy but also filling. Itna ki dhoodh ke sath ek khane ke baad dopahar tak bhook na lage!” Since she became an inspiration for many, through social media, her efforts to provide home cooked and healthy Indian food options have been in much demand. She is happy to receive the love and adulation coming her way, but says, “I’m not looking to expand my venture to a large scale enterprise. My kids had motivated me to start this. They said ‘Aap ghar mein rehte ho akele saara din, toh kuch nah kuch busy rakhne ke liye karo...’ And I started making pinnis that they took to their office, and then asked me to make some more. Soon orders started coming in. Jaise hi order aata hai, I start preparing. It takes me one hour to roast atta or any other material. Uske baad garama garam mein hi banani bhi hoti hai... One lady asked me to make Bhunne Channe ki Pinni, that was new to me as well, but I loved to try my hand at it.” She asserts that she’s able to make only 5 kgs of pinnis every day. “I’m not able to do more because of my age. But the regard and love that people have showered on me, woh bahut acha lagta hai mujhe,” she concludes.Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-68-year-old-begins-second-innings-during-covid-19-pandemic-101612355756144.html
03-02-2021||Noida||Can’t deliver your food, it got snatched: Is this for real?||In a screengrab that recently went viral, the text reads: ‘Sorry that we couldn’t deliver your order as the order was snatched by some others’. This message, by a food delivery app to a customer, stated a bizarre incident where some unknown miscreants allegedly snatched the food order from a delivery boy in Noida. And as soon as this incident was shared on social media, by a Twitter user Chayanika Das, it invited a host of hilarious comments such as: ‘Just another day in Noida’, ‘Gurugram mein aisa hua hai mere saath’, etc. Das, who had reportedly placed an order with the food delivery app for the first time in a Noida-based location, had to face a cancellation due to the alleged snatching. But, her sharing of the incident has led to many denizens across Delhi-NCR voice their ever-so-memorable and hysterical food ordering experiences! ‘Tyre puncture ho gaya hai’Vishesh Pahwa, a Gurugram-based corporate, recalls, “Delivery guy pauna ghanta ghumata raha saying ‘Tyre puncture ho gaya hai mera. Jahan woh bol raha tha ki tyre puncture hua hain, app pe it should have shown that the bike has stopped on the way from the restaurant to my home. But the bike kept moving in the opposite direction. It was annoying at that time, but now when I look back, I find it hilarious. And later, when I complained on the app chat, I got a call citing not one but too many reasons! I did get a refund, but the incident spoilt my dinner that day.” Replacement dish took a day to get delivered“In one incident, the rider refused to enter my society saying that I need to be the gate to collect the order as it’s Covid time. I kept wondering how entering the society will get him Covid as long as we are maintaining safe distance and wearing masks, and meanwhile the order got cancelled,” says Pawan Soni, a food and travel writer, adding how he can recall many episodes of delivery boys not turning up in time for varied reasons. Sharing a funny experience, he says, “In another incident, my daughter had ordered a taco along with a pizza. When we received the order, we found that the taco was half eaten! After complaining about this to the eatery, we were sent another taco, but that was delivered the next day!” ‘Delivery guy asked ₹200 for petrol’In another bizzare incident, a Delhi-based professional, who wishes to stay anonymous, says, “Once a delivery guy reached my place and said ‘Please give me ₹200 urgently as I’ve refill petrol in my bike’. When I clarified to him that my order was prepaid online, his tone suddenly changed and he said: ‘Theek hai toh main aapko khaana de deta hoon par main company mein main bol raha hun ki meri bike se khana gir gaya hai; then you’ll get the entire bill of ₹600 refunded aur refund aate hi aap mujhe ₹300 de dena.’ He didn’t budge and in fact waited for 20-25 minutes till the money came back to my account. And when I finally gave him cash, he said ‘Next time apko khana order karna ho toh apka order main hi pick karunga!” ‘Rider didn’t have money to pick the food’Citing another strange incident of food delivery, Smriti Chhabra from Gurgaon Community Circle, says, “We had an order for a sandwich once at around 9pm. But it didn’t get delivered even after 10pm. When we checked the tracker, we saw that the delivery guy did go to pick the sub, but then went in a way opposite to our location! We immediately called up the restaurant and enquired why the food hasn’t been delivered yet, and the person on the other side of the phone said ‘Madam the delivery boy came to up, but he didn’t have money to pay for the order so he left without collecting it.’ I was puzzled when they said that the delivery guy had to pay to be able to pick up the order, and then he would take payment from us, but he couldn’t because he didn’t have any money.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cant-deliver-your-food-it-got-snatched-is-this-for-real-101612355097451.html

These squads found out the illegal theft of electricity majorly in Bhosari, Pimpri, Kothrud, Parvati, Kedgaon, Nagar road, Padmavati and Rasta peth areas. The MSEDCL Pune region has started a special drive to search, identify and then act against the electricity theft in the district since December 2020. In this drive three types of electricity supply thefts are checked residential, commercial, and industrial. Those found guilty under this drive have acted under section 135 of the Indian Electricity Act, 2003. “We are giving required electricity supply for all the three types residential, commercial and industrial units. However, people are stealing the electricity in illegal ways, so this drive was started by us with special squads formed. Of the total 1,096 theft cases found in the Pune district till now, in 194 cases a fine of ₹59 lakh is recovered by the squad members. While in the past one week, a total of 240 engineers and our staff continued the special drive in Pune district at various areas – Wagholi, Tathwade highway, Pimple Nilakh, Hinjewadi, Bhekrainagar, Manjari, Undri Pisoli, Warje, Katraj and other areas,” said Ankush Nale, MSEDCL Pune regional director. “The squads found out the illegal theft of electricity majorly in Bhosari, Pimpri, Kothrud, Parvati, Kedgaon, Nagar Road, Padmavati and Rasta Peth areas. In this last week’s drive, we have found 142 theft cases worth ₹53 lakhs. We are taking action against the people found stealing the electricity under section 135 of Indian Electricity Act, 2003. Also, we are lodging police complaints against some of them who are not paying full payment of electricity theft done by them.

We will continue with our drive across the Pune district.” added Nale. Talking about this issue Atul Namekar secretary of Sinhagad road - Warje residents association said, “In our area there are many illegal electricity supply connections taken by the public, I have personally complained about some of them.

Normally, sewage water calculates 80 percent of daily supply of drinking water. At present, the corporation supplies around 1,100 million litre per day (MLD) in the city. So, the city generates 880 MLD sewage water. According to corporation data, PMC does not have 100 per cent collection efficiency of sewage networks and adequate sewage treatment capacity as per service benchmark. The PMC has mentioned 64 per cent capacity in the Environment Status Report (ESR-2018-19). However, the PMC drainage department has claimed 100 per cent quality of sewage treatment in the ESR-2018-19 report. The new online system will help to prove the claim of PMC. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Maharashtra state pollution control board directives, the PMC has decided to install an online system which will display inlet and outlet water samples of sewage. Online display of sewage treatment Shriniwas Kandul, additional city engineer of electrical department said, “It is an online testing system. We will place a metre inlet and outlet of sewage plant which will show characteristics of water such as the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand level (COD) of sewage and treated water, pH (acidity or basicity of water).” “The BOD and COD level is one of the major parameters to check the quality of sewage water. Both should be below 30 Milligram per litre water. Normally, sewage water BOD and COD level is more than 150 Milligram per litre water. After treatment, it comes down to 20 milligrams per litre water. The system will also show people how much water PMC treats in each STP,” he added. According to Kandul, the PMC is not treating 100 per cent sewage. However, the corporation has planned to construct 11 new sewage treatment plants (STPs) in future. “It will result in a creation of an additional treatment capacity of 396 million litre per day (MLD) over the existing treatment capacity of 477 MLD, laying of 113.6 kms of sewer lines and renovation/rehabilitation of four existing intermediate pumping stations,” Kandul said. How sewerage system works? The sewage system consists of a collection network, conveyance lines, pumping stations and sewage treatment plants. The collection network collects sewage from houses, apartments, commercial complexes or from the source. This collected sewage is further carried to pumping stations or Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) via conveyance lines. Pumping stations pump the sewage to STPs where primary and biological secondary treatment is given to sewage water before discharging into any natural water course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-install-online-system-to-check-treated-sewage-quality-101612350713213.html

The police lodged the complaint after Isha Balakant Jha (37), a woman associate of Jadhav filed a private complaint with Pune court seeking registration of case against Manish Anand, Aman Chaddha, Karan Chaddha, Mamata Chaddha, Ajay Chaddha, two other motorcycle-borne men and another unidentified person under 22 different sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Jha in her complaint said that she and Jadhav had parked her four-wheeler car in the opposite direction of Bank of Maharashtra in Aundh on December 14, 2021. When she opened the car door for Jadhav to get into the car, Ajay Chaddha deliberated rammed his two-wheeler into the car from behind and started abusing and molesting her. Aman Chadda was with his wife Mamta Chadda who was riding pillion on the bike. Jadhav asked him why he deliberately banged his two-wheeler onto the car after which he raised his voice, molested Jha and publicly abused them. Jadhav came to her rescue and both got into the car and went ahead, the application stated. Jha further stated, “Their car was accosted by two unidentified motorcyclists. On lowering the glass window, one of them pulled out the car key, pulled out Jadhav and brutally assaulted him. Later, one of the unidentified accused pushed her including the former MLA in another car where they were kidnapped. The three inmates of the car were Aman Chaddha (28), his brother Karan Chaddha and Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB) member Manish Anand who molested and physically assaulted us with iron rods and sticks. We somehow freed ourselves from their captivity and reached the police station to lodge our complaint, but they refused to our pleas.” The application stated “The police officer present at the police station told us that there was a case under IPC section 307 against Jadhav under an FIR lodged against him and told that he needs to be arrested. I sat through the night to lodge a complaint but instead they recorded my statement between 3 am to 4 am and made me forcibly sign on a paper which was written in Marathi language which I did not understand,” the complaint addressed to Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Court No 9. Anand said, “I have no connection with the case and just because I am a political person, an issue is being made from it. Karan Chaddha is my sister’s son and he called me regarding the incident. When I reached the police station, the complaint was already lodged. My sister had sustained a fracture on one finger in the leg while my brother-in-law got a heart attack and had to be admitted to the hospital. Jadhav’s lawyer had called Karan Chaddha asking him to withdraw the case. We will take law procedure and all false allegations levelled against me will be dealt in the court. I am approaching the court for anticipatory bail and I have no connection with this case.” Former legislator Jadhav was arrested on December 15 in a case related to physical assault of a couple in a road rage case in Pune. Jadhav (43), who was a legislator till May 2019, was arrested by the Chaturshringi police after he and his associate assaulted an elderly man and his wife in Aundh on Monday. Jadhav is the estranged son-in-law of union minister Raosaheb Danve. He was booked after the victims’ son Aman Chadda (28), a resident of Bopodi, lodged a complaint against Jadhav and his associate identified as Isha Jha stating that they assaulted his parents, Ajay and Mamata Chadda, at a spot in front of a bank on an approach road towards Bremen chowk. Jadhav suddenly opened the door of his car which hit the couple’s approaching vehicle. Because of the car door, his mother, who was riding pillion, sustained an injury on the leg and his father lost balance and almost fell, the FIR had stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/kcb-member-seven-others-booked-in-former-mla-jadhav-assault-case-101612350712465.html

03-02-2021||Pune||State govt: Bird flu threat “depleting” in Maharashtra||The Maharashtra animal husbandry department is riding high on confidence after depleting threat of the bird flu outbreak in the state. The department has reported declining mortality rate among birds and the absence of recurrence of virus (H1N1 or H1N8). “The trend which we have observed in the last eight days gives us high confidence that the bird flu threat is declining. If the same trend continues for the next one week then we will be able to say the threat is negligible,” said Sachindra Pratap Singh, state animal husbandry commissioner. On February 1, the deaths of only 94 birds were recorded in the state. It is the lowest number of deaths since bird flu cases began on January 8. “The mortality rate has gone down across the state and the best part is that whichever place we declared as an ‘infected zone’ and prescribed preventive measures, there wasn’t a case of recurrence of the virus which is a positive sign,” added Singh. The mortality rate among birds was highest on January 19 when 4,479 birds were found dead across the state. The second highest number of mortalities was on January 23 when 1,804 birds were found dead. On other days since the bird flu outbreak in the state (January 8), the number of bird deaths were below 1,500. On Monday, February 1 only 94 deaths of birds were recorded in the state. Until Monday, a total of 19,923 bird deaths were recorded in the state. In Pune district, bird flu cases were found in Boribel village Daund; Nande village Mulshi and Gajunje village Maval. “After taking preventive measures no unnatural bird deaths have occurred in Pune district,” informed an official who looks after Pune district bird flu cases. The cafes around the city have also observed a surge in chicken orders in the last one week compared to the last 15 days. “More people are asking for chicken when we compare it to the second week of January. Still the orders are not coming like it used to come normally but there is an improvement, and we accept it will get normal,” said Abbas Ali, manager, Good luck café.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-govt-bird-flu-threat-depleting-in-maharashtra-101612350651589.html

The illegal construction was done on the backside of the shops over the Ambil Odha retaining wall which was causing risk to the steady flow of water. A team of PMC workers started the anti-encroachment drive in the morning at 10am and continued till afternoon. There are at least 40 furniture shops in Padmavati near the starting point of Shankar Maharaj flyover bridge on the Satara road. It is known as the Gururaj Society furniture shops line and the shops have been there for the last 35 years. “The action against encroachments at the furniture shops was the part of our regular anti-encroachment drive. From last few days this drive is going on and it will continue for the next few days. There was illegal construction done by the shop owners behind the shops over the Ambil Odha which was demolished by our department workers,” said Madhav Jagtap, PMC’s anti-encroachment squad chief. All the shops had increased their shop from behind approximately four feet in width over the Ambil Odha. Furniture materials and other things were kept inside these parts of the shops, also a retaining wall has been built beneath these encroachment areas. “We have been doing business at this place since the last 35 years and there has been full cooperation from all the shop owners to PMC. One year ago, we received a notice from the PMC about encroachments, after which we organised subsequent meetings with their officials. On Tuesday morning suddenly their team came and started demolishing the back-end of our shops. We requested them to give us time till February 11 so that we could shift our material and other things, but they didn’t listen to us,” said Tanaji Dadhe, one of the shopowners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/encroachments-by-furniture-shops-on-satara-road-demolished-101612350355318.html

03-02-2021||Pune||Pune dist admin faces possible shortage of doses as frontline workers get ready for vaccination||The district administration is likely to face a shortage of the Covid-19 vaccine doses if the second instalment of the vaccines do not arrive in time. Frontline workers are second in line after healthcare workers to get the Covid-19 vaccine in the second round of phase II of the vaccination drive. The district administration needs close to 4.29 lakh doses, including the possible 10% wastage for about 1.95 lakh registered beneficiaries.The district administration had received 78,000 doses of both Covishield and Covaxin, of which 2,000 doses of Covaxin were sent to District Hospital, Aundh. Of the 78,000 doses of Covishield, currently 40,780 doses are available with the authorities which include the second doses kept aside for the beneficiaries who received their first doses since January 16. Of the 1.95 lakh registered beneficiaries, over 1.10 lakh are only healthcare workers while the remaining 85,000 are frontline workers. The registration for the frontline workers is still going on which means that the number is likely to be higher. Frontline workers include police officials, armed forces, disaster management volunteers, municipal workers, home guards, and civil defence organisations and prison staff. The district administration is yet to receive a date to start the vaccination for frontline workers which is likely to start in the first week of this month. Dr Ashish Bharti, PMC health department chief, said, “We have not yet got the date and the link is not activated in the software. The beneficiaries have been registered and because of these technical issues no one has been able to start the vaccination for frontline workers. We have vaccinated about 7,500 healthcare workers as of now and we have 55,000 more to go. The second dose is also pending which would start from February 13. We have been told by the state that we would get the required doses shortly. Looking at the current stock it would not be enough even for the 55,000 pending healthcare workers. Dr Bharti added, “Without completing the first round of vaccinating healthcare workers for whom we will now start the second round by mid-February, to start the first round for frontline workers is a scary situation. It would be difficult to balance the situation. Already the system is exhausted, we had a polio drive on Sunday and this has been going on for a long time now. The vaccination would go on for five days every week for months which could lead to fatigue among the staff.” Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer, said, “We have about 85,000 frontline workers registered as of Sunday in the district. We have enough doses as of now and we will get additional doses and it is a routine process. The state has committed to provide more doses whenever required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-dist-admin-faces-possible-shortage-of-doses-as-frontline-workers-get-ready-for-vaccination-101612348972006.html

03-02-2021||Delhi||#VocalForLocal: In focus, tribal arts at Dilli Haat||Abuzz with life, light and colours, one usually finds a lot of variety to shop and eat when a cultural fest on at Dilli Haat. But, what if you find Baiga art, Saura art, Red Ant Chutney and more such eclectic things? There’s this and a lot more to celebrate the spirit, culture and life essence of indigenous tribes of India, at the ongoing Aadi Mahotsav, a national tribal festival organised by Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation (TRIFED), Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The event has been organised keeping in mind all safety precautions for Covid-19, at a venue that allows for a large gathering without overcrowding. And it’s curated with the spirit to further the Prime Minister’s clarion call of #VocalForLocal. Pravir Krishna, managing director, TRIFED, says, “The pandemic has hit our artisans quite adversely. We want to give them access to large markets so that they can sell their goods, earn their livelihood and live well. The sale they get here will sustain them for a whole year, and it’s a thrill to see their enthusiasm. Our battle cry is #BuyTribal, so our focus is on making them self-reliant by enabling their economic welfare and cultural sustenance.” Over a thousand artisans and artists have come together to set up around 200 stalls that showcase the rich tribal handicrafts, paintings, jewellery, fabric, handmade soaps, woollen shawls and stoles, and foods from across the country. “After almost a whole year, we are at an exhibition showcasing our work. It feels so heartwarming to be able to get such an exposure that allows us to also earn a livelihood and continue with our generational art forms,” says Amar Baiga, a member of the Baiga tribal community from Madhya Pradesh, who is showcasing Baiga art, a form of traditional wall relief. The festival also has presence of some of the National award winning artists such as Rameshwar Munda, a flag bearer of Saura art from Odisha’s Munda tribe. His stall exhibits a melange of palm leaf engraved paintings, Saura paintings and Pattachitra. “Each piece takes weeks to complete, and the intricate work involved is what makes Pattachitra art so exquisite,” he says, adding, “Often a Pattachitra painting has an entire family working on it. I’ve been teaching this art to my kids so they can also learn this skill alongside pursuing their education.” In addition to these exquisite arts, there is a delectable spread of tribal dishes including Dal Pitha, Mahua laddoos, Telangana’s spicy biryani, Jharkhand’s Chilka roti, and something to please every palate. And there’s no dearth of entertainment with enthralling live performances by tribal musicians and dancers at different breakout zones!

However, he could not stop praising the deputy CM. “He is a very good man and we are from the same region,” he said, adding, “My visit was related to the issues of development and nothing else.”On January 28, all five AIMIM MLAs from Seemanchal had met chief minister Nitish Kumar, triggering speculation about their possible shift to the JD(U). However, they too had incidentally described their meeting to be about the ‘development’ issues.On Monday, AIMIM state president Akhatarul Iman, said their party was committed to the development of Seemanchal and threatened to launch an agitation if the development of the region was neglected.“We fought the election on the issue of backwardness of Seemanchal and we will try our best to fight for this cause and will take to the streets if the government fails,” Iman had said while describing the purpose of their meeting with the CM.“We want development of the Seemanchal region either by hook or by crook. People have expressed hope in us and by their blessings we won five seas in Seemanchal and emerged as a potential political power centre,” Iman added while exhorting Seemanchal MLAs and MPs to lend their support in the ‘fight’ for Seemanchal.Seemanchal, once regarded as a bastion of the RJD, dealt a blow to the party, which could only win the Thakurganj seat in the region, where Saud Alam, son of late Congress MP Maulana Asrarul Haq, won.Out of 37 assembly seats in Seemanchal and Kosi region, NDA won 23 seats. Out of the 24 assembly seats falling in Seemanchal’s four districts- Katihar, Araria, Kishanganj and Purnia, NDA won 12 seats while the AIMIM and the Congress won 5 each and one each went to the RJD and CPI-ML.Similarly on Kosi region’s 13 seats, NDA won on 11 and the remaining two went to the RJD.Also Read: SC seeks Centre's reply on encroachments on Ganga's floodplains in Patna“Tarkishore Parasad was offered the post of DCM as a reward as he is associated with the two regions,” said Naresh Kumar Srivasatava, a political observer.Srivastava pointed out that the Deputy CM was born in Kosi and made Seemanchal his political turf. “Tarkishore Prasad is quite popular in Seemanchal and Kosi,” he said, adding, “MLAs from even the opposition parties will have a sense of bonhomie with Prasad.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/somethings-cooking-bihar-dycm-fuels-speculations-after-meeting-rjd-mlas-101612328395822.html

03-02-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s vaccine wastage below permissible limit of 10%||More than three weeks after the roll out of coronavirus vaccination, Haryana has reported an average vaccine wastage of 9.43%, well below the programmatic wastage of 10% allowed by the Union ministry of health.According to the vaccine coverage data of the health department up to January 29, the state has administered 1,16,481 doses against the actual dose consumption of 1,28,660. This also meant that more than 90% of the doses have been successfully utilised for inoculation.Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora, said that better vaccination session planning which led to inoculation of more healthcare workers was a major reason that the wastage was within the permissible limits.Of about 1.9 lakh healthcare workers registered on the CoWin software for prioritising beneficiaries of vaccination, about 1.28 lakh (about 67%) were inoculated by Tuesday.“A lower level of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Haryana is also a factor in lower vaccine wastage since the turnouts have been good,” said National Health Mission (NHM) director Prabhjot Singh.The ACS said that they created multiple vaccination sites and ensured that gaps are filled in case of lower turnout at any site. “We also ensured that inoculation of healthcare workers is advanced by a day. This helped in curbing vaccine wastage as they filled in for those who did not turn up. In case more people turned up, we create a new vaccination site,” he added.Healthcare workers to get vaccinated by Feb 15The ACS said that all healthcare workers have asked to get vaccinated till February 15 and priority for them will end after the set date. Meanwhile, the state will start the second phase of vaccine rollout for frontline health workers from February 3.All frontline workers who are to be administered the vaccine during the second phase will be registered on the CoWin portal by February 7. Frontline workers, include employees of revenue, jails, police, home guards and urban local bodies departments.So far, about 1.10 lakh frontline workers have been registered for the second phase on the portal, said the NHM director.Singh added that 7,23,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine have been received from the central government so far.Infection curve continues flattening trendHaryana recorded 694 coronavirus infections last week (Jan 25-31) as compared to 894 the week before. The infection curve thus has continued with its flattening trend for a successive 10th week.ACS (health) Rajeev Arora said that dipping infection, however, should not mean complacency as there is always an apprehension of fresh surge due to lowering of guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-vaccine-wastage-below-permissible-limit-of-10-101612328089305.html

Here is all you need to know about the findings that suggest more than half of the Capital’s population on average may have been exposed to the virus:• The data showed that except for the north district, the other 10 districts had a seroprevalence of more than 50%. Of these, six had a seroprevalence of over 55%. South-east district had the highest at 62%.• The numbers now appear to fall in a territory that experts believe is similar to the herd immunity threshold – a point in seroprevalence (estimated to be 60-80% of the population in case of Sars-Cov-2) when there are too few people left for the virus to spread to, slowing an outbreak down.Also Read | Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districts: Sero survey in Delhi• Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain has cautioned that this should not be seen as having hit herd immunity.• Experts have underlined herd immunity is uncertain in the case of natural infections since such immunity could wane and people still spread the disease while they are infected (contrary to what happens when someone is vaccinated).• The latest round of the survey was conducted between January 15 and January 23 and included 100 samples from each of the city’s 272 wards.• It was the largest in the Capital and the country so far.• The high seroprevalence is in sync with the state of the outbreak in the Capital.• Over the past 10-12 days, Delhi has been reporting less than 200 Covid-19 cases every day and the positivity rate, which at one point had touched 15%, is now stable at lower than 1% for the past one month.• The full report of the latest survey will be released later this week after further examination of the findings.• This time, too, the number of women having antibodies was more than that of men. There means that all these people had Covid at some point and now have fully recovered. • Experts say the latest survey was bigger in scale and also better technology was used. • CLIA technology was used for the latest survey, which is more sensitive than the ELISA technology.• All the samples were tested to ensure uniformity. The survey was conducted in association with Maulana Azad Medical College. The samples were collected from people of all socio-economic strata and from across all kinds of population and age groups.• Delhi’s first serological survey was done in June-July and it had shown that 23.4% of people surveyed had developed antibodies against the virus. • Similar surveys in August showed that 29.1% of people had antibodies, 25.1% in September, and 25.5% in October. • A positive result implies that the person has developed antibodies against the virus. This means that the person was infected at some point and developed immunity against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-50-in-delhi-exposed-to-covid-says-5th-sero-survey-all-you-need-to-know-101612324729262.html

The lid was blown off the racket after a complaint was filed against some of the accused officers, according to an ACB officer.A construction company, which won the contract for Delhi-Mumbai express highway construction under the Bharatmala project, had complained to the bureau, alleging the SDMs demanded a bribe for helping the contractor in the land acquisition process for road construction and for not obstructing the project.When he refused, the SDMs started harassing him, the contractor had alleged.Also Read: Vasundhara Raje's hour-long meeting with Shah surprises manyThe ACB had found that in the last 35 days, SDM Mittal, along with other officials, met Agarwal multiple times. Neeraj, the middleman from Dausa, also a contractor by profession, was also found to have been in constant touch with Mittal and Agarwal regarding the award of the highway project to the complainant.The complainant had alleged that the SDMs harassed him continuously citing different technicalities.“The middleman used by the SP threatened the contractor with a criminal case if he refused to pay ₹10 lakh every month and an extra amount of Rs10 lakh to settle a case. The accused also blackmailed others but they were not able to gather courage to register a complaint. These officials used to threaten victims with trapping them in civil and criminal cases,” said an ACB official.Meena and Mittal, both Rajasthan Administrative Officers (RAS), are presently in judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-ips-officer-manish-agarwal-linked-to-extortion-racket-arrested-101612323461824.html

Minimum temperature is expected to be around 9 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. The minimum temperature in the city on Tuesday rose to 6.2°C, as against 5.3°C on Monday.A western disturbance is likely to bring light rain to the city.

03-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Hero’s grave||Among those who care for graves of historical people, it is common knowledge that the shrine of Sufi saint Hazrat Sarmad Shahid lies between the Jama Masjid and the Red Fort in Old Delhi. Some might even know that the grave of freedom fighter Maulana Abul Kalam Azad lies between these two monuments as well. But very few will be aware that the area is also home to the grave of General Shah Nawaz Khan. Born in 1914 in Rawalpindi, he served in the Indian National Army (INA) under the leadership of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose during WW2, and was famously convicted for treason in 1945 by the British in the Red Fort, along with two other top INA figures—Prem Sahgal and Gurbaksh Dhillon. In Shyam Benegal’s 2004 biopic on Netaji, actor Sonu Sood portrayed General Khan.But his burial place is hidden from sight. The marble grave lies within a small garden, its boundary wall circled by unwieldy trees. Even to an alert eye, it is almost impossible to spot the venue while walking on the crowded lane outside. This afternoon, the garden is filled with the incessant chirping of birds. The sound is so deafening that one feels the presence of hundreds — though not one is to be seen. A more concentrated gaze reveals that these are tiny ullus (owls). An earthen pitcher filled with water is placed beside the grave, possibly for these birds.The enclosure has another grave. The smaller one belongs to Begum Karim Jaan, the General’s wife. While the General’s grave has grass growing out of it, hers is perfectly dry. According to the inscriptions on the stones, she died 13 years after his passing in 1983.Though the place is empty, there are signs of a recent visit. A tea cup is lying upturned beside the graves. A cushion is flung along a hedge. A wooden bench is standing vertically against a wall.Suddenly a cat appears. She tiptoes about the General, and then turns towards the Begum. The cat stands still for a while, seemingly immersed in her own thoughts, and then goes away. The couple is left alone.The main door to the grave enclosure remains closed, but you can enter through a back gate via Meena Bazar. After sundown, a pavement clothes-seller called Allahabadi sleeps just outside the grave-garden, as a night watchman would.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-hero-s-grave-101612319593225.html

Many other measures to improve policing in the state were also discussed in the conference."Till now, in cases of any person putting any anti-national posts on social media, the police used to first do his counselling, asking him not to repeat it in future. A case was registered only if it was a very serious case," Kumar said, throwing light on the state police’s current approach on the matter."From now onwards, the police would scrutinise the accused person’s social media behaviour to check if he is habitual of putting such anti-national posts. If it is found, then the police would not clear his police verification, needed while applying for passport or arms license," said Kumar.Another police officer privy to the development said, "The decision was taken as there has been an increase in the number of people putting anti-national posts on social media in the state."Also Read: Senior Cong leaders push for Harish Rawat's name for CM, infighting intensifies"The social media monitoring team has been keeping a strict vigil to track down such posts and people as it is a clear threat to law & order," said the officer.Speaking about other important policing decisions taken during the two day conference, DGP Kumar said, "In the cases of road accidents involving mining vehicles, the police would now also register a case against the owners of such vehicles and not just its driver."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/antinational-posts-could-deny-police-clearance-for-passport-in-uttarakhand-101612318207963.html

03-02-2021||Delhi||Schools kick off prep as parents, students welcome exam schedule||With the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) releasing the 2021 exam time table for classes 10 and 12 on Tuesday, almost three months in advance, principals and teachers across the national capital said it was a welcome step as students can now prepare well for exams. The board also announced that class 12 students will have exams in two shifts – morning and afternoon.While CBSE had announced in December that exams would be conducted between May and June 2021, on Tuesday it released the date sheet for the board examinations, which would begin on May 4 for both Class 10 and 12 students. While exams of Class 10 students will end on June 7, those of Class 12 students will end on June 11.Of the total 2,168 schools in Delhi, a majority is affiliated to the CBSE and board exams for classes 10 and 12 are usually held in February. Due to the pandemic and the subsequent shift to online education, the board had also reduced the syllabus for the academic year by 30%.Also read: CBSE class 10 and 12 date sheet 2021 releasedManju Sethi, principal of Bluebells School International in Kailash Colony, said conducting exams in two shifts won’t be an issue. “As per the notification by the CBSE, exams in the second shift are of subjects not offered to students in CBSE schools abroad. That means these will be subjects having fewer enrolments. It won’t be an issue for schools to conduct exams for fewer students in the second shift. We won’t require more than three or four classrooms for that and we can easily sanitise and ready them before students arrive,” she said.Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales, Pusa Road, also said it was a balanced date sheet. “For instance, Class 12 students will appear for their English exam on May 4 and then get a week to prepare for the next major elective paper. In between, they have music and vocational subjects. Since the board has introduced an afternoon shift, schools will take measures so that students are able to write their papers comfortably while wearing masks.”Most students were happy with the schedule. “Commerce students have ample time between major subjects and we are happy with the date sheet. Also, unlike previous years when the date sheet was announced less than two months before exams, this time we have nearly three months in hand. We know how much time there is between papers so we can devise a study routine accordingly,” said Twisha Kacker, 18, a class 12 student of The Indian School.Sukhbir Singh Yadav, principal of Sarvodaya Vidyalaya Rohini, Sector 3, said since the Delhi government had allowed class 10 and 12 students to return to schools for preparations, teachers can plan the lessons accordingly and as per the needs of students.Also read: CBSE class 10 date sheet 2021 released, here's link to check“The class 10 date sheet has days between major subjects. Same is the case with class 12 students. However, for certain subject combinations, there are no gaps. For instance, students who have opted for both biology and commerce, there would be no gap day,” he said.Yadav also said since exams would be held during peak summer in Delhi, the timings could have been different. “Students will be wearing masks; so it would have been better if the morning shift started at 9am instead of 10.30am and the afternoon shift at 3pm instead of 2.30pm,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/schools-kick-off-prep-as-parents-students-welcome-exam-schedule-101612308734840.html
03-02-2021||Delhi||Front line staff to get Covid jabs later this week; 77 centres added||State health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday that the ongoing Covid-19 inoculation drive —which currently covers health workers — will be opened to front line workers this week even as authorities increased the number of vaccination centres from 106 to 183 as well as the number of vaccination days from four to six days a week.Jain, however, did not mention the exact day when the vaccination will begin for the city’s estimated 600,000 front line workers, including the police and municipal employees, among others, directly engaged in Covid-19 management in some way. About 338,011 front line workers have enlisted so far to take the jab in a registration drive that is still underway.Meanwhile, Delhi gave a boost to its vaccination drive. So far, Covid-19 vaccines in the national capital were administered on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. From Wednesday, it will become a six-day drive (from Monday to Saturday), a senior health official said on condition of anonymity.Also read: Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districtsBut the turnout rate in Delhi witnessed a sharp fall on Tuesday with only 9,357 of a targeted 18,300 (at scaled-up capacity) beneficiaries getting vaccinated. The turnout rate of 51.13% was the lowest since January 19, the second day of vaccination when it was 48.8%.On Tuesday, Delhi also reported 17 cases of adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI), of which none was severe in nature, government officials said.Several government officials attributed the low turnout to fewer people turning up at new centres because of lack of awareness about them, said officials. However, other government officials said turnout at some of the existing vaccination centres have reached a saturation point.“That is why the government should start vaccinating front line workers now, along with health workers, to fill up the gap,” said a health department official.For instance, the vaccine centre at Maulana Azad Medical College, which witnessed a turnout of around 70% over the past one week, saw only 18 beneficiaries on Tuesday.“There are apprehensions among beneficiaries, especially in view of several cases of mild fever and AEFI (adverse event following immunization) that have emerged. In its ongoing awareness drive, the government should stress that the vaccine is for prevention and India is yet to witness a second wave like several other countries such as the US and the UK,” said Dr Namrata Makkar, deputy medical superintendent at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on Tuesday’s turnout figures.The 183 sites are spread across 114 hospitals, which essentially means at least some of them – such as Lok Nayak Hospital in the public sector and BL Kapoor Hospital in the private sector — have more than one centre now, said the health department official cited above.“This scaling up was needed to increase the coverage at a faster rate among health workers. There will be need for more capacity building to accommodate front-line workers, whose numbers are more,” said a second health department official.The number of health workers in the city is estimated at 300,000 by the Delhi government, of which around 240,000 registered for the Covid-19 vaccination and 73,983 health workers have taken the jab.“The aim at this stage should be to reach out to more categories of beneficiaries. People belonging to other priority groups, who want to get vaccinated at the earliest, should be given the opportunity now,” said Dr Suneela Garg, director professor, community medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College, and member, Lancet Covid-19 Commission and Vaccination Task Force for India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/front-line-staff-to-get-covid-jabs-later-this-week-77-centres-added-101612305997796.html
03-02-2021||Delhi||Centre defends police use of tear gas on protesters||Defending the use force on protesting farmers during the January 26 tractor rally that descended into violence and chaos, the Union government told Parliament on Tuesday that Delhi Police was left with no option but to use tear gas, water cannons, and mild force to control the agitating crowd, which was also breaking Covid safety protocols. .The ministry of home affairs (MHA), which oversees the policing of the Capital, said that Delhi Police have registered 39 cases between September and December 2020 against the farmers protesting against the new farm laws. These cases do not include those registered in connection with the January 26 violence.Responding to a query by several members of Parliament in the Lok Sabha, Union minister of state (home affairs) G Kishan Reddy said in a written reply: “As regards the use of tear gas and resorting to lathi charge against protesting farmers by the Delhi Police, it has been reported by Delhi Police that at Delhi border, large convoys of protesting farmers in tractor trolleys tried to furiously force their way and go past police barricades to enter Delhi to mark their protest against the recently enacted farm laws.”Also read: Metal batons, just an experiment, say Delhi PoliceHe added that the farmers “aggressively resorted to rioting, damage to government property, and used criminal force to deter public servants from the discharge of their duty, thereby inflicting injuries to the on-duty police personnel. Moreover, social distancing was not followed by the farmers/protestors and they gathered in large numbers without face masks amid Covid-19 pandemic. The farmers’ actions left the Delhi Police with no option but to use tear gas, water cannons and mild force to control the crowd”.The minister told Parliament that one case of a farmer’s suicide has been reported to the ministry by the police till date.The Centre, however, appeared to duck a question on number of farmers who have lost their lives so far during the agitation, which have been going on at Delhi’s borders for over two months now. To a query on number of farmers’ killed so far during agitation, the MHA told Parliament that police and law and order is a state subject. “The responsibilities of maintaining law and order, including investigation, registration / prosecution of crimes, conviction of accused, protection of life and property etc. rests primarily with the respective state governments,” the MHA reply stated.In Delhi, law and order comes under the Union government.Farmers claim that over 100 people have died on Delhi’s borders, for various reasons, since the agitation began.The minister also did not give a specific response to a question seeking evidence from the home ministry on the claim that “terrorists have infiltrated the farmers’ agitation”. Over the last month, the government and intelligence agencies have repeatedly said that the farmers’ agitation has been hijacked by some pro-Khalistan elements.Avik Saha, Secretary of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), said, “The government has always been very shy of admitting farmers’ deaths, be it suicides or now during the agitation. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-defends-police-use-of-tear-gas-on-protesters-101612303590260.html

03-02-2021||Delhi||Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districts: Sero survey in Delhi||The fifth serological survey in Delhi to detect Covid-19 antibodies showed that 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled tested positive, state health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday, releasing findings that suggest more than half of the Capital’s population on average may have been exposed to the virus.The data released by Jain showed that except for the north district, the other 10 districts had a seroprevalence of more than 50%. Of these, six had a seroprevalence of more than 55%. South-east district had the highest number at 62%.These numbers now appear to fall in a territory that experts believe is similar to the herd immunity threshold – a point in seroprevalence (estimated to be 60-80% of the population in case of Sars-Cov-2) when there are too few people left for the virus to spread to, slowing an outbreak down.But Jain cautioned that this should not be seen as having hit herd immunity, something that experts have separately said is uncertain in the case of natural infections since such immunity could wane and people still spread the disease while they are infected (contrary to what happens when someone is vaccinated).“Some say herd immunity is achieved at 50%, others say it should be 60%. I don’t think we should get into the debate of herd immunity now. This is a new form of virus or disease, we should not get lax with our precautionary measures because in October, we had thought the virus was brought under control, but then we got the third wave,” said Jain.Also read: Delhi records 3 Covid-19 deaths, lowest in 10 monthsAccording to Jain, the latest round – which was conducted between January 15 and January 23, and included 100 samples from each of the city’s 272 wards – was the largest in the Capital yet. “It is also the largest in the country so far. Delhi has largely won over Covid-19, but we should continue to practise Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” Jain said.The latest figure is an over 30 percentage point jump over the last sero survey that was held in October, before the city entered the third wave of infections.The high seroprevalence is also in sync with the state of the outbreak in the Capital. Jain stated that over the past 10-12 days, Delhi has been reporting less than 200 Covid-19 cases every day and the positivity rate, which at one point had touched 15%, is now stable at lower than 1% for the past one month.“Still, I want to urge everyone to continue wearing masks for a few more months. In the past two months, the compliance has improved substantially, the result of which is in front of everyone -- Covid cases have drastically come down. If people continue to wear masks this way, we will be able to totally control the virus in the next few months,” the minister said.The minister said the full report of the latest serological survey will be released in a day or two after further examination of the findings.“Like the results in the previous surveys, this time too the number of females having antibodies was more than that of males. There means that all these people had Covid at some point and now have fully recovered. We can say that antibodies have been found in 49.09% to 62.18% of the people in Delhi, and the average percentage of people who have been found positive is 56.13%,” Jain said.Dr Nutan Mundeja, director general of health services (Delhi state health mission) said this time, the sero survey was not just bigger in scale, but also better technology was used.“We have used CLIA technology this time, which is more sensitive than the ELISA technology, as a result of which results come out more accurate. All the samples were tested at the ILBS hospital to ensure uniformity. The survey was conducted in association with Maulana Azad Medical College. The samples were collected from people of all socio-economic strata and from across all kinds of population and age groups,” said Mundeja.Delhi’s first serological survey was done in the city in June-July and it had shown that 23.4% of people surveyed had developed antibodies against the virus. Similar surveys in August showed that 29.1% of people had antibodies, 25.1% in September, and 25.5% in October. A positive result implies that the person has developed antibodies against the virus. This means that the person was infected at some point and developed immunity against it.Jain said earlier, the Delhi government was conducting sero survey every month.“But, now we are doing it after 1.5-2 months. The next survey will also be done after about 2 months,” he said.T Jacob John, former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore said the latest sero survey result is a representation of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic which had hit the national Capital in mid-November when the peak daily cases had touched around 8,500.Also read: Barricaded roads lead to massive snarls in Delhi“This sero survey does not include those who got infected in the first and second wave because the tests detect antibodies which lasts only for about 2-3 months. So, in general more than 56.13% people in Delhi have got infected and recovered. Also, loss of antibodies, which is not the last word on immunity, does not mean loss of protection,” he said.John said herd immunity will be better achieved once vaccination is rolled out in a larger way.“Senior citizens and those with co-morbidities, school staff and essential service providers should be vaccinated at the earliest so that Delhi can inch towards herd immunity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-50-exposure-to-sars-cov-2-in-10-of-11-city-districts-sero-survey-in-delhi-101612296515799.html

The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is indicative of the city’s temperature, recorded a maximum temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius, which was 4.9 degrees above normal. The temperatures soared after a week-long spell of cold conditions last week and is in line with IMD’s forecast. “As IMD considers January and February as winter months, this is the highest temperature recorded in the ongoing winter season. November and December are months when the transition in temperatures happens,” said an official from IMD. Prior to this, the Santacruz station had recorded a maximum temperature of 35.3 degrees Celsius on January 12. The Colaba weather station, which is representative of the weather in south Mumbai, also recorded high temperature at 33.8 degrees Celsius, which was 3.5 degrees above normal. The minimum temperatures were also higher than normal. At Santacruz, the minimum temperature was 19.2 degrees Celsius, which was 1.6 degrees above normal, while at Colaba the minimum temperature was 22 degrees Celsius –2.4 degrees above normal. “The delayed setting-in of sea breeze led to higher temperatures in and around Mumbai. In the morning, there was land breeze with easterly component that continued to dominate almost till 3.30pm. This delayed the setting of sea breeze, which normally happens before 1pm. However, gradual reduction in both day and night temperatures is expected in the coming four-five days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region), IMD, on Twitter. Meanwhile, the air quality, which had improved slightly on Monday, worsened on Tuesday, but continued to remain in the poor category. An overall air quality index (AQI) — an air quality indicator— of 283 was measured on Tuesday, as opposed to Monday’s 221. Navi Mumbai had the worst air quality with an AQI of 359 (very poor), followed by Mazagaon at 325, while Andheri and Malad recorded an AQI of 303. “The air quality of Mumbai is in the poor category. With the current calm wind conditions, local emission with continental pollution to keep the AQI poor for Mumbai in the next two days,” short-range forecast by SAFAR statedThe AQI is calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in and around Mumbai. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-36-3-celsius-mumbai-records-season-s-highest-temperature-101612295265645.html

He was speaking at the inaugural session of Colaba Conversation, a conference organised by the Observer Research Foundation to discuss policy issues affecting the city, the country and world. The two-day conference held via video-conferencing had 70 speakers from 20 countries to discuss policy and planning in life after pandemic in global cities. Speaking at the inauguration of the conference, Thackeray said that development activities must be undertaken bearing in mind their impact on nature and environment. He said that even as there is no medicine to treat Covid-19, oxygen has saved lives of several people.The CM added that Mumbai is perhaps the only city which has a jungle within its limits. “It’s not a concrete jungle, but one that is rich with biodiversity,” he said, adding that Mumbai ranks among the top cities in the world where migration from rural to urban areas is high. “Global warming does not happen in jungles, and it hardly happens in the villages. Cities contribute hugely to climate change. We must gauge the need of the hour and rise to the occasion,” he said in his speech on Tuesday, adding that the transport arm of the Mumbai civic body, the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking, has introduced e-buses, and the government is also augmenting the Metro rail network.Thackeray added that the Covid-19-pandemic brought the world to a pause and the reset button needs should be thinking and changing the manner in which things are done in the future. “The pause brought because of the pandemic has made us identify where and how the next challenge is going to arise. Corona has opened our eyes to environment. The question is whether we have learnt the lessons,” he said.Additional civic commissioner Ashwini Bhide, who was also speaking at the conference, said as trains are not running in full capacity, there is further strain on road transport. “There are inherent limitations as Mumbai is a linear city with a high population density. It’s poised to expand its public transport network but in the meantime, we still need to face challenges: be it pandemic or floods. We need efficient protocol to ensure these facilities work smoothly during a crisis,” Bhide said in a panel discussion on ‘Lessons from the pandemic’. CM lays emphasis on sustainable development Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was on Tuesday attended the inaugural session of Colaba Conversation, a conference organised by the Observer Research Foundation, to discuss policy issues affecting the city, the country and the world. He said rise in migration leads to increase in construction activities, mechanisation etc, which is a “danger” for all global cities including Mumbai. “Cities contribute majorly to climate change. So should we stop the development work? No, that may not be the case. As the population is rising, issues such as affordable housing and eco-friendly mass transportation are gaining significance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/need-affordable-eco-friendly-mass-transport-in-post-pandemic-world-maharashtra-cm-101612294125637.html
03-02-2021||Mumbai||Traffic violations in 2020 more than 2019: Mumbai traffic police data||Despite being under complete lockdown for over six months, the city had witnessed more number of traffic violations last year as compared to 2019.According to the Mumbai traffic police data, in 2020, 5,095,478 drivers had received challans for various traffic -related violations compared to the 4,938,485 violations in 2019. The traffic police had imposed penalties worth ₹148.16 crore, of which 953,679 fines worth ₹25.73 crore had been recovered, while 4,141,799 challans worth ₹122.43 crore have remained unpaid last year, the data revealed. In 2019, there were unpaid challans worth ₹102 crore. Traffic police officers said after the lockdown restrictions were eased, the department had to ensure smooth flow of traffic, especially of emergency vehicles and government vehicles. Thus, they increased patrolling and nakabandis across the city and could nab more traffic violators. Additional commissioner of police (traffic) Pravin Padwal said that the department had in January and February also noticed a rise in the number of violations, even before the city went into lockdown. “We had ensured more action in 2020,” said Padwal, adding that after the lockdown was eased in September, there was increase in challans as more action was taken. Traffic police officers said that there was a backlog of 29 lakh unpaid fines on e-challans issued, amounting to ₹315 crore. To recover the pending e-challans, the call centre started by the traffic police on December 7 contacted around 4,600 motorists and managed to recover ₹1.12 crore-fines from 2,596 violators. Yashasvi Yadav, joint commissioner of police (traffic), said they would continue with the call centre until all the pending challans are recovered. The officers said that to clear the backlog of pending challans they had urged the motorists to pay their dues but did not get response. A mobile application was also set up to make it easy for the violators to pay their fines but that was also not working. The traffic police had also requested the regional transport department to cancel the driving licences of 2,000 motorists who failed to pay their pending e-challans. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/traffic-violations-in-2020-more-than-2019-mumbai-traffic-police-data-101612293525411.html

Commenting on the crisis on Tuesday, party chief spokesperson Nawab Malik asked if the Central government is preparing to fight a war with the farmers. He also said that the prime minister should use the same strength against China instead of its own farmers.The Delhi Police has turned the borders of the Capital — Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur — into fortresses as they have become the epicentre of the farmers’ protest against the three contentious farm laws. The police’s measures include multi-layered barricades, heavy security deployment, roads cemented with nails and concrete walls erected between barriers.“Is (Narendra) Modi ji planning to start a war with the farmers of our country? He should be reminded that they are our own countrymen who are fighting for their rights. If Modi ji is so keen on showing his strength, then he must question China for all its wrongdoings against our country,” Malik, the Maharashtra minority affairs minister, said in a tweet on Tuesday.“The people will not accept the idea of suppression of the farmers’ agitation through these means. The Central government should stop using the policy of General Reginald Dyer [who was behind the Jallianwala Bagh massacre],” Malik alleged in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farmers-protest-ncp-slams-centre-over-multi-layered-barricades-at-delhi-border-101612292445911.html

Thackeray was addressing hoteliers from the city. “We will be restarting the 24X7 concept after Covid-19. We want to make Mumbai a major tourist destination so that visitors can extend their stay by a day or two,” said Thackeray. The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), an association of hoteliers, called it a positive move which will add substantially to the state’s coffers. “We had conducted a study which indicated that if the tourists extend their stay by just one night, the city will get an additional revenue of ₹108 crore daily. This will also boost employment opportunities and give boost to the state exchequer,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, spokesperson of HRAWI.The minister said there are plans to make a vintage car museum in the city. “People go to Nariman Point or Worli Sea Face now to view vintage cars. So a new museum will attract them. We also plan to create an aquarium in Worli as well as start heritage walks in the city. The BMC headquarters tour has already started, and we are also requesting the Bombay high court to allow us to tour on weekends,” he added.Thackeray also said that the hotels will be given the status of an industry from April 1. This will entail them for concessions in electricity and property tax and also make them eligible for government schemes, among other sops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aaditya-thackeray-mumbai-24x7-nightlife-to-resume-after-pandemic-101612292385369.html
03-02-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena MPs meet farmer leader at Ghazipur border to express support||After its half-hearted show of solidarity with the farmers who had marched into Mumbai last week, the Shiv Sena came out in full support of the agitation on Tuesday. Sena members of Parliament (MPs), led by senior party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut, met farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, who has been at the forefront of the protest against the Centre’s three farm laws, at the Ghazipur border between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.Raut, along with MPs Arvind Sawant, Vinayak Raut, Rajan Vichare and Anil Desai, met Tikait and other farmers at the border and express solidarity with them. “We met Tikait saheb and gave Uddhavji’s message to him and expressed solidarity. This is not an issue of one state, but of the country’s farmers. The government should speak to farmers in a proper way. There should not be any politics in talks. Ego will not help run the country,” said Raut after the meeting.The Sena also launched an attack on the Centre over the barricading and fortification of Ghazipur border and said that had the Union government done this at the Indo-China border, the Chinese troops would not have infiltrated eastern Ladakh.Sena leader and Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray asked if the Ghazipur border was that of the state’s, or the country’s. “The pictures of walls being built and barricades being erected [at the Delhi border] that I’m seeing through media and on Twitter seem like they are at the country’s border against its enemies. Farmers, who feed the country, are being named terrorists and given such treatment is unfortunate. Whatever we do must happen with consent and dialogue with all,” Aaditya told media persons in Mumbai.The Centre ordered that the Ghazipur border be sealed with barbed wire, concrete blocks and police barricades. Commenting on what many have considered an extreme measure, Anil Desai said, “Looking at this, it seems like it is some other country beyond the barricade. These are extremely unfortunate scenes, which would shame any nation. If protesting farmers, the annadata, are being blocked with barbed wire, then the common man can clearly see in which direction this country is headed.” Former Union minister Sawant added, “We would have been happy if these barricades and barbed wire were installed at India’s borders with Pakistan and China rather than state borders to prevent farmers from entering Delhi.”Despite being critical of the BJP-led Central government’s farm laws, Sena’s prominent leaders stayed away from the public meeting of farmers held at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan last week. Instead, the party sent a youth wing leader as its representative. The party was questioned and criticised for the move. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra Congress president, minister Balasaheb Thorat and other members of their parties were present at the Azad Maidan event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-mps-meet-farmer-leader-at-ghazipur-border-to-express-support-101612292325499.html
03-02-2021||Mumbai||Tourism, hospitality sectors neglected in Union Budget: Travel federation||The travel industry, disappointed after the budget announcement on February 1, said the government has completely neglected travel, tourism and hospitality sectors that need an urgent boost for revival.Tourism has been one of the most severely affected industries due the Covid-19 pandemic leading to lockdown. The industry continues to struggle as international borders remain shut and domestic travel is yet to benefit the travel companies that are running into losses. Apart from this, many travel companies have had to close down their business last year.Subhash Goyal, general secretary of Federation of Associations in Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH), said the budget was a good opportunity for the government to revive the tourism industry and save around 30,000- 40,000 jobs that are on the verge of extinction. According to Goyal, 75 million people are directly and indirectly employed in the tourism industry.Goyal, however, added, “There are a few good things (in the budget) which may indirectly help the tourism industry, like more tourist coaches and trains in the railways. Rupees 35,000 crore on vaccines and medical infrastructure will indirectly boost medical tourism. Rupees 15,700 crore for the ministry of micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) may help a few small operators indirectly too.”The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) said the budget has focused more on spending to enable economic growth through infrastructure roads and financial remedies.“It is inappropriate on the part of the finance minister to completely ignore travel, tourism and the hospitality business during the budget, said Jay Bhatia, vice president, TAAI.Bhatia added that TAAI had proposed single employee benefits under one provision which cares for labour welfare, social security, health, safety, family, etc.“We are happy to note prima facie that with the implementation of the four labour codes, for the first time globally, social security benefits will extend to gig and platform workers. Minimum wages will apply to all categories of workers, and they will all be covered by the employees’ state insurance corporation. Women will be allowed to work in all categories and also in the night-shifts with adequate protection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tourism-hospitality-sectors-neglected-in-union-budget-travel-federation-101612291965878.html
03-02-2021||Mumbai||Law on ballot paper: Speaker tells Maharashtra to mull possibility||The Maharashtra government may propose a law to have ballot paper as an option for voters during local body and state Assembly elections. Assembly speaker Nana Patole on Tuesday directed the law and judiciary department to examine and prepare a draft law. Patole insisted under article 328 of the Constitution, the state legislature has powers to bring such laws. The initiative taken by Patole does not have support of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition partners, as of now. Legislative experts said the state would not be able to do so in case of Assembly elections as they are held by the ECI under a Central law. They are divided over such a possibility in case of municipal bodies and district councils. A senior Shiv Sena minister said the MVA parties —Sena, NCP and Congress — have not discussed any such move yet. “We are not aware of the move. It is possible that the Speaker has taken the initiative on his own. We will react when any such proposal is put forth before the three parties formally,” he said, seeking anonymity as he did not want to remark on Patole’s (who belongs to the Congress) move publicly. “We don’t know if it is legally feasible. As such we will have to hold extensive consultations with constitutional experts before moving any bill in the legislature,”he said and added that Patole should not have gone public with his proposal at an early stage. “I have directed the law and judiciary department to prepare a draft for an amendment in the existing laws to give the people an alternative of using ballot paper for voting. People have doubts over the EVM and want the old system of ballot to be brought back. Article 328 of the Indian Constitution empowers the state legislature to make provisions with respect to the elections,” Patole told HT.Patole was recently approached by Nagpur resident Pradip Uke, requesting him to bring the ballot-paper system back for voting. The petition was discussed in a meeting called by Patole on Tuesday. State legislature secretary Rajendra Bhagwat, chief electoral officer Baldev Singh and secretary in law and judiciary department Bhupendra Gurav attended the meeting along with other senior officials.“Public sentiment must be respected. As such, I have issued the directives,” added Patole. Bringing back the ballot paper voting system is a popular demand raised by most opposition parties time and again as they suspect manipulation. However, the ECI has been insisting that EVM is a fool-proof system.While Patole is insisting the state government and state legislature have powers to make legal provisions to ensure ballot-paper voting in elections related to the state, state officials dealing with legislative affairs are not sure about the same. They feel that a provision for ballot paper voting might be done for local polls but difficult for assembly elections which are held by ECI. Article 328 of the Constitution states: Power of Legislature of a State to make provision with respect to elections to such Legislature subject to the provisions of this Constitution and in so far as provision in that behalf is not made by Parliament, the Legislature of a State may from time to time by law make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, the elections to the House or either house of the Legislature of the State including the preparation of electoral rolls and all other matters necessary for securing the due constitution of such House or Houses.Officials from the state election commission (SEC) that conducts local elections (gram panchyat, zilla parishad or district council and municipal bodies) in the state said that the amendment in the laws related to local body elections can be made but not for state Assembly elections as it is conducted under the Representation of People Act, 1951 which is a central law.“We conduct local bodies’ election under four different laws, each for municipal corporations, zilla parishads, village (gram) panchayat etc. and all the above laws have a provision for conducting elections through EVM. Theoretically, they can be amended for use of ballot paper, but for this the state will have to consult the SEC and the commission will have to make the request officially,” said a senior official from the SEC, requesting anonymity.“However, the state assembly elections are conducted under a central law. It means the state government has no purview to make any amendment related to assembly polls,” the official added. Another official said giving the option of EVM as well as ballot paper to the voters is practically not possible. “The state cannot allow half of the polling through EVM and another half through ballot paper. It is not feasible at all. It can either continue with the existing system of EVM or adopt a ballot paper system,” he said.Former state legislature secretary Anant Kalse said the state has no right to make any such change. “Article 324 of the Indian Constitution empowers the Election Commission of India to conduct all the elections of state legislatures as well as the general elections. The state government cannot do anything in this case. Even in the case of local bodies elections, it may not be possible for the SEC to act contrary to the central law — Representation of People Act, (which has provision for conducting elections through EVM),” Kalse opined.Meanwhile, senior NCP minister Nawab Malik said that the decision has to be taken by all the three parties. He said they don’t have powers to make any changes in respect with Assembly elections, but for local bodies a policy decision can be taken.“It is a policy decision which needs to be discussed among the ruling allies. The state government cannot make any amendment related to state Assembly elections as it is the right of the Parliament, but the election process of the local bodies can be changed, however, for that, we will have to wait for the opinion of the law and judiciary department,” the minority affairs minister said.Senior Congress minister Amit Deshmukh said the speaker asked the officials to examine the merit of the demand made by some sections of the society. “Some sections of the voters demanded to be given a choice on how to vote. They also had some legal inputs and arguments which the Speaker heard and asked the officials to examine the merit in the demand. As part of the government, I can only say that a policy or mechanism regarding conducting the elections will have to be completely transparent and without any doubt,” Deshmukh said, who was also present in the meeting called by the Speaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/law-on-ballot-paper-speaker-tells-maharashtra-to-mull-possibility-101612291786625.html
03-02-2021||Mumbai||Devendra Fadnavis writes to Uddhav Thackeray, seeks action against Sharjeel Usmani||Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has written a letter to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, demanding that a case be registered against former student leader Sharjeel Usmani for his allegedly provocative speech at an Elgaar Parishad event in Pune on January 30. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its frontal organisations have filed complaints against Usmani at various police stations.In the letter to the CM on Tuesday, Fadnavis has questioned the permission given to organise the conclave in the wake of violence witnessed in the past after the first Elgaar Parishad organised in 2017. “Sharjeel’s provocative speech has proved how permission given to the conclave was wrong. His statements were derogatory to Hindu religion, serious and objectionable, and insulting to community members. The state government should take stern action against him immediately,” Fadnavis said. In his letter, the BJP leader said that it was surprising to see that no action was initiated against a youth leader who came to Maharashtra and defamed Hindutva. “It is a shameful event that leads to tension in the state. The state should immediately book him by lodging a complaint and taking legal action against him,” Fadnavis stated.The Elgaar Parishad was organised in Pune on January 30 by Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyaan on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Rohit Vemula, a Dalit research scholar of the University of Hyderabad, who died by suicide in 2016.On Monday, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said that police were examining the speeches at the conclave and appropriate action would be taken based on the information.Meanwhile, BJP’s Kandivli MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar filed a complaint against Usmani at Dindoshi police station. Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), BJP’s youth wing also filed a complaint against the youth leader at Swargate police station in Pune, and demanded that a first information report (FIR) be registered against Usmani under section 153 (a) (attack on religion, race, group); 295 (a) (malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of a community), and 124 (a) (whoever, by words, signs and visible representation attempts to create contempt towards the government) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/devendra-fadnavis-writes-to-uddhav-thackeray-seeks-action-against-sharjeel-usmani-101612291785334.html
03-02-2021||Other||Day 2 of Mumbai local trains for all sees 3.2 million travellers||Approximately 3.2 million passengers travelled by local trains on Tuesday, which was the second day since suburban train services resumed for the general public after 10 months of lockdown. Since February 1, the general public is allowed on local trains during specified hours. However, commuters have complained that these timings are not convenient and the state government has said it may reconsider the time slots. Guardian minister of Mumbai (suburban) Aaditya Thackeray said the government is maintaining a cautious approach to ensure there is no spike in Covid-19 cases in the city. Local train services for the general public were suspended on March 23,2020, due to the spread of Covid-19 in the city. Train services resumed for frontline and essential workers on July 15, 2020, and on February 1, train services resumed for the general public. On the first day, nearly 3.4 million passengers had travelled by the suburban local train network. On Tuesday, 2 million passengers travelled by local trains on Central Railway (CR) and 1.2 million travelled on Western Railway (WR). No overcrowding was reported on trains, but there were long queues outside booking offices at suburban railway stations. Passengers are allowed on local trains from the start of train services till 7am; between 12pm to 4pm; and post 9pm till the last train service. These time slots are intended to prevent overcrowding in trains, which could lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases. However, commuters have said these timings are not convenient to reach workplaces and consequently, the state should allow travel during peak hours. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The government will definitely consider the inconvenience the commuters are facing due to the staggered timing. We will definitely think over the rescheduling of the permissible timings of the trains. Ultimately, the convenience of the people is key in decision making for any government. My department will move the proposal for rescheduling of timings.” However, guardian minister of Mumbai (suburban) Aaditya Thackeray has adopted a cautious stand. “More than convenience, saving lives is important for the government. We have been opening up activities slowly under Mission Begin Again and fortunately have not been forced to revoke the decisions taken, like seen in some other countries. The pandemic has not ended as yet, and we need to be careful,” he said. Face masks are mandatory for those travelling on local trains. Around 560 people were fined on Tuesday for not wearing face masks on trains. The fine amount is ₹200. On the CR network, 278 passengers were fined Rs55,600 was collected in fines. On the WR network, 282 people were fined and Rs47,900 was collected in fines. Further, 2,104 passengers were found travelling without valid railway tickets on the suburban railway network on Tuesday with 1,700 of them travelling on CR. A total of Rs5.5 lakh was collected as fines from ticketless commuters. At Dadar station alone, 400 ticketless travellers were caught. On WR, 915 passengers were caught travelling without a valid railway ticket and Rs1 lakh was collected in fines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-2-of-mumbai-local-trains-for-all-sees-3-2-million-travellers-101612291727904.html

We will give our vision document for each ward to the citizens,” said Ravi Raja, Congress corporator from Sion and leader of opposition in the BMC.“There is no one particular solution for the problems in the entire city, but it will depend on the area… like dilapidated buildings, road, health, etc,” he added.The Congress said it would involve all its active party workers across the city for the drive.When asked if the programme was being planned too early before the BMC polls, Raja said, “It is nothing like early or late. This outreach programme is aimed at interacting with citizens. The actual manifestation and election campaign will be at a later stage.”The Shiv Sena and the BJP both said their leaders have been in regular touch with the citizens.Senior Sena corporator and former mayor Vishakha Raut said, “We are in regular touch with the citizens for their problems. Unlike the Congress, we are a cadre-based party and are always in touch with the citizens. Also, I think every political party will conduct outreach with citizens before the BMC polls… even Sena will do it.”Vinod Mishra, BJP corporator and party leader in the BMC, said, “We have been doing door-to-door campaigns as part of our programme to collect money for the construction of the Ram temple. During this collection drive, we are also interacting with citizens, and till now we have covered around 30% of the city. Actual activities for the election campaign will also begin in the coming months.”The Congress has maintained that as of now, it is going to fight the BMC elections independently irrespective of it being in alliance with the Shiv Sena and the NCP at the state level.“As of now, Congress is going to fight the BMC elections on its own,” said Raja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2022-bmc-polls-mumbai-congress-to-launch-100-day-programme-from-february-6-101612291545432.html
03-02-2021||Mumbai||TRP scam case: Former BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta denied bail||The Mumbai sessions court, in its January 20 order, has rejected the bail plea of Partho Dasgupta, observing that the former chief executive officer (CEO) of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) appears to be the mastermind of the television rating point (TRP) manipulation scam.The court has also expressed a need for a face-to-face probe into Dasgupta’s WhatsApp chats with channel owners and code language used by him in the exchanges. Dasgupta has now approached the Bombay high court (HC) for bail.The BARC CEO’s lawyer Arjun Thakur had contended that all the accused in the case have been granted bail. Hence, the rule of parity should be applied and Dasgupta should also be given bail.In response to this argument, the court observed: “It is true that 14 accused have been granted bail by the learned additional chief metropolitan magistrate, but the case paper in the present crime reflects that the accused (Dasgupta) is the mastermind of the entire scam and was acting in his capacity as CEO to manipulate the television ratings through mechanical devices.”Thakur, however, said that the lower court had not considered the rule of parity for bail. As far as a further probe or face-to-face investigation is concerned, it can also be done after releasing Dasgupta on bail.The prosecution had relied heavily on the WhatsApp chats between Dasgupta and TV channel owners, which is part of the supplementary charge sheet filed by police. The court, while rejecting the bail, observed that the accused used coded words in their conversations on chat, which only the accused can explain. Hence, the court held that a face-to-face investigation is required in this case.“It appears from the papers put forth before me, that it is not a case of simple manipulation of TRP but more than that. However, before forming any opinion regarding the Whatsapp chats, I am of the opinion that a thorough investigation is required,” read the court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trp-scam-case-former-barc-ceo-partho-dasgupta-denied-bail-101612291365330.html

This is the second fatality due to the collapse. Meanwhile, Narpoli police booked the three owners of the godown and a company that handles its maintenance, for negligence. “Patil was stuck under the debris for around six hours, and both his legs were severely injured. He was rescued alive and rushed to the hospital in Thane. He died during treatment,” said Santosh Kadam, chief, regional disaster management cell, Thane. A representative of Jupiter Hospital said,”Patil was under the rubble for six hours and was brought to the hospital in a state of shock. Despite all resuscitative measures he succumbed to his grievous injuries in the emergency department of Jupiter hospital and the body was sent for post mortem.”Patil worked in the godown along with his elder brother, Ajay, 24. On the day of the collapse, Ajay decided to join in the afternoon shift instead of the morning one. Mother of the deceased, Jaimala Patil, 50, said, “My son suffered a lot till his last breath. My elder son was lucky enough to not go to work that morning. Both my sons joined work at this godown during the lockdown.”Prior to Patil’s death, Saurabh Tripathi, a 33-year-old security guard died on the spot of the incident. On Monday, around 10am, a portion of the ground-plus-one storey godown at Harihar compound in Dapode village, located on Bhiwandi’s Mankoli Road collapsed. The godown housed Shadow Fax Technology Private Limited on the ground floor and Mark Infax company on the first floor.Six people were injured in the incident.

The bank managements or property owners are required to pay 7.5% of the annual rent as property tax but these banks had been deliberately showing a lower amount on the rent deed to save up on tax.The MC has served notices to the defaulters, asking them to pay up the tax along with 100% penalty on the amount evaded. As per information, there are 360 banks in the four MC zones of the city. Out of this, the civic body has scrutinised the tax returns of 225 banks. So far, the MC has caught 28 banks evading tax in Zone-A, 38 banks in Zone B, 17 in Zone C and 12 in Zone D. The MC is expected to recover around ₹2.2 crore from these banks and its property owners. Zone-D superintendent Rajeev Bhardwaj said that notices have been served to the bank authorities and building owners to submit the tax along with penalty or be ready to face action.Zone-C superintendent Vivek Verma said, “After completing the process of scrutinising the rent deeds of banks, we will also be checking the rent deeds of insurance companies being operated from rental properties.”The MC is also serving notices to religious organisations that have set up shops on the boundaries of their premises and given it out on rent. Further, notices are also being served to government departments, including Zila Parishad and bus stand. The MC is struggling to meet the annual recovery target under the head of property tax as the civic body has only recovered around ₹70 crore against the target of ₹130 crore for the financial year 2020-21. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had earlier warned officials of strict departmental action if they failed to achieve the targets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-catches-95-banks-evading-property-tax-imposes-penalty-101612290647864.html

From Thursday, the MC will be facing a herculean task of dealing with over 1, 100 metric tonnes of garbage generated in the city on a daily basis, on its own. During a meeting called by mayor Balkar Sandhu, which was also attended by MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, civic body officials said on Tuesday that it will be a challenge for the MC to take over this task as it does not even have the machinery for lifting garbage from secondary dumping points. The MC will also have to make alternative arrangements for door-to-door lifting of garbage from around 30 wards (out of the total 95 in the city), from where garbage is being partially collected by the company. Civic body will also have to lift garbage from 45 secondary dumping points where household waste is dumped by waste collectors and shift it to the main dump site on Tajpur road. At the main dump site, the MC will have to run the static compactors and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) plant. The A2Z company had in December 2020 served a self-termination notice to the civic body, stating that it will stop lifting of garbage in the city after February 4. The company had entered into a 25-year contract with the MC in 2011 for lifting of garbage in the city. The company officials said that among the main reasons behind serving the self termination notice, is the delay on part of MC in making monthly payment of around ₹1 crore to the company as tipping fee for transportation of garbage to the main dump site. The company officials said that the payment was pending for the last six months when the notice was served to the MC. Also, the MC and Punjab Pollution Control Board are forcing the company to run the RDF plant at full capacity even when the civic body has failed to find a buyer for the RDF, they claimed.The company has claimed ₹47 crore as compensation for investment done in the past. The MC is however expected to challenge the same in the court, said the officials.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “We have been working to find a common ground and a meeting was also conducted with the company officials a few days ago to reach a compromise. But if the company steps back, MC will take up solid waste management in the city as the residents should not face any kind of harassment. We may also enter into ab agreement with some other company or service provider in the sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-a2z-firm-leaves-mc-to-take-over-solid-waste-management-in-ludhiana-101612290646983.html

03-02-2021||Delhi||MCDs did not get grant from Centre due to corruption in Delhi BJP, alleges AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday said the Centre did not give a single penny in the Union Budget 2021-22 to the three cash-strapped Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations in Delhi because it has “lost confidence” in the Delhi BJP and the party’s leaders.Addressing a press conference, senior AAP leader and the party’s MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the Union government has “accepted that the Delhi BJP is completely corrupt”. Pathak said the MCD mayors and Delhi BJP leaders earlier met Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and urged her to release a grant but received nothing.“Yesterday, the BJP government at the Centre left the MCDs high and dry with zero allocation against their demand of Rs.12,000 crores. The employees of the BJP-ruled MCDs, along with the citizens of Delhi, expected that in this budget the BJP government would provide some aid to the MCD. The BJP has been ruling the MCD for the last 15 years and the reason behind no allocation for the MCD is BJP’s own Delhi unit. The saffron party’s central leadership has lost all faith in its Delhi unit,” Pathak said.Also read: AAP criticises ‘meagre’ allocation for Delhi in Union budgetThe Delhi BJP said the AAP is “concocting stories” to divert public attention from the fact that the Delhi government is not paying constitutional funds that constitutionally due to the three MCDs.“Central government gives municipal bodies funds as per Niti Aayog’s recommendations. Also, Delhi does not figure in the list of Union Territories eligible for direct grants to its municipal corporations. This is the reason why the Centre has not given a direct grant to MCDs,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.“It will be better if instead of issuing misleading statements on municipal funds, Pathak asks chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to clear all pending dues of the three MCDs,” Kapoor said.Pathak also alleged that the Centre has reduced allocation for local bodies across India.“Earlier, the Centre used to pay the local bodies on the basis of ₹428 per person of their population. But now, it has come down to ₹206. Gurugram has received ₹200 crores, Ghaziabad received ₹200 crores, Lucknow also got the same amount. Gurugram and Ghaziabad are situated on the borders of Delhi and Lucknow is just around five hours drive from the capital. The BJP government has provided aids to the local bodies of these cities but not to Delhi,” he said.“It is significant that leaders of Delhi BJP and mayors of the MCDs met Sitharaman and minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur to demand grants. But, despite their demands, the BJP-led central government has not provided a single penny to the MCD,” Pathak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mcds-did-not-get-grant-from-centre-due-to-corruption-in-delhi-bjp-alleges-aap-101612289924488.html

It has contended that despite a PCR call from a woman employee of the DJB, who was trapped inside when the attack was happening, a belated FIR was registered by the police on a complaint by the Head constable.The plea had also contended that violence was aggravated owing to the conspicuous inaction on the part of Delhi police “who nonchalantly stood as mute spectators while the riotous mob created havoc and illegally trespassed the Delhi Jal Board Headquarters and woefully ravaged the public property of the DJB.Around 200 to 250 BJP workers had allegedly vandalised the DJB headquarters in broad daylight, the plea said.Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Our protest was peaceful. As we entered the DJB office to try meet CEO of the board, some Aam Aadmi Party volunteers infiltrated and it were they who indulged in violence. It is really shocking to see the reaction of AAP leaders of approaching a city court to get FIR registered as this party owes its birth to agitational politics and here we find AAP leaders trying to threaten Delhi BJP to take back its agitation against financial irregularities in DJB or face manipulated FIRs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-asks-police-to-file-report-in-vandalism-at-djboffice-101612289864405.html

With Metro operations shut for 169 days following the nationwide lockdown announced by the Centre in March last year due to the pandemic, DMRC’s revenue has shrunk drastically.Also read: Maximum temperature rises up to 28.1°C, rains likely, says IMDOn January 14, Delhi Metro chief Mangu Singh wrote to Union housing and urban affairs ministry and state governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to release funds for them at the earliest.

This is just 50% of the operational losses incurred by the Metro in the financial year 2020-21.While the Centre and Delhi government are to share the operational losses equally for Phase I and II corridors, for Phase III, the Delhi government is mandated to pay entirely for the operational losses.While requesting the Centre and state governments to release the funds at the earliest, Singh wrote, “…DMRC is facing an unprecedented financial crunch making it difficult to even meet day-to-day expenses.”A senior Central government official said, “The matter was referred to our integrated finance division for consideration. The division has certain observations and has also asked for an audited amount. The matter has been referred back to DMRC.”Prodded about the same, DMRC officials didn’t comment on the issue.While officials with Haryana government’s town and country planning department said that they are examining the matter, the Delhi government didn’t respond to HT’s query.No one from the UP government could be reached for a comment.The total loss for the financial year 20-21 is estimated to be ₹2,856 crore. With its operations closed for 169 days, the DMRC incurred losses close to ₹1,700 crore during that period. Its revenue from other sources, such as property development, also dropped due to the pandemic.Revenue from tickets is one of the main sources of funds for Delhi Metro. That revenue too has dropped , as DMRC has been running its services at only 50% capacity due to the Covid-19 restrictions.(With inputs from Hitender Rao)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dmrc-asks-centre-states-to-covid-induced-losses-101612289744499.html

The police said they have also got “clear photographs” of 12 men allegedly involved in the January 26 violence from video footage available with them. The video grabs of the 12 suspects were circulated on social media on Tuesday, but the police said they have not officially released them yet.Also read: Journalist Mandeep Puniya arrested at Singhu protest site gets bailA total of 44 cases have been registered in connection with the violence at Red Fort and other places in Delhi during the tractor rally on January 26 and also in connection with an incident on January 29 when a group of persons, claiming to be locals, entered the protest site at Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police.Police said in all, they have arrested 123 people, including protester Akash Preet Singh whose arrest details were shared on Monday, and apprehended two minor boys. The total number of police personnel injured in the two incidents of violence is 510. A day after the January 26 violence, the city police had said 394 police personnel were injured, during clashes. At least 10 farmers have also sustained injuries.The crime branch, which was already investigating 10 cases related to the January 26 violence, has now been given four more cases (from the 44) for investigation. Of the four cases, one pertains to the FIR filed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), in connection with the vandalism at the iconic Red Fort. This is the second FIR in the violence at the historic monument; the first one was filed by the police themselves. The other three FIRs transferred to the crime branch were registered at the Nangloi police station, police officers privy to the development said.One of the officers, who did not want to be named, said 14 tractors were seized from different places in the city, where the violence had occurred on January 26.“The seizures were made after video footages pertaining to the violence confirmed that they were involved in the vandalism and violence. The owners of these tractors have been served notices, asking them to join the investigation and record their statement,” the officer said.Asked about the 80 or more tractors that have been identified but are yet to be seized, the officer said these were identified with the help of the video footage and photographs available with the police and those shared by the public.Also read: Centre defends police use of tear gas on protesters“A majority of these tractors are from Punjab and Haryana.

All these measures are in addition to the deployment of DTC buses and extra personnel. The new security measures have attracted sharp criticism from protesting farmers, civil society as well as politicians.Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava on Tuesday defended the measures and said the force had “strengthened” the barricading so that it is not broken again. Addressing the media outside DCP Outer’s office in Pitampura, Shrivastava said he was “surprised” that nobody had raised questions when protesters had attacked policemen.“I am surprised that when tractors were used on January 26 to attack policemen and barricades were broken, no questions were raised. Why were no questions raised at that time? What have we done now? We have just strengthened the barricades so that it could not be broken again,” he said.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/14-tractors-seized-for-r-day-violence-80-more-identified-have-clear-photos-of-12-vandals-say-delhi-police-101612289685066.html

On Monday, photographs of a group of police personnel carrying metal batons and arm guards in east Delhi’s Shahdara were widely circulated on social media, prompting criticisms against the Delhi Police for resorting to the use of metal batons against farmers who are protesting at the city borders against the three contentious farm laws.Apart from photographs of metal baton-wielding personnel, pictures of policemen drilling iron nails on to the roads and heavily barricading them -- reportedly to stop farmers from driving their tractors into the national capital -- were also widely circulated.Also read: Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districtsCurrently, police use canes, water cannons and tear gas shells for riot control and metal batons have not been a part of their riot gear.Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar said they got the batons on an experimental basis to counter rioters who may be armed with swords. The usage of improvised metal batons was a “defensive mechanism and not an aggressive one”, he insisted.“Everyone has seen the violence during the tractor rally on January 26; barricades were broken, agreed upon route was not followed, rally began before the scheduled time and tractors were used as weapon against police personnel,” Kumar told ANI.“There is no official order for its usage, and it was being used on an experimental basis,” he said.Officers aware of the matter said so far, only 10 to 15 policemen were given the improvised batons. The decision to use such batons did not come from the police headquarters, senior officers said.“It’s a makeshift arrangement to minimise injury in case a policeman is attacked by rioters armed with swords. This new baton will help stop the blow of a sword and prevent the personnel from sustaining grievous injury,” said an officer, who wished not to be named.Last week, a police inspector was injured after he was allegedly struck by a sword by one of the farmers camping at Singhu border after clashes broke out between farmers and a group of about 200 men, who claiming to be locals tried to disband tents put up by farmers. Also, during the Republic Day violence, many protesters who took to the streets were seen wielding swords.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/metal-batons-just-an-experiment-say-delhi-police-after-pictures-go-viral-101612289625008.html

Hence, there is no possibility that the accused/ applicant can be able to influence any of the police officials.”Also read: Rakesh Tikait coins new slogan at Ghazipur protest sitePuniya was barred from leaving the country without informing the court.The journalist was arrested on the grounds of misbehaving with the police personnel on duty and obstructing a public servant from discharging its duties during the farmers protest at the Singhu border. He was arrested while covering the clashes that broke out at the protest site last week.The police opposed the bail plea, stating that Puniya was concealing his identity and misleading them. The police alleged that the accused was trying to incite the protesters at the Singhu border by shouting slogans and he even “clung” to one of the policemen on duty and dragged him.The Editors Guild of India on Monday had demanded the release of the journalist. The guild claimed that the arrest was an attempt to curtail the voice of independent journalists who were fighting fake news.In a separate matter, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea which sought immediate release of protesters, not limited to farmers, from the alleged “illegal detention” of police since January 26 in connection with the violence during the tractor rally on Republic Day.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh came down heavily on the counsel for the petitioner and said that it was nothing more than a “Publicity Interest Litigation” and not “Public Interest Litigation. It also said that the protestors cannot be released without investigation and going in the merits of the case.It directed Delhi Police to complete the investigation of the cases in a time bound manner and produce the detainees before a magistrate within 24 hours in accordance with law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/journalist-arrested-at-singhu-protest-site-gets-bail-101612289504424.html

The ASI-protected monument has also been declared an “infected zone”.“As per order received from the district magistrate (central)-cum- district disaster management authority, and in continuation to previous office orders of this office, it is hereby directed that the Red Fort, Delhi, shall remain closed to public and general visitors until further order as a measure to control the spread of avian influenza in the Red Fort area which is declared as (an) infected zone,” said the order issued on Monday, a copy of which HT has seen.At least 15 carcasses of crows were found on the Red Fort premises in early January and some of them were sent to a laboratory in Punjab for tests. On January 19, one sample tested positive for the H5N1 virus that causes the avian influenza, following which the ASI shut the monument till January 26, and later extended the closure till January 31, officials said.Also read: 96 more birds found dead in MaharashtraMonday’s order of the ASI essentially stretches the closure of the monument for an indefinite period of time.The historic site had witnessed violence on January 26 when hundreds of farmers, who were participating in a tractor rally -- part of the larger ongoing protest against the three contentious farm laws – stormed the Red Fort, and raised a religious flag alongside a farmer union flag and clashed with the police.The report on the samples taken Red Fort had come just three days after an owl, found dead in the Delhi zoo, had tested positive for the bird flu.Earlier in January, crows in at least three other locations in the city and ducks at Sanjay Lake in east Delhi were found infected, following which the government closed Delhi’s only wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur for 10 days. In the days that followed, multiple agencies had imposed temporary restrictions on poultry trade, transport of fowls and their serving in restaurants. The restrictions were lifted on January 14 after the government vouched that the poultry birds in Delhi were not infected with the H5N1 virus.Currently, there is no restriction on poultry within the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/red-fort-shut-indefinitely-to-prevent-spread-of-bird-flu-101612289504960.html

The blast came on the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Israel on January 29, 1992.People familiar with the development said the central anti-terror probe agency will form a special team to investigate the case. NIA sleuths will also coordinate with Israeli agencies, including Mossad, to get inputs on the outfit behind the attack, which has been termed as a terrorist act. The agency has registered a case and is getting documents from Delhi Police Special Cell.Also read: Avoid travel in Myanmar, says Indian Embassy in advisory after military coup“Initial assessment has pointed out to the role of Iranian suspects, which will be the focus of our investigation among other angles,” said a senior NIA officer, requesting anonymity.A home ministry official said, “The case file and evidence gathered by the Delhi Police’s Special Cell so far including the sample of the explosives used, CCTV footage and a letter recovered from the blast site will be handed over to the central agency.”Over the last few days, Delhi Police and NIA investigators, who were informally associated with the probe till now, have collected information about certain social media channels, including a Telegram entity which had claimed responsibility for the blast on behalf of a group called “Jaish ul Hind”, an investigator said.Experts are also trying to locate the people who placed the bomb and a letter near the pavement, few metres away from the Israeli embassy. The letter swore revenge for the killing of Iran Quds Commander Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mehdhi Al Muhandis, who were killed in a US drone attack in January 2020, and Iranian nuclear physicist Dr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who died in a car bomb attack in Iran in November 2020.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assured his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu of punishing the perpetrators of the blast. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the two leaders spoke on phone and PM Modi told Netanyahu that India gives high importance to the safety and security of Israeli diplomats and embassy.No injuries were reported in the incident except window panes of three cars parked in the vicinity of the embassy on Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road were shattered.After the incident, external affairs minister S Jaishankar assured the Israeli foreign minister of “fullest protection” to their diplomats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-hands-over-probe-in-blast-near-israeli-embassy-to-nia-101612289445041.html

The young animal required immediate medical intervention and was rushed for treatment to the Wildlife SOS Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar,” said Yogesh Ghodake, range forest officer, Otur, adding, “The jackal was weak and exhausted when we found her. Otur range is home to a significant jackal population.” Golden Jackals, native to the Indian subcontinent, play a very important role in forest ecology. “They are omnivorous in nature and feed on a variety of small mammals, birds, fish, hares and even fruits. Unfortunately, the animal is frequent victim of hunting, wildlife trafficking, man-animal conflict and highway accidents. This species is protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 and has an estimated population of 80,000 in the wild,” he said. Preliminary examination by Wildlife SOS veterinary officer Dr Nikhil Bangar revealed that the jackal was suffering from a stomach infection. After a few days of intensive care and treatment, the jackal showed signs of improvement and a final examination deemed her fit for release. Dr Bangar said, “The jackal was suffering from a stomach infection that led to diarrhoea and severe dehydration. We administered antibiotics and placed the animal under fluid therapy to ensure steady recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/3yrold-female-jackal-rescued-and-released-in-otur-101612275104661.html

The brainchild of noted humourist Pu La Deshpande, the auditorium has become a hub of the city’s cultural activity. It is a popular venue for cultural events, plays and art exhibitions. The hall has staged numerous functions and plays since it was inaugurated in 1968.Eight architectural firms in raceAccording to PMC officials, 56 architects and designers had shown interest in rebuilding the auditorium. The civic body received designs from 26 firms and eight were selected for final presentation. PMC had announced a budgetary provision of ₹10 crore for the redevelopment of the auditorium in 2018. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol formed a committee comprising experts to look into the issue after artist groups raised objection to the demolition of the historic auditorium. Plan to be finalised soon Mohol said, “We are going through the design plans received from architects. The final plan will be presented before the expert committee soon. We will work on the project in phase-wise manner. After presenting the plan before committee, we will put it up on social media. All stakeholders, including committee members and Balgandharva’s family members, will be shown the proposed plan.” Waiting for PMC’s callVirendra Chitrav, one of the committee members, said, “PMC has not approached any committee member since the last one year. In the second meeting, the committee received a suggestion and basic plan of the auditorium. Plan was based on renovation of existing structures, demolition of few structures and construction of new ones. Firms gave an estimated ranging from ₹20 crore to ₹120 crore. The committee could not come to a conclusion to demolish or alter. Members favoured renovation. However, there was one suggestion that that if the existing structure is unable to sustain for renovation. Then, go ahead for new construction.”Structural audit completedShivaji Lanke, superintendent engineer of building (construction) department said, “We have kept ₹10 crore as budgetary provision for the revamp plan. The structural audit of the building has been completed.

03-02-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: “Stonehenges” of Pune and Megalithic Man||So, do you think aliens ever landed earth? Were the gigantic pyramids, the mysterious crop circles, Inca civilisation, the giant statues of Ester and formidable looking Stonehenge of England created by them?There are numerous such architectural marvels scattered across the earth which leave you wondering about who might have created them and how! In absence of modern technology, it is almost impossible to believe that they might be product of human endeavour. And yet, as we dig deeper (literally) with archaeologists’ help, we can find some clues to reveal the astonishing answers to our mystical pasts. Stonehenge in England is one such fascinating monument comprising 13 giant stones (13 ft high, 7 ft wide) standing in a circle, essentially, representing the burial grounds from Neolithic and Bronze ages of civilisation. All that is indeed wonderful, but what does it has to do with our Pune story? Did you know what Pune and Stonehenge mega stone circle burial grounds at England have in common? Proto historic Pune folks were not very behind in raising giant projects and have left marks of similar Stonehenge of Pune in the suburb of Bhosari. When British authors of Gazetteer of Bombay presidency wrote about history of Pune in 1885, they were unaware of enigmatic humans as well as their remains in the vicinity of Pune. But, as we have seen in past articles, the scholars of Deccan College, including Dr Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia, were not a passive lot and proactively hunted in the environs of Pune for clues to past inhabitants. As the local memory serves, Bhosari is an old settlement known as Bhojpur and had a fortification enclosure called “Kot”. In the old village, the medieval remains were scattered in the forms of Mahadev shrine, Khandoba temple with enclosure, and shrine of folk gods such as Chedoba, Munjaba, Babpuji Buwa along with some herostones. Amongst these medieval remains, Dr Sankalia and his team in 1939 found traces of stone structures which went back many centuries ago. In proto-historic period, one comes across the structures made of colossal undressed stones, either arranged in a circle called “stone circle”, or an erect, roughly tall triangular flat slab called “Menhirs” standing out prominently. Sometimes, the large three or four stones are arranged at right angles and covered with capping stone called a “Dolmen”. None of these stones show any chisel marks or have cementing material and one wonders how they were moved to particular place and installed in particular manner. These structures mark the proto-historic burial grounds of humans who were aptly referred to as “Megalithic” (of Big Stones). Till recently, not many habitation sites of these humans have been reported by archaeologists and such prominent burial grounds have been largely reported from Vidarbha region and southern Deccan. So, finding evidence of Megalithic man near Pune was indeed a significant discovery. Based on the black and red pottery found in excavation of such burial grounds, archaeologists have dated these cultures to Iron Age of India dating roughly to 1000 BCE. The Vidarbha region excavations such as Mahurjhari have reported good amount of iron tools, jewellery, and the remains of humans and horse buried commemorating the dead. This elaborate burial practices indicate that the Megalithic man believed in life after dead and hence, packed goods and vehicle for the journey of departed souls. At Bhosari, three “Menhirs” of height 4’8” ft, 8’8”ft and two 6’4” were seen near Bapuji Buwa shrine, Chavadi area and Bhairoba shrine, respectively. Two stone circles were reported from Kot area and Kanhoba shrine. Numbers of “Dolmens” were reported in the form of the enclosure of Chedoba and Mhasoba shrine where present day communities have established shrines by placing aniconic symbols. Unfortunately, no burial remains or significant pottery has been reported.Overall, the entire area seemed to be proto-historic burial ground and the tradition of burial continued till the time of investigation as Mahar community was seen practicing burials. But, Mahars did not erect the huge stones to mark the site as seen above.It is thus interesting to see that in the time when most Hindu communities practice cremation, it is unusual to find burial grounds except for certain communities such as Mahars, Jangam, etc. It was also fascinating to note that many nomadic communities such as Lamani and Dhangars visit these shrines annually and offer worship. This practice may signify some important ties between Megalithic humans and present nomads. Of course, erosion of tradition and loss of the material evidence on ground has made it difficult for us to trace the continuity of such practices. Some communities in modern period also followed the custom blindly and had erected a “modern dolmen-like” structure to carry the resemblance with Megalithic structures forward without knowing their true nature. Dr MK Dhavalikar has known to excavate a stone circle yielding Chalcolithic potsherds at Pimpalsuti in Shirur, Pune marking another Megalithic site. Similarly, due to resemblance in form, Dr DD Kosambi had indicated that the Vetal of Vetal hill in midst of Pune city may be originally a stone circle belonging to the same period. He claimed that Mhatoba and Vetal lie on tracks which yield microliths and were frequented by nomadic communities too and served as pre-historic cult sites. Thus, he also suggested that the place might have served as ancient necropolis or burial ground. He had reported some interesting rock engravings at Vetal hill as Megalithic engraving which were later examined by Deccan college archaeologist and geologists to reveal that majority of them are result of natural erosions. Some which may be made by man could not be dated for lack of context. And yet, it is intriguing to note that Dhangars do pass though this area and venerate the Mhatoba and stone circle like formations as Vetal, even today!Today, the growing suburb of Bhosari has engulfed most of these remains, including the stone circles and few obscurely survive hidden in narrow lanes. The big stone circle was lost to expansion of Pune-Nasik highway. But thanks to efforts of Dr Sankalia and the communities who still keep the place alive through their veneration, we can witness the fascinating human endeavours of Megalithic Man of Pune!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/stonehenges-of-pune-and-megalithic-man-101612268973361.html

The operational work of the census had begun last year before it was disrupted after a few months due to the Covid pandemic. The census aims to estimate the population of leopards in four talukas — Junnar, Shirur, Ambegaon and Khed — under the Junnar forest division. The findings from the project will provide details about the animal’s number and their migratory and movement patterns in agriculture and residential areas. The project is funded by Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), the national advisory council under the chairmanship of ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEF&CC). Wildlife expert and conservation biologist Bilal Habib is the principal investigator of the census project. According to forest officials, river belts and sugarcane areas are hotspots in terms of the predominance of leopards and incidents of human-animal conflict. “Otur, Manchar-Shirur border, Shirur taluka’s northern and southern parts are the hotspots. We analysed data of almost 20 years and identified some new hotspots. Khed taluka has not reported any case related to leopards in the recent past. The census will help check the rising cases of human-animal conflict,” said Jayaramegowda R, deputy conservator of forests (territorial), Junnar division, Pune circle. Forest officials said that leopard census will help devise strategy to reduce conflicts and maintain human-animal coexistence. “As we are yet to know the exact number of leopards in the division, four talukas have been picked for the census. Though their number has been counted in protected areas such as national parks or wildlife sanctuaries, area census is not done. This is the first attempt,” said Jayaramegowda. The project is expected to be completed in four years. Junnar forest division has got the permission from authorities to radio-caller leopards to study their movements and activities. Some leopards have already been radio-collared. The paw count Of the 5,826 sq km geographical area in Junnar forest division, 591.89 sq km is under forest cover. The area contains four talukas — Junnar, Shirur, Ambegaon and Khed — in Pune district The project is funded by Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) 50 sq km: Area of each site to be covered under the division 100 trap cameras: Installed at each site Every month: Period of data collection by cameras at each site Every week: Period of data collected at each site will be analysed Four years: Expected period of completion of the census project||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/junnar-forest-division-resumes-first-leopard-census-project-101612266453129.html
03-02-2021||World||UN climate chief urges world 'in a tough spot' to keep fighting warming||Like the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change is a problem countries must work together to address or "all nations will feel the reverberations", the United Nations' climate chief warned on Wednesday.The new coronavirus has ignored national borders and "climate change respects them even less", Patricia Espinosa said in an online lecture for the London School of Economics (LSE)."Many places that thought they would be completely free of the effects of climate change ... are already feeling it," said Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.But rising national isolationism, including in the face of the pandemic, is making vital global cooperation harder, she said.Dealing simultaneously with the "twin crises" of coronavirus and climate change can feel overwhelming and "almost impossible" for many people and leaders, she conceded."There is no doubt we are all in a tough spot right now," she said.But Espinosa, who in recent years underwent treatment for advanced breast cancer, said she understood that even seemingly insurmountable challenges could be overcome if "you do a little bit every day and eventually you get to the other side".So far, growing firsthand experience of a warming climate has not translated into fast enough action to deal with more extreme weather and rising seas, nor into promised funds to help poorer nations grow cleanly and adapt to rising risks, she said.Wealthier countries are lagging on a promise to raise $100 billion a year from 2020 to drive a shift to green energy and build resilience in vulnerable nations, the climate chief said.That is particularly frustrating when that commitment is just a small share of the trillions needed to shift the world onto a sustainable path - and as governments simultaneously raise huge amounts to deal with the pandemic, she added."With Covid spending, it's hard to explain why $100 billion hasn't come together," Espinosa said. By raising that climate cash, rich countries "are really serving their own purposes".If emissions continue to rise in the developing world and a green transformation does not happen, then all the efforts made to reduce greenhouse gases in richer countries "will be negatively affected", she warned.Countries hit by virus-driven economic slowdown could make limited budgets do double duty by ensuring stimulus spending drives a global transition to clean energy and more resilience, she said.However, only a fraction of an estimated $13 trillion being poured into the world's economies was earmarked for green aims by the end of 2020, according to research by think-tanks Vivid Economics and Finance for Biodiversity.Among wealthier G20 countries, 15 out of 20 had announced stimulus packages that would have a net negative impact on the environment, the think-tanks said in a December report.But Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the LSE, said a surge in pledges to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century was accelerating green investment, including by business."This is the growth story of the 21st century - the drive to net-zero," the noted economist told the event."It is remarkable how fast people are moving," Stern said, but warned less than a decade remained to make the fundamental shifts in the global economy needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change."This decade, until 2030, will be absolutely decisive for our future," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-climate-chief-urges-world-in-a-tough-spot-to-keep-fighting-warming-101612376697183.html

03-02-2021||World||US plans record debt sale; no big changes before new stimulus||The US Treasury held steady its planned issuance of longer-dated securities at a quarterly debt auction next week as the department awaits the result of the Biden administration’s push for a fresh coronavirus relief package.The Treasury already boosted its so-called quarterly refundings in each of the last three quarters, and its stockpile of cash remains near an all-time high. With the outcome of President Joe Biden’s push for a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill uncertain, the department held off on tweaking its issuance of longer-dated securities.Officials followed through on plans detailed in November to lift auctions of inflation-linked securities this year. The Treasury also said it will reduce bill issuance, which surged as it rushed to fund pandemic-related spending. The aim now is to bring the share of bills in the nation’s debt back toward historic norms.The Treasury will sell $126 billion in long-term debt next week, broken down as follows:The debt management team also said it won’t be expanding sales of any other tenors of nominal coupon-bearing debt over the quarter. Officials didn’t specify the amount by which bill supply will fall over the period. In August, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee recommended allowing the share of T-bills to fall gradually to a range of 15% to 20% of outstanding debt -- compared with nearly 24% now.The majority of Wall Street bond dealers had predicted the Treasury would make no changes to nominal coupon-bearing debt auctions. Yet, given the reprieve from the onslaught of ever increasing long-term debt supply, the yield curve did flatten slightly after the announcement. The gap between five- and 30-year yields narrowed briefly, before widening back toward the widest since 2016.The Treasury pushed forward with the initiative it started in January to increase sales of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities compared with last year’s auction sizes:The department held off on making a decision on debt linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the heir presumptive to Libor as a benchmark for short-term dollar lending rates. The government has been analyzing the idea for months, and said Wednesday it “continues to actively explore the possibility” of SOFR-linked issuance.Meantime, the Treasury is following through on expanded floating-rate note sales, after boosting its new-issue FRN last month by $2 billion. The reopenings planned for February and March will also rise by $2 billion each, bringing them to $26 billion per auction. No other FRN changes were announced.On Monday, the Treasury as part of its quarterly borrowing estimates said it would reduce its cash balance to $800 billion by the end of March and to $500 billion by June, from about $1.6 trillion now.The Treasury in 2015 instituted a policy of keeping the equivalent of at least five days’ worth of expenditures, or a minimum of $150 billion, in the cash account in case unexpected disruptions locked it out of debt markets. Before that, the Treasury kept enough cash for just two days. As budget deficits had begun to soar even prior to the pandemic, so has the size of the cash buffer.Brian Smith, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, told reporters Wednesday that the 2015 cash-balance policy “still holds.”“We are still looking to make sure we can meet any outflows in the case of a market disruption -- generally targeting a week of outflows,” Smith told reporters. “It’s really the size of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 outbreak that has changed the situation” for now.That cash balance will be drawn down over coming months in part by trimming bill issuance. The Treasury said it’s modifying the “cadence” of its shortest-dated securities, called cash management bills, or CMBs.Cutting the cash balance also gets the government ready for the risk of a protracted battle over the debt limit, with the current suspension set to expire at the end of July. By law, the Treasury has to shrink its cash to the level when the suspension was put in place, back in 2019.“The debt ceiling looms large,” Zachary Griffiths, a rates strategist at Wells Fargo wrote in a note with his colleagues on Wednesday. Getting the cash balance down to the mandated level of roughly $120 billion “will be particularly challenging,” the group wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plans-record-debt-sale-no-big-changes-before-new-stimulus-101612368332254.html
03-02-2021||World||UN court says it can hear case brought by Iran against US||The United Nations' highest court ruled Wednesday that it can hear a case brought by Iran against the United States in a bid to end sanctions the Trump administration re-imposed in 2018 after pulling out of an international deal aimed at curtailing Tehran's nuclear program.Lawyers for the United States argued at hearings last year that the case should be thrown out by the International Court of Justice for lack of jurisdiction and admissibility.However, the court's president, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, said that judges rejected U.S. arguments.Iran filed the case in July 2018 a few months after then-President Donald Trump said he was pulling the U.S. out of a 2015 international agreement over Iran’s nuclear program and would re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Washington also threatened other countries with sanctions if they don’t cut off Iranian oil imports by early November.In its case, Iran alleges that the sanctions breach a 1955 bilateral agreement known as the Treaty of Amity that regulates and promotes economic and consular ties between the two countries.The ruling Wednesday comes as new President Joe Biden is seeking to enhance diplomacy toward Iran while Washington looks at restoring constraints on the country’s nuclear program and reining in its regional ambitions.Secretary of State Antony Blinken appointed a new special envoy for Iran on Friday as Biden’s national security adviser said that restoring limits on the Iranian nuclear program is a top administration priority.The court based in The Hague had ruled in favor of Iran at an earlier stage, saying in a preliminary ruling in October 2018, that Washington should “remove, by means of its choosing, any impediments arising from” the re-imposition of sanctions to the export to Iran of medicine and medical devices, food and agricultural commodities and spare parts and equipment necessary to ensure the safety of civil aviation.The Trump administration responded by pulling out of the treaty.“The Iranians have been ignoring it for an awfully long time, we ought to have pulled out of it decades ago,” then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the State Department at the time.Now that the court has ruled it can hear the case, it will likely take years to reach a conclusion. Rulings by the world court, which settles disputes between nations, are final and legally binding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-court-says-it-can-hear-case-brought-by-iran-against-us-101612365320111.html
03-02-2021||World||World Economic Forum again delays annual meeting in Singapore||The World Economic Forum has again pushed back its 2021 annual meeting in Singapore, rescheduling it for August from May given what it called "challenges in containing the pandemic".The Geneva-based WEF, which last month delayed the event by 12 days in May, said on Wednesday it would now be held from Aug. 17-20."Although the World Economic Forum and Government of Singapore remain confident of the measures in place to ensure a safe and effective meeting, and local transmission of Covid-19 in Singapore remains at negligible levels, the change to the meeting's timing reflects the international challenges in containing the pandemic," it said in a statement.Global travel restrictions have made planning difficult for an in-person meeting in the first half of the year, while differing quarantine and air transport regulations increased the lead time needed to ensure participants can join, it added.Singapore's ministry of trade and industry said the government understood the challenges the WEF faced and had agreed to reschedule.The annual meeting typically takes place in January in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, but the pandemic made that impossible this year.

03-02-2021||World||EU faces 100 billion-euro price tag for bungled vaccine push||The European Union is facing a cost of tens of billions of euros for the slow and chaotic rollout of coronavirus vaccinations compared to countries such as the U.K. and U.S.Lockdowns mean the bloc’s economy is operating at about 95% of its pre-pandemic level, equating to about 12 billion euros ($14 billion) a week of lost output, according to calculations by Bloomberg Economics. It’s also weeks behind its peers in inoculations, and progressing at a slower pace.Unless it can make up ground, the EU will be forced to keep lockdowns or similar restrictions in place even as other major economies get fully back to work. A delay of 1-2 months would amount to a 50-100 billion-euro blow.The numbers highlight the massive stakes for the European Commission, which became embroiled in a public standoff with drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc over supply curbs before imposing export restrictions for Covid-19 vaccines. That turned into a U-turn for President Ursula von der Leyen over shipments into Northern Ireland.“Every week that the lockdown has to be extended because the population isn’t vaccinated and vulnerable means substantial economic costs,” said Guntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. “Those costs are a lot higher than the costs of the vaccinations themselves.”So far, the EU has administered just 3 doses per 100 people, far behind the 15 in the U.K. and 10 in the U.S., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. In the meantime, more contagious strains of the coronavirus are spreading, forcing governments to extend lockdowns.“The U.K.’s early progress means we expect a vigorous economic recovery to take root sooner than in mainland Europe,” said Jamie Rush, chief European economist at Bloomberg Economics. “The higher transmissibility of new Covid-19 strains is prompting tougher containment measures in much of Europe, raising the cost of vaccine delays.”The EU predicts a surge in vaccine supply in the second quarter, and still plans to have 70% of the adult population vaccinated by the summer. That’s a level that should allow governments to lift many of the current restrictions that have shut down shops, restaurants and travel.Yet Allianz SE estimates that countries are five weeks behind with respect to meeting that target, and vaccinations need to happen at six times the current pace to catch up. It puts the cost at 90 billion euros, taking into account knock-on effects later in the year.“In vaccine economics there is only black or white: Economies that finish the race first will be rewarded with strong positive multiplier effects supercharging consumption and investment activity in the second half of 2021,” economists led by Ludovic Subran said in a report. “Vaccination laggards will remain stuck in crisis mode and face substantial costs -- economic as well as political.”Southern countries including Spain and Italy -- already the worst-affected by the pandemic -- will suffer most from a delay if it hits international tourism. Even a partial opening around the Easter holidays at the beginning of April would bring much-needed revenue, according to Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS Group AG.“With the slow progress on vaccinations, it’s not clear we’ll have a good Easter season,” he said, adding that the summer is also under threat, as many travelers books their holidays in the spring and may opt to stay closer to home for another year.Each extra week the economy is subject to restrictions also increases the risk that companies that ate into their financial buffers for the last year will be pushed over the edge and file for insolvency. That would raise unemployment and undermine the prospect of rapid rebound.The EU could still catch up with its peers, or all nations could yet be plunged into another crisis, for example if further coronavirus mutations emerge that are resistant to the current vaccines.On current form though, the likelihood is that continental Europe is headed for a painful reckoning.“To the extent that we don’t get the necessary run rates in the coming weeks and months, our concerns will rise on a daily basis,” said Cluse.(Updates with vaccination rates, comment from Bloomberg Economics starting in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-faces-100-billion-euro-price-tag-for-bungled-vaccine-push-101612341463977.html
03-02-2021||World||Bangladesh intensifies vigil along its border with Myanmar||Bangladesh said on Wednesday that it has intensified security along its border with Myanmar to prevent a fresh influx of Rohingyas amid speculation that the military takeover of Yangon could push more refugees into the country."We have secured our border (with Myanmar)," Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen told reporters here.He, however, said that Dhaka did not expect further Rohingya influx, but some friendly Western countries "fear that rest of the Rohingyas would flee to Bangladesh from Rakhine" due to the military coup in Myanmar, he added.His statement comes as officials in southeastern Cox's Bazar that borders Myanmar's Rakhine state said that the paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has intensified patrols and vigils along the border.Myanmar military seized the power on Monday detaining the country's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The military coup took place at a time when Bangladesh was spearheading a desperate campaign for safe return of some 1.1 million Rohingyas.Momen said Dhaka wants to continue talks with Myanmar for "advancing the ongoing process to commence Rohingya repatriation"."Our discussion will continue with the Myanmar government, not with any individual,” he said. "We did the agreement (regarding repatriation) with the Myanmar government, not with any individual… (so) the (repatriation) process should be continued."Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, who fled Myanmar facing military crackdown, often considered as "ethnic cleansing" by many rights groups.In an immediate reaction after the military takeover, Dhaka issued a statement saying “as an immediate and friendly neighbour, we would like to see peace and stability in Myanmar.”Bangladesh firmly adheres to and promotes democratic ethos, it added.Momen said Rohingya repatriation remained to be Dhaka's top agenda in its relations with Myanmar."The border situation remains normal but we have enforced an extra security vigil to prevent any fresh Rohingya influx," BGB's 34 battalion's commander Lieutenant Colonel Ali Haidar Azad said in Cox's Bazar.Another BGB official at the frontier town said Bangladesh border guards were "kept alert" as "we will not allow any influx from Myanmar"."We understand the international pressures on Myanmar army. If the pressure mounts, they will be forced to take us back," a Rohingya representative, Nur Hossain of Leda Camp, said.Rohingya leader at Jutupalang camp Saiful Islam said the "Burmese military forced us to flee our homes, but we are concerned as they took over the total control".The minister said in previous such influxes repartitions took place in 1978 and 1992 under the Myanmar’s military government and "if that time they could do so, why not this time".On January 19, the secretary level tripartite meeting among Bangladesh, China and Myanmar decided to hold the next joint working group meeting on February 4 for advancing the discussion about commencing repatriation of Rohingyas.But, the meeting scheduled on Thursday is uncertain as Dhaka did not communicate with Myanmar officially after the coup."We were not able to contact with Myanmar as still their (Myanmar's new authority) communication is shut down," the minster said.In the last three years, Myanmar did not take back a single Rohingya despite its pledges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-intensifies-vigil-along-its-border-with-myanmar-101612370458446.html

03-02-2021||World||Ukraine's President imposes sanctions against 'pro-Russian' media||Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has imposed sanctions against several opposition-supporting television and media companies his government accuses of being financed by Moscow and a Russian-leaning politician.A presidential decree, published late on Tuesday, said "special economic and other restrictive measures" would be imposed against Taras Kozak, a lawmaker from the Opposition Bloc faction, and eight media and TV companies.The decree gave no reasons for the decision. Kozak is the listed owner of the three TV channels covered, which Ukrainian media said were associated with Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent opposition figure seen as an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin."These media have become one of the tools of the war against Ukraine, so they are blocked in order to protect national security," Zelenskiy's spokeswoman Iuliia Mendel said on Facebook.She said Ukraine had evidence the channels received funding from Russia. The channels have not commented on that accusation.Zelenskiy said in a tweet that the sanction had been a difficult decision and that Ukraine supported freedom of speech but not "propaganda financed by the aggressor country".Kyiv and Moscow have been at loggerheads since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and involvement in a conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region, which Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.Kozak and Medvedchuk both condemned the move as illegal."President Zelenskiy threw 1,500 journalists and employees of three TV channels into the street and deprived millions of viewers of the right to receive objective information," Medvedchuk said on his website.The sanctions against Kozak were imposed for a period of five years and limit his ability to use and dispose of property and withdraw capital from Ukraine, as well as revoking the licences he holds for the TV channels.The media organisations and TV channels are prohibited from broadcasting and their assets blocked."We regard this decision ... as a political reprisal against objectionable media," channels 112 Ukraine, NewsOne and ZiK said in a joint statement.All three channels went off air on Wednesday morning.Ukraine's move drew criticism from Russia."By shutting down opposition television channels, Zelenskiy acknowledged his inability to withstand political competition," prominent Russian senator Alexei Pushkov wrote on Twitter.(Reporting by Pavel Polityuk; Additional reporting by Natalia Zinets in Kyiv and Andrew Osborn in Moscow; Editing by Alex Richardson)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraines-president-imposes-sanctions-against-pro-russian-media-101612344997129.html

Romania, Bulgaria, Portugal, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden all breached particulate matter limits, while France had illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide.In a case brought by the Commission in 2018, the court ruled that Hungary had breached limits on particulate matter pollution from 2005 to 2017 in Budapest and the northeast Sajo river valley region, and in the southwest city of Pecs from 2011 to 2017, with the exception of 2014.The court also said that, since 2010, Hungary had failed to ensure that breaches were kept as short as possible.The ruling orders Hungary to comply or face potential further legal action by the Commission to impose financial penalties.The court acknowledged Hungary did adopt air quality plans - but it said these plans did not require fast action to rein in particulate matter.Particulate matter is produced by industry and vehicle emissions, as well as some agriculture, and is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.In Hungary, 13,100 premature deaths were attributed to fine particulate matter in 2018, according to the European Environment Agency. Per capita, such fatalities in Hungary were the same as the Czech Republic and Greece, and behind only Bulgaria and Poland in the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-systematically-breached-eu-air-pollution-limits-says-court-101612351401460.html
03-02-2021||World||UK says 10 million people have received coronavirus vaccine||Ten million people in the UK have been given coronavirus vaccine, as the government’s program to immunize the most vulnerable groups makes rapid progress.The milestone puts the country on track to provide shots to 15 million citizens and carers at greatest risk from the disease by Feb. 15, potentially paving the way for ministers to begin easing lockdown restrictions.“It’s fantastic that 10 million people in the UK have got their first dose of the vaccine,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet. “Thank you to everyone who has helped make this possible.”The rapid roll out of coronavirus vaccines is a rare bright spot for the UK government in its handling of the pandemic, which has left more than 100,000 people dead and caused the deepest recession for more than 300 years.InfectionsThe country is a month into its third national lockdown, and while death rates and hospitalization numbers have declined in recent days, medics are still battling high levels of infections.Johnson is under mounting pressure to ease restrictions from lockdown skeptics in his own party who fear shutting up businesses and schools will inflict lasting scars on the economy and society. News that vaccines are effective at cutting transmission of the disease has fueled their argument.“With better and better news by the day on the vaccination roll out and its effectiveness, the government has got to start addressing its mind to the harms caused by the measures we’re putting in place,” said Mark Harper, chairman of the so-called Covid Recovery Group of Conservative members of Parliament. “Lockdowns and restrictions cause immense damage to people’s health and livelihoods and we need to lift them as soon as it is safe to do so.”Johnson has promised to review the pandemic response after the priority groups have been given vaccines and said he will publish a roadmap in the week of Feb. 22 for lifting lockdown. Schools will be the first facilities to reopen in England, starting no earlier than March 8 under the government’s plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-10-million-people-have-received-coronavirus-vaccine-101612366040170.html

It has become hugely popular among teenagers in Italy during the Covid-19 pandemic.The Italian regulator said TikTok had agreed to block all accounts in Italy from Feb. 9, and to readmit only users who provided a date of birth showing they were at least 13 years old.Alexandra Evans, Tiktok's head of child safety in Europe, said it would also introduce a button into the app to enable members to report users who appeared to be under 13.The regulator said TikTok had also agreed to evaluate using artificial intelligence to detect under-age accounts.It will, however, have to discuss the proposal with the Irish privacy authority, which is the European Union's lead data protection authority for Tik Tok because the firm has its European head office in Ireland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-agrees-to-block-users-in-italy-who-say-they-are-under-13-after-girl-dies-101612365831526.html

He later collapsed and died.The Senate next week will begin an impeachment trial of Trump over his alleged role in inciting the deadly mob, which walked to the Capitol from a political rally near the White House after the former president exhorted them to protest the count. Trump’s lawyers are arguing that his impeachment trial is “substantively flawed,” unconstitutional and should be dismissed.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced last week said that Sicknick, 42, would lie in honor in the Capitol’s rotunda. Two Capitol Police officers who were killed in 1998 when a gunman entered the building and opened fire were given similar recognition.“The heroism of Officer Sicknick and the Capitol Police force during the violent insurrection against our Capitol helped save lives, defend the temple of our democracy and ensure that the Congress was not diverted from our duty to the Constitution,” the Democratic lawmakers said in a statement. “His sacrifice reminds us every day of our obligation to our country and to the people we serve.”A viewing period for members of the Capitol Police was scheduled for Tuesday night, and Sicknick will be interred Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-harris-visit-capitol-pay-respects-to-officer-killed-in-riot-101612360201926.html
03-02-2021||World||‘Regrettable’: Japan on Sri Lanka not sticking to trilateral deal for port||Japan on Wednesday said it was “regrettable” that the Sri Lankan government had opted to hand over the operations of a key port terminal in Colombo to a state-run body instead of sticking to a trilateral agreement involving India for the development of the facility.The position taken by Japan endorsed India’s stance on the development of the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo port. New Delhi had on Tuesday asked Colombo to abide by the agreement signed by the three countries in 2019.The Sri Lankan government gave in to pressure from labour unions, which opposed a joint venture with Indian and Japanese investors having a 49% stake in the ECT, and the cabinet decided on Monday to run the facility as a fully owned operation of the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA).“It is regrettable that the government of Sri Lanka unilaterally made a cabinet decision and announced the development and operation of ECT as a wholly owned container terminal of Sri Lanka Ports Authority,” said an official of the Japanese embassy in New Delhi.“We are aware of the cabinet decision by the government of Sri Lanka and looking into the details,” the official said.Japan, India and Sri Lanka “have been discussing the details about the cooperation on ECT” since the three countries signed a memorandum of cooperation (MOC) for developing the terminal in May 2019, the official added.The reaction from the Japanese side came a day after Indian high commissioner Gopal Baglay held separate meetings with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and foreign minister Dinesh Gunawerdene in Colombo to convey India’s position that the Sri Lanka must abide by the trilateral agreement, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.India’s Adani Group and several Japanese investors were to form a joint venture to hold 49% stake in the ECT, with the majority stake in the hands of SLPA. The Indian side also made it clear to the Sri Lanka side that the latest decision on ECT could affect investor confidence, the people said.The Indian high commission in Colombo has called for the “expeditious implementation” of the trilateral agreement and said: “All sides should continue to abide by the existing understandings and commitment.”The Sri Lankan government has said it will allow the development of the West Container Terminal (WCT) by India and its partners.The agreement for the port terminal was signed by the previous government of president Maithripala Sirisena and has been in trouble since he was voted out of power in 2019. A group of 23 labour unions in Sri Lanka have demanded that ECT should be a 100% government entity.

03-02-2021||World||Biden team in talks with utilities, car companies about emissions||US President Joe Biden's administration has started discussions with the utility and automobile sectors about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, White House domestic climate change adviser Gina McCarthy told Reuters.The talks are part of a broad effort by the Biden administration that McCarthy will spearhead to engage every federal agency to decarbonize the US power sector by 2035 and the whole economy by 2050.The United States is the world's second-biggest greenhouse gas emitter behind China, with the power and transport sectors making up more than half of the emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.McCarthy's first major task will be to come up with a 2030 emission reduction target under the Paris climate agreement before Biden convenes world leaders for a climate summit on April 22."We're already having conversations with the utility world and we're having conversations with the car companies," McCarthy said in an interview."The car companies understand now that the future for them is electric vehicles ... so we're going to be sort of working to make sure that we move forward with some kind of an agreement on that and a strategy to get us out of the gate fast."The White House has met some major automakers - including General Motors Co - as it prepares to begin talks with the industry about revising vehicle emission standards through 2026 or beyond. GM said last week it aimed to sell only electric cars by 2035.She met virtually with the board of the Edison Electric Institute, the main utility lobby, which discussed its "support for recent energy-related executive orders," a spokesman for the group told Reuters.McCarthy will chair a task force composed of the heads of all Cabinet agencies to see what measures can be taken through regulation, budget appropriation and legislation to combat climate change, she said.Input from that task force will help McCarthy come up with a feasible emission reduction target the United States can achieve by 2030 that her international policy counterpart, John Kerry, Biden's special envoy on climate change, can submit to the United Nations.Biden brought the United States back into the international agreement after his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, withdrew.Oil and gas companies will also face new proposed limits on methane emissions later this year, she said, after Trump withdrew previous rules late last year.The main US oil lobby group, the American Petroleum Institute, long resisted mandatory methane regulations but lifted its opposition in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-team-in-talks-with-utilities-car-companies-about-emissions-101612355974843.html
03-02-2021||World||Taliban on diplomatic blitz after Afghan peace talks stall||The Taliban have been on a diplomatic blitz since peace talks with the Afghan government stalled in Qatar last month and the Biden administration said it plans to review a U.S.-Taliban agreement signed last February.The flurry of activity — including Taliban visits to Iran and Moscow, and a planned trip to Turkey — comes as the Afghan government’s negotiating team warned this week that if the Taliban fail to resume the talks, the government could recall its team from Doha.The peace talks resumed in early January in Qatar, where the Taliban have a political office, but quickly halted, marred by a spike in violence across Afghanistan, with the warring sides blaming one another.A Taliban official said the talks stalled after the Taliban demanded the government side accept a new “inclusive Islamic system" that includes all “tribes and groups" in Afghanistan — language that indicates the Taliban seek guarantees that Islamic rule would be in place in post-war Afghanistan.The government instead demanded the Taliban first join the current political system and declare a cease-fire, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.However, Nader Nadery, a government negotiator, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it was the Taliban who have until now refused to return to the negotiating table. He denied any discussions over competing agendas.In Kabul, deep divisions have emerged between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his political opponents over what some see as Ghani's unwillingness to consider a power-sharing deal with the Taliban that could prematurely end his presidency, before 2024.Ghani's opponents have set up a 21-member parliament committee to possibly meet separately with the Taliban, accusing Ghani of stalling peace talks to remain in power. Ghani's supporters, meanwhile, say the committee us trying to unseat the president.The Pentagon said last week that the Taliban’s refusal to meet commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan is raising questions about whether all U.S. troops will be able to leave by May as required under the U.S.-Taliban deal.The deal calls for all international troops to pull out, but only if the Taliban honor a promise to abandon their connection with terrorist groups — such as al-Qaida — and guarantee that their territory would not be used to attack the U.S. or its allies.“A political settlement needs to happen before the exit of foreign troops because after their exit, chances of agreement among Afghans is slim to none,” increasing prospects for a civil war, said Torek Farhadi, a political analyst.The Taliban have threatened to step up their their war if U.S. and NATO troops remain in Afghanistan after the May deadline.Since the agreement signed last February under former President Donald Trump, the Taliban have not attacked U.S. and NATO troops but accuse the U.S. of breaking its promise not to carry out preemptive attacks. The U.S. denies the allegations and says it has responded to Taliban attacks against Afghan security forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-on-diplomatic-blitz-after-afghan-peace-talks-stall-101612352526550.html
03-02-2021||World||Covid vaccine Sputnik V turns out to be a scientific and political win for Putin||First greeted with scepticism, experts have since been convinced of the effectiveness of the Russian coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, with positive results published in The Lancet medical journal on Tuesday.The development represents a scientific and political victory for Vladimir Putin's Russia.Putin at the forefrontFrom the first weeks of the pandemic, the Russian president ordered the scientific, political and military apparatus of the country to work in overdrive to develop the world's first Covid vaccine -- even if that meant taking shortcuts.Last spring, Alexander Gintsburg, the director of the state-run Gamaleya research centre that developed Sputnik V, boasted of having personally injected himself with an experimental version of the jab.A few months later, in mid-August, Putin announced the approval of the world's first coronavirus vaccine.With the shot at that point having only been tested by a few dozen volunteers, the proclamation was greeted with scepticism abroad.The vaccine nonetheless soon became available to Russia's elite, including one of Putin's daughters, even before the beginning of Phase III clinical trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers.Russia made the vaccine available to the wider public in December, when Europe and the United States were just deploying the first doses of the vaccines made by their pharmaceutical companies.Global ambitionsFor the Kremlin, the homemade vaccine -- first vilified by the West -- demonstrates Russia's excellence, with Putin having called Sputnik V "the best vaccine in the world".The choice of name for the jab is highly symbolic. A tribute to the world's first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, Sputnik V recalls a scientific feat for Russia and a historic setback for its rival the United States.The success of the vaccine restores Russian research capabilities to the world's top echelons, after the sector had been decimated by crises and corruption in the wake of the USSR's collapse in 1991.Sputnik V has been approved in more than 15 countries, including ex-Soviet nations like Belarus and Armenia, allies like Venezuela and Iran, but also Argentina, Algeria, Tunisia and Pakistan.Sputnik V in Europe?Last month the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which helped finance Sputnik V, announced that it had applied for registration of the vaccine in the European Union.But the Russian vaccine has been treated with suspicion due to a lack of publicly available scientific data.Denouncing European delays, Viktor Orban's Hungary sidestepped the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and registered the vaccine on its own.For her part, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has offered Putin the possibility of "joint production".Production capacity?Russia says it has received pre-orders of more than a billion doses of Sputnik V, but it is unable to meet that level of demand.The quantities of doses that have been delivered abroad have mainly been symbolic, like the 20,000 exported to Bolivia.In some cases the figures were not revealed, while Argentina experienced a shipment delay last month.No official source has made clear how many doses have been produced or deployed, though authorities in mid-January said that 1.5 million people had been inoculated with Sputnik V around the world.Rather than exporting Sputnik V in bulk, Moscow hopes to develop production partnerships with local factories.Brazil, India, Kazakhstan and South Korea are currently producing the jab, though not all them have made it available to the public yet.Other Russian vaccinesAt least three more Russian coronavirus vaccines are expected to be rolled out in the coming weeks.Sputnik V -- a two-dose vaccine using adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that causes the common cold -- is set to be produced as "Sputnik Light", a less effective single-dose version.Mass production of the EpiVacCorona vaccine, developed by the Siberian Vektor laboratory, is set to launch this month.The Russian government has said that a third vaccine named CoviVac is expected to be approved this month too.And there may even be a fourth, with the Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca and the developers of Sputnik V having said they are working to combine their respective vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-sputnik-v-turns-out-to-be-a-scientific-and-political-win-for-putin-101612356457023.html
03-02-2021||World||More sanctions on Russia over Navalny cannot be ruled out: Germany||The German government said on Wednesday further sanctions against Russia cannot be ruled out after a Moscow court jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and police used force against opposition protesters.Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday's verdict against Navalny was "far from any rule of law standards" and demanded an end to violence against peaceful protesters in Russia.Asked if Germany was mulling new sanctions against Russia, Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told a regular news conference the European Union had already imposed sanctions against Moscow following a nerve agent attack on Navalny."Further sanctions are not to be ruled out," Seibert said, adding that Berlin would discuss further steps with its European partners.Seibert said Moscow's handling of the Navalny case violated basic human rights principles which Moscow had signed up to and that Berlin condemned "the systematic use of force" against demonstrators by Russian police.The EU in December imposed sanctions on six Russians and a state scientific research centre accused of deploying against Navalny a banned nerve agent designed for military use.Western countries have urged Moscow to immediately free Navalny.Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the authorities tried to poison Navalny and said Russian agents would have finished the job if they had wanted him dead. He said in December that reports the Russian state had poisoned Navalny were part of a U.S.-backed plot to try to discredit him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-sanctions-on-russia-over-navalny-cannot-be-ruled-out-germany-101612356889663.html

Supply problems should ease in the second quarter of 2021, but increasing production remained a challenge, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccination-delay-could-cost-eu-economy-90-billion-euros-study-101612353838396.html
03-02-2021||World||Myanmar's Suu Kyi charged with possessing illegal radios||Police in Myanmar have charged deposed national leader Aung San Suu Kyi with having several illegally imported walkie-talkies in her home, members of her party said Wednesday.Suu Kyi was detained Monday along with other senior politicians when the military staged a coup the day the newly elected Parliament was supposed to open its session. Party officials say she has not been moved from her residence, where she was being held under house arrest.The charges against Suu Kyi appear to carry a maximum sentence of two years in prison. The charge sheets indicate the unregistered walkie-talkies were for use by Suu Kyi’s bodyguards.National League for Democracy spokesman Kyi Toe confirmed the charge on his Facebook page. He also said the country’s ousted president, Win Myint, was charged with violating natural disaster management law. An NLD lawmaker, Phyo Zayar Thaw, also confirmed the charges.Police and court officials in the capital Naypyitaw could not immediately be contacted.The coup was a dramatic backslide for Myanmar, which had been making progress toward democracy, and highlighted the extent to which the generals have ultimately maintained control in in the Southeast Asian country.The takeover also marked a shocking fall from power for Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who had lived under house arrest for years as she tried to push her country toward democracy and then became its de facto leader after her party won elections in 2015.Suu Kyi had been a fierce critic of the army during her years in detention. But after her shift from democracy icon to politician, she worked with the generals and even defended their crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, damaging her international reputation.The military has announced it will hold power under a state of emergency for a year, and then hold elections whose winner will take over government.Suu Kyi’s party has called for non-violent resistance to the military takeover, and on Tuesday night, scores of people in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, honked car horns and banged on pots and pans in a noise protest called by activists. They included shouts wishing Suu Kyi good health and calling for freedom.Supporters of the military have also staged demonstrations, attracting as many as 3,000 people to a Tuesday rally.While in power, Myanmar’s new leader said the military government plans to investigate alleged fraud in last year’s elections. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing announced the moves Tuesday at the first meeting of his new government in the capital, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said.The military has said one of its reasons for ousting the elected civilian government was because it failed to properly investigate its allegations of electoral irregularities. The state Union Election Commission has said there were no significant problems with the vote.In the November 2020 election, Suu Kyi’s party captured 396 out of 476 seats contested in the lower and upper houses of Parliament. The main opposition party, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, won only 33 seats.The military, known as the Tatmadaw, is automatically allocated 25% of the seats in the combined houses under the 2008 Constitution that was drafted under a previous military government.The state newspaper reported that Min Aung Hlaing told Cabinet members that a new Union Election Commission, with what he described as independent and unbiased personnel, “would examine the voting data to find correct results, and actions would be taken accordingly in the process.” He said voter lists would be scrutinized against family household registrations.Min Aung Hlaing also said that Covid-19 containment measures taken by Suu Kyi’s government would be continued.Myanmar has confirmed more than 140,600 cases including some 3,100 deaths. Its health care infrastructure is one of the weakest in Asia, according to UN surveys.A statement issued Wednesday in the name of the executive members of Suu Kyi’s party said that authorities began raiding the party’s offices in Mandalay and other states and regions on Tuesday and seized documents and laptop computers.The statement on the Facebook page of party spokesman Kyi Toe said locks were broken at several offices. It denounced the raids as illegal and demanded that they stop.The takeover presents a test for the international community. US President Joe Biden called the military’s actions “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law” and threatened new sanctions. The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting Tuesday but took no action.The foreign ministers of the Group of 7 leading industrial nations on Wednesday issued a statement calling for Suu Kyi and others to be released, the state of emergency to be scrapped and power restored to the democratically elected government. It also expressed concern about restrictions on information, an apparent reference to cuts to phone and internet service on Monday.“We stand with the people of Myanmar who want to see a democratic future,” it said. The group comprises the United States. Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, along with the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-suu-kyi-charged-with-possessing-illegal-radios-101612351105259.html

And nobody has an office in this place.”Biden made that pledge during the 2020 presidential campaign — as Trump and other Republicans tried to make an issue out of some of Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings. He sought to differentiate himself from Trump, whose daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, served him as high-level White House advisers.Biden represented Delaware for 36 years in the Senate. Barack Obama, a senator from Illinois, and Biden were elected president and vice president, respectively, in 2008.Biden told the magazine a folksy story about rejecting the advice of an accountant who had told him years ago that he could bill the Senate for some of the gasoline he pumped into the family car.Biden said he told the accountant: “Here’s how I look at it: The foul line is 15 feet away from the basket. Never get me closer than 17 feet, because it really is a matter of the public trust.”“And we need to rebuild that trust in government,” added Jill Biden, who joined her husband for the interview in the magazine’s Feb. 15 issue, hitting newsstands nationwide on Friday, days before Trump’s impeachment trial is set to open in the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-bring-an-unexpected-piece-of-furniture-to-white-house-101612350233802.html

The explosion occurred minutes after the experimental launch at Boca Chica, Texas.The SN9 rocket was a test model of the heavy-duty rocket being developed by Elon Musk's company to carry humans and cargo into space. SN8, the model before it, had also met a similar fate during a test launch in December. No injuries occurred in either incident.SpaceX’s live stream covered a 16-story-tall SN9 taking a flawless liftoff from the Gulf Coast in South Texas. The spacecraft hovered in midair at an altitude of 10 km before shutting off its engines for planned “belly-flop” execution.While landing, the Starship tried to reactivate two of its three Raptor thrusters but failed to ignite one. The rocket then fell, exploding into a ball of flames, smoke, and debris - 6 minutes and 26 seconds after launch.There was no immediate comment from Musk, who also heads the electric carmaker Tesla Inc. Hours earlier, he tweeted about staying off social media platform “for a while.”Also read| Elon Musk keeps sparring with regulators as Joe Biden cabinet takes reinsA SpaceX commentator, after the live stream, said that the test altitude “looked very good and stable, like we saw last December. We just have to work on that landing a little bit.”The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will investigate Tuesday’s mishap despite the tensions with Musk - from the previous inquiry. SpaceX conducted December’s launch “without demonstrating” public safety measures, according to the FAA. But “corrective actions” the company later took were approved and incorporated into Tuesday’s launch.Musk expressed his disagreement over the agencies’ broken structure. In his tweet, he said, “FAA’s space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure” and that “humanity will never get to Mars under its rules.The complete Starship rocket, with its super-heavy first-stage booster, is the company’s next-generation fully reusable launch vehicle - planned for year’s end.Musk aims to make human space travel more affordable and systematic. He intends to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon with the Starship in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-starship-explodes-during-landing-faa-launches-probe-101612344895537.html

It’s also the only major economy that saw carbon emissions rise.In December, emissions surpassed 2019 levels for the first time all year, according to data from Carbon Monitor, a collaborative effort between researchers in China, Europe and the US that offers near real-time monitoring. That lifted total emissions in the country for 2020 to 10.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, 0.5% higher than the year before.The increase comes as global emissions likely dropped by 4.4% in 2020, according to Carbon Monitor, with declines in Brazil running to about 10% and nearly 13% in the US China’s emissions dropped 11% in the first quarter, during its intense pandemic lockdown, as gross domestic product shrank 6.8% from a year earlier.Carbon Monitor’s research captures emissions from burning fossil fuels and from cement production. Its estimates are subject to change as more data becomes available.Also read| South Korea curbing travel, gatherings for holidayThe emissions comeback underscores the challenge China and the rest of the world face as they balance economic revival and long-term climate goals. Because it was the first country to encounter and contain the virus, China’s pandemic path has often foreshadowed the experiences of other countries.China’s recovery picked up speed last month, putting it further ahead of rivals. Industrial production surged in the fourth quarter, with the country producing more than 1 billion tons of crude steel in 2020, an annual record.The nation’s long-term climate plans including hitting peak emissions by 2030 at the latest, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2060. Reaching that will require an overhaul of its mostly coal-based power sector, which contributed nearly half of the country’s emissions in 2020, according to Carbon Monitor data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-comeback-is-bad-news-for-climate-as-emissions-rise-101612342522843.html
03-02-2021||World||Ant Group reaches agreement with China regulators on overhaul||Ant Group Co. and Chinese regulators have agreed on a restructuring plan that will turn Jack Ma’s fintech giant into a financial holding company, making it subject to capital requirements similar to those for banks.The plan calls for putting all of Ant’s businesses into the holding company, including its technology offerings in areas like blockchain and food delivery, people familiar with the matter said. One of Ant’s early proposals to regulators had envisioned putting only financial operations into the new structure.An official announcement on the overhaul could come before the start of China’s Lunar New Year holiday next week, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns about a third of Ant, erased losses in Hong Kong trading on Wednesday after Bloomberg reported the agreement. The stock closed with a 0.4% gain.Ant’s restructuring plan marks the first big step in what’s expected to be a lengthy overhaul process, as regulators draw up detailed capital requirements and other guidelines for companies that span multiple financial business lines.China only introduced its framework for financial holding companies in September and many of the specifics are still being ironed out. While the rules will eventually provide more regulatory clarity for Ant, they’ll almost certainly force the company to slow the torrid pace of expansion that has made it China’s dominant fintech player and one of the world’s most valuable startups.Ant is still exploring possibilities to revive its initial public offering, which was abruptly halted by regulators in November, one person familiar with the matter said. But given the financial holding company framework is so new, it’s unclear how long it might take for authorities to sign off a listing.Ant declined to comment. The People’s Bank of China, which oversees financial holding companies, didn’t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.Ant’s restructuring is part of a broader government campaign to increase supervision of the financial and technology sectors. Regulators have in recent months targeted everything from health-care crowdfunding to consumer lending. In January, they proposed measures to curb market concentration in online payments, where Ant and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are the biggest players.The clampdown has fueled intense speculation over the status of Ma, who co-founded both Ant and Alibaba. The e-commerce giant has also faced increased government scrutiny in recent months, becoming the target of an antitrust investigation in December.Ma’s appearance in a live-streamed video conference in January -- after several months out of public view -- has helped quell talk of worst-case scenarios for his business empire. Still, plenty of uncertainty remains: even after Wednesday’s gain, Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares are trading about 15% below their record high in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ant-group-reaches-agreement-with-china-regulators-on-overhaul-101612342660234.html
03-02-2021||World||China to send 10 million coronavirus vaccine doses abroad||China on Wednesday announced a plan to provide 10 million coronavirus vaccine doses to developing nations through the global COVAX initiative.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China is responding to a request from the World Health Organization as developing countries seek to fill shortages predicted to run through March.COVAX, coordinated by WHO and others, seeks to ensure low and middle-income countries have enough coronavirus vaccines, as wealthy nations have snapped up many of the millions of upcoming doses.“We hope countries in international society with the capability will swing into action, support COVAX through practical actions, support the work of the World Health Organization, assist developing countries in obtaining vaccines in a timely manner and contribute to international society's conquering the pandemic at an early date," Wang said a daily briefing.China has already shipped large amounts of domestically developed vaccines to mainly developing countries, and WHO is in the process of approving Chinese vaccines for emergency use.That is seen by many as an attempt to boost China's reputation amid concerns over its growing military and economic influence and willingness to use its political leverage to defend what it considers its core interests.China is also anxious to dismiss criticisms of missteps in handling COVID-19 after the first cases were detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. A team of WHO experts is currently in the city to collect data in a search for clues about the virus's origins and how it spread around the world.China has called the virus a mutual challenge facing humanity and even questioned its origin.Earlier, as the pandemic spread around the world, it sent medical teams and supplies to affected countries and signed agreements with developing nations such as Indonesia and the Philippines to provide priority access to one of its vaccine candidates.While Chinese vaccines are considered a cheaper and possibly more plentiful alternative, others are also stepping in. Pfizer last month committed to supplying up to 40 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine this year through COVAX.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-10-million-coronavirus-vaccine-doses-abroad-101612342951103.html
03-02-2021||World||GameStop’s giant bubble deflates further after $27 billion rout||GameStop Corp. shares continued their rapid fall back toward earth on Wednesday, with last week’s massive peak becoming a distant memory.The stock listed on Germany’s Tradegate venue fell to $71.99, implying a drop of about 20% from Tuesday’s New York closing price of $90.GameStop, the poster child for Redditors looking to squeeze short sellers, plunged 60% Tuesday, and has now erased more than $27 billion in market value from last week’s intraday high of $483. Several other favorites of the Reddit community -- including movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and clothing retailer Express Inc. -- also tumbled, with AMC falling a further 12% in early trading on Tradegate.GameStop’s rapid retreat has coincided with a sharp reduction in short interest after bearish investors appeared to cover their positions. That has loosened a squeeze on the stock caused by day traders who used Reddit forums to tout and bid up out-of-favor stocks that also included American Airlines Group Inc. and BlackBerry Ltd.“The loss of momentum in the short-squeeze frenzy highlights that triggering such reverberation in the market is not easy, after all,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, said in written comments. “We could wait a while before seeing a similar phenomenon in the future.”GameStop has now given up more than 80% of the sharp gains that were fueled by last month’s attack on short sellers. Even with the latest pullback, however, the Grapevine, Texas-based retailer is still up 377% year-to-date, based on most recent closing values.Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban told Reddit investors on Tuesday morning to hold on to their GameStop stocks if they could afford it.“If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I don’t own it, but that’s what I would do,” the 62-year-old wrote on Reddit during a “Ask Me Anything Session” to discuss investment strategies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gamestops-giant-bubble-deflates-further-after-27-billion-rout-101612341874951.html
03-02-2021||World||House Republicans tie Biden Commerce department pick to Huawei stance||Several House Republicans are asking their Senate counterparts to delay the confirmation of Gina Raimondo for Commerce secretary until President Joe Biden clarifies whether he supports keeping Huawei Technologies Co. on a restricted trade list.Led by Texas Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the group released a statement Tuesday highlighting the threat they say the Chinese technology company poses to national security. McCaul said while he agrees that the president should be able to pick his own cabinet -- and the confirmation process is up to the Senate -- removing Huawei from the Commerce Department’s “Entity List” is an issue that the nominee should clarify before moving ahead.“The fact that the Biden Administration has still refused to commit to keeping Huawei on the Department of Commerce’s Entity List is incredibly alarming and dangerous,” the House Republicans said in the statement. “We urge those Senators who have a history of calling for Huawei to remain on the Entity List to stick to their principles and place a hold on Ms. Raimondo’s confirmation until the Biden Administration clarifies their intentions for Huawei and on export control policies for a country that is carrying out genocide and threatening our national security.”The Trump administration instituted a Huawei export ban that requires U.S. firms to obtain government licenses if they want to sell American tech and intellectual property to the Chinese telecommunications-equipment giant.Raimondo didn’t specifically commit to keeping Huawei on the list when asked about the issue during her Jan. 26 Senate confirmation hearing.“We can’t have the Chinese or really anyone having a back door into our network and compromising in any way our national or economic security,” Raimondo said in her hearing last week. “I will use the bold toolkit at my disposal to the fullest extent possible to protect Americans and our network from Chinese interference or any kind of back-door influence into our network -- and that’s Huawei, ZTE, or any other company,” she said, referring to China’s ZTE Corp., another telecommunications equipment firm.“The last U.S. administration and some anti-China politicians, to uphold the U.S. monopoly, have been doing all they can to oppress Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Wednesday. “This is a denial of the market economy principles and fair competition which the U.S. champions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-republicans-tie-biden-commerce-department-pick-to-huawei-stance-101612341403549.html
03-02-2021||World||Astra shot shows 82% efficacy With UK’s two-dose interval||AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid vaccine showed 82% effectiveness with a three-month gap between two shots, according to a new study that bolsters the UK’s controversial decision to adopt an extended dosing interval.The vaccine may also significantly reduce transmission of the virus, according to analysis of trial data by the University of Oxford, which developed the shot with the British drugmaker. Swabs taken from volunteers in the UK arm of the trial showed a 67% reduction in transmission after the first dose, the report showed.The UK approved giving the first and second injections of two-shot vaccines from four to 12 weeks apart in an effort to stretch scarce supplies while manufacturing is ramped up. AstraZeneca executives had previously said the longer gap, compared with the three- to four-week period between shots that’s been recommended for other vaccines, could also boost effectiveness.The new results are a further boost for the immunization program in the UK, which has raced ahead of countries in the European Union and has given initial shots to 14% of residents. If the Astra vaccine also reduces transmission, it will speed up the process of achieving herd immunity, when the virus can no longer make inroads into a population. The effect on asymptomatic transmission fell after the second shot to 50%, the report showed.“Extending the dosing interval not only boosts the vaccine’s efficacy, but also enables more people to be vaccinated upfront,” said Mene Pangalos, Astra’s executive vice president for biopharmaceuticals research, in a statement. “Together with the new findings on reduced transmission, we believe this vaccine will have a real impact on the pandemic.”AstraZeneca shares rose 0.5% early Wednesday in London.Vaccine efficacy rose from 55% with a dosing interval of less than six weeks to 82% when spaced 12 or more weeks apart, according to new data. The analysis also found the shot showed 76% protection after the first of two injections. That level of immunity was achieved from 22 days after the first shot.Questions have swirled around the AstraZeneca vaccine since the company reported early trial results that showed 70% protection, on average. Those results came from two subsets, one of which delivered 62% effectiveness, the other 90%, with the higher level coinciding with a mistake in dosing. When the U.K. approved the vaccine in December, regulators signaled that they thought the discrepancy was more likely linked to the interval between shots than the dosing level.More CasesThe initial results were based on 131 cases of symptomatic Covid-19 in the trials, a number that has since grown to 332, allowing for more in-depth analysis. The new data are based on information from more than 17,000 trial participants in the UK, Brazil and South Africa, Oxford said.The European Union has also approved the vaccine, with France, Germany and some other countries restricting its use in the elderly, citing a lack of trial data in older age groups.“These new data provide an important verification of the interim data that was used by more than 25 regulators,” said Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford trial and co-author of the paper, in a statement. It also supports the policy recommendation made by the UK vaccine advisory panel, he said.Oxford is also planning to publish data on how the vaccine interacts with new variants of the coronavirus in coming days. The university said it expects the findings to be in line with those from other developers.Moderna Inc. said last month its vaccine will protect against two known coronavirus variants, but it plans to start human studies of a booster shot for a strain from South Africa that may cause immunity to wane more quickly. Pfizer Inc. is also looking to develop a booster shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astra-shot-shows-82-efficacy-with-uk-s-two-dose-interval-101612340409113.html

The army chief’s remarks seen to be aimed at New Delhi were a sharp contrast to his strident pitch against India, particularly after New Delhi carried out aerial strikes at terror training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir after the 2019 Pulwama bombing and later scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.General Bajwa, who made the statement at the graduation ceremony of Pakistan Air Force cadets, continued. “Pakistan and India must also resolve the longstanding issue of Jammu and Kashmir in a dignified and peaceful manner as per the aspirations of people of Jammu and Kashmir and bring this human tragedy to its logical conclusion,” General Bajwa said at the military event, according to a statement issued by the military.New Delhi has not reacted to the army chief’s remarks. A counter-terror official said it may be too early to conclude that General Bajwa had changed his position. “We will need to track if this is a one-off comment or there are other indicators of a possible change as well,” he said.Either way, it will take a lot more than words to help put bilateral ties between the two arch-rivals back on an even keel. Pakistan, the official said, would have to take concrete steps to dismantle the terror infrastructure on its soil and end support to terrorists to convince New Delhi that it was serious about improving ties.General Bajwa’s move to tone down his rhetoric against India came at a time he and Prime Minister Imran Khan have been facing fierce attacks from an alliance of opposition parties that joined hands last year to try to force PM Khan to step down.A Pakistan watcher said New Delhi could be expected to respond to action rather than words, particularly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took steps in the early part of his first tenure to mend ties. But his honest attempt to end the animosity by making an unscheduled visit to Pakistan was followed by an attack on the Pathankot airbase in December 2015.Unwilling to let terrorists derail the peace process, India worked with Islamabad to act against the Jaish-e-Mohammed but found Islamabad unwilling to deliver on its promise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-to-extend-hand-of-peace-pakistan-army-chief-gen-bajwa-springs-a-surprise-101612337327104.html
03-02-2021||World||Days before coup, IMF sent Myanmar $350 million in emergency aid; no precedent for refund||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week sent $350 million in cash to the Myanmar government, part of a no-strings-attached emergency aid package to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic.Days later, military leaders seized power and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other elected officials, in what the US State Department said on Tuesday constituted a coup.There appears to be little the IMF can do to claw back the funds, part of rapid-disbursing Covid-19 financing programs with almost no conditions and approved by the IMF board on Jan. 13, sources familiar with the payments and international finance experts said."We are following the unfolding developments closely. We are deeply concerned about the impact of events on the economy and on the people of Myanmar," an IMF spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Tuesday, confirming the payment was completed last week.US President Joe Biden, facing his first international crisis since taking office less than two weeks ago, has threatened new sanctions against the generals, and the State Department said it would review its foreign assistance to the southeast Asian country.The United States is the dominant shareholder in the IMF, which has provided Myanmar with $700 million in emergency coronavirus financing over the past seven months, including last week's payment, which included $116.6 million through the IMF's Rapid Credit Facility and $233.4 million through the Rapid Financing Instrument.The Fund said in a statement on Jan. 13 the money would help Myanmar meet "urgent balance-of-payments needs arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, especially the government’s recovery measures to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability while supporting affected sectors and vulnerable groups."Unlike the IMF's regular financing programs, which disburse funds in smaller increments as performance benchmarks are met for agreed policy reforms, coronavirus emergency aid has been sent quickly, often all at once."It's not a program that was negotiated, there isn't conditionality and there aren't forward-looking reviews with disbursements tied to those reviews," said Stephanie Segal, a former IMF economist and US Treasury official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington."I'm not aware of any precedent where money that's been approved by the IMF board can be recalled," Segal added.Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis last year, the IMF has provided emergency financing to 80 countries.The timing of the latest disbursement to Myanmar was unfortunate, two sources familiar with the payments said, and pointed to the risks of using rapid financing that gives governments broad discretion over how they spend the money.The best-case scenario is that the Myanmar government that emerges from the current political turmoil will spend the money appropriately because it wants to have a productive relationship with the Fund, one of the sources said.The IMF's counterparty in Myanmar is the Central Bank of Myanmar, and the source expressed hope it can maintain its independence from the country's finance ministry.But on Tuesday, the ruling Myanmar military appointed Than Nyein as the country's new central bank governor, reinstating him to a post he previously held between 2007-2013, during the rule of the last junta.The World Bank, which has provided more than $150 million in financing to Myanmar since the pandemic started a year ago, said on Monday it was gravely concerned about the military takeover, warning it risked a major setback to the country’s transition and its development prospects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/days-before-coup-imf-sent-myanmar-350-million-in-emergency-aid-no-precedent-for-refund-101612333960592.html
03-02-2021||World||Biden, Yellen say GOP coronavirus aid too small, Democrats push on||President Joe Biden panned a Republican alternative to his $1.9 trillion COVID rescue plan as insufficient as Senate Democrats pushed ahead, voting to launch a process that could approve his sweeping rescue package on their own, if Republicans refuse to support it.Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen joined the Democratic senators for a private virtual meeting Tuesday, both declaring the Republicans' $618 billion offer was too small. They urged big fast action to stem the pandemic crisis and economic fallout.As the White House reaches for a bipartisan bill, Democrats marshaled their ever-slim Senate majority, voting 50-49, to start a lengthy process for approving Biden's bill with or without GOP support. The goal is to have COVID-19 relief approved by March, when extra unemployment assistance and other pandemic aid expires.“President Biden spoke about the need for Congress to respond boldly and quickly,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the lunch meeting.“If we did a package that small, we’d be mired in the COVID crisis for years.”The swift action from Democrats on Capitol Hill underscores the urgency of delivering Biden's top legislative priority even as talks are progressing privately between Republicans and the White House, as well as with centrist Democrats, on potential changes to the package to win over broader bipartisan support.Biden framed his views during the virtual lunch meeting with Democrats by talking about the need not to forget working and middle-class families — even those like nurses and pipefitters making $150,000 for a family of four — who are straining during the crisis, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private call.The night before, Biden met with 10 Republican senators pitching their $618 billion alternative, and let them know it was insufficient to meet the country's needs. The president made it clear that he won’t delay aid in hopes of winning GOP support.While no compromise was reached during the late Monday session, White House talks with Republicans are privately underway.The outcome will test the new president striving to unify the country but confronting a rising COVID-19 death toll and stubbornly high jobless numbers, with political risks for all sides. Vaccine distributions, direct $1,400 payments to households, school reopenings and business aid are all on the line.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell criticized the Democrats for pressing ahead on their own. He said he had spoken to Biden ahead of his meeting with the 10 GOP senators.“They’ve chosen a totally partisan path,” McConnell said. “That’s unfortunate.”The two sides are far apart, with the Republican group of 10 senators focused primarily on the health care crisis and smaller $1,000 direct aid to Americans than the $1,400 payments Biden proposed, while the president is leading Democrats toward a more sweeping rescue plan to shore up households, local governments and a partly shuttered economy.At the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated Biden’s view that the risk is not in crafting too large a package, but in providing too little aid. She said the president was hopeful GOP ideas will be brought forward, and said nothing precludes Republicans from participating in the process.“We need to make sure people get the relief they need,” she said.White House officials have previously cited the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as evidence of broad support for their plan, but the nation's most prominent business group issued a letter Tuesday that urged a bipartisan compromise.“There ought to be common ground for a bipartisan proposal that can become law,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer, said in an interview.The cornerstone of the GOP plan is $160 billion for the health care response — vaccine distribution, a “massive expansion” of testing, protective gear and funds for rural hospitals, similar to what Biden has proposed.But from there, the two plans drastically diverge. Biden proposes $170 billion for schools, compared to $20 billion in the Republican plan. Republicans also would give nothing to states, money that Democrats argue is just as important, with $350 billion in Biden’s plan to keep police, fire and other workers on the job.The GOP's $1,000 direct payments would go to fewer households, individuals earning up to $40,000 a year, or $80,000 for couples. That’s less than Biden’s proposal of $1,400 direct payments at higher income levels, up to $300,000 for some households..The Republicans offer $40 billion for Paycheck Protection Program business aid. But gone are Democratic priorities such as a gradual lifting of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.According to Schumer, Biden told Democratic senators he had let the Republicans know “he’s willing to make some modifications."But both Biden and Yellen recalled the lessons of the government response to the 2009 financial crisis, which some have since said was inadequate as conditions worsened. Biden said he told the Republicans their offer was “way too small,” Schumer said.Winning the support of 10 Republicans would be significant, potentially giving Biden the votes needed in the 50-50 Senate to the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation. Vice President Kamala Harris is the tie-breaker.Wary Democrats pushed ahead with Tuesday's vote, unwilling to take too much time in courting GOP support that may not materialize or may lead to too meager a package.The procedural steps are groundwork for eventual approval under the budget reconciliation process that would allow the bill to pass with a 51-vote majority in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes typically needed.The vote Tuesday opens 50 hours of debate on a budget resolution, with amendment votes expected later this week. The House is poised to launch a similar process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-yellen-say-gop-coronavirus-aid-too-small-democrats-push-on-101612334551522.html
03-02-2021||World||Myanmar's military junta plans probe of last year's election||Myanmar's new leader said the military government installed after Monday's coup plans an investigation into alleged fraud in last year's elections and will also prioritize the COVID-19 outbreak and the economy, a state newspaper reported Wednesday.Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing announced the moves Tuesday at the first meeting of his new government in the capital, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said.The military had said one of its reasons for ousting the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi was because it failed to properly investigate its allegations of alleged widespread electoral irregularities. The state Union Election Commission four days before the military takeover had declared there were no significant problems with the vote.The military has declared it will hold power under a state of emergency for a year, and then hold elections whose winner will take over government.In the November 2020 election, Suu Kyi’s party captured 396 out of 476 seats contested in the lower and upper houses of Parliament. The main opposition party, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, won only 33 seats.The military, known as the Tatmadaw, is automatically allocated 25% of the seat in the combined houses under the 2008 Constitution that came into effect under a previous military government.The state newspaper reported that Min Aung Hlaing told Cabinet members that a new Union Election Commission, with what he described as independent and unbiased personnel, “would examine the voting data to find correct results, and actions would be taken accordingly in the process.”″ He said voter lists would be scrutinized against family household registrations.Min Aung Hlaing also said that COVID-19 containment measures taken by Suu Kyi’s government would be continued.Myanmar has confirmed more than 140,600 cases including some 3,100 deaths. Its health care infrastructure is one of the weakest in Asia, according to U.N. surveys.The general also urged measures to boost the COVID-19-impacted economy, especially the agricultural sector upon which the 70% of the country’s population who live in rural areas depend.Suu Kyi and other senior members of her National League for Democracy party serving in government remain under detention after being rounded up on Monday, as do an unknown number of lower-ranking officials and political activists around the country.The NLD has called for non-violent resistance to the military takeover.On Tuesday night, scores of people in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, honked car horns and banged on pots and pans Tuesday in a noise protest called by activists. They included shouts wishing Suu Kyi good health and calling for freedom.Supporters of the military have also staged demonstrations, attracting as many as 3,000 people to a Tuesday rally.The takeover presents a test for the international community. U.S. President Joe Biden called the military’s actions “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law” and threatened new sanctions. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Tuesday but took no action.The takeover marked a shocking fall from power for Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who had lived under house arrest for years as she tried to push her country toward democracy and then became its de facto leader after her party won elections in 2015.Suu Kyi had been a fierce critic of the army during her years in detention. But after her shift from democracy icon to politician, she worked with the generals, who despite allowing elections maintained control of key ministries and guaranteed themselves enough seats in Parliament to have veto power over any constitutional changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-military-junta-plans-probe-of-last-year-s-election-101612334073001.html
03-02-2021||World||Explainer: Myanmar, Burma and why the different names matter||This week, the military upended years of quasi-democratic rule in Myanmar, with soldiers taking control of the country in a carefully orchestrated coup. The military said the seizure of power was necessary because the government had failed to act on its unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in November elections, which the party of the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, won in a landslide. It claims the takeover was constitutional.But where exactly did the coup happen? Was it in Myanmar, as the the country is officially called? Or was it in Burma, the name Washington continues to use?The answer is complicated. Because when it comes to Myanmar, pretty much everything is political. Including language.Also read| The genesis of the military coup in MyanmarWHY ARE THERE TWO NAMES FOR ONE COUNTRY?For generations, the country was called Burma, after the dominant Burman ethnic group. But in 1989, one year after the ruling junta brutally suppressed a pro-democracy uprising, military leaders suddenly changed its name to Myanmar.By then, Burma was an international pariah, desperate for any way to improve its image. Hoping for a sliver of international legitimacy, it said it was discarding a name handed down from its colonial past and to foster ethnic unity. The old name, officials said, excluded the country’s many ethnic minorities.At home, though, it changed nothing. In the Burmese language, “Myanmar” is simply the more formal version of “Burma.” The country’s name was changed only in English.It was linguistic sleight-of-hand. But few people were fooled. Much of the world showed defiance of the junta by refusing to use the new name.Also read| US in touch with India, Japan on Myanmar coupWHEN DID THINGS CHANGE?A little over a decade ago, the country began a stumbling semi-democratic transition. The military retained extensive political power, but opposition leaders were freed from prison and house arrest, and elections were allowed. Longtime pro-democracy activist Suu Kyi became the country’s civilian leader.Over the years, many countries and news outlets, including The Associated Press, had begun using the country’s official name. As repression eased and international opposition to the military became less vocal, “Myanmar" became increasingly common. Inside the country, opposition leaders made clear it didn’t matter much anymore.Unlike most of the world, the U.S. government still officially uses “Burma.” But even Washington has mellowed its stance.In 2012, during a visit to the country, then-President Barack Obama used both “Burma” and “Myanmar.” An adviser to Myanmar’s president called that “very positive” and said it was an “acknowledgement of Myanmar’s government.”Also read| Why did the military stage a coup in Myanmar?WHAT NOW?Washington’s response to the coup seemed designed to highlight old criticisms, with both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden pointedly avoiding the country’s legal name.“The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy,” Biden said in a statement. “The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws.”Most other countries, though, continued to call it Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-myanmar-burma-and-why-the-different-names-matter-101612326144898.html
03-02-2021||World||US, Europe condemn Russia’s imprisonment of Navalny||Russia imprisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny for two years and eight months, drawing renewed condemnation from Western leaders as President Vladimir Putin seeks to crush a resurgence in protests against his rule.A Moscow court converted a suspended sentence that Navalny, 44, received for a 2014 fraud conviction into a prison term for alleged violations of his probation. His 3-and-a-half-year sentence will be reduced by the 10 months he spent under house arrest in the case, the judge in a Moscow court ruled Tuesday.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated calls for Navalny’s immediate release after the ruling. “We will coordinate closely with our allies and partners to hold Russia accountable for failing to uphold the rights of its citizens,” he said.Navalny was arrested in mid-January as he returned from Germany, where he recovered from a near-fatal attack involving a nerve agent applied to his underwear that he and Western governments blamed on Putin’s security services. The Kremlin denies responsibility. The prison term could isolate Navalny but risks escalating the confrontation between the authorities and opposition supporters.“Someone didn’t want me to return to Russia a free man. We know who,” Navalny said in a defiant statement to the court, branding Putin “Vladimir the underpants poisoner.” His comments drew objections from the prosecutor and a warning from the judge that “this isn’t a demonstration here.”Some of the biggest crowds in recent years have joined unsanctioned protests across the country since Navalny was detained. The unrest has resulted in more than 9,000 detentions at rallies in dozens of cities in the last two weekends. More than 1,400 protesters were detained Tuesday, mostly in the capital where Navalny’s supporters called for protests near the Kremlin after the sentencing, according to monitoring group OVD-Info.Leaders across Europe spoke out against Navalny’s imprisonment. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she condemned the sentencing “in the strongest possible terms.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Twitter that the ruling was “far from any rule of law.” France’s President Emmanuel Macron called the sentencing “unacceptable,” while in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet that the ruling was “pure cowardice and fails to meet the most basic standards of justice.”While the Kremlin’s move to jail Putin’s most prominent critic aims to put a stop to his political activities, Navalny’s backers say he’ll become a powerful symbol of resistance behind bars.“There are lots of Navalnys,” Ivan Zhdanov, director of the activist’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said on TV Rain.A major test will come when Russia holds parliamentary elections in September.“The main point of this trial isn’t how it turns out for me -- putting me in jail isn’t hard,” Navalny told the court from the glass defendant’s cage. “They’re imprisoning one person to frighten millions.” His lawyers vowed to appeal.More PressureIn a separate case, Navalny also faces possible new fraud charges that could carry an additional 10-year punishment.“This is a message to the security services that we’re firm and won’t give in,” said Alexei Makarkin, vice president at the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. “And it’s a message to the opposition: international notoriety and support don’t give you even minimal immunity.”Navalny received the suspended sentence in a fraud trial involving the Russian branch of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher that also led to a 3 1/2 year jail term for his younger brother, Oleg. Both men denied wrongdoing, and the European Court of Human Rights has called the case politically motivated.Defense attorneys cited that ruling and argued that Navalny was recuperating in Germany last year and couldn’t check in with probation authorities. The prison service contended that he had breached the terms of the sentence before going to Germany as well.Putin, 68, has been in power since 2000, the longest rule since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. In July, he pushed through constitutional changes that would allow him to stay as president until 2036. Last year his support fell to a record low amid the Covid-19 downturn, and the continuing slide in incomes is weighing on the Russian leader’s popularity, pollsters say.Navalny raised the focus on officials’ opulent lifestyles in a video released after his arrest that got more than 100 million views and alleged that Putin owns a giant $1.3 billion Black Sea palace. Putin dismissed the claim and a billionaire ally, Arkady Rotenberg, said last week that he is the beneficial owner of the residence.“The opposition outside the system is seen by the Kremlin as a hostile force, a threat to national security, which requires harsh, merciless, repressive tactics against Navalny” and his allies, said Tatiana Stanovaya, head of political consultancy R.Politik. “This is only the beginning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-europe-condemn-russia-s-imprisonment-of-navalny-101612333232795.html

Google says it has 95%.Swinburne University senior lecturer on media Belinda Barnet said Bing and other search engines could fill the void left by Google and deliver benefits.“People need to realize it will not be personalized in the sense that Google advertising in searches is, so Bing doesn’t know and frankly doesn’t care that you’re in the market for yoga pants, for example,” Barnet said.“Some of these platforms, Google and Facebook in particular, feed you more misinformation if you’re already prone to clicking on misnformation, so they create this echo chamber, in a sense,” she said. “But a product like DuckDuckGo and Ecosia is not going to know that in the past you’ve looked at 100 articles about how vaccines are bad and they will just give you the most accurate information that they can find.”Peter Strong, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organizations Australia, an advocacy group, expected the disruption to small businesses created by Google’s departure from Australia would be short lived.“We're not panicking,” Strong said. “But it would have a short-term impact.”“It would be a bad thing if Google quits, but if Bing took over, the situation would be the same,” he added. “One organization has the capacity to blackmail a country and that should never happen," he said, calling for more government regulation.A Senate committee that is scrutinising the draft legislation will report to the government next week.The mandatory code proposed by the government aims to make Google and Facebook pay Australian media companies fairly for using news content the tech giants siphon from news sites.There are no plans to make smaller search engines such as Bing pay for linking users to Australian news, but the government has not ruled that option out.Google has faced pressure from authorities elsewhere to pay for news. Last month, it signed a deal with a group of French publishers paving the way for the company to make digital copyright payments. Under the agreement, Google will negotiate individual licensing deals with newspapers, with payments based on factors such as the amount published daily and monthly internet site traffic.But Google is resisting the Australian plan because it would have less control over how much it would have to pay. Under the Australian system, if an online platform and a news business can’t agree on a price for news, an arbitration panel will make a binding decision on payment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-backs-australian-plan-to-make-google-pay-for-news-101612331319391.html

The Canadian company, which was not identified, is looking at importing 50,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in the UK and manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India under the Covishield brand. This is not part of the Canadian programme, even though it has ordered millions of doses from AstraZeneca.Canada has among the highest per capita volumes of orders of Covid-19 vaccines, with deals in place with Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax, accounting for over 350 million doses in total.However, its vaccination programme, which began in December after emergency authorisation was given to the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, has come to a standstill due to supply issues caused by the former delaying sending its jabs while it ramps up production at a plant in Belgium and also the European Commission placing export controls on vaccines made within the bloc.While AstraZeneca is among the companies that has sought its vaccine’s clearance by Canadian public health authorities, there was no response to queries from Hindustan Times sent to the office of the minister of public services and procurement, Anita Anand, over whether these will be sourced, even partly, from India.Anand, however, told CBC News that shipments from the EU should be expected to resume very soon. While some batches have started arriving, she said “all systems are a go for these shipments”.Canadian officials led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have spoken to EU officials, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, on the vaccine issue. During a media interaction, Trudeau said, “The conversations I had with the president of the European Commission were enough to reassure me, and should be enough to reassure all Canadians, that the EU is extremely mindful that Canada’s contracts be respected, and that our supply of vaccines not be interfered with.”Canada also entered into an agreement on Tuesday with the American company Novavax for manufacturing their vaccine in the country, though those vials are unlikely to be available before the end of 2021. The botched vaccine campaign has taken a toll on the popularity of the PM and his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canadian-pharma-company-plans-to-import-covishield-doses-from-india-101612329949929.html

In four years of negotiations, the EU had made avoiding a hard border a precondition for any accord, saying it was necessary to protect the peace process.‘Menacing Behavior’Updating members of Parliament on Tuesday, Gove was blunt about the damage the EU had done, saying the European Commission in Brussels had “mucked up.”“In recent days we’ve seen an increase in community tension,” Gove said. “We will work over coming days to fix the difficulties on the ground.”Officials from both the EU and the UK have temporarily halted some checks at the region’s ports after what Mid & East Antrim Council called “an upsurge in sinister and menacing behavior.” That included “graffiti within the local area referencing increasing tensions around the Northern Ireland Protocol and describing Port staff as targets.”The EU told staff working in Northern Ireland not to go to work Tuesday, a day after the region stopped physical inspections of products of animal origin at the ports of Belfast and Larne amid security concerns. Document checks will continue, and the measure will be kept under review, Northern Ireland’s agriculture ministry said in a statement.“It is obvious that for us the first and utmost priority is the safety of people,” European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said. “We are in contact with the UK authorities on this matter, both from a security perspective and from the perspective of the implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”‘Ugly Development’The threats are a “sinister and ugly development,” Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin told reporters in Dublin. “We will be doing everything we possibly can to assist and to defuse the situation,” he said.Democratic Unionist Party lawmaker Ian Paisley linked the growing tensions to the operation of the protocol, which effectively keeps the UK region of Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union after Brexit and entails checks on goods coming across the Irish Sea.Unionists such as Paisley have opposed the protocol because it draws a customs border between the UK and Northern Ireland.“I condemn all threats to staff outrightly,” Paisley said. “The protocol was bound to end in tears.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-gove-meets-eu-s-sefcovic-for-talks-on-northern-ireland-border-101612328656921.html

The United States continues to remain the worst affected nation by the deadly disease though the number of cases and deaths from the viral disease have started to decline. The situation in the United Kingdom, the country with the fourth highest number of coronavirus cases, remains equally tense with the emergence of the new variant of the virus that causes the infection.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereAs vaccination under the Joe Biden administration in the US gathers pace, Covid-19 deaths have begun to decline in every section of the country. As of Wednesday morning, there were a total of 446,731 fatalities in the US and 26,430,237 positive cases, according to Johns Hopkins University’s dashboard. According to news agency Bloomberg, now, the seven-day average has shown signs of having peaked in all four US Census Bureau regions, even the laggard South. The declines will buy states time as they attempt an unprecedented vaccination effort to get shots to most of the country’s 330 million people, Bloomberg reported.Also Read: Covid-19 variant in UK picks up worrying South Africa mutationIn the past week, the US has administered about 1.35 million doses of Covid vaccines a day, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. Around 31.8 million doses have been given in the country overall.Meanwhile, Britain, which has been forced into another lockdown following the spike in cases, recorded 1,449 deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19 on Tuesday, up from 406 a day earlier, with a further 16,840 cases of the disease, a decrease from a day earlier, Reuters reported. Official data showed that 9.65 million people have been given the first dose of a vaccine, up from a figure of 9.29 million people announced on Monday.The steep spike in the number of fatalities due to the disease comes a day after the deaths dropped to 406 on Monday, the lowest daily figure since December 28.The nation continues to worry as its UK variant of the coronavirus has developed a new, concerning mutation in a small number of cases, which scientists said makes it similar to the South African and Brazilian variants and could reduce the efficacy of vaccines, Reuters reported, with Public Health England saying there had been 11 reports of the UK variant which feature the E484K mutation, mostly in south-west England. The E484K mutation, which occurs on the spike protein of the virus, is the same change as has been seen in the South African and Brazilian variants that have caused international concern, the report added.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-drop-uk-witnesses-sharp-one-day-rise-in-fatalities-101612320514844.html

03-02-2021||World||Treasury secretary Yellen to name ex-IMF official Lipton as adviser: Reports||David Lipton, an economist who served as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund and U.S. Treasury, will return to government service as a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, six sources familiar with the matter said.Lipton will focus on the U.S. role within the Group of Seven advanced economies and the larger Group of 20 economies in a temporary role, several sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. His appointment comes as the world's top economies are struggling to manage the coronavirus pandemic and ensure a nascent global recovery stays on course.The White House and Treasury had no comment. Lipton did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Bringing Lipton on board to guide international matters will free Yellen to focus on the U.S. economy and work to ensure passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan, the sources said. The plan has run into resistance from Republicans in Congress, and Democrats on Tuesday took a first step toward fast-tracking the bill without Republican support. [nL1N2K81MU]"Lipton's presence in the Yellen Treasury is a huge boost for the department's international efforts. He brings immediate credibility and signals that the Biden administration intends to hit the ground running in responding to the economic dimensions of this crisis globally," said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former Treasury official."That would be great news!" tweeted German Finance State Secretary Wolfgang Schmidt.Lipton's experience on international economic issues and his tenure as Treasury undersecretary for international affairs from 1993 to 1998 in the administration of former President Bill Clinton will help Washington as it seeks to rebuild ties with allies and multilateral institutions, people familiar with his assignment said.Several of the sources said Lipton's assignment would help bridge a gap in staffing as Yellen assembles her team.The Senate has not yet scheduled a confirmation hearing for Yellen's nominated deputy, Wally Adeyemo, and the Biden administration has not yet announced its pick for the international post at Treasury, or who will serve as the G7/G20 sherpa, a job normally housed at the White House.The sources welcomed Lipton's return to official life after IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva ousted him as her top deputy one year ago, some 19 months before his official term was due to expire. He had served nearly 8-1/2 years in the role.Widely respected in economic circles, Lipton, 67, was often critical of former President Donald Trump's trade policies and tariff actions, which triggered heavy costs for U.S. companies and farmers and spawned significant tensions with allies.Lipton began his professional career as an economist at the IMF in 1981, and in addition to his role in the Clinton administration, he held a senior role in the administration of former President Barack Obama.Allies are looking for more muscular U.S. leadership on global issues ranging from climate change, battling the pandemic and staving off a wave of sovereign debt defaults among low-income countries. IMF officials have warned of continued uncertainty and divergent economic trends that threaten to push an additional 90 million people into poverty, as even advanced economies struggle to distribute COVID-19 vaccines.Lipton will also likely have to wade into global talks on taxation after those negotiations came to a standstill under former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.It was not immediately clear when Lipton would start in his new role, but the move could happen quickly since the job does not require Senate confirmation.G7 finance officials are due to meet remotely on Feb. 15, while G20 finance officials are due to meet Feb. 26-27, with debt issues and the financing needs of low-income and emerging market economies a priority.Consensus is building for a new allocation of IMF Special Drawing Rights, a move akin to a central bank printing money, that was blocked by Mnuchin. Such a move would provide extra reserves to every IMF member at a time when funding needs remain large, especially for low-income countries hit hard by COVID-19.The Biden administration has signaled support for a new allocation of SDRs, and legislation to back such a move is working its way through the now Democratic-controlled Congress.Yellen spoke with both the IMF's Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass on Tuesday, underscoring the need for close coordination and efforts to reduce debt vulnerabilities and support recovery in low-income countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/treasury-secretary-yellen-to-name-ex-imf-official-lipton-as-adviser-reports-101612319544156.html
03-02-2021||World||Mexico approves Russia's Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V||Mexico approved the Russian coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V for use Tuesday, just hours after the publication of early results of an advanced study saying it is about 91% effective.Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell, the government’s pandemic spokesman, said the health ministry signed a contract Monday for 400,000 doses of Sputnik V that will arrive this month. That is still a tiny amount for Mexico's 126 million people.It couldn't come a moment too soon. Mexico has been hit so hard that hospitals in the capital were 87% full, and ambulance drivers waited hours to find an open bed for patients. Mexico has reported about 159,500 test-confirmed deaths related to COVID-19, but excess-death estimates place the real toll at well over 195,000.“Unfortunately, because of the saturation of the hospitals and the phone lines, we are waiting about three or four hours before they can assign us a hospital, and to get there,” said ambulance crew chief Eduardo Vigueras.Vigueras noted patients are sometimes sent to the only available beds at hospitals, far away from the overwhelmed east side borough of Iztapalapa. He said some relatives get angry and aggressive with paramedics because of the delays in treatment.Because some patients are in such bad shape, some families make an even harder choice. Paramedics say they often go to pick up a seriously ill coronavirus patient only to find their loved ones want to cancel the emergency call, because they know treatment is in such short supply and they may never see their relative again.“A lot of people prefer to keep their relative at home, knowing that they are going to die, but with their loved ones there for the last few minutes, hours, days,” paramedic Paulina Cervantes said.That desperation was on display Tuesday, when the Mexican government launched a new website for people over age 60 to register for appointments to get vaccines that the country doesn't yet have.So many people logged on that the Health Department apparently didn’t have the bandwidth to handle requests. The department’s website was quickly overwhelmed and the registration page didn’t load, returning a message: “Due to the overload of registrations, service has been interrupted. We are correcting and strengthening our infrastructure to avoid such interruptions."The Russian vaccine would become the third to receive emergency approval in Mexico. The regulating agency approved the Pfizer vaccine in December and AstraZeneca’s in January. Mexico turned to the Russian vaccine following delays in obtaining others it was counting on.A dozen countries have already approved the Russian vaccine for use, including Bolivia and Argentina, where López-Gatell visited in January to learn more about it. He acknowledged that there had a been a “legitimate concern” among Mexicans, but that the early results published Tuesday in the medical journal The Lancet should alleviate them.“The Russian Sputnik V vaccine is safe, it has 92% efficacy against COVID, it can be used safely and is effective in seniors,” López-Gatell said. “It allows us now to accelerate the step of vaccination against COVID in Mexico.”Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador spoke with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a week ago.Mexico has so far given about 675,000 doses of vaccine, all of them from Pfizer. On Tuesday, a second batch of the active substance in the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in Mexico, where it will be packed and distributed through the rest of Latin America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-approves-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-101612319329326.html

We are deeply concerned about the impact of events on the economy and on the people of Myanmar," an IMF spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Tuesday, confirming that the payment was completed last week.U.S. President Joe Biden, facing his first international crisis since taking office less than two weeks ago, has threatened new sanctions against the generals, and the State Department said it would review its foreign assistance to the southeast Asian country.The United States is the dominant shareholder in the IMF, which has provided Myanmar with $700 million in emergency coronavirus financing over the past seven months, including last week's payment, which included $116.6 million through the IMF's Rapid Credit Facility and $233.4 million through the Rapid Financing Instrument.The Fund said in a statement on Jan. 13 that the money would help Myanmar meet "urgent balance-of-payments needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the government’s recovery measures to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability while supporting affected sectors and vulnerable groups."Unlike the IMF's regular financing programs, which have performance benchmarks, the emergency aid is provided quickly, with no way to yank it back."It's not a program that was negotiated, there isn't conditionality and there aren't forward-looking reviews with disbursements tied to those reviews," said Stephanie Segal, a former IMF economist and U.S. Treasury official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington."I'm not aware of any precedent where money that's been approved by the IMF board can be recalled," Segal added.Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis last year, the IMF has provided emergency financing to 80 countries.The timing of the latest disbursement to Myanmar was unfortunate, two sources familiar with the payments said, and pointed to the risks of using rapid financing that gives governments broad discretion over how they spend the money.The best-case scenario is that the Myanmar government that emerges from the current political turmoil will spend the money appropriately because it wants to have a productive relationship with the Fund, one of the sources said.The IMF's counterparty in Myanmar is the central bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/days-before-coup-imf-sent-myanmar-emergency-aid-says-cannot-get-it-back-101612318166392.html

03-02-2021||World||Elon Musk keeps sparring with regulators as Joe Biden cabinet takes reins||Elon Musk has a long history of run-ins with the local, state and federal officials who oversee his growing empires at Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. The world’s richest person shows no signs of changing his ways as US President Joe Biden takes office and bolsters the regulatory agencies defanged by his predecessor.In the past week alone, Musk has tangled with the Federal Aviation Administration over a December rocket test flight that ended in flames and begrudgingly agreed to recall some Tesla cars at highway-safety officials’ urging. And while he announced Tuesday he was taking a break from Twitter -- the platform that previously got him fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- Musk had already used his favorite social-media megaphone in the preceding days to roil stocks of companies from Etsy Inc. to Shopify Inc. during a retail-trading frenzy.The potential for more conflict is building as Biden works to confirm his cabinet secretaries and reinvigorate agencies following the Donald Trump era. Democratic administrations have historically been tougher on industry regulation, and Musk’s empire intersects with government oversight of automobiles, spaceflight, energy, telecommunications and medical equipment.On Tuesday, the FAA said that Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. had ignored the agency back on Dec. 9 to go ahead with a test launch of its massive Starship rocket -- a test that ended in a blazing fireball when the prototype malfunctioned on landing. The FAA said it had rejected SpaceX’s request to exceed the maximum public risk for that launch.The FAA’s comments added some clarity to the dispute that triggered an angry tweet from Musk on Jan. 28 in which he accused the agency of having a “fundamentally broken regulatory structure.” Musk’s ire against the FAA was triggered after another SpaceX test flight was delayed.Without giving much detail, the FAA in a Tuesday email said that SpaceX was now in compliance and could proceed with another test. Within hours, the unmanned Starship SN-9 lifted off from SpaceX’s seaside launch pad at 2:25 p.m. Tuesday in Boca Chica, Texas, flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) -- and exploded as it attempted to land, much like the earlier rocket.Meanwhile, Tesla has been engaged in a long back and forth with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the failure of touch screens in some of its Model S and Model X vehicles. Last month, NHTSA sent a letter to Tesla saying it had determined the failures constituted a defect. Tesla responded that it “respectfully disagrees” with the finding but will voluntarily initiate a recall. Impacted Tesla customers received emails that said they will be notified “when the parts become available.”“Tesla makes it very clear that they don’t think this is necessary, but they are doing this to make the issue go away,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business, in a phone interview Tuesday. “If NHTSA had not written the recall request letter, Tesla would not have done this.”Musk, 49, is widely heralded for disrupting the auto industry with high performance electric cars and upending Big Aerospace with reusable rockets.His companies are growing: Tesla is building two new factories in Berlin and in Austin, Texas, while SpaceX -- which has contracts with the Air Force and NASA -- is rolling out Starlink, its high speed Internet service, to rural and remote customers across the US, Canada and the UK. There’s also the Boring Co., his tunnel-construction business, and Neuralink, which is testing its brain machine interface device on monkeys and pigs and hopes to begin human trials this year.Musk’s frustration with regulators is legendary.He once hung up during a testy call with the head of the National Transportation Safety Board over Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system; the NTSB was irked in part by the company’s public comments about a crash probe. Tesla has aggressively pushed out Autopilot -- including what it calls a Full Self-Driving upgrade -- much to the consternation of some safety advocates, even as driverless tech rivals like Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit in recent weeks have taken pains to be more transparent and circumspect with their claims.When public health officials in California’s Alameda County ordered Tesla to close its factory last spring, Musk railed against the shut down orders as “fascist” on the company’s earnings call. And despite settling with the SEC over his failed go-private bid in 2018, Musk has continued to taunt the agency, referring to them as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission.”The settlement stripped Musk of the chairmanship of Tesla’s board for three years, meaning he could potentially resume the role this fall -- just as the Biden administration is re-establishing the government’s role in oversight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-keeps-sparring-with-regulators-as-joe-biden-cabinet-takes-reins-101612315101582.html
03-02-2021||World||'He invited us': Accused Capitol rioters blame Trump in legal defense||Emanuel Jackson, a 20-year-old Washington area man, was caught on video using a metal bat to strike the protective shields wielded by police officers as they tried to fend off rioters storming the US Capitol on Jan. 6.Jackson, awaiting trial in federal court on assault charges, is now adopting a novel legal defense: seeking to pin the blame on Donald Trump, citing the former president's remarks at a "Stop the Steal" rally shortly before the Capitol siege.Trump told the crowd to "fight like hell," said "we will not take it anymore" and repeated his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. Trump exhorted his followers to go to the Capitol. The ensuing rampage interrupted the congressional certification of President Joe Biden's election victory, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five people dead including a police officer.Jackson's lawyer, Brandi Harden, wrote in a Jan. 22 court filing that "the nature and circumstances of this offense must be viewed through the lens of an event inspired by the President of the United States."Also Read | Trump 'provoked violence': Lawmakers say in impeachment trial briefThe Capitol siege, Harden added, "appears to have been spontaneous and sparked by the statements made during the 'Stop the Steal' rally." Harden argued that Jackson should be released while awaiting trial. A judge on Jan. 22 denied the request.At least six of the 170 people charged in connection with the Capitol siege have tried to shift at least some of the blame onto Trump as they defend themselves in court or in the court of public opinion.Other defendants to take this route include Jacob Chansley, who donned a horned headdress and face paint during the attack, and Dominic Pezzola, a member of the Proud Boys right-wing extremist group who is accused of shattering a window in the Capitol with a stolen police shield so rioters could enter."The boss of the country said, 'People of the country, come on down, let people know what you think,'" Pezzola's defense lawyer, Michael Scibetta, told Reuters. "The logical thinking was, 'He invited us down.'"Lawyers have not yet sought dismissal of charges or acquittal during a trial based on the idea that Trump incited their clients, instead making the claim as part of efforts to spare them from pretrial detention.No defendant will be able to avoid criminal culpability by saying they were incited by Trump, said Jay Town, who served as the top federal prosecutor in Birmingham, Alabama, during the Trump administration."If anything, it is an admission to criminal conduct," said Town, now the general counsel of cybersecurity firm Gray Analytics. "While this ineffective tactic may help with headlines, it will not help the fate of any defendant."Trump took to a stage near the White House and exhorted supporters to "fight" - using the word more than 20 times. Trump told the crowd that "everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol." About 50 minutes into the speech, many of them did.Trump adviser Jason Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the legal strategy of blaming the former president. Trump has called his speech "totally appropriate."Impeachment trialThe Democratic-led House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on a charge of "incitement of insurrection" stemming from his Jan. 6 speech. He faces an impeachment trial next week in the Senate.Enough of his fellow Republicans in the Senate have signaled opposition to impeachment to indicate that the chamber almost certainly will fall short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict him. Democrats hope to use the trial to disqualify him from future public office.Lori Ulrich, a defense lawyer in Pennsylvania, said that her client Riley June Williams was motivated by Trump's remarks. Williams, 22, is accused of stealing a laptop from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office during the siege.It is "regrettable that Ms. Williams took the president's bait and went inside the Capitol," Ulrich told a judge at a Jan. 21 court hearing as she argued against Williams being detained while her case proceeds. The judge released Williams to home confinement.Some legal experts said the "blame Trump" defense could complicate matters for defendants if they eventually plead guilty in hopes of getting a lesser sentence. Town noted that federal judges require defendants who plead guilty to accept full responsibility for their conduct.Scibetta acknowledged the limits of the effectiveness of blaming Trump."It would be reckless to put all your eggs in that basket," Scibetta said.But Scibetta said Trump's speech helps explain how people got swept away in the riot."These were people acting in a way they have never acted before," Scibetta said, "and it begs the question, 'Who lit the fuse?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-invited-us-accused-capitol-rioters-blame-trump-in-legal-defense-101612314980901.html
03-02-2021||World||‘Climate change, not Genghis Khan, destroyed central Asia’||Decreasing river flow caused by climate change was a cause for the abandonment of previously flourishing city states in Central Asia’s medieval river civilisations, new research has shown.The research led by the University of Lincoln, UK, reconstructed the effects of climate change on floodwater farming in present southern Kazakhstan. It challenges the assumption that the area was destroyed by the Mongol invasion of Genghis Khan in the early 13th century.The examination of long-term river dynamics and ancient irrigation networks showed the changing climate and dryer conditions may have been the real cause. “It was climate change, not Genghis Khan, that was the ultimate cause for the demise of Central Asia’s forgotten river civilisations,” Mark Macklin, the study’s author from the University of Lincoln, said in a release from the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-not-genghis-khan-destroyed-central-asia-101612314827166.html
03-02-2021||World||Citizens in Myanmar protest coup with noise barrage||Scores of people in Myanmar's largest city honked car horns and banged on pots and pans on Tuesday evening in the first known public resistance to the coup led a day earlier by the country's military.What was initially planned to take place for just a few minutes extended to more than a quarter hour in several neighborhoods of Yangon. Shouts could be heard wishing detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi good health and calling for freedom.“Beating a drum in Myanmar culture is like we are kicking out the devils,” said one participant who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals.Several pro-democracy groups had asked people to make noise at 8 pm to show their opposition to the coup.A senior politician and close confidante of Suu Kyi also urged citizens to defy the military through civil disobedience.Win Htein, a leader of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, spoke Tuesday from a small party office in the capital, Naypyitaw, not far from where hundreds of lawmakers elected in November national polls were detained when the military seized power Monday in a lightning takeover.“The curse of the coup is rooted in our country and this is the reason why our country still remains poor. I feel sad and upset for our fellow citizens and for their future,” the former political prisoner said.“All the voters who gave their backing to us in the 2020 general election should follow Aung San Suu Kyi’s instructions to carry out civil disobedience,” he said, referring to a note posted Monday on Facebook attributed to her.The military began to lift restrictions Tuesday on the hundreds of members of Parliament who had been confined at a guarded government housing complex, with the new government telling them to go back to their homes, party spokesman Kyi Toe said.He said Suu Kyi was in good health at a separate location where she was being held and would stay there for the time being. His comments couldn't immediately be confirmed.The coup came as lawmakers gathered in the capital for the opening of a new parliamentary session. The military said the seizure was necessary because the government had not acted on the military’s unsubstantiated claims of fraud in November’s election, in which Suu Kyi’s party won a majority of seats. It claimed the takeover was legal under the constitution. The move was widely condemned abroad.The coup highlights the extent to which the generals ultimately maintained control in Myanmar, despite more than a decade of talk about democratic reforms. Western countries had greeted the move toward democracy enthusiastically, removing sanctions they had in place for years.Myanmar is facing a growing coronavirus outbreak. As of Tuesday, it had over 140,300 confirmed cases, including about 3,100 deaths. The country has just received its first supply of vaccines from India.Win Htein heavily criticized the generals for the impact he said the coup would have on efforts to protect people’s lives.“These people, they are super crazy to do this. They are not courageous,” he said. “The virus still remains and the people are struggling a lot. Their only priority is power and their personal desire." As a result, he said, "vaccines will be delayed, the economy will go down and there will be pressure from other countries.”The takeover presents a test for the international community. U.S. President Joe Biden called the military’s actions “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law” and threatened new sanctions. The U.N. Security Council was expected to meet later Tuesday about the military’s actions.Suu Kyi’s party released a statement Tuesday calling for the military to honor the results of the election and release all of those detained — as have the leaders of many other countries.“The commander in chief seizing the power of the nation is against the constitution and it also neglects the sovereign power of people,” the party said.An announcement read on military-owned Myawaddy TV on Monday said Commander in Chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing would be in charge of the country for one year. A new Cabinet composed of current and former generals and former advisers to a previous government headed by former Gen. Thein Sein held its first meeting Tuesday.The takeover marked a shocking fall from power for Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who had lived under house arrest for years as she tried to push her country toward democracy and then became its de facto leader after her party won elections in 2015.Suu Kyi had been a fierce critic of the army during her years in detention. But after her shift from democracy icon to politician, she worked with the generals, who despite allowing elections maintained control of key ministries and guaranteed themselves enough seats in Parliament to have veto power over any constitutional changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/citizens-in-myanmar-protest-coup-with-noise-barrage-101612314802911.html
03-02-2021||World||Democrats make case for conviction; Trump denies charges||Donald Trump endangered the lives of all members of Congress when he aimed a mob of supporters “like a loaded cannon” at the US Capitol, House Democrats said Tuesday in making their most detailed case yet for why the former president should be convicted and permanently barred from office. Trump denied the allegations through his lawyers and called the trial unconstitutional.The Democratic legal brief forcefully linked Trump's baseless efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election to the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, saying he bears “unmistakable” blame for actions that threatened the foundation of American democracy.Also Read | Trump 'provoked violence': Lawmakers say in impeachment trial briefIt argued that he must be found guilty when his impeachment trial opens before the Senate next week on a charge of inciting the siege. And it used evocative language to conjure the day's chaos, when “terrified members were trapped in the chamber" and called loved ones “for fear they would not survive.”“His conduct endangered the life of every single member of Congress, jeopardized the peaceful transition of power and line of succession, and compromised our national security," the Democratic managers of the impeachment case wrote.“This is precisely the sort of constitutional offense that warrants disqualification from federal office.”Trump's lawyers responded with their own filing that denied that he had incited the riot by disputing the election results or by exhorting his followers to “fight like hell.” In any event, they said, the trial was unconstitutional now that Trump has left the White House.The dueling filings offer the first public glimpse of the arguments that both sides intend to present at the impeachment trial, Trump's second. They show how Democrats will look to explicitly fault Trump for his role in the riot and to also make the case that his behaviour was so egregious as to require permanent disqualification from office.On the other side will be challenges to the trial's constitutionality and claims that Trump's speech was protected by the First Amendment.“It is denied that President Trump ever endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,” defense lawyers wrote in a 14-page brief.The Constitution specifies that disqualification from office can be a punishment for an impeachment conviction.“This is not a case where elections alone are a sufficient safeguard against future abuse; it is the electoral process itself that President Trump attacked and that must be protected from him and anyone else who would seek to mimic his behavior,” the Democrats wrote.The Democrats drew heavily on the words of prominent Republicans who have criticized the former president.Among them are Wyoming Rep Liz Cheney, who voted for Trump's impeachment and said there has never been a “greater betrayal” by a president, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who said Trump “provoked” the rioters.“The only honorable path at that point was for President Trump to accept the results and concede his electoral defeat. Instead, he summoned a mob to Washington, exhorted them into a frenzy, and aimed them like a loaded cannon down Pennsylvania Avenue,” the Democrats wrote in their 77-page brief.Still, Republicans have signaled that acquittal is likely, with many saying they think Congress should move on and questioning the constitutionality of an impeachment trial — Trump's second — now that he has left office. In a test vote in the Senate last week, 45 Republicans, including McConnell, voted in favor of an effort to dismiss the trial over those constitutional concerns.Though no president has been tried after departing the White House, Democrats say there is precedent, pointing to an 1876 impeachment of a secretary of war who resigned his office in a last-ditch attempt to avoid an impeachment trial. The Senate held it anyway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-make-case-for-conviction-trump-denies-charges-101612314606123.html
03-02-2021||World||Jeff Bezos to give reins to cloud boss Andy Jassy as Amazon's sales rocket past $100 billion||Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday said founder Jeff Bezos would step down as CEO and become executive chairman, as the company reported a third consecutive record profit and quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time.The transition, slated for the summer, will make current cloud computing head Andy Jassy the next chief executive of Amazon.Jassy joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School, founding Amazon Web Services (AWS) and growing it to a cloud platform used by millions, the company's website said.Tom Johnson, chief transformation officer at Mindshare Worldwide, said Jassy's promotion underscored the importance of web services to Amazon's future."Jassy’s background in steering AWS shows just how top of mind those services are to Amazon's business strategy. It’ll be interesting to see how that affects their strategy and balancing that priority with a growing ad business and the commerce behemoth," he said.Jassy is known for understanding technical details, and he has regularly taken jabs at legacy player Oracle Corp and cloud rival Microsoft Corp, which AWS continues to exceed in sales.He has bestowed a rock-star aura to keynotes at AWS's annual Las Vegas conference, speaking before over 60,000 attendees in 2019 after upbeat music preceded his talk.Bezos, who started the company 27 years ago as an internet bookseller, said in a note to employees posted on Amazon's website, "As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions." Blue Origin is Bezos' space company, and the Post is his private newspaper holding.Bezos, age 57, added, "I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring."COVID SPENDING DOWNNet sales rose to $125.56 billion as consumers turned to the world's largest online retailer for their holiday shopping, beating analyst estimates of $119.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Amazon shares were up less than 1% in after-hours trading.Jassy's AWS, traditionally a bright spot, fell slightly short of expectations in the fourth quarter. While the cloud computing division announced deals in the quarter with ViacomCBS , the BMW Group and others, it posted revenue of $12.7 billion, short of the $12.8 billion analysts had estimated.Amazon said it was not announcing an AWS replacement for Jassy at this time.Meanwhile Amazon's e-commerce business has never been as big. Since the start of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, consumers have turned to Amazon for delivery of home staples and medical supplies. While brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors, Amazon, recruited over 400,000 more workers to keep up with demand.That has placed the Seattle-based company at the center of workplace tumult. More than 19,000 have contracted COVID-19 as of September, and some staff have protested and demanded facility closures. Others, at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse, are seeking to be the first at the company to unionize in the United States, with an election to begin next week.Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a conference call that costs associated with the pandemic in the first quarter are expected to total $2 billion, down from $4 billion in the fourth quarter as shopping volumes decrease.

Bezos will transition to the role of executive chairman in the third quarter of 2021 and Andy Jassy who is currently heading Amazon Web Services will take over as the CEO of the company, which he founded almost 27 years ago.The announcement came as Amazon released its financial results for its fourth quarter that ended December 31, 2020. The company recorded USD 100 billion in sales for last three months of 2020.Also Read | Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to step down from company's CEO role this yearAmazon is built from a startup into one of the world's most valuable firms by Bezos. It was launched in 1995 and currently worth nearly $1.7 trillion.In a letter to employees, Bezos said he will now focus on "new products and early initiatives" being developed by Amazon. He also said that he would have more time for side projects, including his space exploration company Blue Origin, his philanthropic initiatives and overseeing The Washington Post, which he owns.Read the full letter here:Fellow Amazonians:I'm excited to announce that this Q3 I'll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name. The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, "What's the internet?" Blessedly, I haven't had to explain that in a long while.Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world.How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We've done crazy things together, and then made them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime's insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more. If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.I don't know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon's, and I believe we are at our most inventive right now. I hope you are as proud of our inventiveness as I am. I think you should be.As Amazon became large, we decided to use our scale and scope to lead on important social issues. Two high-impact examples: our $15 minimum wage and the Climate Pledge. In both cases, we staked out leadership positions and then asked others to come along with us. In both cases, it's working. Other large companies are coming our way. I hope you're proud of that as well.I find my work meaningful and fun. I get to work with the smartest, most talented, most ingenious teammates. When times have been good, you've been humble. When times have been tough, you've been strong and supportive, and we've made each other laugh. It is a joy to work on this team.As much as I still tap dance into the office, I'm excited about this transition. Millions of customers depend on us for our services, and more than a million employees depend on us for their livelihoods. Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it's consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it's hard to put attention on anything else. As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions. I've never had more energy, and this isn't about retiring. I'm super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.Amazon couldn't be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to. We have things in the pipeline that will continue to astonish. We serve individuals and enterprises, and we've pioneered two complete industries and a whole new class of devices. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics, and if an Amazonian's idea requires yet another new institutional skill, we're flexible enough and patient enough to learn it.Keep inventing, and don't despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-to-step-down-as-amazon-ceo-writes-to-his-1-3-million-employees-read-full-text-here-101612312103214.html
03-02-2021||World||Joe Biden treads carefully in unwinding hardline Trump immigration policies||US President Joe Biden on Tuesday ordered a review of asylum processing at the US-Mexico border and the immigration system as he seeks to undo some of former President Donald Trump's hardline policies.Biden also created a task force to reunite migrant families who were separated at the border by Trump's 2018 'zero tolerance' strategy."We are going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families," Biden said as he signed the orders at the White House.Immigration advocates have urged the new Democratic administration to move quickly but Biden aides say they need time to unravel the many layers of immigration restrictions introduced during the Trump era and to put in place more migrant-friendly systems."It's not going to happen overnight," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said earlier in the day.The cautious strategy reflects the tightrope Biden is walking to reverse hard-line Trump policies while simultaneously trying to prevent a surge in illegal immigration. Biden opponents could also derail or slow down his agenda with lawsuits if his administration moves too quickly and fails to follow proper procedures.In a sign of the wary approach, Biden's executive orders on Tuesday did not address repealing an order known as 'Title 42,' which was issued under the Trump administration to stop the spread of the coronavirus and allows U.S. authorities to expel almost all people caught crossing the border illegally.He did, however, mandate a review of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), a Trump program that ordered 65,000 asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings.The Biden administration has already stopped adding people to the program but has not yet outlined how it will process the claims of those already enrolled."I can't tell you exactly how long it will take to put in an alternative to that policy," a senior administration official told reporters on Monday in response to a question about processing MPP enrollees.Chad Wolf, former acting US Department of Homeland Security secretary under Trump, said in an interview that halting the MPP program was a mistake because it had been an effective deterrent to illegal immigration."If you do have a surge (of migrants), you're taking one of your tools off the table," he said in reference to the program.Michelle Brane, a senior director with the New York City-based Women's Refugee Commission, said Biden's latest orders do not appear likely to bring the sort of quick change sought by immigrant advocates."I think we were all hoping for something more immediate and operational, but these seem like they will be more visionary," she said.Brane said advocates will now need to "wait and see" what concrete steps US immigration agencies take to implement Biden's directives.HURDLESBiden's efforts face logistical challenges and opposition from Republicans, according to immigration policy experts, former officials, and activists on both sides of the issue.Lawsuits by conservative groups could potentially slow down Biden's agenda. A federal judge last week temporarily blocked one of his first immigration moves - a 100-day pause on many deportations - after the Republican-led state of Texas sought an injunction.Trump won the presidency in 2016 while making border security a major theme of his campaign. If Biden fails to prevent surges in illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border, he could give ammunition to Republicans in the 2022 congressional elections, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute."This is the thing that rallied Donald Trump supporters," she said.On Tuesday, Biden also called for a review of Trump's so-called 'public charge' rule, which makes it harder for poorer immigrants to obtain permanent residency in the United States.The review is expected to start the process to rescind it, according to two people familiar with the plan.Biden's order setting up the task force to reunite parents and children separated at the southern border was a key election promise.However, the task force will face a daunting challenge in trying to track down the parents of more than 600 children who remain separated, according to a January court filing in a related case. The children are living with relatives or in foster care, an attorney representing plaintiffs in the litigation told Reuters.The task force will be led by Alejandro Mayorkas, one of the senior officials said on Monday. The US Senate on Tuesday confirmed Mayorkas as the new head of the Department of Homeland Security, the first Latino and immigrant to hold that position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-treads-carefully-in-unwinding-hardline-trump-immigration-policies-101612313598818.html

The Biden administration has insisted Iran return to compliance before it would do so."We haven't ... had any discussions with the Iranians, and I wouldn’t expect we would until those initial steps go forward," State Department spokesman Ned Price said, referring to the Biden administration's consultations with allies, partners and the US Congress."There are (many) steps in that process ... before we're reaching the point where we are going to engage directly with the Iranians and willing to entertain any sort of proposal," he added.Another US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Price's comments should not be taken as a rebuff of Zarif's idea, but rather reflected the fact that Biden's Iran team is just settling in and has committed to consult widely."There is no rejection," this official said. "We have not begun negotiating with Iran, or with anyone else, because our priority is to consult" with partners in the nuclear deal and in the region.Under the 2015 accord between Iran and six major powers, Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program, making it harder to develop nuclear weapons in return for relief from economic sanctions.Trump abandoned the deal, which Iran struck with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, reimposed prior US sanctions and placed new ones that have squeezed Iran's economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cool-to-but-does-not-reject-iran-s-idea-on-reviving-nuclear-deal-101612312892664.html
03-02-2021||World||Long-detained immigrant families in US could soon face deportation||Lawyers working with immigrant families detained by the US government for more than a year say they’re worried the families could be deported as soon as this week.Six parents and six children could be placed on deportation flights as early as Wednesday, even though they continue to fight to win asylum, the lawyers said. The families say they were unfairly denied protections under several policies enacted by former President Donald Trump's administration that courts later prohibited.Hundreds of people have been deported in the early days of President Joe Biden's administration, including a woman who was a witness to the 2019 massacre at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. While a federal judge barred Biden from enforcing a 100-day moratorium on deporting most people in the US without authorization, the judge's order did not require the US government to resume deportations as before. Legal experts say ICE generally has the discretion to delay deportation flights, keep immigrants detained, or release people on bond even if they have final deportation orders.Since the judge's order, ICE has deported people to at least five countries, according to the agency and advocates for people deported.The families facing deportation have been held at the family detention center at Dilley, Texas, created by the former administration of President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president. Biden on Tuesday announced executive orders on family separation, border security and legal immigration intended to unwind Trump-era policies.ICE said last week that 230 people were detained at the Dilley facility. The agency declined to confirm the pending deportations of the families.In a letter sent to Department of Homeland Security officials Tuesday, immigration groups called on the Biden administration to “immediately halt the deportations of asylum seeking parents and their children.” It noted that new Homeland Security guidance that went into effect Monday — and was not affected by the federal judge's moratorium bar — established the department's enforcement priorities as “protecting national security, border security, and public safety.”Many of the families at Dilley who have been detained for more than a year came within hours of being deported under the Trump administration before last-minute appeals delayed the process. Some have been taken to airports and brought back.Shalyn Fluharty, director of the legal group Proyecto Dilley, which represents the families, noted that the parents and children facing deportation fought throughout the Trump administration, which enacted a series of restrictive immigration policies, including the separation of thousands of immigrant families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longdetained-immigrant-families-in-us-could-soon-face-deportation-101612312382948.html
03-02-2021||World||Pentagon chief purges defence boards; Donald Trump loyalists out||Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered hundreds of Pentagon advisory board members to resign this month as part of a broad review of the panels, essentially purging several dozen who were appointed last-minute under the Trump administration.During the last two months of his tenure, former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller removed a number of longtime members from several defence policy, health, science and business boards and replaced many with loyalists of former President Donald Trump. More than 30 of those replacements will now be forced to resign, including former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski."I am directing the immediate suspension of all advisory committee operations until the review is completed unless otherwise directed by myself or the deputy secretary of defense," Austin said in a memo released Tuesday. And he ordered all committee members who were appointed by the defence secretary to resign no later than February 16.Austin said the review will assess whether each board provides value and make sure its focus aligns with "our most pressing strategic priorities and the National Defense Strategy"Tata, a former Fox News commentator, failed to get through Senate confirmation for the top Pentagon policy job early last year because of offensive remarks he had made, including about Islam. In November, however, Trump appointed him to that same post, just days after firing then-Defence Secretary Mark Esper and putting Miller in the job.Miller appointed Tata to the Defense Policy Board on January 19, his last full day on the job. Gingrich was appointed to that same board. Lewandowski was appointed to the Defense Business Board.A senior defence official said Austin's decision was driven by the frenetic activity of Miller to remove dozens of board members and replace them in such a short amount of time between Trump's election loss and the inauguration of President Joe Biden.Of the 42 advisory panels listed in Austin's memo, 31 will have their members removed, six will be part of the review but their members will be retained, and five others have either no members at this time or have concluded their business. Among the 31 are some of the department's most well-known boards, including those with purview over defence policy, science, health, innovation, Arlington National Cemetery and women in the military.Altogether there are more than 600 members on the 42 boards. Defence officials said they do not know exactly how many are being asked to resign, but it will be hundreds.The boards of visitors for the Army, Navy and Air Force academies will keep their members, because those are presidential appointments that Austin does not have the authority to overturn. Among the Trump appointees who will remain on those boards are his former press secretary Sean Spicer and longtime adviser Kellyanne Conway. Those boards, however, will be subject to the review.One new congressionally-mandated commission is also being purged of the four members that Miller appointed in early January. The panel has not started its work yet, but will be responsible for figuring out how to go about renaming military bases and property that honour Confederate leaders. The panel is not subject to Austin's broader review, but he intends to appoint four new members.In a letter to Austin this week, US Reps. Anthony Brown, D-Md., and Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, called for the removal of the four Miller appointees on the renaming board. Trump had opposed the renaming of bases, and cited that as a reason for vetoing the defence bill, which included a provision setting up the panel to handle the process."Those who are called to serve their nation in this matter must have a deep understanding of and expertise in the history of Confederate monuments and their role in the white supremacist movement," Brown and Beatty wrote to Austin.The defence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Austin believed that stopping the activity of all the boards and doing a more intensive review was the fairest and most consistent process.Officials said the review will look at whether the boards have overlapping jurisdictions and whether they should be realigned or if money could be saved by trimming some of them. It also will make recommendations on the membership balance, size and mission of all the boards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-chief-purges-defence-boards-donald-trump-loyalists-out-101612311741567.html

Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Court of Chancery in Delaware, however, said McDonald's was justified in relying on Easterbrook's statements that he had only a single inappropriate relationship when the Chicago-based company ousted him.A lawyer for Easterbrook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.McDonald's said it looked forward to proving Easterbrook's misconduct."He violated the company's policies, disrespected its values and abused the trust of his co-workers, the board, our franchisees and our shareholders," it said in a statement.McDonald's sued Easterbrook in August, nine months after reaching the severance package, claiming he never gave directors a complete picture of his relationships with employees.It said that after Easterbrook's ouster, an anonymous tip led to the discovery of dozens of nude or sexually explicit photos of women, including three employees, that Easterbrook sent to his personal email account from his company account.McDonald's said Easterbrook deleted the emails shortly before his ouster, but they remained on a company server."This active concealment makes it at least reasonably conceivable the company had no way of knowing the full extent of Easterbrook's misconduct," Slights wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcdonalds-can-sue-ousted-ceo-over-alleged-lies-about-affairs-judge-101612311195773.html

03-02-2021||World||Suspected China hackers used SolarWinds bug to spy on US payroll agency: Report||Suspected Chinese hackers exploited a flaw in software made by SolarWinds Corp to help break into US government computers last year, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking a new twist in a sprawling cybersecurity breach that US lawmakers have labeled a national security emergency.Two people briefed on the case said FBI investigators recently found that the National Finance Center, a federal payroll agency inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was among the affected organizations, raising fears that data on thousands of government employees may have been compromised.The software flaw exploited by the suspected Chinese group is separate from the one the United States has accused Russian government operatives of using to compromise up to 18,000 SolarWinds customers, including sensitive federal agencies, by hijacking the company's Orion network monitoring software.Security researchers have previously said a second group of hackers was abusing SolarWinds' software at the same time as the alleged Russian hack, but the suspected connection to China and ensuing US government breach have not been previously reported.Reuters was not able to establish how many organizations were compromised by the suspected Chinese operation. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing investigations, said the attackers used computer infrastructure and hacking tools previously deployed by state-backed Chinese cyberspies.A USDA spokesman said in an email "USDA has notified all customers (including individuals and organizations) whose data has been affected by the SolarWinds Orion Code Compromise."In a follow-up statement after the story was published, a different USDA spokesman said the NFC was not hacked and that "there was no data breach related to Solar Winds" at the agency. He did not provide further explanation.The Chinese foreign ministry said attributing cyberattacks was a "complex technical issue" and any allegations should be supported with evidence. "China resolutely opposes and combats any form of cyberattacks and cyber theft," it said in a statement.SolarWinds said it was aware of a single customer that was compromised by the second set of hackers but that it had "not found anything conclusive" to show who was responsible. The company added that the attackers did not gain access to its own internal systems and that it had released an update to fix the bug in December.In the case of the sole client it knew about, SolarWinds said the hackers only abused its software once inside the client's network. SolarWinds did not say how the hackers first got in, except to say it was "in a way that was unrelated to SolarWinds."The FBI declined to comment.Although the two espionage efforts overlap and both targeted the U.S. government, they were separate and distinctly different operations, according to four people who have investigated the attacks and outside experts who reviewed the code used by both sets of hackers.While the alleged Russian hackers penetrated deep into SolarWinds network and hid a "back door" in Orion software updates which were then sent to customers, the suspected Chinese group exploited a separate bug in Orion's code to help spread across networks they had already compromised, the sources said.'EXTREMELY SERIOUS BREACH'The side-by-side missions show how hackers are focusing on weaknesses in obscure but essential software products that are widely used by major corporations and government agencies."Apparently SolarWinds was a high value target for more than one group," said Jen Miller-Osborn, the deputy director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks' Unit42.Former U.S. chief information security officer Gregory Touhill said separate groups of hackers targeting the same software product was not unusual. "It wouldn't be the first time we've seen a nation-state actor surfing in behind someone else, it's like 'drafting' in NASCAR," he said, where one racing car gets an advantage by closely following another's lead.The connection between the second set of attacks on SolarWinds customers and suspected Chinese hackers was only discovered in recent weeks, according to security analysts investigating alongside the US government.Reuters could not determine what information the attackers were able to steal from the National Finance Center (NFC) or how deep they burrowed into its systems. But the potential impact could be "massive," former U.S. government officials told Reuters.The NFC is responsible for handling the payroll of multiple government agencies, including several involved in national security, such as the FBI, State Department, Homeland Security Department and Treasury Department, the former officials said.Records held by the NFC include federal employee social security numbers, phone numbers and personal email addresses as well as banking information. On its website, the NFC says it "services more than 160 diverse agencies, providing payroll services to more than 600,000 Federal employees.""Depending on what data were compromised, this could be an extremely serious breach of security," said Tom Warrick, a former senior official at the US Department of Homeland Security. "It could allow adversaries to know more about US officials, improving their ability to collect intelligence."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspected-china-hackers-used-solarwinds-bug-to-spy-on-us-payroll-agency-report-101612310857146.html
03-02-2021||World||New York governor Andrew Cuomo says earlier Covid-19 shot for cabdrivers, restaurant workers||Restaurant workers, taxi drivers and workers at developmentally-disabled facilities could become eligible to receive Covid-19 vaccines if local governments choose to include them, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said.Cuomo said he is directing local governments to make decisions about whether to add groups, and which ones, to the so-called 1B eligible tier, he said in a briefing Tuesday.New York expanded vaccine eligibility beyond health-care workers last month to include public workers, teachers, and people 65 and older. Last week, he announced a plan to reopen New York City’s indoor dining on Feb. 14 to 25% capacity, raising questions about whether restaurant workers should then be included in eligibility lists. He has also been asked to make those with health conditions eligible to receive the vaccine.Facing supply shortages in New York, Cuomo has pushed back against requests to open up vaccines to even more groups of people. “Without a significant increase in the supply, it’s all just posturing,” Cuomo said.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier Tuesday that he supported including restaurant workers in the category of people who are eligible to receive the vaccine.“The restaurant workers now are going to be in enclosed places with people eating and drinking. And every doctor on this line or any place else will say, that’s an area of concern,” de Blasio said in a Tuesday briefing. “ Now that the state has made this decision, it follows that we have to protect those workers and they should be added to the 1b category.”Cuomo said the state has administered about 2 million vaccine doses for about 7 million eligible residents. Expanding eligibility to the immuno-compromised would add another 4 million in a state that’s getting about 300,000 doses a week from the federal government, Cuomo said.Cuomo said the Biden administration told governors on Tuesday that the state’s vaccine allocation will rise by another 5% over the next three weeks, on top of a previous boost of about 16%. The federal government also told governors during a call earlier Tuesday that they would give an additional 10% of the states’ allocation to pharmacies, which will result in another 30,000 doses for those in New York, Cuomo said.New York’s Covid numbers continue to improve, the governor said. The state’s seven-day average rate of positive tests is below 5% for the first time since early December, Cuomo said.The state plans to test targeting vaccine supply in areas with high positivity, Cuomo said. The Yankee Stadium will be open only for for residents in the Bronx, which has the highest positive rate among New York City’s boroughs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-says-earlier-covid-shot-for-cabdrivers-waiters-101612293902837.html

After that, we will be able to start our vaccine delivery to India" Dmitriev told ANI."The data published by The Lancet shows that Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world with the efficacy of over 90 per cent but outperforms them in terms of safety, ease of transportation due to storage requirements of 2 to 8 degrees, and a more affordable price. Sputnik V is a vaccine for all mankind," Dmitriev said.Dmitriev further stated that "For many other vaccines that have efficacy less than 90 per cent Sputnik V vaccine is willing to partner with them with one of our shots just as we are working with AstraZeneca to increase the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine."According to the result of an interim analysis of the phase 3 trials published by the journal Lancet, Russian's Sputnik V is 91.6 per cent effective at protecting people from COVID-19."Sputnik V is already registered in 16 countries including Russia, Belarus, Serbia, Argentina, Bolivia, Algeria, Palestine, Venezuela, Paraguay, Turkmenistan, Hungary, UAE, Iran, Republic of Guinea, Tunisia and Armenia," read the Lancet's paper.The paper further stated that in the first week of February, vaccination with Sputnik V will start in the 12 countries including Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Palestine, UAE, Paraguay, Hungary, Armenia, Algeria, Bosnian Serb Republic, Venezuela and Iran.

03-02-2021||World||Oxford finds AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot 76% effective for 3 months after single dose||Oxford University and AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine showed in a study it had 76% efficacy against symptomatic infection for three months after a single dose, which increased if the second shot is delayed, backing Britain's vaccine rollout policy.The findings of the pre-print paper, which had not been peer-reviewed, supported Britain's decision to extend the interval between initial and booster doses of the shot to 12 weeks, Oxford said on Tuesday.However, the new study did not address concerns about a lack of data on efficacy among the oldest, who the British government have given highest priority in its vaccine rollout.Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said the data showed the 12-week interval between doses was "the optimal approach to roll out, and reassures us that people are protected from 22 days after a single dose".Britain has decided to vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as possible by lengthening the amount of time between initial shots and booster shots to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.AstraZeneca's research chief has said 8-12 weeks between doses seems to be the "sweet spot" for efficacy, contrasting with US drugmaker Pfizer, which has warned that the vaccine it has developed with Germany's BionTech was not trialled with such an interval.The results for the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, gathered from trials in Britain, Brazil and South Africa, showed that immune responses were boosted with a longer interval to the second dose among participants aged 18 to 55 years."Vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 post vaccination was 76%, and modelled analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3 month period," Oxford academics said in the preprint.The paper said that vaccine efficacy was 82.4% with 12 or more weeks to the second dose, compared to 54.9% for those where the booster was given under 6 weeks after the first dose.The longest interval between doses for those aged 56 and over was between 6-8 weeks, so there was no data for the efficacy of a 12 week dosing gap in that cohort.Europe's medicine regulator has flagged that there is not enough data to determine how well the vaccine will work in people aged over 55, but Britain has expressed confidence the vaccine works in all age groups.The study said that no-one out of the 12,408 people vaccinated with a single dose of the vaccine was hospitalised with Covid-19 from 22 days after immunisation.Oxford also said data seemed to suggest the vaccine reduced transmission of infections, with a 67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated in the British arm of the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-finds-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-shot-76-effective-for-3-months-101612292539936.html

Till 11:10 pm (IST), her tweet garnered 144,000 likes and over 70,000 retweets.Actor Kangana Ranaut, who had supported farm laws called Rihanna a "fool" and said that the protestors were not farmers but "terrorists who are trying to divide India"."No one is talking about it because they are not farmers they are terrorists who are trying to divide India, so that China can take over our vulnerable broken nation and make it a Chinese colony much like USA... Sit down you fool, we are not selling our nation like you dummies," the 'Panga' actor tweeted.Others like Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Diljit Dosanjh have earlier come out in support of the farmers on Twitter.

03-02-2021||World||Biden’s executive orders to undo more of Trump’s immigration policies||US President Joe Biden will sign three executive orders on Tuesday that will reunite families separated by the Trump administration’s hardline policies, improve access to the asylum system and make it more humane and remove barriers from legal immigration.This will be the second lot of executive orders issued by Biden. In the first, seven orders issued on his first day in office, he had rescinded former president Donald Trump’s “Muslim ban”, stopped work on the border wall and reinstated protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. The president had also sent to Congress an immigration reforms legislation, which among other things, provided a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants.Also read: Accused Capitol rioters blame Trump in legal defenseA memo issued by the White House on Tuesday said the president’s new orders are based on a strategy that is “centered on the basic premise that our country is safer, stronger, and more prosperous with a fair, safe and orderly immigration system that welcomes immigrants, keeps families together, and allow people — both newly arrived immigrants and people who have lived here for generations — to more fully contribute to our country”.The first executive order will create a task force to reunite parents and children separated by the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy. The exact number of affected children is not clear, but Associated Press has reported that 5,500 such children have been identified in court documents. The task force will be headed by Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s nominee to head the department of homeland security.The second order will seek to address the root of irregular migration” in the region the US in a three-step plan, to be coordinated with countries in the region. It will also review the asylum protocol — essentially the “Remain in Mexico” policy — that forced applicants to stay in Mexico as they awaited months for court hearings.The third order will seek to remove barriers from legal immigration. It will instruct government agencies dealing with immigration to conduct a “top-to-bottom review of recent regulations”.Under the scanner will be the “public charge” rule, under which the US could turn down immigration applicants who, it deemed, would need government assistance to survive. Though the order will not end that rule yet, it will rescind a Trump-era memorandum that required Americans to reimburse the government for any public benefits extended to relatives they were sponsoring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-executive-orders-to-undo-more-of-trump-s-immigration-policies-101612285544794.html
03-02-2021||India||Tharoor and Sardesai move SC against FIRs over tweet on farmer’s death||Congress Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor has approached the Supreme Court challenging the registration of FIRs against him in several states over his erroneous tweets over the death of a protestor during the tractor rally organized in the Capital on January 26. His petition seeks quashing of the nine first information reports (FIRs) pending against him in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Along with him, journalist Rajdeep Sardesai has also petitioned the top court for quashing of criminal cases. The petition was filed on Wednesday and the Supreme Court is yet to number the case for listing. In the petition, Tharoor and Sardesai have sought protection of their fundamental right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The genesis of the cases against them ate tweets in which Tharoor and Sardesai attributed the death of a protestor during the tractor rally in the Capital to police firing. Tharoor later deleted the tweet after coming to know that the protestor died after he rammed his tractor into police barricades, causing it to flip over.. On January 30, the Delhi Police lodged a case against Tharoor, Sardesai and several others for alleged misreporting and spreading disharmony. Simultaneously, cases were lodged at Gurugram in Haryana and in Madhya Pradesh under serious charges of sedition (IPC Section 124A) besides provisions of promoting enmity (IPC Section 153A), making assertions prejudicial to national integration (IPC Section 153B), and some provisions under the Information Technology Act. Tharoor and Sardesai have further stated that the multiple FIRs against them were a mala fide exercise that was politically motivated as the contents of the FIRs were identical. The other persons who have been named in these FIRs are also believed to have approached the top court for relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tharoor-and-sardesai-move-sc-against-firs-over-tweet-on-farmer-s-death-101612376875950.html

He was speaking at the conclusion of a three-day global virtual conclave organised by the State Planning Board to chart Kerala's future in a post-Covid scenario. Prof Sen said a look at the successes and failures of Kerala would pin the focus on labour. "I would be personally very optimistic about Kerala looking to the future, he noted, citing not just its track record, but unique historical reasons that contributed to the states success."He recalled that Kerala's first government in 1957 triggered animated discussions when the Communist regime saw movements related to labour, anti-untouchability and education as a major means of progress. "Kerala was one of India's three poorest economies when the state was incepted six-and-a-half decades ago. In a couple of decades, the state not only moved away from that position, but was competing for being one of the top three in terms of per capita expenditure," he said. The 'Kerala Looks Ahead' conclave gave a call on Wednesday for continued social security and highlighted the need for public discussion that relied heavily on humanity and reasoning,the release said. "The 22 sessions on nine key sectors got an overwhelming response from experts across the world,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan noted in the valedictory session. He said KLA stimulated national and international discussion between scholars and experts in areas that were part of the conference and many suggestions had emerged. "There are issues of long-term and strategic interest to the state and also recommendations regarding policies that can be implemented in the short run. The government would study these suggestions, which have from all over the world, to look at ways they can be incorporated into policy," he said.

03-02-2021||India||Vitriolic slogans, sarcastic songs go viral in poll-bound Bengal||Be it vitriolic slogans comprising only a couple of words or complete sentences or songs composed with sarcastic lyrics, the rising political tension in poll-bound West Bengal is being marked by myriad expressions, some of which have gone viral.Soon after joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on December 19, Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee’s aide-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari picked up the most sacred chant of the Vaishnav community and turned it into his signature slogan.“Hare Krishna Hare Hare, BJP ghare ghare,” shouted Adhikari at his first rally as BJP leader, implying that his party had entered every home with the holy chant that Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the 15th century Hindu saint had composed for disciples of Lord Krishna.“Sri Chaitanya spread the message of universal love, hence this slogan. We are paying homage to Purushottam Ram and Sri Chaitanya at the same time,” Adhikari explained at the rally in East Midnapore, his home turf. The slogan has become so popular that these days he only chants “Hare Krishna Hare Hare” and the crowds complete the sentence.Not willing to be quoted, some TMC leaders admit in private that in the districts Adhikari’s catchy lines have become almost as popular as the one the ruling party’s students’ wing raised before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when Banerjee was projected as a contender for the Prime Minister’s chair.The TMC slogan, “Delhi jabe Hawaii choti,” implied that Banerjee’s signature blue and white sandals would go to Delhi. It went viral and led to counter slogans from the CPI (M)’s youth wing. The slogan, however, lost relevance once the BJP returned to power with a thumping majority.This year, TMC’s Birbhum district president Anubrata Mondal, a mass organiser known for triggering debates with almost anything he utters, is making news with just two words: “khela hobe” or let's play.The slogan Mondal raised at a rally in Birbhum on January 31 is being heard everywhere, be it picnics by college students or TMC rallies. On Tuesday, it was heard at a roadshow of TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee in the southern fringes of Kolkata. The BJP has alleged that “play,” hints at poll violence since Mondal has spoken of using force against the opposition several times in the past.“Slogans being raised at TMC rallies are unhealthy for a democratic setup. At Chatterjee’s rally, a slogan was also raised against BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. It talked of attacking him,” said Samik Bhattacharya, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson. The viral slogan he referred to talks of skinning Ghosh.“Our party does not subscribe to such slogans. We do not support these,” Chatterjee said in reaction to the allegation.Nachiketa Chakraborty, a very popular singer and composer of modern Bengali songs and who is known to be close to Mamata Banerjee, raised a storm on social media on Monday by singing one of his compositions that target political turncoats. He was performing at a cultural event held by the Burdwan town municipality in East Burdwan district where the local Lok Sabha MP joined the BJP alongside Adhikari.A video, showing the singer stopping in the middle of the song and mouthing an invective while explaining the context, has gone viral.On January 19, a year after Union minister Anurag Thakur triggered strong reactions by raising the Hindi slogan, “Desh ki gaddaron ko, goli maaro…” (Shoot the traitors in India), the same slogan, with the word India replaced by “Bangal” (Bengal in Hindi), was heard from a section of the crowd who took part in a TMC roadshow in south Kolkata. The ruling party quickly distanced itself from the slogan, calling its chanting “uncalled for”.However, the very next day, Thakur’s original slogan was heard at a BJP roadshow at Chandannagar in Hooghly district and three party workers were arrested.On Tuesday, former forest minister Rajib Banerjee, who joined the BJP at Union home minister’s Amit Shah’s Delhi residence on January 30, raised eyebrows by dishing out his adaptation of the chief minister’s most popular slogan on the eve of the historic 2011 assembly polls that ended the Left’s 34-year-long regime.“Chup chap padde chhap” (silently vote for the lotus), Rajib Banerjee said at a rally in Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district.In 2011, the TMC’s most popular slogan was “chup chap phule chhap” or, silently vote for the flower, the TMC’s election symbol.Kolkata-based economics professor and political commentator Sarthak Roychowdhury said, “These slogans are the only entertainment the polls can offer. The rest is just a horror story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vitriolic-slogans-sarcastic-songs-go-viral-in-poll-bound-bengal-101612373364524.html
03-02-2021||India||SC may lay protocol for widening projects which require cutting of trees||The Supreme Court Wednesday observed that it would consider laying down a protocol to be followed for projects like road widening which require cutting of trees so that there is minimum damage to the environment.The apex court also said it did not consider it tenable that if road is less than 100 km then Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is not necessary.The observations came while hearing a plea relating felling of over 350 trees for construction of railway over bridges (ROB) and widening of National Highway-112 from Barasat to Petrapole on the Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said the protocol would make sure that alternatives adopted for the project are less damaging to the environment.A four-member committee constituted by the top court informed it that before implementing a project of national importance environmental impact assessment is desired and this has not been done in the project under consideration.The committee said that the State authorities are considering project under consideration as an independent project which is affecting a distance of 59.2 km only."According to a circular issued by MoEF, if a road project have length less than 100 km, in that case there is no need to get EIA from any government agency. Such argument, in present case, is an attempt to circumvent the law of the land."We feel deriving such conclusion is erroneous and needs rethinking on the part of the state of the West Bengal.. According to the committee members EIA should be taken up before starting the project related work," the panel said.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, referred to the MoEF notification and said that in Char Dham project roads were divided in smaller segments in order to avoid EIA.The court said," Prima facie, we don't consider it tenable that if road is less than 100 km then EIA is not necesaary. The whole environment is our land of everybody. There is no question of this government and that government."The bench has now posted the matter for hearing on February 18.The apex court had earlier formed a committee of environment experts to suggest an alternative to felling of over 350 trees for construction of railway over bridges (ROB) and widening of National Highway-112 from Barasat to Petrapole on the Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal.The five-member committee is headed by Dr Soham Pandya of the Centre of Science For Village, Wardha.Bhushan, appearing for petitioner Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR) had earlier said that no alternatives were explored and permission was granted to fell the trees, which are heritage ones aged around 80-100 years.He had said everyone knows about global warming and there is study which says if the vegetation is not protected then in next 10-20 years the human species will be in danger.The Calcutta High Court on August 31, 2018, had paved the way for widening of the national highway and allowed felling of over 350 trees for widening of Jessore Road, which connects the city to Petrapole on the Indo-Bangladesh border, on the condition that five trees will be planted for each tree cut.The NH-112 or Jessore Road is an important link between India and Bangladesh and the state government had undertaken a project to widen it. Hundreds of old trees line both sides of the road, some of which were decided to be felled for the purpose of widening of the road.A PIL was moved before the high court challenging the state''s plan to fell the trees. After arguments for several months, the high court allowed felling of 356 trees at five places from Barasat to Petrapole border along the Jessore Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-may-lay-protocol-for-widening-projects-which-require-cutting-of-trees-101612372724237.html

A passenger aircraft generally flies at a height of around 30,000 feet."The airspace below 1,000 feet is lower airspace and it would be the main playground of drones. For that, we may have a system of private ATCs, which would be managed by private operators," Dubey said at a session organised by industry body FICCI at Aero India 2021."It could be a government agency or a private agency, it is something that would evolve," he added. The AAI cannot handle drones because they would be flying at 5 feet to take care of crops to about 1,000 feet in the airspace, Dubey mentioned.Drone technology is moving way faster than the regulations so we have decided that we need to start a parallel activity, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-allow-private-air-traffic-controllers-to-manage-drones-in-lower-airspace-101612372877667.html

Defence minister Rajnath Singh met Chinese defence minister Gen Wei Fenghe in Moscow on September 4 last year and said that the two sides should “resolve the ongoing situation and outstanding issues in the border areas peacefully through dialogue”.External affairs minister S Jaishankar met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on September 10 last year, and both ministers had a “frank and constructive discussion on the developments in the India-China border areas and reached a five-point agreement to address the ongoing issues along the LAC”, Muraleedharan said.The two foreign ministers agreed that the “current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side”. They also agreed “therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions”, Muraleedharan said.Despite several rounds of talks through diplomatic and military channels, the two sides are yet to make any headway on disengagement and de-escalation at friction points in Ladakh sector of the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempts-by-chinese-to-transgress-lac-met-apt-response-mea-tells-parliament-101612369113739.html

I was active as a BJP worker in the past but took a break to raise my children."Now, since my children have grown up, I can dedicate more time for people. That is the reason I have decided to jump into electoral fray," Sonal Modi said.She said she qualifies to get party nomination to contest the polls."Though the BJP has set some criteria, I believe I qualify for the ticket.

The new curb is effective from Wednesday. The country’s interior ministry announced that the "temporary suspension" would be effective from local time 9pm (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.People who have a history of travel to any of the 20 countries 14 days prior to their travel to Saudi Arabia are not allowed to enter the country, said news agency ANI quoting sources.The list of banned countries includes India, the US, Egypt, Pakistan, Argentina, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, France, Italy, Portugal, Indonesia, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Lebanon, UAE, and Turkey.However, there are some exceptions. Saudi citizens, diplomats, and health workers coming from these countries will be allowed to enter the kingdom "in accordance with the precautionary measures". Indian cargo flights operating with clearance from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) do not fall under the purview of the ban either.Saudi Arabia had been ramping up domestic measures to contain the surge of coronavirus cases. Saudi health minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah has been urging people to be on their guard, not become complacent, and adhere strictly to Covid-19 preventative measures."Lack of compliance will force us to take measures to protect society," he said in televised remarks. "I ask you to help us preserve the gains we made in combating coronavirus ...

03-02-2021||India||India can act as net security provider in Indian Ocean Region: Defence minister||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said India can take on the role of being the net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region as geopolitically it is a reliable partner in the IOR. "We live in a challenging geo-political landscape where countries not only have to face the threat of military aggression, but natural calamities which include pandemics like COVID-19 which has wreaked havoc in the last one year," Singh said. Therefore, when faced with threats across multiple dimensions, it is imperative for the nation to strengthen relations with countries with whom it shared converging views on key global issues, he said,addressing the inaugural session of Chiefs of the Air Staff Conclave at Aero India here. "Geopolitically India is a reliable partner in the Indian Ocean Region and can take on the role of being the net security provider in the region," he added. Noting that air power has and would continue to play a critical role in maintaining regional stability and peace in the region, Singh said freedom of manoeuvre provided by air and space capabilities enables the nation to influence in a sustainable and clearly escalable manner.The Indian Air force is at the very forefront of offensive capabilities with its reach, speed and precision, he said. Indias unique disposition in the IOR, complimented by a potent airlift capability of IAF, enables it to contribute significantly in Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief (HADR) missions, he said. Singh noted that India has been regularly conducting exercises to deepen HADR cooperation and coordination among its neighbours with a focus on sharing expertise and assisting building capabilities. He also said that the recent conflicts had shown the potency of emerging technologies and India is heavily focused on building these capabilities. "We are keen to cooperate with our defence partners in these niche technologies with focus on knowledge sharing and co-production," he added. The Chiefs of the Air Staff Conclave today had physical representation from 26 countries, while 14 were in attendance virtually, officials said. The Conclave has been planned with three sessions to address the themes of disruptive technologies and innovations, air power in Indo-Pacific region and air power and airspace strategies, they said. Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria, in his keynote address, said "we have witnessed a paradigm change in the Geo-political landscape in recent years and globally, we are facing unprecedented levels of uncertainty, volatility and interconnected threats." While the world was grappling with complications and control of the pandemic, the worsening inter-state relations, rising mistrust and geopolitical tensions have only reinforced the importance of mature and balanced cooperation at international level, he said. "We need to strengthen our mutual understanding and existing security frameworks based on the principles of Cooperation, Collaboration and Coexistence," he said, adding that for India, the security challenges are as varied as its geography and as unpredictable as the nation's threats. Noting that the nature of warfare has changed significantly in the last few years, the air chief said advent of new technologies and cross linking of 'Physical', 'Digital' and 'Cognitive' domains has complicated the art of war fighting considerably. "Our understanding of national boundaries has shifted well beyond the classical definitions of airspaces, land borders and shorelines. An attack may originate without warning, several time zones away, and its effect may proliferate rapidly across several domains." Also, the exponential technological progress made in the last few years has made the realm of sub-con warfare more complex, Bhadauria said. The low cost and easy availability of simple disruptive technology like drones with small state and non-state actors have made them more lethal, agile and capable of generating disproportionate effects, he said. "We are closely observing these developments and are focusing on developing capabilities in unmanned, and optionally manned platforms, manned-unmanned teaming, and anti-drone technologies," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-act-as-net-security-provider-in-indian-ocean-region-defence-minister-101612365053505.html

Two years later, he had joined the Sharad Pawar-led NCP. However, in June last year, he had resigned from the NCP due to some differences and floated the PSDP.In his statement, Vaghela claimed that many Congress workers urged him "with tears in their eyes" to rejoin the party when he was at Piraman village in Bharuch district last year to attend Congress leader Ahmed Patel's funeral."Apart from these workers, many Congress leaders have been insisting that I should join Congress. I am ready to join the Congress without any pre-conditions to fight the BJP. I have no problem in joining Congress. I will take an appropriate decision after meeting madam Sonia jee and Rahul Gandhi in Delhi," the senior leader said.Before Vaghela's statement, state Congress spokesperson Jayrajsinh Parmar said, "I have learned from the media that Vaghela is joining the Congress. I want to clarify that there is no such thing as of now. As far as I know, Vaghela has not contacted any of our leaders for the comeback. I think only Vaghela can shed light on these rumours."Vaghela's party has already announced that it will not field its candidates in the upcoming local body polls in Gujarat in order to stop the anti-BJP vote division.Vaghela had started his political career with the BJP. After the BJP came to power in the state in 1995 and chose to make Keshubhai Patel the chief minister instead of him, Vaghela engineered a split in the saffron outfit and became the CM in 1996 with outside support of the Congress.Later, he joined the Congress and served as Textile Minister in the Manmohan Singh government.While in the Congress, he had also served as its state unit president and Leader of Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-ex-cm-shankersinh-vaghela-says-ready-to-rejoin-congress-101612365044083.html

The other six assembly segments in the Ghatal seat are in West Midnapore.Dev’s invitation to the Haldia event sparked a controversy on Wednesday afternoon when Saumitra Khan, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha MP from Bankura district, tweeted a report of a Bengali online magazine which carried a photo of Modi and Dev and said the two will share the same dais.“This has created a sensation in state politics” Khan tweeted in Bangla, tagging the Prime Minister and Dev.Dev reacted quickly to stop the story from gaining any traction.“Dear Saumitra, I still feel very proud to see your journey & achievements. My sincere apologies, as I won't be able to make it to this event, but I’m touched to have received this invite. U will always hold a special place of love n respect irrespective of our political ideologies,” tweeted Dev.“Irrespective of our political ideologies, as I still cherish the good old times we spent together, when you represented the same party as me. All the very best for this and my best wishes are always with you & your Party. Take care,” Dev wrote in a second tweet.Dev (39), who was born in Keshpur in West Midnapore, won the Ghatal seat twice since 2014. In 2019, he defeated BJP's Bharati Ghosh, a former Indian Police Service officer, by more than one lakh votes.East Midnapore district has been in the headlines ever since TMC’s Nandigram legislator Suvendu Adhikari quit the assembly seat and the cabinet and joined the BJP on December 19. Tapasi Mandal, the CPI(M) legislator from Haldia also joined the BJP the same day under his leadership. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has declared that she will contest the Nandigram seat in the elections due in March-April.Suvendu Adhikari’s father, Sisir Adhikari, is the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from East Midnapore’s Kanthi constituency and the latter’s elder son Dibyendu is the Lok Sabha MP from Tamluk. Both have been invited to the Prime Minister’s programme.Modi is also scheduled to attend a BJP rally after the government event. There are speculations that Suvendu Adhikari’s father and brother may join the BJP. His youngest brother Soumendu, who headed the Kanthi municipality, has already joined the saffron camp.Sisir Adhikari has been Mamata Banerjee’s close associate since the party’s birth in 1998. He has been representing the Kanthi seat since 2009.Ever since Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP, ruling party leaders are targeting him at election rallies, often calling him Mir Zafar, the general who betrayed Shiraj-ud-Daulah, Bengal's last independent nawab who was defeated by the East India Company in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The battle marked the beginning of British rule in India.On December 19, Adhikari and six sitting TMC legislators, a TMC Lok Sabha member, three MLAs from the Left and Congress and at least 20 other district-level leaders of the ruling party joined the BJP at Union home minister Amit Shah’s rally in Midnapore town.

He was responding to a query from All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MPs Syed Imtiaz Jaleel and Asaduddin Owaisi on whether some countries and PIOs have supported the farmers’ protest.“No foreign government has given support to agitation of Indian farmers against three bills passed by Indian Parliament,” Muraleedharan said in the reply.“In Canada, [the] UK, [the] USA, and in few European countries, protests by a few motivated PIOs on issues related to the Indian Farm Bill have been reported,” he added.Muraleedharan said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “made a comment on issues related to farmers in India”, following which the Indian government had “taken up this matter with the Canadian authorities both in Ottawa and New Delhi and conveyed that such comments pertaining to the internal affairs of India are unwarranted, unacceptable and would damage India-Canada bilateral relations”.He also said the Canadian government “has welcomed the Government of India’s commitment to ongoing dialogue with the farmers to discuss issues of concern”.The external affairs ministry has pushed back against comments by foreign leaders supporting the farmers’ protest or questioning the government’s handling of the snowballing demonstrations, saying they are an internal affair and that most of the remarks didn’t reflect the country’s democratic ethos or the government’s outreach to the farmers.Trudeau triggered a diplomatic row in December when he told a Facebook video interaction organised to mark the 551st birth anniversary of Guru Nanak that his government had conveyed its concerns over the farmers’ protest to New Delhi.In response, the external affairs ministry summoned Canadian envoy Nadir Patel and told him the remarks by Trudeau and Canadian lawmakers on the issue had the potential to “seriously” damage bilateral ties. Despite the protest from the Indian side, Trudeau doubled down on his position and said Canada “will always stand up for the right of peaceful protest anywhere around the world”.The matter has also been raised by influential US lawmakers, including members of the influential house foreign affairs committee, and a group of 36 British MPs wrote a letter to foreign minister Dominic Raab last month, asking him to take up the farmers’ protest with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar during a visit to New Delhi last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-foreign-govt-has-supported-farmers-protest-mea-in-lok-sabha-101612363765565.html

If there is no adverse impact, it will be continued," CC Patil, Karnataka's minister for information and public relations, said.The decision was taken after a delegation of senior actors, directors, producers and others from the Kannada film industry met senior ministers of the government on Wednesday in Bengaluru.A detailed set of guidelines will be issued on Thursday, Patil said.The decision of the Karnataka government comes almost a month after neighbouring Tamil Nadu had to reverse its order allowing 100% occupancy in cinema halls.The Edapaddi Palaniswamy-led government had to revoke its decision four days after it received criticism for lifting restrictions in enclosed spaces like cinema halls where air conditioning and other factors are likely to contribute to help spread the virus.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa had relaxed lockdown measures to revive economic activity and bring in some much needed revenues to the state coffers.The state has so far reported 9,40,170 positive cases from March 8 last year, of which at least 5924 are active currently.Over 12223 people have lost their lives in the state so far and 148 are currently in the intensive care unit, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-limiting-it-to-50-karnataka-allows-100-seating-in-cinema-halls-101612364940708.html

He had written about it to the Maharashtra government. The state home department gave its sanction (to file a complaint)," a senior police official said.The complaint has been filed under Indian Penal Code sections 499, 500 (defamation) and 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory).Goswami made "grossly false", "malicious" and defamatory statements during the coverage of actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death by suicide last year, it claimed.These defamatory statements were telecast on the channel Republic Bharat during a discussion about phone records of actor Rhea Chakraborty, Rajput's girlfriend, it said."The said defamatory attacks have been made with a singular view of assassinating his (Trimukhe's) official character and thereby...maliciously and deliberately causing undue humiliation of the Mumbai Police Department," the complaint said.Goswami also tweeted the contents of the telecast to a larger audience, the complaint said.When contacted, Goswami's lawyer said they had not received any intimation about the court complaint yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cop-files-defamation-complaint-against-arnab-goswami-101612363771358.html
03-02-2021||India||House republicans face identity dilemma in fight over Marjorie Taylor Greene||Republicans in the US Congress on Wednesday face questions about whether to discipline a pair of strikingly different Representatives Liz Cheney and Marjorie Taylor Greene, decisions that will send a strong signal about the party's future.Cheney, the No. 3 House of Representatives Republican, is facing heat for her vote to impeach former President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting insurrection in a speech to his followers before they attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, leaving five dead.Greene is in the hotseat for having supported conspiracy theories and online calls for violence against Democrats - views that have drawn sharp criticism from Senate Republicans including leader Mitch McConnell, who warned against "looney lies and conspiracy theories."In choosing to strip Cheney of her leadership role or remove Greene from committees, Republicans will also telegraph a message about the future of their party.The 211 House Republicans who have been invited to a closed-door meeting also are expected to weigh both, though it is unclear if they will act on Wednesday.An outspoken Trump supporter, Greene before coming to Congress this year has voiced support for unfounded conspiracy theories. Last week, CNN reported that she had also approved of calls for violence against Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is being pulled in opposite directions from members of his rank-and-file, who have been riven for months over Trump's insistence, without evidence, that the 2020 election was "stolen" from him and by the increasingly violent rhetoric among members of the Republican Party.House Democrats, who hold a slim majority, were preparing to advance legislation on Wednesday relieving Greene of her committee assignments if House Republicans did not act promptly. Some Democrats called for her to be expelled from Congress."I'm the Democrat mob's public enemy number one," Greene said in a tweet on Tuesday.Some high-profile Republican senators have injected themselves into the House controversies."We should have nothing to do with Marjorie Taylor Greene. I think we should repudiate the things she said and move away from her," Senator Mitt Romney told reporters on Tuesday.On Monday, McConnell weighed in with a statement saying that Greene's "looney lies and conspiracy theories are a cancer for the Republican Party and our country."Greene is a political newcomer who took office just last month while Cheney, the daughter of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, served in Republican administrations before first winning election to Congress in 2016.In early 2019, then-Representative Steve King was stripped of his committee assignments after the long-time Republican lawmaker was found to have uttered racist comments. King was defeated in a Republican primary election last June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-republicans-face-identity-dilemma-in-fight-over-marjorie-taylor-greene-101612350217284.html
03-02-2021||India||Anti-CAA protest: Court dismisses Jamia's plea seeking FIR against police for assaulting students||A court here on Wednesday dismissed an application filed by Jamia Millia Islamia University seeking an FIR against Delhi police officials for allegedly breaking into the campus without its permission and assaulting students and security guards during anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in December 2019.Metropolitan Magistrate Rajat Goyal held that the acts allegedly committed by the police officials fell within the purview of the acts committed in discharge of official duties, and a requisite sanction was a must from the authorities concerned to prosecute them.“Thus, as per law down by the Supreme Court, existence of requisite sanction is a must even before jurisdiction could be exercised. That being so, present application cannot be allowed for want of sanction,” the court said.The application had sought registration of an FIR claiming that on December 15, 2019 police officials committed various atrocities, including “vandalizing public/university property and unnecessary use of force against hapless students who were only exercising their democratic right to protest peacefully.”In an Action Taken Report field in response to court's direction, the police said that a protesting crowd set several vehicles on fire and then went inside the university campus and started pelting stones on the police and raised provocative slogans.“In order to maintain law and order situation, police had to enter the university campus and contain the mob by detaining some persons,” the report said.Advocates Asghar khan and Tariq Nasir, who represented the university, said that they will file a revision petition before a superior court against the order.The court said in its order that it was clear from the factual background of the matter that some of the protests had become violent and that police personnel were acting to control the said protests at the relevant point of time, so as to prevent violence and prevent law and order situation from further deterioration. “Though it could be argued that while so acting, the police/respondents had allegedly exceeded their jurisdiction and used more force than necessary in some instances, it cannot be said, by any stretch of imagination, that the said acts allegedly committed by the respondents were wholly unconnected to their official duty.“Likewise, it could also be argued that the situation perhaps could have been handled by the respondents in a better way and that some restraint should have been shown by the police/respondents in order to differentiate between peaceful student protesters and anti­-social elements who had attempted to hijack the entire movement,” the judge said.The judge said that “however, the lack of such restraint exhibited by the police/respondents and excesses committed in trying to control the situation are very much related to official duties of the respondents.” “This court has no hesitation in holding that acts allegedly committed by the respondents fall within the purview of section 197 Cr.P.C., being acts committed in discharge of official duties,” the court further said.The application had claimed that on December 15, 2019 civil society members decided to call a peaceful protest near the university area against CAA. “In pursuit of clearing the crowd, police officials broke into the campus without seeking any sanction and used excessive and arbitrary force and thrashed several security guards of the university and also students.“The said police officials caused destruction of university property and fired tear gas shells and conducted lathi charge. They also hurt religious sentiments of locals of the area by entering into the university mosque,” it said.It added that the complainant gave a complaint to the SHO of Jamia Nagar police station and ACP and DCP concerned in this regard on the next day of the incident but no action was taken, therefore, the university approached the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anticaa-protest-court-dismisses-jamia-s-plea-seeking-fir-against-police-for-assaulting-students-101612361569023.html

Sharing the statement of the ministry of external affairs in which the ministry termed international support to farmers' protest as irresponsible, Amit Shah said propaganda can neither disrupt India's unity nor can decide India's fate. "India stands united and together to achieve progress," he wrote with hashtags IndiaAgainstPropaganda and #IndiaTogether. Many ministers and BJP leaders tweeted using these hashtags, first used by the MEA in its statement, committing to India's unity.No propaganda can deter India’s unity!No propaganda can stop India to attain new heights!Propaganda can not decide India’s fate only ‘Progress’ can.India stands united and together to achieve progress.#IndiaAgainstPropaganda#IndiaTogether https://t.co/ZJXYzGieCtThough the tweets, MEA's statement do not mention Rihanna, the action from the government stems from American pop singer Rihanna's tweet on Tuesday in which she raised the issue of the farmers' protest and triggered huge international support for the ongoing farmers' protest.why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest https://t.co/obmIlXhK9SThe CNN article that Rihanna shared talked about how internet access in several districts in the national Capital was disrupted following the clashes between the Delhi police and farmers on January 26.The article also voiced "concerns over democracy" and said, "Although India is the world's most populous democracy, it also topped the world in terms of internet shutdowns in 2019, according to Access Now, an advocacy group which tracks internet freedom."The Centre claimed that this is a part of a concerted effort to hurt India's democracy and the ministry, in its statement, linked this with the recent incidents of desecration of Mahatma Gandhi's statues. "This is extremely disturbing for India and for civilised society everywhere... We would like to emphasise that these protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse," the statement said.It also sai that facts need to be ascertained before rushing to comment on such matters. "The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to be celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible," the statement said, denouncing the comments of international celebrities. After Rihanna, climate activist Greta Thunberg too tweeted in support of the farmers.Not only ministers or BJP leaders, but several Indian celebrities also took to Twitter on Wednesday rallying behind India's commitment to unity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/progress-not-propaganda-amit-shah-s-stern-message-on-farmers-protest-101612361980104.html

03-02-2021||India||Ahead of polls, TMC woos ST voters with demand for recognition of Sarna dharma||With an eye on the crucial assembly elections due in two months, the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal has raised the demand of giving recognition to Sarna dharma as a separate religious code in a bid to woo the state’s tribal voters.“I have kept all my promises. You had started a movement for Sarna Dharma. I have also written a letter (to the Centre) for (the recognition) of Sarna Dharma,” chief minister and TMC boss Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday while addressing a rally at Alipurduar on the third day of a four-day visit to north Bengal.She did not mention when she had written the letter.Followers of Sarna usually are nature worshippers who have their own gods and goddesses. They have been demanding recognition of it as a distinct religion for decades. At present, under the census, there are codes for only six religions: Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism.“We have formed laws so that none could take away the land from adivasis. I have also written a letter for giving recognition to Sarna Dharma. I have done everything for you,” Banerjee said.The tribal vote bank becomes crucial for any political party aiming to win the state’s assembly elections. Scheduled Tribes form around six per cent of the state’s population.Out of the 294 assembly states in the legislative assembly, while 68 seats are reserved for scheduled castes, 16 assembly constituencies are reserved for scheduled tribes. According to the 2019 Lok Sabha election trends, BJP was leading over TMC in 13 of the reserved seats. The BJP won both the Lok Sabha seats reserved for STs - Alipurduar and Jhargram.The tribal population in West Bengal is mostly concentrated in north Bengal and in the Jangalmahal (western districts). The BJP had made deep inroads in both these areas. While in north Bengal they had won seven out of the eight Lok Sabha seats, in Jangalmahal they had won all four seats.“It is a very good move by Mamata Banerjee and we welcome it. It has been a long term demand by the tribals to give recognition to Sarna and include it as a separate code in the census. This would enable tribals to mention their religion as Sarna while filling up forms. As of now they have to mention their religion as others as they can’t choose among Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and others,” said PC Hembram, general secretary of All India Adivasi Socio Educational and Cultural Association in Delhi.Back in November 2020, the Jharkhand assembly had passed a house resolution on Sarna Adivasi code for granting separate religious identity of the tribes in census 2021. In December 2020 at least 10 adivasi organisations submitted a memorandum to the state government demanding that it ask the Centre to recognise Sarna.That the TMC was desperate to win over the tribal votes was evident from the chief minister’s statements during her trip to north Bengal.“I have lost all seats in 2019. I am not ashamed. I feel that this time you will compensate me. Please compensate,” Banerjee urged the people of north Bengal as she listed out the sops which the state has showered on the tribal communities.On Tuesday, the TMC supremo went on a public relations overdrive as she danced with tribals at a mass wedding ceremony, organized by the state government in Alipurduar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-polls-tmc-woos-st-voters-with-demand-for-recognition-of-sarna-dharma-101612360880135.html

Calling the Centre's refusal to opposition's request for a debate in Parliament "undemocratic", the Thiruvananthapuram MP said, "If a debate were allowed to happen, MPs could voice the concerns of their constituents, the farmers, and propose solutions to the crisis.

This is undemocratic."Click here for complete coverage on Parliament sessionThe Lok Sabha has been adjourned till 9pm on Wednesday after several adjournments during the day as opposition MPs demanded a separate debate on farm laws."I just cannot understand the attitude of the Govt and the Speaker in refusing a discussion on the Farmers protests and instead insisting on clubbing it with the debate on the President's Address. Parliament exists to give people's representatives a voice on burning issues of the day!" Tharoor said."What does GoI think Parliament is for?

And most of all, it needs a powerful societal commitment, he said. "In these critical times, the youth should assist by providing the right information about the vaccination drive and other related policy actions of the government regarding Covid-19," he was quoted as saying in the statement.Applauding the efforts of scientists and health professionals, Vardhan observed, “Indian scientists and healthcare professionals have stood the test of time. While our Covid warriors have sacrificed themselves to ensure the safety of all of us, our scientists have done a laudable job by developing the Covid-19 vaccine. I can assure you that the government is working overtime to meet the challenge of vaccinating 1.35 billion people.”Lauding the college on its achievements, Vardhan appreciated the unwavering determination of the institute, its faculty members and all stakeholders in contributing towards nation building by churning out globally responsible citizens, conscientious of their community, society and the country as a whole, it said.He congratulated SRCC for being one of the best colleges for commerce in the continent and for producing notable alumni in every fieldlike corporate affairs, law, and politics, the statement said.Emphasising on the vision of seeing India as a 'Vishwa Guru' and the potential of the youth of the country which serves as its bedrock, Vardhan said the government places maximum emphasis on the youth of the nation, the statement said.The New Education Policy introduced by the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will surely change the quality of education services in the country for generations to come, he asserted."In fact, ensuring the highest standards of education is a top priority for our government because education forms the apex of the social pyramid. India is a country which has huge untapped potential of our youth," Vardhan said."Our beloved prime minister has given a clarion call for building a strong and self-reliant India, an 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' that is already rubbing shoulders with global superpowers. The dream of a self-reliant India can only be met if we encourage our youth to 'innovate, patent, produce and prosper' and lead our country towards faster development," he was quoted as saying in the statement.

Aggravating the issue further, many mainstream media channels are determined to change their names from 'Farmers' or “'Ann-daatas' to 'Terrorists' or 'Khalistanis', “ it said.The farmers are protesting at three Delhi borders for almost two months seeking repeal of three laws. They are: the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.On January 12, the apex court had already stayed the implementation of the contentious new farm laws till further orders and had constituted a committee to make recommendations to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers' unions protesting at Delhi borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyers-urge-cji-to-take-cognizance-of-internet-shutdown-order-at-delhi-borders-101612356805843.html

03-02-2021||India||BJP leader responds to Rahul Gandhi, Rihanna on farmers' protest||Smarting from the criticism by opposition leaders and international celebrities over its handling of farmers’ protest, the Bharatiya Janata party on Wednesday accused former Congress president Rahul Gandhi of instigating farm leaders and alleged that he is using the protest for his own political gains.“He is trying to incite people. He is the one who earlier said that there will be fire in the cities and it will go to the slums. Today, he has again threatened that no one will step back. This is an agitation of the farmers and they are saying they are not associated with any political party and this is not a political movement. So why are you speaking on their behalf,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said addressing the media.Defending the government’s outreach towards the protesting farmers, Patra said those such as singer Rihanna who are commenting on the issue are not familiar with Indian democracy.“There have been 11 rounds of talks with the farmers where ministers were present. The Prime Minister at the all-party meeting has assured that the agriculture minister is a phone call away, this is democracy,” Patra said.“Both Rihanna and Rahul know nothing about agriculture; they know nothing about Rabi or kharif crops. Where were these people when Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in California was desecrated; he’s an apostle of peace across the globe none of these people tweeted about it then,” Patra added.Global pop star Rihanna on Tuesday extended her support to the farmers by sharing a news report highlighting the internet shutdown aimed at crippling the protest movement. "Why aren't we talking about this?", she tweeted.At a press conference today, Rahul Gandhi said the national capital was being converted into a fortress and questioned why the government was "threatening, beating and killing farmers". He urged the government to have a dialogue and resolve the problem.The Delhi police have used concrete barricades, barbed wire, spikes, trenches to cut off access to farmer protest sites at its border. There is massive deployment of security personnel around the protest sites.“He should remember what happened on January 26. The whole world saw how the country dealt with it. The Congress then wanted to know why the Delhi police did not take steps. Why did the Delhi police allow people to reach the Red Fort is what the Congress and Rahul Gandhi had asked. Today when the Delhi police is making arrangements; the same Delhi police that showed patience and restraint, the Congress is again asking questions,” Patra said.Watch: ‘Rahul, Rihanna & racket’: BJP attacks Congress over farmer protestsThe BJP also accused the Congress of seeking the release of those who have been arrested for violence on January 26 even as these people had earlier been dubbed as BJP workers and sympathisers.On Republic Day, the tractor parade to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal the three new agriculture laws turned violent as protesters deviated from routes, attacked police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag on the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.“The Congress party in Punjab said those who have been arrested for inciting violence should be released immediately and they should be given legal aid from the Congress. The question is are these people from the Congress who scaled Red Fort and hoisted a religious flag? Earlier all the leaders of the Congress had said that these are BJP workers and their agents who were sent to the Red Fort to create unrest and create violence to defame the agitation,” Patra alleged.To a question on Gandhi’s comment about the lack of leadership in the country, Patra said, what the Wayanad MP wanted to say was that the Congress lacks leadership.Delving into the past, Patra said In 1998 the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh had fired bullets at a farmers rally in the state and 28 farmers had been killed.“Today Rahul Gandhi is trying to question us on what grounds? And Gandhi is accusing the government of killing farmers,” the BJP spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-s-counterpunch-to-rahul-gandhi-rihanna-on-farmers-protest-101612357016117.html

He further added that the country was safe in the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“The country is safe in the hands of PM Modi and the common man knows that. As far as tweets are concerned, the ministry of external affairs has issued a statement on it. It’s our internal issue that we’re going to resolve,” said Nadda who is on a two-day visit to Kerala to review the party’s preparation ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections.Amid recent tweets made by prominent foreign personalities such as Rihanna, Greta Thunberg on the protest against the farm laws, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday that facts needed to be ascertained before commenting on such issues. “Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken. The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” the ministry had said in a statement.The country is safe in hands of PM Modi & the common man knows that.

Talking about the violence which erupted during the tractor rally on Republic Day, he said that it was the Centre’s sympathetic attitude that Police didn’t take any action against any of the protesters as ‘they’re our people’. “What happened on Jan 26, it was our sympathetic attitude that Police didn’t take action as they’re our people. Govt dealt with it while trying to see no untoward incident takes place.” Nadda added.The Delhi Police have arrested 122 people in connection with the Republic Day rally and said that nearly 400 of its personnel were injured in the clashes and 30 police vehicles were damaged. The Police also clarified that it had not illegally detained farmers or any other people post the incident and urged people to not pay attention to such rumours.Also Watch| Modi govt slams Rihanna, Greta Thunberg & other celebs’ tweets on farmers﻿﻿Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court refused to entertain petitions seeking its intervention into the January 26 mayhem and allowed petitioners to withdraw their petitions.

03-02-2021||India||China steps up Covid vaccine diplomacy as competition with India heats up||China on Wednesday said it would provide 10 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the global COVAX initiative as it seeks to step-up its vaccine diplomacy amid projections from experts that India could become the "engine" for the distribution of the jabs to the world.China offered to supply vaccines to COVAX even as it awaited emergency approval for its shots from the World Health Organisation (WHO).COVAX, formally known as the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, is a global initiative, which aims at ensuring that middle and lower-income countries get timely access to coronavirus vaccines.China has decided to provide 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to COVAX to meet the urgent needs of developing countries, at the request of the WHO, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here.China last year joined COVAX, which is co-led by Gavi, an international vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the WHO.Chinese officials said the country is currently conducting field trials for 16 vaccines, while it has so far granted conditional approval to one of its jabs -- Sinopharm, even as it began supplying the shot to a number of countries, including Pakistan.Recently, over 80 people were arrested in China in a crackdown against smuggling of spurious vaccines filled with saline water. Some of the counterfeit vaccines reportedly were being sent to African countries.China's announcement to provide vaccines to COVAX came as India has already begun providing the jabs to a number of countries.Beijing had announced that it would supply three lakh vaccines to Sri Lanka after New Delhi dispatched five lakh doses to Colombo. China has also offered its vaccine supplies to Nepal, Maldives and Brazil, which has already received the first batch of supplies from India.South Africa has received one million doses of Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India in Pune as India moved to use its vaccine diplomacy to shore up its global image, putting it in direct competition with China, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that his country expects another 500,000 doses from India later this month.Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, told SCMP that "India, and especially the Serum Institute, was likely to be the engine for vaccine distribution to the world, especially for low- and middle-income countries".Gostin said India and China had been locked in a geopolitical struggle for many years now, and the rivalry was only intensifying.He said China had a long history of seeking political, commercial or diplomatic gains for its various projects. "For example, China has used the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for its economic and military advantage. China is using its vaccines for similar geostrategic advantage,” Gostin said.However, “India does not have a history of seeking special benefits from its health assistance,” he said."India has long been seen as a helpful partner in ensuring affordable drugs and vaccines to lower-income countries. I expect that to continue,” the Post quoted him as saying.Known as the 'pharmacy of the world', India produces 60 per cent of vaccines globally||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-steps-up-covid-vaccine-diplomacy-as-competition-with-india-heats-up-101612355993470.html

This was egregiously witnessed on January 26, India's Republic Day. A cherished national commemoration, the anniversary of the inauguration of the Constitution of India, was besmirched, and violence and vandalism took place in the Indian Capital," the statement read.Without referring to Rihanna or Thunberg, the statement continued, "Some of these vested interest groups have also tried to mobilise international support against India/I. Instigated by such fringe elements, Mahatma Gandhi statues have been desecrated in parts of the world...""Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that facts be ascertained and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken.

But the survey, whose findings are much more conservative than a private one from last week, indicates India's actual cases may have crossed 300 million.The state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which conducted the survey, said it would only share the findings at a news conference on Thursday. The source declined to be named ahead of the official announcement.It was not immediately clear how many people participated in the latest survey.Following another survey done in August and September using blood samples of more than 29,000 people older than 10, ICMR had concluded that one in 15 Indians had Covid-19 antibodies. The figure jumped to one in six in densely-populated urban slums.A survey released by the government of the capital New Delhi this week found that more than half of its 20 million inhabitants may have been infected with the coronavirus.Separate tests done on more than 700,000 people across India by diagnostics company Thyrocare Technologies showed 55% of the population may have already been infected, its chief told Reuters last week.The World Health Organization says at least 60% to 70% of a population needs to have immunity to break the chain of transmission.India reported 11,039 new cases on Wednesday. Deaths rose by 110 to 154,596. Infections and fatalities have come down significantly since a mid-September peak of nearly 100,000 a day.Its vaccination programme, touted by the government as the world's biggest, has covered more than 4 million people in 18 days, with the aim to reach 300 million by August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-300-million-indians-may-have-contracted-covid-19-report-101612352760358.html

03-02-2021||India||Bengal govt to probe corruption charges against former minister who joined BJP||The Mamata Banerjee-led administration is probing corruption charges against former Bengal minister and ex-Trinamool Congress leader Rajib Banerjee, who recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party.“The man, who was with us but has now left, had done some anomalies in the recruitment process of Bon Sahayaks. He committed theft and then shifted to the BJP,” she alleged, without naming anyone.The TMC chief was speaking at a convention of party workers cum public rally at Alipurduar in north Bengal on Wednesday.“I have received complaints from many people. We are investigating the matter. The investigation will continue even if elections are likely to be announced in the next three to four days,” she said.Rajib Banerjee joined the BJP on January 30, a day after he quit the TMC and resigned as an MLA of the ruling party. Earlier in January, he had resigned as the forest minister.Even though Rajib Banerjee could not be contacted, the BJP hit back saying that if the chief minister knew that the forest minister was corrupt why did she send her emissaries to stop him from joining the BJP?“Rajib was a blue-eyed boy for the TMC when he was with them. We know Rajib and he comes from a good family. If the chief minister knew that Rajib was corrupt why did she send TMC MP Saugata Roy and state minister Partha Chatterjee to retain him in the party? Why did her police not take any action? People understand everything. Those leaders, who are not being able to stay with the TMC with respect and are deserting the party, are being branded as corrupt,” said Jai Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s state vice president.Mamata attacked the BJP saying that the party is a washing machine where corrupt people join to come out clean.“All the thieves, goons and dacoits are joining the BJP and the party says that they will defeat the TMC. You can never defeat the TMC,” she alleged.Rajib Banerjee said at a public rally later in the day: “Today she brought charges of corruption against me. I had handed over the recruitment process to the board. On October 8, I informed the chief minister that a TMC leader from Birbhum had demanded that all the posts should be handed over to him so that he could make appointments. She, however, said that the jobs of Bon Sahayaks should be distributed among TMC leaders and workers in the districts. I have documents to prove that recommendations had come from various leaders including those from Kalighat (chief minister’s residence).”He also said that the chief minister should investigate all contractual jobs till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-to-probe-corruption-charges-against-former-minister-who-joined-bjp-101612350372328.html

(If that happens) those winning elections using EVMs will get defeated," NCP's Maharashtra chief spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said in a statement without naming any party or individual.His comments came a day after Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Nana Patole asked the state legislature to frame a law to make available to the electors the option of casting votes using ballot papers too besides EVMs.Several Opposition parties, including the Congress, had in the past demanded the Election Commission to revert to the ballot paper system while alleging the EVM tampering in polls.On the other hand, the BJP had previously hit out at the Opposition for raising doubts over the credibility of the EVMs.Tapase also referred to political parties in the past flagging several concerns before the Election Commission over technical glitches in and tampering of EVMs."It is natural that Patole's instruction to the state legislature on framing such a law will rankle some people, but it is an important step of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the state towards strengthening democracy," he added.The Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress are the key constituents of the MVA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-of-paper-ballots-will-defeat-parties-who-owe-their-win-to-evms-ncp-101612348917292.html

The family member used to demand money from the subordinates of Agarwal when he was posted in Dausa in lieu of transfers and other professional favours. We are obtaining the call records of the particular family member,” said an ACB official familiar with the development of the case.The anti-graft agency officials claim that they have enough evidence against the accused IPS officer and two state services officers and one of his middlemen who were arrested on January 14 to prove that they worked in tandem to extort money from a road construction company owner and contractor.“Sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) Pinky Meena (Bandikui) and Pushkar Mittal (Dausa), Neeraj Meena, alleged middleman of the then Dausa superintendent of police (SP) Manish Agarwal, and the IPS officer targeted the complainant to extort money,” said another ACB official.The official added that some chats from the mobile phone and locations of Mittal also prove that they were working in an organized manner to extort money.Earlier on January 14, two sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) Pinky Meena (Bandikui) and Pushkar Mittal (Dausa) and one Neeraj Meena, an alleged middleman employed by Manish Agarwal, were arrested in the same case.During investigation, it was found that the IPS officer was involved in the extortion bid on the contractor in connivance with other government officials and a middleman. The lid was blown off the racket after a complaint was filed against some of the accused officers, according to an ACB officer.Agarwal, a 2010 batch IPS officer of Jammu and Kashmir cadre, has a history of controversies.In 2015, a case of corruption was registered against him and his reader by J&K ACB . The officer had allegedly demand bribe of ₹five lakh to release two suspects in a suicide case of a 21-year-old woman in Jammu. However, the case is pending due to lack of prosecution sanction.His cadre was transferred from Jammu and Kashmir to the IPS cadre of Rajasthan on the ground of marriage with an IPS officer of Rajasthan.In six-years of service in Rajasthan, he has been posted only twice as SP of districts. He served as Barmer SP for four months and then as Dausa’s police chief for six months. He was removed after complaints of corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2day-police-remand-for-ips-officer-in-rajasthan-arrested-for-alleged-extortion-101612351191401.html

The proposed reforms should be discussed with engineers and employees to see whether they will address challenges or aggravate them," Gupta said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-engineers-employees-stage-nationwide-protest-against-privatisation-101612348871101.html

This year Ash Wednesday falls on February 17.The festival is said to represent one last swig of the bottle and a steak of beef before 40 days of abstinence kick-in. While not celebrated at the scale of those parades in Europe or Brazil, Goa’s carnival parades represent the only surviving such parades in Asia where the Portuguese once had many colonies and trading posts.At a meeting, Goa’s tourism department and the municipal corporation of Panaji agreed to tone down celebrations although the parade will be held.“The government has decided that we shall go ahead with the carnival. People have been stuck at home for a long time now and no events also have taken place. So this is an opportunity to come out and enjoy a bit and people have also begun taking precautions. People now know the measures to be taken to avoid Covid. So I don't expect that there will be a big problem,” mayor of Panaji Uday Madkaikar said.“Corona hasn't ended, the cases may have come down compared to earlier. All measures will be taken. We will also appeal to people to take care,” he added.The floats are led by King Momo, a mascot who is figuratively symbolically given the keys to the city and reads out a decree declaring three days of fun and merrymaking urging people to ‘Eat, drink and make merry!”Besides the float parades involving decorated floats representing various facets of Goa’s life and culture, the festival is also celebrated through dances and community events, all of which will be toned down this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-to-tone-down-carnival-celebrations-amid-covid-19-pandemic-101612347259853.html

The forest department officials say their “bigger challenge” is to find a place to keep these animals.The vehicle carrying camels was coming from Haryana and was en route to Malda in West Bengal from where the animals were to be sent to Bangladesh, officials said.A total of nine persons - including three people who were traveling in the camel laden vehicle, while six other persons who had come to bribe the forest official, who rescued the camel - have been arrested, officials said.Divisional forest officer (DFO), Pakur, Rajnish Kumar, said, “Fifteen camels were rescued in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. Now, we have a bigger challenge to keep these animals, as we neither have a dedicated shelter for these animals nor trained people to handle them.”The forest range officer, Pakur, Anil Kumar Singh, said, “I received a tip off about the illegal transportation of camels around midnight. I, along with my team, rushed to the spot and rescued the animals.”He said the driver, helper and a labourer, who were in the vehicle, were arrested. “During the investigation, they said the heavy vehicle containing the camels was coming from Haryana. The driver and helper, who drove the vehicle from Haryana, got down at Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh and handed over the vehicle to another driver and helper. The driver said his duty was to drive the vehicle to Malda in West Bengal,” Singh said.Singh further said, “In the early hours on Wednesday, I received a call that requested me to leave the vehicle in lieu of money. Six persons in an SUV came to bribe me and offered ₹20,000. We arrested all six persons and seized the SUV and bribe amount. The process of lodging FIR is on.”Earlier, on January 12, the forest division had seized a truck containing 14 camels. Two camels had already died in the truck, while two others died two days after the rescue due to inhuman transportation of the camels. The animals were being smuggled from Mewat in Rajasthan and transported to Bangladesh, forest officials said.Since Jharkhand doesn’t have proper climate and shelter to keep these rescued camels, People for Animals (PFA), an NGO, has expressed willingness to take back the animals to Rajasthan, as it has a camel rehabilitation shelter in Rajasthan’s Sirohi area.PFA officer, Rana Ghosh said, “As per the animal transportation rule, these animals need to be vaccinated before taking them to Rajasthan. Once it is completed, we will take them to our rehabilitation centre.”Ghosh said, “Camels are transported from Rajasthan to Haryana. From there, they are transported to Bangladesh through Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Generally, it is the job of police to track such illegal transportation. However, the forest department is doing police’s job in Jharkhand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-rescues-15-camels-says-lacks-trained-staff-to-handle-them-101612346819255.html
03-02-2021||India||SC notice on transfer petition to settle uniform age of marriage for men, women||The Supreme Court issued notice on a petition seeking 21 years to be fixed as the uniform marriageable age for both men and women during the hearing on a transfer petition moved by a lawyer and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.The notice was issued to the petitioners in two similar cases pending in Delhi and Rajasthan high courts.Upadhyay, in his petition, stated that the present legal framework, that allows girls to marry at 18 years of age and boys at 21 years of age, aggravates the gender inequality that exists within a marital relationship.“While men are permitted to get married at the age of 21, women are married when they are just 18. The distinction is based on patriarchal stereotypes, has no scientific backing, perpetrates de jure and de facto inequality against women, and goes completely against the global trends,” the petition stated.Upadhyay had raised this issue before the Delhi high court in August 2019 where the issue is still being examined. He later came across a similar petition filed in the Rajasthan high court by one Abdul Mannan. Both petitions argued that the different ages for marriage violated the fundamental rights of equality (Article 14), protection against discrimination (Article 15), and dignity of life (Article 21) of citizens and went against India’s commitment under the convention on elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW).The Supreme Court has power under Article 139A to transfer to itself, cases involving the same or substantially the same questions of law pending before two or more high courts. Upadhyay decided to approach the top court for a common determination of the question of law arising in both petitions.His petition claimed that 125 countries have uniform minimum age of marriage for boys and girls and by ending the discrimination in age, women will have equal opportunities as men to pursue their education, employment opportunities without being hindered by family compulsion to get married.Also Read: SC refuses to entertain pleas seeking intervention into R-Day violenceUpadhyay argued that women in a married relationship are expected to perform a subordinate role vis-à-vis the husband. “This power imbalance is deeply aggravated by the age differential, because age itself constitutes a hierarchy of power. A younger spouse is therefore expected to respect and be servile to her elder partner, which aggravates the pre-existing gender-based hierarchy in the marital relationship,” his petition stated.Across religions, whether it is the Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, Indian Christian Marriage Act or the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, the marriageable age for men and women is 21 and 18 years respectively, the petition claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-on-transfer-petition-to-settle-uniform-age-of-marriage-for-men-women-101612347102439.html

Nine others received the vaccine from the same vial from which Pahan was vaccinated and they are all fine.

A video of farmers' leaders, including Bharatiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, falling as the stage caves in has surfaced.#WATCH | The stage on which Bharatiya Kisan Union (Arajnaitik) leader Rakesh Tikait & other farmer leaders were standing, collapses in Jind, Haryana.A 'Mahapanchayat' is underway in Jind. pic.twitter.com/rBwbfo0Mm1The Mahapanchayat, one in the series that have been taking place in the last few days, was organised at Kandela village sports stadium. It was organised by Haryana khap leaders to discuss the future of the ongoing farmers' protests.This is the first Kisan mahapanchayat in Haryana.Get your facts right: India responds to barbs from celebrities on farm protestAfter farmers' so-far peaceful protest ran into trouble following tractor march fiasco, the protest has been garnering support from panchayats. There have been mahapanchayats at Muzaffarnagar, Mathura and Baghpat in the past few days. But the Jind one was the first one to be attended by Rakesh Tikait.Organisers earlier said that they made arrangement for 50,000 people. But the presence of Rakesh Tikait has apparently been a crowd-puller and more people than what could be accommodated at the venue reached the spot, possibly leading to the collapsing of the stage. It was not immediately known whether there were any injuries.After farmers' tractor march on Republic Day deviated from its pre-decided route and resulted in a stand-off with the Delhi Police at ITO and the Red Fort, the Capital Police have launched a severe crackdown on farmers' leaders. Ghaziabad administration reportedly asked protesters to vacate Ghazipur protest site to which Rakesh Tikait said he would rather end his life but not withdraw the protest. His appeal is believed to have infused fresh enthusiasm in the protest and as many farmers headed towards Delhi after his emotional appeal, Kisan mahapanchayats are being held. In the panchayats held so far, khap leaders, in a show of strength, have decided to throw their weight behind the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jind-mahapanchayat-rakesh-tikait-farmer-leaders-fall-as-stage-collapses-101612345216364.html

Instead of the word Hindu, he should have used the word ‘manuwadi’ or ‘brahminwadi’,” said the former judge.Kolse Patil also criticised the BJP for demanding action against the AMU leader. “BJP is making an issue out of this, purely to defame Elgar Parishad. Those who are now talking about Hindus, we appeal to them for a discussion.” Usmani did not respond to calls and text messages.Following his remarks, Swargate police filed an FIR against Usmani on Tuesday, based on the complaint by advocate and the general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), Padeep Gawade.

The first target identified by the global community is for establishing an action plan for road safety .... reducing the road fatalities to half by 2030 aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals,” said K K Kapila, President Emeritus, IRF.Road, Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate the webinar series on February 9, IRF said.The webinar series is designed for all stakeholders of road safety in central and state governments, industries, corporates, all skilled professionals and the general public to participate and contribute by giving ideas and information for the development of an all-encompassing and sustainable action plan for road safety in India, it said."This action plan will then be recommended to the central and state governments for their adoption for the decade (2021-2030) with a systematic execution plan, pursued consistently with necessary funding support, to realise the target of reducing the road deaths by half by 2030,” said S Gangopadhyay, President, India chapter of IRF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-to-inaugurate-webinar-series-on-road-safety-on-feb-9-101612344604349.html

The joint military exercise will enhance the level of defence cooperation between both armies which will also foster the bilateral relations between both nations and reiterate India's key role as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific region,” he said in a release.The exercise is being held in India also assumes significance in the backdrop of recent developments on northern borders, and conveys the strategic posture of the two nations as well as enhanced upward trajectory in Indo-US relations, he said."The exercise is being conducted despite the Covid-19 pandemic which indicates the strength of bilateral relations and conveys a geo-strategic message to the environment,” the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indous-joint-military-exercise-yudh-abhyas-to-begin-in-rajasthan-on-feb-8-101612343866346.html
03-02-2021||India||Govt puts Twitter on notice for unblocking 250 accounts, threatens prosecution||The government has cited the unblocking of over 250 accounts and posts that talked about “farmer genocide” and issued a notice to Twitter saying the social media company was violating the Information Technology Act’s Section 69 that provides for seven-year imprisonment.“This a is motivated campaign to abuse, inflame and create tension in society on unsubstantiated grounds. Incitement to Genocide is Not Freedom of Speech; It is Threat to Law & Order,” said the notice issued on Tuesday, a copy of which HT has seen.The notice said the government has considered the submissions of Twitter but has found that it is necessary to take down the accounts in the public interest. “Having considered in totality, the contents of the interim order, the oral submissions of the advocate/representative of Twitter at the Committee meeting, and also the mail from Twitter expressing its disobedience of the legal blocking orders, the competent authority is satisfied that it is necessary and also expedient in the interest of public order and also for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to public order that Twitter, as an intermediary under section 2[1][w] of the act is once again directed to block for access by the public, the said Twitter handles and also the said hashtag with immediate effect...”The notice added Twitter is bound by the Indian laws. “You are aware of the prevailing situation, which not only has the potential, but has in fact, resulted into a major public order issue [violence] on 26.01.2021 [during the farmer tractor rally on Republic Day]. The statutory authorities are doing everything possible to ensure that no adverse public order situation takes place and no cognizable offences are committed,” the notice said.It added Twitter has no “constitutional, statutory or any legal basis whatsoever to comment upon the interplay of statutory provisions with constitutional principles or to unilaterally read down the scope of statutory provisions as per its own limited private understanding of the constitutional and statutory laws of India”.The notice has also cited over half a dozen Supreme Court judgements including that of the constitutional bench as to what is public order and what are the rights of the authorities. “Twitter being an intermediary is obliged to obey the directions as per satisfaction of authorities as to which information content will arouse passion and impact public order,” the notice said.HT reached out to Twitter for a comment but did not receive one immediately.The government wrote to Twitter to take down posts and accounts that ran the controversial hashtag last week.“This [unblocking] is a clear violation of the Indian law that Twitter is supposed to follow,” said an official. “The farmers’ protest has been going on for months, but the government did not block a single account earlier,” said a second official familiar with the matter. “If such a decision was taken, it would have factored in the consequences of running a hashtag that alludes to senior people in the government being involved in some sort of conspiracy.”Also Read | Delhi Police announce cash rewards for info on R-Day violence suspectsTwitter temporarily withheld from Indian users nearly 250 accounts that allegedly used the controversial hashtag after the government asked the social media company to block access to the handles “to prevent an escalation of violence” in the backdrop of the farmers’ agitation, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The local ban was imposed in the morning. By evening, the accounts were restored, and Twitter said the content constituted free speech and was newsworthy. At least one of the handles restricted said it deleted a tweet that used the controversial hashtag.Among the handles temporarily withdrawn was that of Kisan Ekta Morcha, a farm organisation linked to the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is an umbrella group leading the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders.The action was also taken against Twitter accounts of media outlet Caravan, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar, activist Hansraj Meena, former Lok Sabha member Mohammed Salim, and actor Sushant Singh, among others. All accounts were restored by evening.The electronics and information technology ministry issued the directions under Section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act after the Union home ministry stepped in. “The home ministry said that the tweets could lead to an adverse law and order situation. The accounts have been withheld to prevent an escalation of violence,” a government official familiar with the matter said.The action was criticised by activists and free speech advocates, who said the temporary suspension of the accounts violated constitutional rights to freedom of speech. They alleged Twitter had different standards of moderation and complying with government orders in different countries.Under Section 69 (A), the government can suspend accounts that pose a threat to public order.“...Section 69A [3] provides for specific penal consequences in case of non-compliance of the directions issued under section 69 A of the Act,” the notice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sends-notice-to-twitter-for-violating-indian-law-by-unblocking-accounts-101612343691100.html

In the first phase health and frontline workers are being immunised while in the second phase those above 50 years and those in the high risk group will be given the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-fastest-nation-to-reach-4-million-covid-19-vaccination-mark-in-18-days-govt-101612340462609.html

Go to the High Court where an investigation is going on. Dismiss."The plea filed by Puneet Dhanda had said the top court around four months back directed the CBI to conduct an enquiry in the case of actor's death but nothing has happened since then.The PIL filed through advocate Vineet Dhanda said the top court had ordered CBI inquiry into the Sushant Singh Rajput death case on August 19, 2020, and despite lapsing of almost four months, the CBI is yet to conclude its investigation and all the eager family members, fans, well-wishers of the late actor are yet to get a solace regarding the exact reason of his death.The CBI is not acting responsibly in the present case and there is a delay in the conclusion of the investigation of the case, the plea alleged. "Even in serious offences like murder, the law stipulates filing of charge sheets in ninety days but in the present case the premium investigating agency has failed miserably in their role and the unnecessary delay in the present case is bringing bad name to the administration of justice not only in our country but across the globe," it added.The petitioner prayed that CBI should be directed to submit a status report in the progress of the investigation regarding Singh's death and also to complete its investigation within a period of two months. He further urged the CBI to submit a copy of the final investigation report before the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-case-sc-dismisses-plea-seeking-direction-to-cbi-to-submit-status-report-101612340440462.html

It does not, however, negate the need for such legislation especially when DNA technology is already in use,” the Committee noted in its report which was tabled in the Parliament on Wednesday. “In fact, its use in recent months has exposed a false encounter in which innocents were killed contradicting initial claims made that they were militants. The Committee is of the strong opinion that an enabling ecosystem must be created soon to ensure that DNA profiling is done in a manner that is fully consistent with the letter and spirit of various Supreme Court judgments and with of the Constitution of India,” the report added.Also Read | Parliament proceedings halted amid protest over farm laws: All you need to knowThe Committee has consulted legal and forensic science experts including members of Internet Freedom Foundation, National Law University, Centre for Internet and Society, Gujarat Forensic Sciences University among others.The main purpose of the bill as per the Department of Biotechnology is to enable identification of missing children and of unidentified deceased individuals including disaster victims; apprehend repeat offenders for heinous crimes (rape, murder, etc.); develop stringent standards, and quality assurance system to grant approval and accreditation to the laboratories undertaking DNA profiling; regulate the use of DNA profiles in establishing identity in criminal and civil proceedings. The bill aims to establish a DNA regulatory board which will advise the Centre and the state governments on establishing of DNA laboratories, DNA data banks and laying down guidelines, standards and procedures for establishment and functioning of such laboratories and data banks.The Department of Biotechnology suggests that the DNA profiles to be stored are not for the entire population but for specified categories of individuals such as convicts and suspects of major crimes, relatives of missing persons (so that their DNA profiles can be compared with profiles of unidentified deceased individuals).The Parliamentary standing committee has recommended that the DNA regulatory board should be independent and not comprise wholly of serving government officials. It has also recommended independent and impartial checks and balances at every stage of the process: each of the police, prosecution and judicial service is independent, which means that there is a clear qualitative check at every stage so that only those cases, where there is a good chance of conviction is taken forward to arrest, charge sheet and then to trial. It also recommends that there should be careful watch on whether DNA evidence collected is legally obtained and no person is forced to provide evidence that may incriminate him/her in any crime.Binoy Viswam, leader of Communist Party of India and member of the standing committee, and Asaduddin Owaisi, member of Parliament and president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, have raised concerns that provisions of the bill will lead to violation of the right to privacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/address-fears-over-dna-technology-bill-in-parliament-and-outside-panel-to-govt-101612340870918.html

03-02-2021||India||‘No summons issued’: MHA denies sending notices over farmers’ stir||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday told the Rajya Sabha that neither the National Investigation Agency (NIA) nor Enforcement Directorate (ED) had sent summons to more than three dozen people related to various agencies and groups providing “humanitarian support” to the ongoing farmers’ agitation on the outskirts of Delhi against the three contentious farm laws.“NIA and ED have not issued summons against 40 people related with voluntary agencies, groups and individuals who are providing humanitarian support to the farmers’ agitation,” the ministry said in a written reply in the Upper House on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, the central government and the Opposition arrived at a consensus to allot 15 hours to discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the farmers’ movement.Last month, farmers’ leaders and the Opposition had claimed that the NIA, the country's premier anti-terror probe agency, had issued summons to 40 activists from Punjab in a bid to “intimidate” them into withdrawing their support to the protests. The summons were reportedly in connection with a sedition case against Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, the legal adviser of the US-based Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan outfit. Baldev Singh Sirsa, who heads the Lok Bhalai Insaf Welfare Society, is among those who accused the NIA of sending summons.Also Read | NIA summons farm union leader Baldev Singh Sirsa, Sikh activists for questioning in sedition caseSirsa, whose organisation is among those leading protests against the farm laws, is among the farmers’ leaders who have held 11 rounds of talks with the Centre thus far, demanding a complete repeal of the legislations. In the 10th round of talks, on January 20, the leaders had raised the issue of the NIA summons with the Centre. Earlier, Sirsa himself had called the summons an “attempt to terrorise the people of Punjab with the sole motive to derail the farmers’ agitation.”The MHA had banned the SFJ in July 2019, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). In January, the Delhi Police announced that it had, earlier that month, booked the group under the UAPA for advocating “Referendum 2020,” a movement for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-summons-issued-mha-denies-sending-notices-over-farmers-stir-101612338303259.html
03-02-2021||India||Get your facts right: India responds to barbs from celebrities on farm protest||India on Wednesday said criticism of the government’s handling of the farmers’ protests against three farm laws by foreign individuals was “neither accurate nor responsible” in a response to comments by musician Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg.A statement issued by the external affairs ministry contended “vested interest groups” are trying to enforce their agenda on the protests to derail them and said these groups have tried to mobilise global support against India. The statement also referred to “sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” by “celebrities and others” but didn’t name anyone.It is rare for the external affairs ministry to respond to tweets by foreign celebrities criticising events within the country though it has, in recent weeks, pushed back against comments by leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and lawmakers in other countries supporting the farmers’ protest.“We would like to emphasise that these protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse,” the statement said.Also Read | SC refuses to entertain pleas seeking intervention into R-Day violence“Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken. The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” it said.On Wednesday, 18-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, who was the youngest person of the year named by Time magazine, tweeted: “We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India.” The tweet was both supported and criticised by sections within the country.A day earlier, singer Rihanna triggered a storm by tweeting “Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest,” along with a link to the same CNN article about the farmers’ protest that was included in Thunberg’s tweet. Author Meena Harris, niece of US vice-president Kamala Harris, also tweeted about the farmers’ protest. “We ALL should be outraged by India’s internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters,” she wrote.It’s no coincidence that the world’s oldest democracy was attacked not even a month ago, and as we speak, the most populous democracy is under assault. This is related. We ALL should be outraged by India’s internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters. https://t.co/yIvCWYQDD1 pic.twitter.com/DxWWhkemxWUnusually, the external affairs ministry’s statement included two hashtags - #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda. This is the first time hashtags were included in a statement.The farmers’ protest began on November 26, and after several rounds of negotiations with the government failed to end the impasse over three central farm laws, farmers’ unions backing the agitation planned to intensify their protest.They organised a tractor rally to New Delhi on Republic Day that turned violent. Many protesters and policemen were injured. Authorities responded by shutting down the internet, digging ditches, driving nails into roads and topping barricades with razor wire to prevent farmers from entering the capital again.Farmers have been protesting against the three laws – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 – and the external affairs ministry said these “reformist legislation” were passed by Parliament after a “full debate and discussion”.“These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming,” it said, explaining the government’s position on the laws.It said “a very small section of farmers in parts of India” had reservations about the reforms and the government initiated a series of talks with their representatives. Union ministers were part of the negotiations in 11 rounds of talks. “The government has even offered to keep the laws on hold, an offer iterated by no less than the Prime Minister of India,” it said.“Yet, it is unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them. This was egregiously witnessed on January 26, India’s Republic Day. A cherished national commemoration, the anniversary of the inauguration of the Constitution of India, was besmirched, and violence and vandalism took place in the Indian capital,” the statement said.The ministry said, “Some of these vested interest groups have also tried to mobilise international support against India”. Instigated by such “fringe elements”, Mahatma Gandhi statues were desecrated in parts of the world, and this is “extremely disturbing for India and for civilised society everywhere”.It added that Indian police had handled these protests with “utmost restraint”, and that “hundreds of men and women serving in the police have been physically attacked, and in some cases stabbed and seriously wounded”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-dismisses-support-of-farmers-protest-by-rihanna-greta-thunberg-101612338830933.html

Talking about Republic Day violence, the MEA further said that "vested interest groups are trying to enforce their agenda on these protests"."Parliament of India, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector.

The central government has projected the laws as "historic reforms" in the agriculture sector that will work in favour of farmers by removing middlemen and giving them the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, farmers fear that it will put them at the mercy of the big corporates and will remove the Minimum Support Price (MSP).The stir received support from American singer Rihanna and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. "Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest," Rihanna tweeted to her more than 100 million followers along with an article that talked about suspension of the internet in areas where these farmers are protesting.Taking it further, Thunberg tweeted, "We stand in solidarity with the farmers' protest in India."Apart from Thunberg, UK Member of Parliament Claudia Webbe also expressed solidarity with the Indian farmers. Author and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, Meena also showed her support on social media towards the agitating farmers as well.

He was directed to furnish a bond of ₹2 lakh, two sureties for the like amount and appear before the investigating officers in Kochi every Monday.Opposing the bail plea, customs had contended, "Sivasankar's influence posed the danger of intimidation of witnesses, as he was stationed at Thiruvananthapuram. The dubious conduct of the petitioner extended beyond the borders of the country, where too he appeared to command tremendous influence," according to new agency ANI.The dollar case relates to alleged smuggling of $1,90,000 (equivalent to ₹1.30 crore) by a former finance head of the UAE Consulate in Thiruvananthapuram to Muscat in Oman. The senior IAS officer, who was arrested in October last year for his alleged liaison with some of the other accused, was granted bail by a Kochi court dealing with economic offences. He will be released from the Kakkanad sub jail later today after remaining in judicial custody for more than 90 days.Earlier, he was given bail in two cases and the dollar case was the only one pending against him. On January 25, additional chief Judicial magistrate's (economic offences) court approved his bail in the case registered by the Customs Department on the grounds that customs didn't file charge sheet in the case.Following his alleged involvement in the case came to the fore, Sivasankar was suspended from service and the government disowned him.The Kerala gold smuggling case, which pertains to the smuggling of gold in the state through diplomatic channels, came to the light after 30 kg gold worth ₹14.82 crore smuggled in a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic baggage was busted by the customs department Thiruvananthapuram on July 5, 2019.Three federal agencies - Enforcement Directorate (ED), National Investigative Agency (NIA) and Customs department -are probing the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-s-former-principal-secretary-m-sivasankar-gets-bail-in-gold-smuggling-101612337232361.html

03-02-2021||India||Ahead of assembly polls, Assam to appoint 29,700 teachers on Friday||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government in Assam will appoint 29,700 teachers at schools and colleges across the state, two months ahead of the state assembly polls.Disclosing this, education, finance and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the appointment letters will be given to teachers at a function on Friday.“In 2012-13, nearly 25,000 teachers were appointed in one go. The fresh appointments would be the highest number of people appointed at a time,” Sarma told media persons while addressing a press conference.Of the new appointments, 16,484 would be teachers and non-teaching staff in schools, junior colleges and colleges, whose services would be provincialised, meaning the state government would start paying them salaries and other benefits.Besides the teachers whose services would get provincialised, another 13,217 new teachers would be appointed in government schools across the state.“This process would continue and towards the end of this month, another 5,000 teachers could get appointed if formalities regarding their appointments are sorted out,” said Sarma.The minister informed that since coming to power in 2016, the BJP-led government has appointed nearly 36,000 teachers in the state. Sarma said another 43,000 new teachers could be appointed next year after implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP).Sarma said that on Saturday, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharama would be present at a ceremony to transfer ₹3,000 each to bank accounts of nearly 800,000 tea garden workers in the state.The state government had earlier transferred sums of ₹2,500 twice to these accounts in the past two years since demonetization.Sarma informed that on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be present in the state-- 2nd time in a fortnight-- to flag off construction of two new medical colleges and also to inaugurate Asom Mala—the scheme to improve state highways and major district roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-assembly-polls-assam-to-appoint-29-700-teachers-on-friday-101612336423430.html
03-02-2021||India||Indian companies targeted by everyone in the world, says Bharat Biotech chairman||A year ago, Krishna Ella was simply known for running a small Indian pharmaceutical company with a reputation for scientific rigor. Then came the pandemic that put the scientist and his family at the center of one of the world’s loudest furors over a coronavirus vaccine.In June last year, India’s drug regulator permitted Ella’s firm -- Bharat Biotech International Ltd. -- to develop a homegrown vaccine in record time. Since then the company has been buffeted by controversies ranging from unrealistic government schedules to sporadic reports of adverse reactions. Matters came to a head last month after the government approved its shot before the completion of final human trials.That fueled a revolt across the breadth of India with many at the frontlines of the pandemic -- particularly health-care workers -- refusing the company’s injection. Two weeks in, India’s national vaccine rollout has fallen flat with little over half the targeted number of people coming forward for shots -- hesitation that’s largely being blamed on the hasty approval of Bharat Biotech’s shot, which is still deep in Phase III trials.From the US to the Norway, vociferous debates over the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 vaccines have beset pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc and governments the world over are battling anti-vaccine sentiment. Yet, experts say India never registered significant resistance to inoculations until now. The stakes are particularly high because the South Asian country is racing to inoculate 1.3 billion people across villages and crowded slums while grappling with the world’s second highest number of infections.“There are many unanswered questions because of the total opaqueness and lack of accountability,” said Dinesh Thakur, a former pharmaceutical executive known for exposing fraud at the Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. “One thing is abundantly clear: They have successfully now created a significant anti-vaccine movement in India.”The use of the Bharat Biotech shot -- called Covaxin -- has drawn particular ire because Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has distributed it alongside AstraZeneca’s inoculation, which completed final tests. Luck of the draw and location determine which shot India’s frontline workers get, leaving many fearful they could end up taking an injection yet to be fully vetted.“They have compelled them to take Covaxin,” said Dayanand Sagar, the Bengaluru-based president of a resident doctors’ body that represents 5,000 medical workers across the state of Karnataka. “Health workers should be given a choice.” Both New Delhi and Bharat Biotech have vigorously defended the vaccine’s safety, with health officials taking Covaxin injections on camera. In a December interview, Suchitra Ella, the company’s co-founder and Krishna’s wife, said they have acted “within the law of the land.” A spokesperson for Bharat Biotech and Indian government officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.Many believe the speed of its vaccine has been driven by nationalistic political forces pushing for a “swadeshi” -- or locally made -- shot, along with the firm’s own ambitions to be a frontrunner.“Both things are aligning here, government pressure and the company’s internal competitive drive,” said Prashant Yadav, a healthcare supply-chain expert at the Center for Global Development in Washington.In a January press conference, Krishna Ella, the 65-year-old chairman, angrily argued the criticism had become “political” and used a 41-page slide-show with early and mid-stage data to prove his vaccine is safe and effective.His bigger rival, Serum Institute of India Ltd., is churning out a billion doses of AstraZeneca’s shot, and Ella bristled with indignation at the idea that a U.K.-sponsored vaccine wasn’t being questioned as deeply.“Indian companies are targeted by everyone in the world,” said Ella, who has a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “It hurts us as scientists -- we don’t deserve that type of bashing.”Last year, as rich nations showed signs of snapping up scarce supplies of leading vaccine candidates, India sought its own local champion. Besides Serum, only a handful of domestic manufacturers have the capacity to pump out hundreds of millions of doses, making Bharat Biotech an obvious choice as others tied up with foreign developers.The company has supplied the Indian government and the World Health Organization with billions of life-saving vaccines for diseases ranging from polio to rotavirus and typhoid -- its three main revenue earners. Bharat Biotech threw itself into work on Covaxin, a two-dose shot based on well-trodden technology that uses part of a dead virus.The Ella’s son Raches -- a US-trained scientist -- was given responsibility for early trials. During an expert seminar at the end of October the younger Ella said he didn’t condone emergency licenses to push out inoculations before final trials were complete. “I don’t believe in that personally and even Bharat Biotech doesn’t believe in that either.”So the company raised eyebrows when it filed Covaxin for Indian emergency authorization in December without completing enrollment for Phase III trials joining the first set of applicants, including AstraZeneca and Pfizer, which both of which already had preliminary final-stage efficacy data.Minutes from January meetings showed that India’s drug regulatory agency at first insisted on seeing efficacy data for Covaxin, before relenting and approving it for a vaguely defined restricted use in “clinical trial mode.” While it’s unclear who or what caused regulators to relent, the chain of events flummoxed scientists. It also jarred with the account of a company that had always played by the book previously, according to Bloomberg’s interviews with more than a dozen investors, ex-employees and industry experts.“In all that they have done so far they’ve always gone by following protocols, building the right partnerships, having the right kind of science available to them,” said Gagandeep Kang, a professor at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, who worked on clinical trials for Bharat Biotech’s rotavirus vaccine, which was hailed by Modi in 2015 as a prime example of Indian innovation. “I really don’t understand what the need was to jump the gun for this vaccine.”It wasn’t the first controversy around the shot. India’s medical research body promised Covaxin would be ready by August 15 last year: The anniversary of national independence from British colonial rule. Suchitra told Bloomberg that was a communication “slip.”Then reports emerged of some adverse reactions. Residents in the town of Bhopal -- one of the trial sites -- said they took the injections in return for 750 rupees ($10) and that some couldn’t read consent forms because they were illiterate. One participant also died on Dec. 21, nine days after a Covaxin shot.In a statement last month, Bharat Biotech said the death was due to cardiac arrest from suspected poisoning, which is under police investigation. Initial reviews suggest the death wasn’t related to the shot, the company said, adding that the payments were in line with Indian trial reimbursement rules and that nobody was induced.The vaccine’s advocates have pointed to a peer-reviewed study published in The Lancet medical journal in January that said Covaxin’s first human test covering 375 people showed “tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses.”Many remain to be convinced.

Slamming the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) IT cell for allegedly spinning a narrative that discredits the agitation, an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana said CCTV footage also showed that the tricolour was left untouched when farmers stormed Red Fort on Republic Day. It went on to point out that if security arrangements at the border were anything like the ones made in the national Capital to prevent agitating farmers from entering Delhi, the Chinese army would not have entered Ladakh. Also Read | Farmers agitation at Delhi borders causing inconvenience to residents: CentreOn Sunday, Prime Minister Modi had referred to the events at Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day and said, “India was saddened by the insult of the tricolour on Republic Day.” Mocking the elaborate arrangements made, including police barricades, concrete blocks and barbed wires at the Delhi borders to stop farmers from entering again, Saamana said, “Sir, the Chinese army sitting in our territory is an insult of the tricolour...Chinese troops have entered our land and put up their red flags, how is that tolerated?”The Sena has become vocal on farmers’ protest against the three laws. Sena delegation of MPs led by Sanjay Raut met Rajesh Tikait, the farm leader, at Ghazipur border on Tuesday. Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray also attacked the Centre by saying that the barricades and barbed wires at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border seemed like security against enemies on an International Border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-incursion-insult-to-tricolour-not-farmers-protest-sena-slams-pm-101612335650443.html

We also read the statement of the Prime Minister in the press that law will take its own course. We are confident that law will take its own course. We don't want to interfere in this case."The court allowed the petitioners to withdraw their petitions.One of the petitions had sought the setting up of a three-member commission headed by a retired Supreme Court judge to launch an inquiry into the January 26 violence.The plea was filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari who also sought direction to the concerned authority to register FIRs against people or organisations that were responsible for orchestrating the violence and causing dishonour to the national flag on that day.Also Read| Govt should restore statehood in J&K, repeal farm laws: Ghulam Nabi AzadAnother plea was presented before the Supreme Court filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, which sought direction to the concerned authority as well as the media to not declare the protesting farmers as “terrorists” without presenting any evidence. Sharma had said in his plea that there was a planned conspiracy to sabotage the agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws and the protesters were allegedly being declared as terrorists without any proof.The tractor rally, which was supposed to be taken out peacefully during the Republic Day celebrations turned violent after the farmers deviated from the planned routes, broke barriers, clashed with security personnel and went on to hoist a religious flag at the iconic Red Fort.Also Watch| ‘There will be a nationwide tractor rally if…’: Rakesh Tikait warns Centre﻿﻿The Delhi Police had said on Monday that they have registered 44 FIRs and made 122 arrests in connection with the violence.

03-02-2021||India||Govt should restore statehood in J&K, repeal farm laws: Ghulam Nabi Azad||Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha and Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday said the government should bring a bill to restore statehood in Jammu and Kashmir and repeal the farm laws that a section of farmers are agitating against. Speaking during the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President’s address, Azad said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only person who can find a solution to both the problems—Jammu and Kashmir and the farmers’ agitation. “The Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan slogan is as relevant today as it was then. Without these two sections of our society we are incomplete,” he said. He went on to pay tributes to the soldiers who live in treacherous weather conditions to serve the nation and said, “I also pay tribute to those farmers who lost their lives in the last few months demanding their rights.” “The logjam between the farmers and the government is not for the first time; it has been going on for hundreds of year... Farmers have had to struggle for their rights sometimes against feudalism and zamindari system and sometimes against the government,” Azad said. Also Read | Parliament proceedings halted amid protest over farm laws: All you need to knowHe referred to the agitations that took place in pre-Independent India when the farmers’ took on the British government, forcing it to recall laws. “I have been reading about farmers’ protests during British rule. The result was the government had to bend and I have reached the conclusion that the might of the farmers is the biggest force in the country. And we cannot reach any conclusion by fighting with them,” Azad said. Apart from the Champaran movement and various other movement for land rights, Azad also referred to the 1988 rally when Mahender Singh Tikait laid seize to the Boat Club forcing the Congress that was then in power at the Centre to move its rally from Boat Club to Red Fort. “I was sitting with the then Prime Minister (Rajiv Gandhi) and the government people came and said let’s remove them (farmers). We said we cannot fight with farmers we will change the venue. We went to the Red Fort instead and did not announce it. Two days later the agitation was withdrawn,” he said. Pointing out that the government cannot open a front against its own people, Azad said the country should be united in fighting against its enemies. While condemning the January 26 incident when a section of farmers raised a religious flag at the Red Fort, Azad said, “The whole Opposition and the Congress party condemned the incident that happened at Red Fort... it should have never happened; it is against democracy; it is against law and order. We cannot support such incidents and those who were involved in this should be given strict punishment; but at the same time those who are innocent should not be implicated.” He urged the Prime Minister to set up a committee to find people who went missing on January 26. “The efforts made to implicate them should not be made because then it will lead to another agitation. A man who has been a minister of state for foreign affairs has been charged with sedition along with a few journalists; if he is anti-national then we are all anti-national,” he said in reference to the sedition cases filed against Shashi Tharoor and some journalists. Urging the Prime Minister to bring a bill to restore statehood in J&K, Azad said he fails to understand the rationale for bifurcating the state into union territories. “I have heard Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s speeches, the then home minister’s and several BJP MPs, but I have never heard them demand that the state should be bifurcated. I can understand and I support a UT status for Leh. The government could have done that, but the state should be left untouched,” he said. While the government has been claiming that the law and order has improved and terror activities in the Valley have come down, the Congress leader said it was a wrong claim. “Law and order in the in the state was much better before, militancy was at its lowest and developmental works were very good when there was a state government, no matter which government was in power,” he said. He, however, congratulated the government for conducting the DDC elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-should-restore-statehood-in-j-k-repeal-farm-laws-ghulam-nabi-azad-101612335170520.html

03-02-2021||India||Sariska tigers’ preference for cattle over wild prey poses danger to big cats||A recently published research has concluded that the tigers in Rajasthan’s Sariska wildlife sanctuary preferred to hunt cattle over wild animals as their prey. The state officials have termed it a worrying development which could threaten the big cat population in the reserve.The worrying findings were the result of a scientific study to analyze the dietary patterns of tigers and leopards, reintroduced into the wild at the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), conducted jointly by Govind Sagar Bhardwaj-- former field director of STR and the member secretary of the pollution board-- and Hemant Shekhawat, former deputy field director of STR.The study, conducted between 2016 and 2018 and published recently, highlighted some alarming facts including very high anthropogenic pressure in the reserve, leading to drastic dietary changes among the big cats, when compared to previous such studies.Among the reported tiger kills, 77% were livestock, especially buffaloes, which is a manifold increase over 10.4% a decade ago and 19.4% in 2012. This has led to an increasing number of human-wildlife conflicts, which induced further resentment among the local communities, further denting both law and order and conservation efforts in Sariska. The diet of Leopards also consisted of an alarming proportion of 84.2% livestock prey as compared to 7.1% in 2012.As per the survey, a meagre 548 sq km of actual inviolate area is available for tigers out of the total 1213 sq km area of STR due to immense anthropogenic pressure. Around 175 villages are located in and around STR, out of which 26 are lying within the critical tiger habitat.The human population residing in the villages inside the reserve is over 1700 and the livestock population is more than 10 thousand, mainly buffaloes and goats. Apart from this, there is a large human and cattle population in villages around STR. Villagers often take their livestock to graze and drink water well within the reserve.Leopards, on the other hand, being smaller in size prefer smaller prey, and their natural primary diet is Cheetals. When tigers were poached out of STR around 2005, leopards occupied the core areas within the reserve but after the tigers were reintroduced and their population flourished, leopards were pushed to the peripheral areas of the reserve.The change in the dwelling areas resulted in them preying on smaller livestock like goats and buffalo fawns, available in the peripheral villages. Their diet included an overwhelming 84.2% livestock as compared to 7.1% in 2012, as per the study.Sariska had lost all its Tigers to poaching in 2004-05. Tigers were brought to the STR from Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in world's first Tiger reintroduction program in 2008. However, owing to high anthropogenic pressure, the tiger population at Sariska did not flourish till 2012. Currently, Sariska is home to 22 tigers including 11 adults, 5 sub adults and 6 cubs.Attacks from tigers and leopards are often met with violent retaliation by the village folks. Killing of their livestock results in serious outrage and unrest among local communities, which induces human attacks against the big cats.The first ever reintroduced Tiger, the male ST-1, was poisoned by the villagers, in 2010. In 2018, tigress ST-5 went missing and a young male ST-11 got strangled in a wire snare.Also Read: Rajasthan IPS officer Manish Agarwal linked to extortion racket, arrestedLately, retaliatory killings have become an even bigger threat than poaching to the already sparse tiger population in the reserve. In 2017-18, seven people were killed by leopards in the nearby villages and an angry mob not only manhandled the staffers of the STR but also burnt a leopard alive at Madhavgarh area near Sariska.A leopard was found dead as recently as last week in Tehla range and unconfirmed reports suggested that it was poisoned from a goat carcass. Village relocation and effective law enforcement in STR are the only viable solutions which can prevent the depletion of the big cat population in the reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sariska-tigers-preference-for-cattle-over-wild-prey-poses-danger-to-big-cats-101612333540944.html

The chairman also adjourned Rajya Sabha proceedings briefly."We expressed our dissent in the house, we want repeal of three farm laws because talks won't help," Singh said after the suspension, according to news agency ANI.This happened as the government and opposition members reached a consensus to discuss farm laws stir in Parliament. According to the arrangement agreed upon, the opposition parties will be allowed to raise questions regarding three farm legislation and the farmer protests at Delhi borders from Thursday. The discussion on the motion of thanks to President's address will last for 15 hours and Question Hour suspended to make time for it.Follow latest updates on farmers click hereThousands of protesters are agitating against the three farm legislation enacted by Parliament in September last year. The central government has projected the laws as "historic reforms" in the agriculture sector that will work in favour of farmers by removing middlemen and giving them the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, farmers fear that it will put them at the mercy of the big corporates and will remove the Minimum Support Price (MSP).The agitation is continuing for more than two months now and has been supported by various opposition parties including Aam Aadmi Party.Last month, AAP leader Raghav Chadha asked Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to deploy police personnel from his state on camps around the borders of Delhi where the farmers are protesting. "The Punjab Police must provide protection to our farmers brothers and sisters so no harm is done to them and they can continue to protest against the black laws in a peaceful manner," wrote Chadha in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-stir-three-aap-members-suspended-from-parliament-for-sloganeering-101612333432239.html

The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force in three years, with the rest being supplied by 2030. The deal involves the supply of 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft.“I am very happy that HAL has got the orders for development of 83 new indigenous LCA Tejas Mk-1A...it is probably the biggest Make in India defence contract till date,” said defence minister Rajnath Singh while inaugurating Aero India-2021. The show is being held at the Yelahanka airbase from February 3 to 5. At least 600 exhibitors are taking part in the biennial show, including 78 foreign exhibitors.India’s Cabinet Committee on Security, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on January 13 approved the proposal to buy the advanced Tejas jets to bolster IAF’s combat potential.Also Read | ‘India offers unlimited potential in defence’: PM Modi as Aero India kickstartsOn Tuesday, defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated HAL’s second LCA plant in the city to increase the yearly production rate of the fighter jet from eight to 16.“Our vision is to make India one of the biggest countries of the world in defence sector, from design to production, with active participation of public and private sector,” Singh said.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far..“HAL now has to perform since the stakes involved are very high -- IAF’s potency is dependent on it. HAL’s work culture and ethos have to turn a new leaf to ensure that aircraft production timelines are met in letter and spirit. Rigid adherence to quality in production and timely provisioning of spares would define successful contract implementation,” Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies, said on Tuesday.The Mk-1A variant will come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability. The fighter’s indigenous content is expected to be 60%, compared to 50% in the existing variants.“I believe Aero India 2021 will boost investment, expand manufacturing ecosystem and enhance the technology levels and propel the economic growth for the country,” the minister said.Singh said on Tuesday that the LCA Mk-1A was better than its foreign equivalents on several parameters and also cheaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hal-awarded-48-000-cr-contract-for-83-advanced-tejas-fighters-101612330249926.html
03-02-2021||India||Kerala HC quashes government order to pay employees missing on strike days||The Kerala high court on Tuesday quashed the state government order that approved payment of salaries to the government employees for the two days, when they participated in a nation-wide strike against the Central government in January 2019.A lawyer had challenged the state government’s move to sanction salaries or leaves for many employees, who participated in the two-day strike on January 8 and January 9 in 2019. “There is clear prohibition under the law to call for and participate in strikes and therefore, the action of the government regularising an illegal act cannot be sustained in law,” the HC bench headed by chief justice S Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly ruled, while hearing a public interest litigation filed by lawyer B Balagoplan.The court also rejected the contention that leave could be granted to employees who had not attended their duty on these two days. It also directed the heads of department and the chief secretary to check attendance register and take action within two months. With the verdict, employees who availed leave or payment on these days will have to return their two days’ salaries.A nationwide two-day strike was called by trade unions in January 2019 to protest against the economic policies of the Union government and it turned into a forced shutdown in Communist-ruled Kerala. Later, the government issued an order granting permission to convert these two days into leave to avoid loss of pay. This was challenged in the high court.“We do not think the government is at liberty to take any policy decision in absolute violation of the rules. Even if it is a policy decision, the court can look into the legality, correctness or arbitrariness by exercising the power under Article 226 of the Constitution, if such a policy is against the statutory provisions,” the court ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-quashes-government-order-to-pay-employees-missing-on-strike-days-101612329866723.html

A team of archaeologists has visited Telhara to review the status of the site and to chalk out the excavation plan. The digging was likely to begin in the next few days, the officials said.The remains of the university have remained buried under a 35-feet high mound at Telhara village, which is located in Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s constituency. The state archaeology department started excavations there in 2009 but they were stopped five years later.The digging earlier led to the remains of the ancient university and over half-a-dozen terracotta sealing, similar to the sealing found at ancient Nalanda University. One terracotta sealing has a Chakra flanked by two deer and carried the inscription, Sri Prathamshivpur Mahavihariyaye Bhikshu Sangha in Pali language, which is believed to be the original name of the university.Also Read | Ram Setu exploration given nod by ASI, govt tells Parliament“Things have been cleared now and the ASI has allowed resumption of digging at Telhara. We will start the work in the next few days,” said Animesh Parashar, director, state archaeology department.The department also plans a site museum near the excavation site.CP Sinha, a former director of the KP Jayaswal Research Institute (Patna Museum), said the digging will unfold a new chapter in Bihar and India’s history. “It has remained a major site for the historians and archaeologists. Even Hiuen Tsang, the Chinese traveller visited Telhara and has given detailed descriptions in his travel account of the Viharas, the university, and of the buildings and their architectural designs located there,” he said.Atul Kumar, a former state archaeology director who earlier led Telhara excavations, said Hiuen Tsang called Telhara a seat of learning, where the monks studied the Mahayan Buddhism along with other subjects. “Importantly the sealing found there and the size and shape of the bricks used in the structure indicate that it was set up in 1st Century AD while the Nalanda University was set up in 4th Century AD and Vikramshila University was set up in 7th Century AD,” he said. Kumar added the structure is believed to have been destroyed in the 12th Century and a layer of ashes was discovered over the remains during the digging conducted earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/excavation-at-ancient-buddhist-university-site-in-bihar-s-telhara-set-to-resume-101612327729438.html

People of the Valley are doing great," she said.Despite the odd timings required by the job and a dynamic work environment, the 25-year-old said that she was happy to take on the challenge."I chose this field because I have loved traveling since a very young age and was very fascinated by flying. One gets to meet so many people. This is why I wanted to be a pilot. It is quite challenging because this is not like a normal 9-5 desk job.

03-02-2021||India||SC notice on petition to transfer cases from HCs||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice on a petition seeking transfer of pleas from Delhi high court and Rajasthan high court which have sought 21 years as uniform marriageable age for both men and women.The notice was issued based on a petition filed by lawyer and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay who claimed that the present legal framework allowing girls and boys to marry at the age of 18 and 21, respectively, aggravates the gender inequality that exists within a marital relationship.Also read: Centre tells SC that states will file regular reports on polluting vehicles“While men are permitted to get married at the age of 21, women are married when they are just 18. The distinction is based on patriarchal stereotypes, has no scientific backing, perpetrates de jure and de facto inequality against women, and goes completely against the global trends,” the petition stated.Upadhyay had earlier raised the issue before the Delhi high court in August 2019. He later came across a similar petition filed by one Abdul Mannan which is being considered by the Rajasthan high court.Both petitions stated that the different age for marriage violated fundamental rights of equality (Article 14), protection against discrimination (Article 15), and dignity of life (Article 21) of citizens and went against India’s commitment under the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Under Article 139A, the Supreme Court has the power to transfer to itself cases involving the same or substantially the same questions of law, and pending before two or more high courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-on-petition-to-transfer-cases-fromhcs-101612318991951.html

On Monday, its cabinet decided to run the facility as a fully- owned operation of state-run Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA).Also read: Centre defends police use of tear gas on protestersDuring a meeting with labour unions, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said he had already announced that the ECT “will not be handed over to any foreign country or institution”.Following this assurance, the unions agreed to suspend a protest that was to begin on Tuesday. As a compromise, the Sri Lankan government will allow the development of the West Container Terminal (WCT) by India and its partners.Reacting to the developments, a spokesperson for the Indian High Commission called for the “expeditious implementation” of the trilateral agreement of 2019. The spokesperson pointed to a decision by Sri Lanka’s cabinet three months ago to implement the project with foreign investors.“All sides should continue to abide by the existing understandings and commitment,” the commission said in a statement.The spokesperson added: “I would like to reiterate the expectation of government of India for expeditious implementation of the trilateral Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) signed in May 2019 among the governments of India, Japan and Sri Lanka for the development of ECT with participation from these three countries.Sri Lanka’s industries minister Wimal Weerawansa said the ten parties in the ruling coalition that are against handing over the ECT to an Indian investor would not oppose the development of the WCT by foreign firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-lanka-opts-out-of-port-deal-with-india-101612313770333.html

The Oxford Hindi word of the year is a word or expression that is chosen to reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year, and have lasting potential as a term of cultural significance.In a statement, Oxford Languages said in the early months of the pandemic when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s Covid-19 recovery package, he emphasised the need to become self-reliant as a country, in a bid to navigate the perils of the pandemic.There was a massive increase in the usage of ‘aatmanirbharta’ highlighting its increased prominence as a phrase and concept in the public lexicon, it said.“In an unprecedented year, ‘aatmanirbharta’ found resonance with a wide cross-section of people as it is seen to be an answer to the revival of a Covid-impacted economy,” said Oxford University Press India managing director Sivaramarkrishnan Venkateswaran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxford-names-aatmanirbharta-as-hindi-word-of-the-year-for-2020-101612305401914.html
03-02-2021||India||CBSE sets ball rolling with exams schedule||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the schedule for final examinations of classes 10 and 12 on Tuesday, three months before the commencement of theory papers on May 4, taking a step towards normalcy that could leave a key imprint on this year’s academic session in the shadow of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to the CBSE date sheet, Class 10 board exams will end on June 7 and Class 12 board exams on June 11. The board said authorities will have to follow guidelines against Covid-19 such as wearing masks, following physical distancing and using sanitisers.Officials at the Council for the Indian School Certificate (CISC), another national-level board, said they too were working on board exam schedules. While some state boards have already announced the dates, others are in the process of finalising the modalities. The commencement of board exams, especially CBSE — the biggest national board — would have a bearing on college admission dates and, in turn, the entire academic session that was upended by the pandemic last year, experts said.“The practical priority for schools is to deliver exams. This is the first thing they will try to deliver in order to move towards normalcy. For regular learning, the schools might continue hybrid learning (online and offline) for some more months. It all depends on the Covid-19 positivity rate at that exact time,” educationist Meeta Sengupta said.The CBSE schedule detailed that while most of the Class 12 exams will be held in the morning shift (10.30am-12.30/ 1.30pm), some of them have been slated for the afternoon shift (2.30pm- 4.30/5.30pm) with an aim to reduce the total exam days in view of the pandemic. To be sure, this does not mean that Class 12 students will have to write two papers a day. The four days (May 6, 15, 21, and 27) when they will write their papers in the afternoon, only Class 10 exams will be held in the morning.Also read: Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districts“Class 12 examinations will be conducted in two shifts to reduce the number of days of conducting examinations,” Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE controller of examinations, said. Bhardwaj added that exams for subjects not offered by schools abroad will be conducted in the afternoon shift on the four specified days.Classes 10 and 12 theory examinations (for all streams) will be completed in 39 days, as compared with the 45 days planned in 2020. However, 12 papers of Class 12 were eventually cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak, which also impacted college admissions that were pushed back by at least three months.Authorities also announced that around 340,000 students will take the Class 10 and Class 12 board exams this year. While the Class 10 exams involve a total of 75 subjects, including optionals, Class 12 exams involve 111 subjects across science commerce and arts streams. Practical tests will begin on March 1, as announced in December.Usually, the practicals are conducted in January while written exams begin in February and conclude in March.Officials at the Delhi University (DU) said the college admission process may again get delayed, but the situation would be better compared to the last year. The admission process was delayed by around three months (from July to October) due to the pandemic, said Suman Kumar, a member of the DU admission committee last year. “According to the CBSE schedule (this year), the results are likely to be announced by July 15. However, our academic session normally begins in mid-July. It means the admission process will again get delayed this year.”On Tuesday, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ announced the CBSE exam schedule and wished students luck. “When the entire world was fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, students showed everyone that they were capable of taking care of both their health and future. Now that the vaccines are here, we don’t need to be afraid and just take the necessary precaution,” he said in a video address. He added that adequate intervals had been given between two important papers. The board has already announced that its 2021 exams will be conducted in written mode, and not online. Owing to the disruptions due to Covid-19, the board has also reduced its syllabus for classes 9-12 for the 2020-2021 academic session by up to 30% as a “one-time measure”.Schools were closed across the country in March-end, and then a 68-day nationwide hard lockdown followed prohibiting all businesses and activities, excluding essential services. Though the Centre allowed states to take a call on the graded reopening of educational institutes after October 15, many of them took a wait and watch approach before allowing students to return to their classrooms. Meanwhile, schools conducted online classes.Also read: CBSE class 12 date sheet 2021 released, here's direct linkJyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Delhi’s Rohini, welcomed the move to announce the schedule three months in advance and said it will help students. “Schools will be following Covid-19 protocols such as physical distancing, masks and sanitisation. CBSE has prepared the date sheet in a meticulous way and even reduced the number of days of the examination.”Darshan Ram, a Class 12 student at Bluebells School International in Delhi, agreed. “Adequate time has been given... between two examinations. There won’t be any issue since we still have three months left for the exams,” he said.Some state boards such as those in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh have already announced their board exam dates, while states such as Rajasthan are likely to make public their schedule soon. Class 12 board exams in Bihar have commenced and will conclude on February 13. The Tamil Nadu government is holding consultations to decide on the dates for state board exams. Karnataka has announced a tentative time table Class 10 exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-sets-ball-rolling-with-exams-schedule-101612301563410.html
03-02-2021||India||House stalled as Opposition parties demands farm debate||Several opposition parties protesting the farm bills brought Parliament proceedings to a halt on Tuesday by pushing suspension of business motions in the Rajya Sabha and adjournment motions in the Lok Sabha to demand a separate debate on the farm protests before the customary discussion on the President’s speech during the Budget Session.The parties forced repeated suspension of proceedings in both Houses, trooped into the Well, raised slogans and flashed placards, walked out, and continued protests whenever they returned — mirroring scenes of agitation that have played out across northern India and Delhi over the past two months.Rajya Sabha was adjourned three times before it was adjourned for the day, and Lok Sabha three times before it was adjourned just minutes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Locket Chatterjee initiated the debate on the motion of thanks to the President.There is some hint that normal proceedings may resume on Wednesday since a section of the Opposition feels that it provides opportunity for them to nail the government on the farm issue, as it featured extensively in the January 29 speech by President Ram Nath Kovind.Also read: Over 50% exposure to Sars-Cov-2 in 10 of 11 city districtsCongress floor leader in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, said, “We have some issues that we will discuss with Speaker Om Birla. But we want the debate to take place.”Even if there’s a debate, the farm issue is set to dominate the Opposition agenda. The Opposition wants a separate debate on the farm issue but government managers want it covered under the discussion on the President’s speech. As things stand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to reply on the debate in Lok Sabha on Friday and Rajya Sabha on Monday.A few opposition parties may move notices under Rule 267 in the Rajya Sabha, and adjournment motions in the Lower House, to set aside scheduled business and discuss the farm issue.The agitation against the three farm bills started soon after they were passed by Parliament in September. The farmers think the laws will put them at the mercy of corporate firms and gut government-backed support systems. The Centre has assured farmers that the minimum support price regime will not be touched and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but the protesters are pushing for a repeal of the laws.The protests took a violent turn on Republic Day, when agitators broke through barricades on tractors, ran riot on Delhi’s streets and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Sikh flag from its ramparts. Since then, protest sites on the outskirts of the Capital have turned into fortresses, with police digging trenches, putting up barbed wire fences, concrete barricades and hammering beds of nails on roads.On Tuesday, farm leader Rakesh Tikait, whose emotional appeal for support last week inspired thousands of farmers from western Uttar Pradesh to join the stir, told agitators to be ready to continue the stir until November. “‘Kanoon wapsi nahi to ghar wapsi nahi (no returning home until the laws are repealed),” he added.Some opposition parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the Left, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), which met on Tuesday morning to strategise, also objected allotment of 10 hours for the entire debate on the President’s speech, and argued that since the PM speaks for about an hour, he should get a separate slot.The Opposition parties will again meet on Wednesday morning to review and renew their strategy.Throughout the day, Lok Sabha Speaker Birla spoke to leaders across parties to run the House but the Opposition remained adamant. There was no formal meeting between Naidu and opposition leaders, according to his officials, but back-channel negotiations are likely to start in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.Protests erupted in the Rajya Sabha at 9.25am after Naidu rejected the Opposition’s notice and said, “As we are going to discuss the President’s address tomorrow as the first item, members can avail themselves of this opportunity and then participate and express their viewpoints. That is why I am not able to accept the notice given to suspend the Business of the House.”The opposition members from the TMC, Left, Congress and the DMK, who had given suspension notices, raised slogans and trooped into the Well of the House. But Naidu did not relent, and some Opposition MPs walked out as soon as the question hour began.When they reassembled after some later, the protests grew louder, forcing Naidu to adjourn the House for about 40 minutes. As soon as it resumed, opposition members continued to raise slogans, forcing a second adjournment till 11.30am. The House was finally adjourned for the whole day a third time when opposition MPs did not heed deputy chairperson Harivansh’s appeals to allow the House to take up bills listed for the day.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said, “The Opposition can raise any issue during the debate on President speech. And the government will also give a reply to all their questions.” RJD’s Manoj Jha and Communist Party of India’s Binoy Viswam demanded a discussion while BSP’s Satish Misra said that this was an issue that every parliamentarian wanted to discuss so that a solution could come out.In the Lok Sabha, right from the start, the Opposition pushed for an adjournment motion. Question hour, which had a query on minimum support prices — one of the key bones of contention between the government and the farm unions — could not continue after a brief start as the House got adjourned.The House met after an hour but protests followed. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that had the Opposition allowed the question hour, their issue would have been resolved. Birla tried to convince the protesting MPs and said he will allow everyone to speak if they return to their seats but no one was in a mood to comply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-stalled-as-opposition-parties-demands-farm-debate-101612300800173.html

The government will work out the framework that may take six months or even a year... no new cities have come up for many years, the Finance Commission has granted ₹8,000 crore to incubate new cities," said Durga Shankar Mishra, housing ministry secretary.Mishra said that a census town is an area with a population of more than 5,000 and a population density of over 400 per square kilometres, and wherein more than 75 per cent of the male population is engaged in non-agriculture work.Census towns may be considered for the new project. However, there is no clarity yet as the project is in its initial stage, a source said."The country needs new cities... unless we get planned cities, there would then be outgrowth," he said. While the framework for developing the new cities will be worked out later, Mishra pointed out that there are such areas that exist just outside the jurisdiction of a city administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-to-develop-8-new-cities-to-meet-urbanisation-demand-101612290668029.html

Where is that money? After collecting donations for Ram Temple in the daytime, the BJP leaders use that money to pay for alcohol in the evening,” veteran Congress MLA Kantilal Bhuria told reporters in Petlawad, Jhabua.He had earlier made similar allegations at a rally.He went on to say that he had only repeated what people were already saying.The BJP government hit back with home minister Narottam Mishra saying Bhuria’s statement was a reflection of his devilish mindset. “He didn’t say anything new. He is saying what his mentor taught him,” Mishra said.But Bhuria found support in Congress MLA PC Sharma who said, “Bhuria spoke about the reality. BJP leaders should deposit the fund directly into the account of Ram Janambhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust but they are collecting cash and misusing the fund.”“The fake collection drive was exposed on Tuesday evening after a man was booked for such a fraud in Bhopal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-buy-alcohol-with-ram-temple-funds-says-congress-mla-in-mp-101612290645198.html
03-02-2021||India||Fix timeline for call on pleas by life convicts: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed all states and Union territories to fix a timeline to decide on requests for early release by life convicts, noting with regret that a total of 1,649 such applications were pending across 21 states.Contemplating a uniform policy across the country, the top court said that there must be a regime in place to ensure that convicts undergoing a life term are apprised of their legal right to seek remission after completing 14 years behind bars.According to the law, people sentenced to life imprisonment are supposed to be inside the prison until they die. However, the law entitles the state government and jail authorities to consider the early release of convicts if they are is found to have good conduct throughout a minimum jail term of 14 years.On Monday, the Supreme Court bench of justices Sanjay K Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy noted that the best practice would be to ensure that jail superintendents send applications for early release within a month of the convicts completing 14 years in jail, and the state’s home department then takes a decision within three months.Legal aid to those who are unable to pay for lawyers cannot be a mere formality, but must always be about providing proper assistance, the bench underlined, while noting that some legal aid lawyers indiscriminately filed appeals in the life term cases without even considering if the convicts had filed requests for early release after completing 14 years in prison.Also read: Centre says states will file regular reports on polluting vehiclesThe bench was hearing a petition by a murder convict who filed an appeal in the apex court after he spent more than 14 years in a Chhattisgarh jail. Appointed as amicus curiae to assist the court, advocate Liz Mathew pointed out that although the Chhattisgarh government has a rule to enable filing of applications for early release, it took almost four years for the prison authorities and the home department to take a decision in this case and order the release.Appearing for the National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa), advocate Gaurav Agrawal presented a chart that showed 1,649 applications of convicts seeking premature release pending across 21 states, 431 prisoners not having moved such pleas despite spending 14 years in jail.The court, in light of this, said that it intended to put in place a uniform mechanism with respect to processing of applications for early release after ensuring proper legal assistance to the life term convicts.“It is a valuable right under the law. And we think if the law provides for it, the convicts should be made aware of their right. Legal aid cannot just be a mere formality which is to get over by filing appeals,” remarked the bench as it asked all the states to respond on fixing a timeline for remission decisions.The court asked Nalsa to circulate the copy of its order to all states and union territories and fixed the matter for hearing next on March 1.The bench has considered at least 10 cases where convicts either completed 14 years in jail or were nearing the 14-year mark. But there was no information on whether the convicts had been given any legal assistance to file their pleas for early release.In one of these cases that the court heard last week, it issued a notice to the Supreme Court Legal Services Cell, asking it to look into such cases and to ensure the provision of proper legal assistance to the convicts.Senior Advocate and former Additional Solicitor General KV Viswanathan told HT: “This is a salutary order, having Article 21 (right to life and dignity) overtone. This order will go a long way in bringing uniformity in jail rules and ensuring speedy decisions in such cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fix-timeline-for-call-on-pleas-by-life-convicts-sc-101612289984757.html
03-02-2021||India||Farm leaders tell protesters to ensure peace during Feb 6 ‘chakka jam’||Farmers leaders on Tuesday appealed to the protesters to maintain peace during the Feburary 6 nationwide ‘chakka jam’ announced on Monday against the three farm laws. This comes a week after violence during the tractor parade by farmers on Republic Day.Protesters and security volunteers have also been asked to keep a “tight vigil” to ensure that anti-social elements do not become part of the agitation on February 6 and “disrupt” the movement.Karan Singh Brar, a farmer leader and a member of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, said, “We will have to successfully execute the call of ‘chakka jam’ on February 6 between 12-3 pm and it will only be successful if we do it peacefully. We will have to ensure that emergency vehicles such as ambulance or fire tenders should be given way during the agitation and that there is no non-violence,” he said at Tikri border.Also read: Rakesh Tikait coins new slogan at Ghazipur protest siteAnother farm leader, Chaudhary Rajveer Singh said, “To execute our chakka jam peacefully, we also need to be vigilant and keep an eye out for anti-social elements who may try to infiltrate and try to defame farmers. The government may resort to these tactics, but we will have to be extra cautious.”Following the Republic Day violence, farmer leaders have maintained that the incident was a government conspiracy. Police have blamed farmer leaders for betraying their trust by letting protesters indulge in violence and drive on routes other than the ones approved by the police.Meanwhile, Delhi Police continued to bolster its security arrangements at the agitation spot across the three borders. While police installed at least three more layers of obstructions beyond the iron spikes at Tikri on Tuesday, fresh trenches were dug up at Ghazipur, and another layer of concrete barricade was installed a few metres away from the main stage at Singhu border. The police have made these arrangements to discourage any movement of agitating farmers towards the capital.At Singhu, the barricades were installed after a mob, claiming to be locals, entered the protest site last week leading to clash with farmers in which 15 farmers and 6 police personnel were injured. On Monday, the government had poured concrete mixture between two barricades and fixed iron rods on the road. On Tuesday, another layer of barricades were installed at the spot and no one except police personnel were allowed at that point. Security volunteers at the spot had also tied ropes on the concrete barricades disallowing protesters to come near it.Gurpreet Singh, 28, a security volunteer and a farmer from Moga district, said, “Yesterday, too many people had crowded here when police officials were supervising pouring of cement mixture between concrete barricades. If anyone managed to infiltrate that group and cause any problems, our movement would get defamed. So, we decided to guard the area and ensure no one reaches close to police barricades.”However, despite restrictions, farmers from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh were joining the protests in large numbers. At Singhu, where crowd had thinned after January 26, more farmers had arrived at the protest site in the past couple of days adding to the movement.Pritam Singh, 62, a farmer from Devinagar village of Patiala district in Punjab, said, “Around 2,500 people from our village have been coming per day since last week. While some stay back for a week or two, others return in a couple of days once more people come. Though the Republic Day incident had left us worried, we now understand that it was a ploy to scare the farmers and weaken the movement. The government’s decision to repeal laws and suspend internet just shows that.”Hundreds of farmers from Haryana were also travelling from Sonipat and other districts to join the movement albeit for a day. Rajesh Malik, 47, a farmer from Bhainswal Kalan village in Sonipat district of Haryana, who has been camped at Singhu border, said, “Our women want to join the movement in large numbers, so they come every day in different batches. They leave the next day only once another batch arrives. We want to let the government know that protesters are not leaving the agitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-leaders-tell-protesters-to-ensure-peace-during-feb-6-chakka-jam-101612289745173.html
03-02-2021||India||Maharashtra may propose law for ballot papers in elections||Maharashtra’s Speaker Nana Patole on Tuesday directed the state government to explore the option of allowing the use of paper ballots in addition to electronic voting machines (EVMs) during state and local body polls, a move that officials and experts could test the limits of electoral procedures that are under a state’s legal control.Patole’s direction came purportedly on a request by a Nagpur resident, following which the Speaker held discussions with state legislature secretary Rajendra Bhagwat, chief electoral officer Baldev Singh and secretary in law and judiciary department Bhupendra Gurav, in addition to other senior officials.“I have directed the law and judiciary department to prepare draft for an amendment in the existing laws to give the people an alternative of using paper ballots for voting. People have doubts over the EVM and want the old system of ballot to be brought back. Article 328 of the Indian Constitution empowers the state legislature to make provisions with respect to the elections,” Patole told HT.Also read: Maharashtra CM says affordable, eco-friendly mass transport needed in post-pandemic worldThe Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi partners – Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress – and the government did not comment on the issue.“Public sentiment must be respected. As such I have issued the directives,” Patole added.State officials dealing with legislative affairs are not sure whether the state has powers to legislate on assembly elections, which are held by Election Commission of India.Article 328 of the Constitution gives state legislatures the power to make provisions with respect to elections to such legislative bodies as long as these are not under the domain of Parliament.Officials from the State Election Commission (SEC) said the amendment related to local body elections can be made but not for state assembly elections since it is conducted under the Representation of People Act, 1951 which is a central law.“We conduct local bodies’ election under four different laws, each for municipal corporations, zilla parishads, village (gram) panchayat etc. and all the above laws have a provision for conducting elections through EVM. Theoretically, they can be amended for use of paper ballots but for this, the state will have to consult the SEC and the commission will have to make the request officially,” said a senior official from the SEC, requesting anonymity.Another official, who asked not to be named, said giving the option of EVM as well as ballot paper to the voters will not be feasible practically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-may-propose-law-for-ballot-papers-in-elections-101612289685614.html
03-02-2021||India||No proposal for transgender reservation: Govt||The Centre is working on a scheme to ensure access to health, education and livelihood for transgender persons but there is no proposal to enforce reservations for the community, the government told Parliament on Tuesday. The response by the Union social justice minister Thaawarchand Gehlot was to a question by Congress MP Revanth Reddy and it came roughly a year after the government enacted the transgender rights act.In its response, the government said the Transgender Persons (Protection Of Rights) Act 2019 and rules under the legislation mandated the central and state governments to take up schemes that address access to health, education, welfare, shelter and economic support for livelihoods. “A scheme is being formulated for addressing the above, which includes skill upgradation. As of now there is no proposal for providing reservations to the transgender persons in education or jobs,” the written answer read. In response to another question by the same parliamentarian, minister of state for social justice and empowerment Rattan Lal Kataria said the government spent ₹98.50 lakhs in supporting 6,940 transgender persons from 33 states and union territories during the Covid-19 pandemic. The National Backward Class Finance and Development Corporation (NBCFDC) gave Rs1,500 each to transgender persons through direct benefit transfer and also provided ration supplies, the Centre declared.The transgender community was among the worst hit when India imposed a lockdown last March to arrest the spread of Covid-19. Many members also appealed to the government in May for basic provisions because they struggled to access livelihood, food, medication and housing. Data furnished by the ministry showed that the maximum beneficiaries were in Tamil Nadu (1036) followed by Delhi (876) and West Bengal (814). “Free helpline assistance was setup to provide psycho-social support to transgender community during Covid period,” the answer, furnished in the Lok Sabha, read. But the help may have been inadequate. “The transgender community was badly hit by the virus and the lockdown. Many were on the streets. We needed more help from the government, including reservation in jobs and education,” said Shameena, a transgender activist. In 2016, the transgender rights bill was drafted by the government in response to the Supreme Court’s 2014 judgment that confirmed the rights of the community, and a 2015 private member’s bill passed in the Rajya Sabha. But almost immediately, activists and transgender groups criticised the draft legislation for confused definitions, focus on medical screening and criminalization of traditional occupations such as begging. The bill was then sent to a select committee and underwent several modifications before being passed by Parliament in November 2019. But many activists still say the law still has inadequate penal provisions for crimes and discrimination against transgender persons and no reservations for the community. The medical screening clause, for authorities to provide a transgender certificate, has also not been done away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-working-on-scheme-for-welfare-of-transpeople-101612289565059.html
03-02-2021||India||No plans to bring national anti-conversion law: Govt||The Centre has no plans to bring a nationwide anti conversion law to regulate interfaith marriages in the country, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) told Parliament on Tuesday.The government’s response comes at a time anti-conversion laws in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, which outlaw religious conversions by marriage, have stoked controversy, especially over the issue of love jihad, a term used by right-wing groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.Himachal Pradesh has a similar law. Assam, Karnataka and Haryana have announced they plan to bring similar legislation.Responding to a query by five members of parliament (MPs) on whether the government intends to propose a central anti-conversion law , Union minister of state of home affairs G Kishan Reddy said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha – “No, Sir”.Also read: Speaker tells Maharashtra to mull possibility of ballot paper lawAsked if the government was of the view that interfaith marriages were happening due to forceful conversions, Reddy said issues related to religious conversions are primarily the concern of state governments. He added that law enforcement agencies take action whenever such instances of violation come to the fore.“Public order and police are state subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Hence, prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of offences related to religious conversions are primarily the concerns of state governments and Union Territory administrations. Action is taken as per existing laws by law enforcing agencies whenever instances of violation come to notice,” Reddy said.Punishments under the anti-conversion law currently range between one to 10 years of imprisonment in case of forced conversion for marriage. Several cases have already been registered in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, both ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Human right activists have spoken out against the laws, which they allege are persecuting minorities.”Interfaith marriages are as old as the institution of marriage. Love jihad is nothing but an anti-minority political idea to interfere in an individual’s life and choices. It can make people targets of vigilante groups,” said civil rights activist Sanam Sutirath Wazir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plans-to-bring-national-anti-conversion-law-govt-101612289446965.html
03-02-2021||India||Government to sign ₹48,000 crore Tejas deal with HAL||The government will on Wednesday, the opening day of Aero India-2021, award Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) a ₹48,000-crore contract to supply 83 LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jets to the Indian Air Force, which is grappling with a shortage of fighter planes, officials familiar with the development said.India’s Cabinet Committee on Security, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on January 13 approved the proposal to buy the advanced Tejas jets, the biggest indigenous defence purchase so far, to bolster IAF’s combat potential.HAL chief R Madhavan said the first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force in three years, with the rest being supplied by 2030. The deal involves the supply of 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft.The state-owned aircraft maker is taking steps to accelerate deliveries of the fighter jet. On Tuesday, defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated HAL’s second LCA plant in the city to increase the yearly production rate of the fighter jet from eight to 16.'Message to world': Defence minister on HAL's new fighter jet production unit“HAL’s new LCA facility is an example of how Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India; a campaign of the government aimed at strengthening local manufacturing) is shaping [up], and HAL deserves the largest indigenous order of 83 LCA Mk-IA…The fighter is superior in many ways when compared to other fighters in its category besides being cost effective,” Singh said, on the eve of Asia’s biggest air show.The show is being held at the Yelahanka airbase from February 3 to 5. At least 600 exhibitors are taking part in the biennial show, including 78 foreign exhibitors.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far.The signing of the deal for 83 Tejas Mk-1A is an important event in Indian aviation, not so much because of the aircraft numbers and monies involved but because it is a renewal of faith in Indian R&D and manufacturing, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“HAL now has to perform since the stakes involved are very high -- IAF’s potency is dependent on it. HAL’s work culture and ethos have to turn a new leaf to ensure that aircraft production timelines are met in letter and spirit. Rigid adherence to quality in production and timely provisioning of spares would define successful contract implementation,” Bahadur said.The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability. The fighter’s indigenous content is expected to be 60%, compared to 50% in the existing variants.The Mk-1A programme is expected to generate thousands of jobs and will involve the participation of more than 500 Indian companies.The project will involve infrastructure development by IAF to enable it to handle repairs and servicing at its base depots so that the turnaround time for mission critical systems is reduced, leading to increased availability of aircraft for operational exploitation.“Tejas is not only indigenous, but it is also better than its foreign equivalents on several parameters and also comparatively cheaper. Many countries have shown interest in Tejas…,” Singh said on Twitter.Exporting weapons and systems is a top priority for the government. On December 30, the Union Cabinet gave its go-ahead for the sale of Akash surface-to-air missile systems to friendly foreign countries and created a high-powered panel for swifter approval of exports of military hardware. India has set a target of clocking defence exports worth $5 billion by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-sign-48k-cr-tejas-deal-with-hal-101612289445706.html

Currently, this record is held by a gathering of 20,000 who sang it together, said Vinay Kumar Pandey, Uttar Pradesh’s director of secondary education.The most people singing live on a radio broadcast is 10,793, achieved by Jingying Group (China) in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China, on 1 October 2018, said Amit Kumar Agnihotri, assistant director of the UP cultural directorate.“The state government has set a target of 50,000 to be on the safer side to avoid any last-minute glitch,” he said.Also read: Self-reliance is at the heart of budget exercise, says PM ModiFebruary 4 marks the centenary of a landmark event in the freedom struggle that took place at Chauri Chaura village in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh, known as United Province in British India, when a large group of protesters participating in Mahatma Gandhi’s non-cooperation movement clashed with the police, who opened fire. In retaliation, the protestors set fire to a police station. The incident left three civilians and 22 policemen dead. Days later, a saddened Gandhi halted the non-cooperation movement.As part of their preparations for the centenary, thousands of students are making videos of themselves singing the first stanza of Vande Mataram, with a hand raised in salute. They are required to send these clips to their schools, after which these videos will be uploaded on a link that will be opened by the Guinness Book of World Records.Aradhya Singh of Class 11 at City Montessori School (CMS, Aliganj campus 1) was among the first to send a clip of her video. Principal Jyoti Kashyap said it was sent to other students to replicate. A large number of students from all CMS campuses will recite Vande Mataram on Chauri Chaura Diwas, said Jagdish Gandhi, CMS founder.“The Guinness world record team will share a link at 10am on February 3 for the schools to upload all videos by February 4 till 12 noon.

03-02-2021||India||No J&K MPs in RS after Feb 15 as four members’ terms end||The Rajya Sabha will have no representatives from Jammu and Kashmir by the middle of February, when the four Upper House member from the Union territory (UT) carved out of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 complete their stints.Because the UT does not have an elected assembly at present, there will be no representatives in the upper chamber of Parliament until elections are held in J&K. Members of the Rajya Sabha are chosen by an electoral college of state legislators with a system of proportional representation through a single transferable vote.The election itself will be held after the delimitation exercise to redraw the boundaries of the electoral constituencies is completed. According to people aware of the details, the delimitation process is expected to be completed by March.Also read: House stalled as Opposition parties demands farm debateIn August 2019, the Centre pushed through constitutional changes divesting the erstwhile state of its special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcating it into two UTs -- J&K and Ladakh.Two MPs from the People’s Democratic Party, Nazir Ahmed Laway and Mir Mohammed Fayaz, will see their terms end on February 10 and 15 respectively. Congress leader and leader of the opposition in the House Ghulam Nabi Azad will see his end on February 15 and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Shamsher Singh Manhas, on February 10. While Azad has been a member of the Upper House for five terms since 1996, Laway, Mir and Manhas are first time MPs.To be sure, this is not the first time that the Upper House will be without any representative from J&K. Between 1991 and 1996, when the state had no assembly, there were no MPs from J&K in the Upper House for the duration between April 1994 and October 1996.Former CM and PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who was then with the Congress, was a member of the Upper House from 1986 to 1992; his party colleagues Rajendra Prasad Jain and Dharam Pal retired in 1994. Ghulam Rasool Mattoo, an independent, was a member of the House from 1988 to 1994 Shabir Ahmad Salaria of the National Conference retired in 1992.After elections were held in 1996, Saifuddin Soz, Sharifuddin Shariq, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Karan Singh were elected to the Upper House.“This has happened before when assembly elections were not held in 1991. But now the process of delimitation is underway and once that is completed we are hopeful that assembly elections will be held and the due processes will be followed,” Laway said.Constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general secretary PDT Achary said: “Ideally, such a situation should not have arisen, but because of the circumstances, the House will go without representation from the UT. Since the process of delimitation and holding polls to elect a new assembly has not been carried out, this is fait accompli,” he said.After the state lost its special status, the UT of J&K was to have its own elected assembly; Ladakh was designated as a UT without an assembly. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019Act also called for the setting up of a delimitation commission to redraw the boundaries of the electoral constituencies of J&K.The delimitation commission headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai was notified in March 2020 and was given a year until March 2021 to draw up the new constituencies.The last delimitation exercise was carried out in J&K in 1995. In 2002, the J&K assembly passed a law putting a freeze on fresh delimitation of seats until 2026.“Work to complete the process of delimitation is underway. There were some delays because of the corona pandemic, but work has resumed and the process is expected to be complete by March 2021,” said an official aware of the details, who requested anonymity.According to the Act, the number of seats in the assembly will increase from 107 to 114. The 24 seats that are reserved in the J&K Assembly for areas under Pakistan’s occupation will remain untouched and due reservation will be given to representatives from the schedule castes and schedule tribes.There is also speculation that more seats are likely to be added to the Jammu division.In his Independence Day address last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir after the delimitation process is completed.“The delimitation exercise is going on in Jammu and Kashmir under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge. As soon as the delimitation process is over, there will be elections in the future so that the Union Territory has its own government, which will undertake development work with renewed vigour,” Modi said.In the Lok Sabha, there are five representatives from Jammu and Kashmir, which includes two BJP MPs from Jammu, minister of state in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) Jitendra Singh and Jugal Kishore Sharma; and three MPs from Kashmir, National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah, Mohammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi. Ladakh, which was a part of the erstwhile state and is now a separate Union Territory, is represented by BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgayal.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-j-k-mps-in-rs-after-feb-15-as-four-members-terms-end-101612289146049.html
03-02-2021||Today's||‘We are here to entertain our fans…’||Theatre artiste, actor, anchor, Rajeev Bhardwaj feels that the love and recognition his characters have garnered over the years is his biggest reward.The Meerut born performer has been part of a number of films like ‘Mulk’,‘Super Nani’, ‘Lupt,’ ‘Traffic Signal’, and shows like ‘Bharat Ka Veer Putra-Maharana Pratap’, ‘Chandragupta Maurya’ and ‘Kulfi Kumaar’.“When my audiences praise my choice of roles and subjects it makes me content. It’s so rewarding to receive love and recognition from viewers. Many of my characters like the one I played in ‘Kulfi…’ made me find fans abroad. Actually, this is what we actors work for: to entertain our fans and to get love in return,” said the ‘Devon ke Dev…Mahadev’ actor during a recent visit to Dehradun.Bhardwaj is a qualified computer engineer who left his corporate job to try his luck in acting. Talking about his journey, he said, “After being in the corporate world for a couple of years, I decided to enter the entertainment field, though becoming a professional actor was never in my mind. I started as a dubbing artist then a radio jockey and entered the TV industry with the hit daily ‘CID’ and then numerous mythological shows happened along with theatre and films.”Currently he is being seen as Laali Rani on TV. Bhardwaj said it was truly challenging to play the role of a man who loves to dress up like a woman. “When I was offered this role for the show ‘Aye Mere Humsafar,’ I was in two minds but when I accepted it, I fell in love with the character. And trust me, my respect and admiration for women has grown manifold,” said Bhardwaj, who will also be seen doing an army officer’s role for a web series.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/we-are-here-to-entertain-our-fans-101612364131492.html
03-02-2021||Today's||By spending, the Union Budget offers an antidote to poverty||Finance minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman had promised that it would be a budget like no other, the best of the century. It was a bold statement. But she has delivered.Perhaps no other FM in free India was faced with such gigantic problems — a raging pandemic; a fragile health care system bursting at the seams; low consumer confidence; farm agitation; and the border tensions with China.Faced with a once-in-a-lifetime crisis, it was time for some big decisions. The budget demonstrates that the government has the political will as well as the financial know-how to put the damaging economic crisis behind us, and push India on its way to a robust growth pathThe budget’s big-ticket ideas revolve around capital spending. Economists had urged the FM to “spend, spend and spend”. She appears to have done just that, without (rightly) bothering about international rating agencies which might have something to say about India’s fiscal deficit. But there is a national consensus to spend now, spend for the next few years, and then worry about the fiscal deficit. This is bold but timely, and will boost demand.There is a sharp increase in capital expenditure to ₹5.54 lakh crore, 35% more than in the last fiscal. This is in addition to ₹2 lakh crore proposed to be given to states and autonomous bodies for their capital expenditure.The outlay for health and well-being, to the tune of ₹2.2 lakh crore as against ₹94,452 crore in the previous year, is significant. A new centrally-sponsored scheme, called PM Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojna, to be launched with an outlay of ₹65,500 crore, staggered over six years, is another big statement by the FM that she is not afraid to spend. A proposal to spend ₹35,000 crore on vaccination is a step in that direction.But what is most striking is the Aatmanirbhar package. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi publicly reiterated his resolve to once again make India self-reliant in a virtual Davos conference organised by the World Economic Forum (WEF) recently. This is a serious pledge to make India a global economic powerhouse and generate wealth for the poor and middle-class. Modi launched this movement on May 12 last year and, since then, it has become his mantra, even his government’s dharma. Every budget in the next few years has to help the PM realise his vision of self-reliance. This budget has made a strong beginning to achieve this goal.The slogan of “vocal for local” — Modi himself encapsulated the spirit of the campaign in these three magical words — is music to the ears of Indian manufacturers and producers. The first step towards this goal was taken last year when the government brought a production-linked incentive scheme. Under this scheme, Indian companies will get 4-6% incremental concession for the next five years on making goods inside the country.The creation of infrastructure will continue to be on top of the list of priorities and the FM has listed quite a few new schemes, including the highest ever outlay of ₹1.18 lakh crore for the ministry of road transport and highways, of which ₹1.08 lakh crore is for capital. Large capex and focus on infra will boost growth and create enormous employment opportunities for both white and blue collar jobs.The emphasis on disinvestment and asset monetisation is not a novel idea, but a much-needed one. Last year’s plans were disrupted by the pandemic, but the FM has promised to be super proactive on this front in the fiscal year 2021-22, which will fill the government coffers by up to ₹1.75 lakh crore.In short, Sitharaman has created a buzz in the market. Her budget will help rebuild consumer confidence. A budget is not a magic wand to end all our economic woes and one budget is never going to be enough to tide over all the difficulties. But her intent is clear — and that is to lead India’s V-shaped economic recovery with all the government’s might.Syed Zafar Islam is a Member of Parliament, national spokesperson of the BJP, and a former managing director, Deutsche Bank, IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/by-spending-the-union-budget-offers-an-antidote-to-poverty-101612274443737.html
03-02-2021||Editorials||On global criticism, tread with caution||The farm protests have captured global attention, with a set of political, cultural, and environmental figures — including the popular artiste, Rihanna, the fourth-most followed person on Twitter — tweeting their solidarity with the protests. This has led the ministry of external affairs (MEA) to issue a statement, blaming “vested interest groups” and pointing to the evolution of the farm laws, the need to see protests within the framework of India’s democratic structure, the efforts made to reach an agreement with farm groups, and the violence on Republic Day. This is unusual simply because the government usually ignores comments from non-State actors. There are two distinct issues here. The first is the international solidarity that the movement has been able to generate, either due to the Sikh diaspora’s network, the larger mobilisation by liberal, left, and human rights groups, or the nature of the international media’s coverage of the protests. At a time when it is not unusual for narratives to be controlled through influencer networks and IT cells — and India is no stranger to either — it is entirely possible (no matter what the probability) that at least some of these displays of solidarity have been engineered. But irrespective of the causes and the merits of the criticism (or the merits of the underlying protest), the fact is that it erodes India’s soft power and image as a democracy. The government will have to recognise the intricate ways in which domestic developments intersect with global politics, especially at a time when social media has disproportionate power in shaping perception. The most substantive and effective way in which the Indian State can respond is by strengthening its own democratic framework and reiterating its commitment to individual liberty and the right to dissent, in principle and practice. Rihanna, for instance, with over 100 million followers on Twitter is unlikely to be cowed down by a troll army, or fears of falling sales of her music in India. The second issue is the ability of this criticism — confined at the moment to private, even if influential, citizens in the West — to become a matter of inter-State deliberations. This is where the MEA’s statement comes in. It can be read as an attempt to both counter what the government sees as “propaganda” to discredit India, and an effort to pre-empt foreign governments from being guided by the social media storm. It is unlikely that foreign governments, particularly the US, will, even if they issue token statements, make it a top diplomatic issue. But what is clear is that India, because of the ideological and economic shifts underway in the country and the subsequent polarisation, will face questions. This requires ensuring that these transformations are democratically managed internally, and smarter strategic communication about the nature of these changes externally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-global-criticism-tread-with-caution-101612363020209.html
03-02-2021||Editorials||India’s democratic dilemma | HT Editorial||With Myanmar witnessing a coup, bringing to an end a period where the military and the democratic forces coexisted in a complex political structure, India is confronting a familiar dilemma. As a democracy, India’s sympathies naturally lie with a popularly elected system of government, an open society, free speech, and civilian control over military. Its role is underestimated, but, as scholarly work by Constantino Xavier has shown, India has often — without making too much noise about it — promoted democracy in the neighbourhood through active interventions or technical support.The challenge arises when there is a mismatch between immediate national interests, values, and India’s own power in shaping outcomes. In the case of Myanmar, India shares a critically important relationship with the military — which has been cooperative in helping tackle extremism in the Northeast and is uncomfortable with China’s intrusive presence in its ethnic politics. India also does not have either the tools or the leverage to be able to persuade the military to roll back, or help carve out an inclusive political regime. In this backdrop, Delhi will have little choice but to work the regime in power in Myanmar.This is, however, a call that needs to be taken depending on the specifics of each case. In Nepal, the alignment between values, interests, and India’s ability to shape outcomes means New Delhi should stand with constitutional democracy, which Prime Minister KP Oli is undermining. In Sri Lanka, the Rajapaksa regime, by withdrawing from an infrastructure agreement with India, has once again shown that besides being authoritarian and exclusivist internally, it is not necessarily receptive to Indian interests externally. This should prompt a rethink in Delhi about its Sri Lanka policy. Or in Bangladesh, the Sheikh Hasina government has been remarkably sensitive to Indian security interests — but its own internal democratic record is weak. This has resulted in Delhi working with Dhaka, at the cost of turning a blind eye to the regime’s excesses. India’s dilemma will only increase because, on one hand, China’s footprint in the region will make Delhi focus on interests, even when its democratic commitment and global partnerships with other democracies will add pressure to focus on values.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/indias-democratic-dilemma-hteditorial-101612275523918.html
03-02-2021||Editorials||In Ghazipur, farm protests take a turn | HT Editorial||After the unacceptable violence and vandalism on Republic Day, the farm movement had lost the moral high ground. A majority of protesters were demoralised and upset about how their movement had been hijacked. But the effort by the Uttar Pradesh government to clear the Ghazipur border last week, and farm leader Rakesh Tikait’s passionate appeal to persist with the protests, changed the situation in three ways. It led to a revival in the momentum of the protests; the key geographical base of the agitation expanded from Singhu and Tikri to Ghazipur; and it has created a real political challenge for the government.The farm movement is the most serious mass movement in the last six years. But as long as it was largely confined to the farmers of Punjab and Haryana, the government’s political calculus was that this would not lead to a major electoral backlash against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in its stronghold regions. But developments in western Uttar Pradesh (UP) has changed the calculus. Since the 2013 riots, with a breakdown in Jat-Muslim relations, Jats in large numbers moved to supporting the BJP. This has not always been an easy relationship, but over three elections, in 2014, 2017 and 2019, their support has helped the BJP in maintaining its dominance in west UP. With state elections a year away, the party is worried about alienating this large demographic in a crucial state.But no side should think it has the upper hand in this constantly shifting dynamic. This newspaper continues to believe it would be best for farm groups to take the government’s offer of an 18-month suspension of the laws and join a consultative exercise to come up with a revised framework. The R-day violence and Ghazipur developments only show the dangers of a prolonged stalemate for both the State and the protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-ghazipur-farm-protests-take-a-turn-hteditorial-101612275103876.html
