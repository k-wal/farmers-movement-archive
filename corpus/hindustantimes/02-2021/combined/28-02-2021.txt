Besides, people above 45 years of age with co-morbidities will also be covered in the third phase, but they need to self-register on the updated version of the Co-Win 2.0 app, officials of the district health department said on Sunday. As many as 220 vaccination booths in 26 hospitals, including private facilities, have also been identified for the third phase, the officials said, adding that the vaccination for phase 3 is likely to begin on March 4 in the district. GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that it is expected that the state government will issue detailed guidelines about the third phase of inoculation on Monday. “We’ll prefer to having vaccination sessions on those days, when there will be no other health programmes. For covering maximum number of beneficiaries, the health department has prepared a list of beneficiaries for the third phase with the help of the latest electoral roll in the district,” he said. Ohri also said that everyone in the district, who have completed 60 years of age, are included in the list of beneficiaries for the third phase. “The third phase will cover all the 4,24,555 beneficiaries in different sessions within a fortnight. As soon as the dates of vaccination for these beneficiaries are announced by the government, we will begin the process of registration, in which the addresses and mobile numbers of the beneficiaries will be updated,” he said. The GB Nagar vaccination officer, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, said that the district health department is also looking for the patients among the listed beneficiaries, who are under treatment for other ailments in different hospitals of GB Nagar and other neighbouring districts. “The third phase of inoculation can begin with the booster dose session for the beneficiaries of first and second phase on March 4 or 5. It is also possible that sessions will be increased in the third phase,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gbnagar-admin-gears-up-for-third-round-of-covid-19-vaccination-101614536957036.html
28-02-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad identifies two govt hospitals for third phase of Covid vaccination||Ghaziabad: For the third phase of Covid-19 vaccination that begins on Monday, the Ghaziabad health department has identified two government hospitals in the district where vaccine doses will be provided free of cost. Health officials said that one private hospital also came forward and procured the vaccine from the department. However, people willing to get vaccinated will have to pay ₹250 per dose at the private facility, they said.The officials said that citizens can also walk in at two of the government hospitals -- the district women hospital and Sanjay Nagar combined district hospital -- and also at the private facility -- Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi -- to get vaccinated.The health department said that the “soft launch” for the third phase of vaccination will cover citizens aged 60 years and above and also those aged 45 years and above but having co-morbid conditions. They added that people can pre-register their choice of vaccination centre through the updated version of Co-Win 2.0 app and will be able to get date and time schedule. “Apart from pre-registration that will begin on Monday, citizens can also walk in at two of our government hospitals and also other private hospitals who are procuring vaccine doses from the health department. Any citizen (belonging to the third category) can register or walk-in and produce documents before he/she gets opportunity to get vaccinated,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. “The third option is vaccination through mobilisation in which our health-care staff will mobilize people, primarily in rural areas, to reach their nearest centre and get the vaccination done. We have sent 100 doses each to the two of our government hospitals where vaccine will be given free of cost. Besides, Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi has procured 100 doses of Covishield from the health department. More private hospitals are likely to procure vaccine in coming days,” Gupta said. He said that Covishield is initially sent to the three hospitals as one vial contains 10 doses, while one vial of Covaxin contains 20 doses. “So, Covishield has low wastage rate. The private hospitals will pay up for purchase of a vaccine dose at the rate of ₹150 and they will charge a maximum of ₹250 per dose from their customers,” Gupta added. Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi confirmed that it received 100 doses of Covishield and vaccination will start on Monday. “People can come with documents either through walk-in or after registration through the Co-Win 2.0 app. The staff at our centre will verify their documents based on age criteria laid down by the government and also their documents (prescriptions by doctors) in case they have co-morbidities,” said a spokesperson of the hospital.To simplify the process of registration, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has come up with Co-Win 2.0 app. The beneficiaries will consist of citizens who will attain the age of 60 years or more as on January 1, 2022. The other group consists of citizens who are aged or will attain the age of 45 years to 59 years as on January 1, 2022 and have any specified comorbidities. “The private hospitals will include all hospitals empanelled under the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PMJAY) and hospitals empanelled under the health insurance scheme(s) of the state government. In Ghaziabad, we have 26 private hospitals under PMJAY and about 50-60 under the CGHS scheme,” the CMO said. The district has already completed the final mop-up round for first category (health-care workers) and for the second category (front-line workers).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-identifies-two-govt-hospitals-for-third-phase-of-covid-vaccination-101614536896972.html
28-02-2021||Mumbai||Ruling MVA vs Opposition BJP: Maharashtra budgets for a face-off in session||In the backdrop of a bitter tussle between the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the budget session of the state legislature beginning Monday is set for face-off. The stage is set with the resignation of forest minister Sanjay Rathod in connection with a woman’s suicide due to the pressure mounted by the BJP. The two sides are already at loggerheads over various issues, which will be reflected in the 10-day session. The state’s budget will be presented on March 8. On the eve of the session, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray trained guns on the BJP and the Centre on issues ranging from the goods and services tax (GST) dues to compensation for floods in Maharashtra. The Opposition, meanwhile, has formulated a strategy to target the MVA government on corruption, financial condition of the state, Covid response and agriculture, etc. Thackeray, while addressing a press conference on Sunday evening, took on the BJP leadership in the state and asked why they were not protesting against fuel prices and demanding pending dues from the Centre. “They have showed agony and rage on electricity bill, but why not the same for petrol, diesel and LPG prices? Why are there no protests? When Modi government came in 2014, the petrol was priced around ₹71. Now it has crossed ₹100 in some states. They have increased cess in fuel and this sum goes to the Centre’s kitty and it is not for the states.” The chief minister said the state is yet to receive compensation for the flooding in Vidarbha and Nisarg Cyclone in 2020. He added the state is yet to get GST dues worth over ₹29,000 crore. “We are yet to get ₹29,291 crore towards GST dues. The Nagpur division flooding and June cyclone compensation of ₹4,720 crore is also pending.” Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis alleged there was corruption in Covid management, IPS and IAS transfers, etc. Fadnavis said the Shiv Sena skipped Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’s birth anniversary following pressure from the Congress. “The CM did not offer tribute to Savarkar. They didn’t say a word on Twitter,” he said. “First, they should understand which is Savarkar’s death anniversary and which is his birth anniversary. The ones who don’t know this difference are levelling allegations against us, this is laughable,” Thackeray said, in response, adding, “Merely levelling allegations without any proof has become a trend. They said there was corruption in Covid management. The Dharavi model has been lauded across the world, but they are making fun of our Covid warriors by doing this, even as they felicitate them. I have never seen such a two-faced Opposition party,” Thackeray said. Thackeray also said the BJP leadership in Maharashtra should take up the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute with the Centre and Karnataka government. Fadnavis on Sunday said the Opposition is united with the government on the issue. “If they are indeed with us, they should take up the issue with the Centre and in Karnataka, where there is a BJP government. In the past five years [between 2014 and 2019], when they were in power in the Centre and state, why didn’t they solve this matter? Today, the state government has taken an aggressive stance to solve it. If we come together, we can give justice to people from the border areas,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ruling-mva-vs-opposition-bjp-maharashtra-budgets-for-a-face-off-in-session-101614536838659.html
28-02-2021||Noida||Apartment owners’ association imposes ‘security’ fee over tenants, residents protest||GREATER NOIDA: Around 150 residents of 16th Avenue, Gaur City 2 in Greater Noida West on Sunday staged a demonstration against the apartment owners’ association (AOA), demanding immediate recall of the decision to impose a security fee on tenants.The tenants alleged that the AOA is arbitrarily charging ₹5,000 from tenants and will charge ₹7,000 from new ones who come to live there.“The decision to levy security fee is an effort to divide on the basis of owners and non-owners and to extort funds. We are paying maintenance for every service; why we should pay this arbitrary security fee now, which has no legal basis,” said Amit Goswami, a tenant in society for a year.At least 150 tenants have started a signature campaign under which they handed over a letter to the AOA asking it to recall the decision. There are 1,710 units in the society out of which around 50% are occupied by tenants.“Only 59 flat owners in their general body took this decision on February 14, 2021 without any legal ground on this. If they do not take back this decision we will write to the district magistrate, Greater Noida authority and other top officials for help,” said Suresh Verma, another tenant.According to new order, a new tenant will have to pay move-in charge of ₹7,000, which includes ₹2,000 non-refundable and Rs5,000 refundable fee. The security fee is being imposed as ‘Excessive Resource Utilization’ by tenants in the society. Even if an old tenant changes a flat within this society, then also the security fee will have to be paid, reads the general body’s letter issued February 14. However, flat owners support the decision.“Old tenant needs to pay only Rs5,000 one-time as security, which is refundable. New tenants will have to pay Rs7,000 as Rs2,000 is non-refundable and the rest will be refunded once the tenant leaves the unit. The decision has been taken as per rules and for the welfare of the society,” said KP Chauhan, an apartment owner and member of AOA.Dilip Gupta, deputy registrar of the Society Chit and Funds from Meerut that looks after AOAs, etc, said, “If the aggrieved persons move an application to our office we can look into the issue and take appropriate action as per the rules. A decision by AOA should not be arbitrary and without consultation with all flat owners. The aggrieved party can file a complaint, without which we cannot intervene.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/apartment-owners-association-imposes-security-fee-over-tenants-residents-protest-101614536837509.html
28-02-2021||Noida||Noida traffic police to colour code autos to curb their illegal movement||Noida: The traffic department in Gautam Budh Nagar has started working on colour-coding auto-rickshaws in the district, in an effort to curb illegal movement of auto-rickshaws.“We have started the first step of data collection. Nearly 70 vehicles were identified till now. We are working on verifying the remaining, after which the registration process will begin. The idea is to colour-code auto-rickshaws from different parts of the city and issue them the number codes accordingly. This will help us monitor any illegal movement of auto-rickshaws, ease traffic and help the public to identify authorised vehicles in respective areas,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ganesh Saha.He said auto-rickshaws operating in the city have pre-described routes, but some manage to evade the system.“For instance, auto-rickshaws registered in Dadri are not permitted to travel throughout the city, but sometimes they do. The new system will help us keep such activities in check. The entire plan is in the process of being finalised and we hope to roll it out soon,” said Saha.Mandatory uniforms and ID cards for drivers will also be issued. Any violation, whether in terms of area wise colour-code or ID can lead to issuance of fines by the traffic department, he added. The system will also have different codes for auto-rickshaws plying at metro stations, auto-rickshaw stands and other parts.“We will also make provisions to display the traffic police helpline number on these vehicles for the aid of the public. It is an overhaul of the existing system and will take time to implement, but it will be a significant improvement over the existing system. It will help the travellers and us alike while also keeping criminal activities in check,” Saha added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-police-to-colour-code-autos-to-curb-their-illegal-movement-101614536837004.html

28-02-2021||Noida||Noida notified as ‘town of export excellence’ for apparel products||NOIDA: In what comes as a big boost for the apparel industry in the city, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the ministry of commerce and industry, on Thursday notified Noida as a ‘town of export excellence (TEE)’ for apparel products.Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that with this Gazette notification, Noida will be eligible for many export promotion schemes of the central government, which include central assistance of States and market access initiative. “It’ll also provide support in strengthening infrastructure, simplifying rules and procedures, besides developing production infrastructure relating to design, R&D packaging, logistic support, etc. Since Noida is in the TEE category now, the ministry will also provide awareness and information about international marketing, which will pave the way for further export promotion in the district,” he said. Lalit Thukral, the president of Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC) said that the notification is a great achievement for the apparel industry here. “It’s the second big recognition for the city, after getting declared as ‘city of apparel’ by the state government. It’ll certainly accelerate the NAEC’s mission to develop Noida as a distinguished destination for apparel products,” he said. “As per the present scheme of the centre, an area/cluster that realizes an annual export turnover of ₹1,000 crore or more will be notified as TEE. However, for TEE in handloom, handicraft, agriculture and fisheries sector, the threshold limit is ₹150 crore. Getting the TEE status means the city has immense potential for growth in exports of key items like handloom, agriculture, textiles, handicraft and fisheries. The DGFT notifies a town in this category to enable them to move up in the value chain and tap new markets,” he said. When contacted, a joint secretary in ministry of commerce and industries said that at present, there are altogether 35 towns in India notified as TEE for their unique exportable commodity. “The TEE towns get benefits from many promotional programmes launched by the centre. One of such schemes is the market access initiative (MAI) to recognize export associations, under which financial assistance is provided for export promotion activities on focus country, focus product basis to different industry associations there. These activities include market surveys, setting up of warehouses, participation in international trade fairs, publicity campaigns, brand promotion, reimbursement of registration charges for pharmaceuticals and testing charges for engineering products abroad,” the officer said, asking to remain anonymous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-notified-as-town-of-export-excellence-for-apparel-products-101614536717576.html

The development of landfill site spread on 126 acres holds significance as the authority has plans to set up a waste treatment plant there by the end of 2022.The authority will complete the development of the landfill by end of this year, said officials. “We have put the development work on fast-track so that the authority can start the treatment of waste scientifically. We are levelling the land so that we can store waste and start remediation work,” said Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority. So far the authority has completed the construction of a boundary wall around the site. The authority will spend ₹3.22 crore on levelling work and developing 100 metre-wide green belt around the site, the officials said, adding that the development of green belt is important to make sure that the waste treatment plant does not cause any inconvenience to people living in Astoli village. The landfill site in Astoli village had got all environmental approvals in 2016, but failed to become operational because of the land issues. Some farmers had started protests and refused to give land for the landfill. But last year, the authority resolved all land-related issues and started the work on this project.Greater Noida produces around 300 metric tonne of waste daily. The authority has divided the city into five clusters for better collection of the waste. The authority is also encouraging residents to segregate the waste so that it can make compost out of green waste and reduce the quantity that goes to landfill. “We will take only 15% inert waste to landfill for the treatment,” said Chand. The treatment plant will be having a capacity of 1.2 tonne, said the officialsThe authority has already decided to set up a construction and demolition waste treatment plant at sector Ecotech 3. It has selected an agency that will recycle the construction waste for 15 years. “We aim to make tiles, bricks and other products out of the construction and demolition waste,” said Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/work-on-landfill-site-expedited-in-greater-noida-101614536718194.html

28-02-2021||Mumbai||We will protest against actors, push for electricity bill waiver: Maharashtra Congress chief||In an interview with Hindustan Times, newly appointed Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole says his party was determined to give waiver from inflated power bills, free electricity to the small consumers and have state’s own farm law to negate central laws. Patole said Congress will protest against Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar for their ‘dubious stand’ on the fuel price hike. He also said that the party will not hesitate to speak against the government on issues related to the general public. Excerpts from the interview- Will Congress become aggressive under your leadership?We have been aggressively reacting to the issues that are close to the heart of the people. Our responsibility has increased more as the Narendra Modi government in the Centre has adopted anti-people policies. It has started selling off public sector companies, fuel prices are all-time high when the crude prices are still low. They have imposed a road cess of ₹18 and a farmer development cess of ₹4, but the money collected is not being utilised for the purpose it’s being collected for. You said you will make Congress the number one party in Maharashtra. How are going to take the party to the top from the current number four position in the state? I have a very pragmatic plan for it. There are some problems in organisational structure in the state, but I have started resolving them. I have started taking review across the state, to strengthen our base. We may not be able to achieve the top position immediately in the upcoming local body elections, but by the 2024 Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, the results will be seen. I got an overwhelming response from the people in Mumbai, Nagpur and Bhandara after I was appointed the Congress chief. Congress is there in the roots of Maharashtra and it would not be difficult to become the number one party in the state.Will Congress contest the local body elections, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC), with its allies in the state?We will fight the BMC election on our own, it has been decided. We have also made an announcement. For other local bodies, the decision will be taken based on the demand and requirement at the local level by speaking to our leaders in the respective areas.The alliance for the local body elections may lead to friction within the ruling alliance. I do not see any reason for it. Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had fought separately even when they were in an alliance in the state. Why there should be any problem within the ruling alliance over it? This government is stable and will complete its five-year term.Congress has been complaining about the secondary treatment by two other parties in the Maharasthra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. What do you have to say over it?The government could be formed just because Congress was part of it. I will take a review of all the departments held by the Congress and if felt need we will talk to the chief minister and deputy chief minister to ensure we get equal treatment. We are in power for the balanced development of the state and the interest of the people. We would not tolerate secondary treatment for us. We will not hesitate to talk against the government if need be, in the interest of the people.Congress has spoken about waiver in the inflated bill, free power to small consumers and state’s own farm law to negate central laws…It does not seem to be happening.We are determined to give a waiver to the power consumers from the inflated bills during the lockdown. Our minister (energy minister and Congress leader Nitin Raut) has also announced free power to the consumers with the usage of 100 units. We will ensure that these announcements are fulfilled. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has recently spoken about the revenue shortfall of about ₹1.12 lakh crore. We will speak to him over it but we are firm on the announcement made by Congress ministers.We will push for the state’s own farm law in the ensuing budget session. Our parliamentary board passed a resolution in that respect.There has been unprecedented friction witnessed between governor BS Koshyari and MVA government in the state…Governor’s stand concerning state government matters is doubtful. People have started raising questions over it. He is expected to act impartially as he the head of the state and should treat all equally. He asked the government to hold an election for the post of speaker but does not clear the names recommended for the nomination to the Legislative Council. The friction between the Governor and the government is unprecedented and something which never witnessed in Maharashtra. You were the first BJP member of Parliament (MP) to speak against Prime Minister Narendra Modi before quitting the party in 2017. Was it a mistake to join BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha election in 2014?The reservations and objections raised by me in 2017 are being raised now by the people of the country. I had joined BJP expecting that I will get a better opportunity to serve the people. But was disillusioned within a couple of years. I am a born Congressi but was compelled to join BJP because of the local politics in Bhandara-Gondiya.You criticised Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar for their silence and announced to ban their films. The Opposition says it was just to grab headlines. We are serious about it. I have directed party workers to protest against the actors for not speaking in the interest of the common people. They are the icons of the country and they have the democratic right, it’s their duty to speak up against wrong policies. They spoke in 2012 when there was the Manmohan Singh government in power. Why are they silent now? If they have pressure upon them to not speak against the government, they should come up openly and the people of the country will stand in their support.Some actors have been proclaimed as Deshbhakt by honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but their nationality is in doubts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/we-will-protest-against-actors-push-for-electricity-bill-waiver-maharashtra-congress-chief-101614535937639.html
28-02-2021||Pune||City has 20.38 TMC water stock until monsoon||The water stock in four dams Khadakwasla, Temghar, Varasgaon and Temghar is currently standing at 20.38 TMC which is almost two TMC more than the previous years. The city’s monthly water requirement is currently at 1.5 TMC. With the day temperature rising to 36.1 degrees Celsius on the last day of February, sunny days are ahead for the city in the coming days. In the past, the city saw a water cut but this year water stock in all four dams is adequate enough and the state irrigation department is confident of providing enough water to the city until the start of the monsoon. “We have a very good rainy season which almost continued until November and all the dams have enough water stock to sustain until the start of monsoon. Currently, there are 56.145% (average of four) water stock available in the dams which provide water to Pune,” said an official from the state water irrigation department. Last year, the average water stock of four dams was 50.01 per cent. Except for Khadakwasla, which has marginally low water stock, all other dams have higher stock then what it had in the year 2020 on the same day (February 28). “Recently, water was released for rabi crops so the number is a little low, but it will not have any impact on the water supply in Pune city,” said an official. As of Sunday, Khadakwasla has (0.98 TMC), Temghar (0.51 TMC), Warasgaon (9.31 TMC) and Panshet (9.58 TMC) respectively. “Last year, there was lesser stock in Panshet and Temghar.

28-02-2021||Other||Centre must ensure one standard measure for all packed, non-packed goods||Last week, an online milk delivery start-up called to say that they are home delivering fresh vegetables and fruits too and as a promotional offer, their customers would be entitled to a 50 per cent discount on the original price ! Of course, there was a catch- the offer would be open for a month, but the discounts would apply only if I validated it with a purchase order for a hamper immediately.I do not like companies that try to hustle you into making a purchase decision instantly, on the basis of their promotional talk on your cell phone. I also know that in most of these cases, the consumer is not given the full and correct information. So I decided to check his prices to see whether he is really giving a 50 per cent discount and whether his prices compare favourably with other online and offline stores. At first glance, I was struck by the price of French beans quoted- ₹17.50 after discount! Since similar beans were being sold for ₹28 for half a kg in two online stores, I thought this was a good offer, till I scrutinized the details carefully and detected the mischief!The quantity of beans for which the price was quoted was only 225 gms! The company may call it a marketing strategy, but I would call it an unfair practice. First, the company calls you and conditions your mind to expect a low price and if you are not careful, you will order the beans believing that you are getting a good deal, without seeing the quantity mentioned in dull blue, against the red colour of the price.That’s not all, Specifying ₹17.50 for 225 gms (not 250 or 500 ) was also obviously meant to prevent price comparison with others. With my poor maths skills, I managed with great difficulty, to calculate the price for one kilogram- ₹77.70 . Now this price was far higher than the price at which others- online/app based stores as well as brick and mortar stores -were selling , at ₹56 a kilogram. In other words, this vegetable, after the so-called discount, was costing ₹21.70 more per kg than others! To mask this and make comparison difficult, he was quoting the price for 225 gms! I then checked his other prices and noticed that there was no uniformity in the quantity quoted. For lettuce, the price listed was for 315 gms, for mushroom-180 gms, for green chilies- 90 gms. Thus it took away the consumer’s right to informed purchase by making price comparison just impossible. Besides, if what you want is 500 gms and not 315, calculating the price was tough!Perturbed by what I saw, I checked up more online grocers and found lot of ambiguity in the pricing. For example, one of them quoted ₹39 for a piece of Broccoli and said in brackets that it’s approximate weight would be 250-500 gms. Does it mean that he will charge ₹39 for one piece of broccoli, irrespective of its weight? Apple- ₹159 for four pieces ( 530 to 640 gms) Similarly, the price quoted for cabbage and cauliflower was for one unit, with wide variation in the weight. Why can’t he just mention the price per kg? The sum and substance of all this is that every online/App /WhatsApp based seller is trying to mislead the consumer, in order to sell- thereby trampling over several rights of consumers.. In order to curb just such practices in the packed goods sector , the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules mandate that ail packed goods should only be sold in certain standard sizes specified under the Rules. Consumers urgently need similar protection vis-à-vis non-packed goods too,The Union ministry of consumer affairs or the Central Consumer Protection Authority has to step in and ensure that all online, app-based, WhatsApp based retailers display prices of non-packed goods-particularly vegetables and fruits- in only one standard measure- one kg or one litre. This would go a long way in preventing deceptive promotional practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-must-ensure-one-standard-measure-for-all-packed-non-packed-goods-101614535876986.html
28-02-2021||Pune||PMC receives objections to road widening from old city areas||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has registered maximum objections from the old city areas on the proposed widening of city roads from six to nine metres. The objections were revealed during a hearing of PMC’s building permission and development department. The civic body received stiff opposition from areas including Kothrud, Shivajinagar, Erandwane, Parvati-Sahakarnagar, Bibvewadi. In total, the civic body received objections for around 200 roads across the city. The PMC is claiming that there are no open areas for development in the city and only redevelopment can help the city’s development. Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulation (UNDP) has given a lot of opportunity to develop in terms of additional FSI and TDR but if there is no proper width of roads, there is no use of such provision. It will hamper the city’s development as well as revenue losses. Citizens are objecting to reducing plot size, affecting the front side of the home, fear of demolition of some parts of the existing bungalow and tree cutting. Some political parties have sprung to help citizens to register opposition in order to gain mileage in the upcoming civic polls. The PMC has identified 335 city roads on the basis of future development based on the redevelopment and utilization of Transfer Development Rights (TDR) and Floor space Index (FSI). The PMC has appealed to citizens who are living in areas where roads are widening. Of the total 335 roads, there are 255 roads from the old city limit, and the remaining 80 roads fall in the suburban areas. The PMC is receiving fewer applications from suburb areas as compared to the old city limits. The civic body received responses from 1,800 citizens who registered a positive as well as a negative opinion on the road widening. However, the total number of applications is around 700. Most of the bungalow societies are at the forefront in opposition. Prima facie, the PMC has found that around 135 roads from where PMC received very less or no applications so far. Prasanna Joshi, executive engineer of the Development Plan (DP) cell said, “There are fewer applications, but citizen numbers are more as citizens signed applications in groups. We received an application in which 60 citizens signed a single application. To date, we have completed the hearing of around 1,000 citizens. We called individual citizens for hearing.” Rajendra Raut, superintendent engineer of the building permission and development department said, “The hearing is ongoing, it will take another 15 to 20 days to complete it. After that, we will make a detailed report and submit it to the standing committee. At present, it is too early to comment on the issue.” Dr Anant Bhagwat, resident and president of Savarkar co-operative society said, “Our society is located in Sahakarnagar area. It is a bungalow society that consists of 55 bungalows. Each one is having around 2,200 square feet of plot size. At present, we have six metres of internal road. The society is on the dead-end of the Taljai hills. Being a bungalow society, we have maintained greenery in our area. We don’t want to widen the road from six metres to nine metres as it will help to boost commercialization in this area, and it will destroy our flora-fauna as well as peace of residents.” “Under the name of development, the decision is actually favorable to developers and not for common citizens. At present, there are high-rise buildings in our areas, but they have approach roads which are passing through slum areas. If the society road widens, builders will get alternate roads and it will help them to sell their flats at a higher price. In this scenario, how can residents get the benefit? On the other side, our society bungalow’s front side will hamper. We have registered our opposition to the PMC as well as written a letter to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and urban development minister Eknath Shinde,” he added. On the other hand, a resident of Dhankawadi area and member of Kalpataru housing society, Girish Kamble said, “Road width was a hurdle for the development of our society. After the PMC initiative, it will help us to redevelop our society. There are different views on road widening but the PMC will have to make decisions case by case. Development cannot be stopped or imposed on citizens.” Areas where PMC received maximum applications Kothrud, Shivajinagar, Deccan Gymkhana, Ghole road, Bhandarkar road, Law college road, Prabhat road, Erandwane, Parvati, Sahakarnagar, Bibvewadi, Dhanakwadi, Aundh, Baner, Mohamadwadi, Tulsibaugh colony, Ambegaon Budruk, Balewadi, Hadapsar, Aundh, Dhanori.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-receives-objections-to-road-widening-from-old-city-areas-101614535819058.html

The victim was walking on the ramp when the teen came from behind and pushed her. The woman was declared dead on arrival by doctors at the hospital. We have registered a murder case but have not arrested the accused as she is also mentally unstable.” Three years ago in March 2018, a mentally ill man killed his 55-year-old mother with a gas cylinder while the two were in a domestic argument; the son hurled a metal gas cylinder in their house at his mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mentally-challenged-woman-pushed-to-death-by-juvenile-in-kothrud-101614535818426.html

28-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: FIR against ex-member of bank panel quashed||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently quashed and set aside the first information report (FIR) registered against a former managing committee member of a cooperative bank in Nagpur after it was informed that the loss that the member had caused to the bank by disbursing loans without security, had occurred before the Maharashtra Protection of Investors Deposit (MPID) Act, 1999 came into force. The court also took cognisance of the fact that the loans amounting to nearly ₹145 crores disbursed with his approval, had been recovered.On February 10, a division bench of justice Z Haq and justice Amit Borkar, while hearing the petition filed by Rajiv Mishra, was informed by advocate Shyam Dewani that his client was a managing committee member of Samata Sahakari Cooperative Bank from 1997 to December 2000. In that period he had attended several managing committee meetings wherein it was alleged that he had approved disbursal of loans without security, which had resulted in a loss to the bank.The complaint against Mishra and other managing committee members was lodged after depositors complained that the bank had allegedly defaulted in returning their deposits on maturity without benefits. The complaint was lodged in November 2007 on the allegations that the depositors’ money had been misappropriated by the members between 1997 and 2006 to the tune of ₹145 crore.While arguing, Dewani submitted that Mishra had attended meetings between July 1997 and January 1999 and had resigned in December 2000. However, since the complaint was lodged, the properties of Mishra had been attached under relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act. Dewani further submitted that as per the charge sheet all the loans mentioned therein had been disbursed before the MPID Act came into force. In light of these submissions, Dewani sought quashing of the FIR and charge sheet against Mishra.Additional public prosecutor TA Mirza, however, opposed the petition stating that the ingredients of FIR and charge sheet against Mishra were fulfilled as he had connived with other managing committee members to cause huge losses to the bank and hence the court should not interfere.After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “The date of offences alleged against the petitioner are before coming into force of the Act of 1999 i.e. 29th April 1999. Since the alleged offences are committed before coming into force of the Act of 1999, the petitioner cannot be charged for the offences under sections 3 and 4 of the Act of 1999.”While quashing the FIR and charge sheet against Mishra the court held, “In the facts of the present case also, there is nothing to show that Samata Sahakari Cooperative Bank i.e. the Financial Establishment committed “Fraudulent Default” in repayment of any deposit on maturity along with any benefit till March 31, 2000.” The court also noted that as the concerned officer had stated that there was no offence under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code against Mishra, the petition was allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fir-against-ex-member-of-bank-panel-quashed-101614535758305.html
28-02-2021||Other||50.86% vote in bypolls to 5 municipal wards||New Delhi: An estimated 50.86% electorate voted on Sunday in the bypolls to five municipal wards that were touted as a precursor to the civic polls scheduled next year.Of the five wards, Kalyanpuri (under East Delhi Municipal Corporation) recorded the highest voter turnout at 59.72% and Shalimar Bagh (under North corporation) the lowest at 42.36%. Though the outcome of the bypolls will not alter the composition of the two municipal corporations, those who came out to vote said that they have voted for change and development of their ward. The Bharatiya Janata Party rules the three municipal corporation with a comfortable majority.The by-elections were also held in Chauhan Banger (041E) and Trilokpuri (02E) and Rohini-C wards.State election commissioner SK Srivastava said, “The voter turnout in the bypolls was good. The turnout in East corporation wards was more than the wards (Shalimar Bagh and Rohini-C) in North corporation. The three East corporation wards saw 56.92% voting whereas just 44.95% polling was reported from the North corporation wards.”This was the first election in the Capital to be held during the pandemic so the state election commission has made elaborate arrangements with dedicated waiting rooms, staff with PPE kits etc to allow Covid-19 positive patients to exercise their franchise.Thermal screening of voters, hand sanitisation was a common practice witnessed across all polling booths. Arrangements of masks were also made for those who reached polling centres without masks. At some polling stations authorities were also seen distributing polythene gloves to voters to cast their vote. “The last one hour (4.30 pm to 5.30 pm) was kept for Covid patients, but no one came to cast their vote,” said Srivastava. The result will be declared on March 3.For the residents of Kalyanpuri, a densely populated area with a large number of slum clusters and unauthroised colonies, garbage disposal, lack of streetlights, etc were among the key concerns that led them to the polling booths.“Garbage disposal and lack of street lights is a main problem in the area. So, instead of blindly following any particular party, this time I have voted for development,” Satish Kumar, a resident of Kalyanpuri said after exercising his franchise.The BJP is facing a litmus test Shalimar Bagh, which is considered the party’s stronghold. Of the five wards, this is the only ward which BJP won in 2017. ““These bypolls will show strengths and weaknesses of main three political parties before the 2021 local body elections. There had been no development on local level. There are hundreds of dark spots in the ward as street lights at those places are yet to be fixed. Many times we have reported to local leaders but to no avail,” Karan Singh, a voter and a resident of Shalimar Bagh pocket-D, said after casting his vote.Bypoll was necessitated in Shalimar Bagh after the death of sitting BJP councillor Renu Jaju. The contest here is between Jaju’s daughter-in-law, Surabhi Jaju, AAP’s Sunita Mishra, AAP’s poorvanchali face in the region, and Congress party worker Mamta.As people voted local issues such as sanitation, which they say has worsened in the past few months due to frequent strikes by staff over non-payment of salaries, and area development, the three main political parties say that it will help them gauge the public mood ahead of civic polls next year. Political parties admit that the outcome of the bypolls will set the tone for municipal elections scheduled early next year. The ongoing tussle between AAP, the ruling party in Delhi, and BJP, which has been ruling the three municipal corporations for the past 14 years, over the municipal funding and financial mismanagement is going to be the key issue in the bypolls.In 2017, the BJP has won 181 seats, while AAP and Congress won 48 and 30 seats respectively. The three main political parties said the have already started preparations for the polls.Of the five wards, the AAP won Kalyanpuri, Chauhan Banger and Trilokpuri in 2017. Rohini-C ward is also AAP’s stronghold as the former councillor joined the party just before the assembly elections last year and is now a party MLA from Bawana.Sanitation topped the priority list for people in Trilokpuri ward. Dinesh Valmiki, a local resident, said the civic body has “failed” on the front of local development. “Salaries of municipal employees are not being paid so they go on strike and ultimately the public has to suffer. Sanitation and lack of proper drainage system are major issues being faced by the residents here,” Valmiki said while waiting in a queue to cast his vote.Voting in Trilokpuri ward also saw minor scuffle between volunteers of the AAP and the BJP over the issue of setting up tables near one of the polling centres. The matter was resolved soon.In Rohini-C, Kalyanpuri and Trilokpuri wards, women voters came out in good numbers to exercise their franchise. In Chauhan Banger ward, located close to Jafrabad Metro station, broken roads, lack of drainage, encroachment on pavements and roads were issues on which people voted.The BJP fielded senior party worker Mohammad Nazir Ansari from the ward while the AAP candidate was former Seelampur MLA Mohammad Ishraq Khan. The Congress fielded its youth wing leader Zubair Ahmad, son of former Seelampur MLA Mateen Ahmad.“There are a number of issues here as the area is among one of the most backward wards. Lack of proper drainage system, dug up lanes, encroachment and lack of sanitation services are among main issues here. In this bypoll, we have voted keeping in view the local area development,” said Asma Khatoon, who had come to vote with her husband.In Rohini-C ward BJP’s Rakesh Goel is pitted against AAP’s former Bawana MLA Ram Chander. The Congress candidate from the ward is ex-councillor Memwati Barwala.Rohini-C ward, which falls under Bawana constituency, saw a good number of women voters. “Local area development is our priority. Lack of street lights is a major problem in the region. It poses a security threat especially for women in the area. Dirty water supply is another issue here,” Sarita Goyal, a voter and resident of Prahlad Vihar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5086-vote-in-bypolls-to-5-municipal-wards-101614535756957.html

Locals alleged that the spot is barely 50 metres away from a police post, which often remains unmanned, because of which the snatcher managed to escape on Saturday.Rajini Babbar, a resident of lane number 10, said that every 5-10 days they hear of a similar crime in the area. “The fact that Simran was targeted right in front of her house is very scary. It reflects that the criminals have no fear of entering residential areas to commit a crime,” she said.General secretary of Adarsh Nagar Green residents welfare association, SN Singhal, also said that police presence in the area is insufficient, which encouraged criminal activities.“Almost every evening, anti-social elements gather in parks in the area and create nuisance, making it difficult for locals, specially women and girls, to even walk through the areas. When we call the police, they send a policeman who takes a round of the area and goes back. The SHO has been made aware of these problems repeatedly, but nothing was done. We are waiting for more similar incidents to happen. Today, I’ve written a letter to the area DCP, senior officers and other concerned people, requesting strict action in this regard,” Singhal said.Another woman, who lives in the same area but wished not to be named, said that the lane in which their houses are located, has gates but they are closed only late night around 11-11.30pm. “The road outside is a busy one, with shops on both sides. Who would think that an outsider can attack you in your own residential neighbourhood in front of so many people? This is very shocking,” she said.Simran’s cousin, Taranjit Singh, who also lives in the same neighbourhood, said the residential locality has often reported snatching and robbery incidents. “Police presence during the night is sparse, which encourages such street crimes,” he said.The municipal councillor from Adarsh Nagar ward, Garima Gupta said that she has told the station house officer of Adarsh Nagar police station repeatedly to step up patrolling in the area during night time at least. “There is also a police post less than 50 metres from the spot of crime, which should always remain manned. So far there has been no serious action on such requests,” said Gupta, who had visited the spot.Deepak Tiwari, the security guard who witnessed the attack on Simran, also recalls how he had a face-off with two thieves around 8-9 months ago. “I had caught them trying to enter a house in the same area. I attempted to catch the duo, but they threw stones at me. I chased them, but they managed to escape,” he said.When asked about the allegations by the local residents regarding the law and order in the area, joint commissioner of police (northern range) SS Yadav refused to comment.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani also did not respond to multiple calls and text messages sent by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/feel-unsafe-in-our-own-neighbourhood-say-locals-after-adarsh-nagar-snatching-101614535696850.html

28-02-2021||Delhi||25-year-old stabbed while fending off snatching bid in Adarsh Nagar, dies||New Delhi: A 25-year-old woman was stabbed to death when she fought back against a snatcher in north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar on Saturday night. A CCTV footage of the incident, which was widely shared on social media on Sunday, shows the attacker first lunging at the chain of the woman, identified as Simran Kaur, as she is returning home from a nearby market with her mother and two-year-old daughter. Simran, however, immediately fights back, catching the snatcher off-guard and forcing him to retreat. As the snatcher flees, he fishes out a knife and stabs Simran multiple times, before escaping with an accomplice waiting on a scooter nearby. A security guard, on duty in the area, is also seen in the footage chasing the man on foot. Simran later collapsed just a few feet away from her house due to blood loss in front of her two-year-old. Police said they have arrested two men from Jahangirpuri for the murder.In Delhi, snatching cases had gone up by 27.11% in 2020 when compared to the previous year, data released by Delhi Police, during their annual press conference earlier this month showed. A snatching occurs in Delhi every 1 hour 6 minutes, the police data showed.According to investigators, Saturday’s incident took place between 9pm and 9.15pm when Simran — who lives with her husband in Patiala and had been in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar visiting her parents — was returning from a local flea market. Eyewitnesses and local residents said when Simran and her mother Mamta Kaur entered lane number seven from Rajan Babu Road, to reach their home, the snatcher approached them from behind.A police officer, who wished not to be named, said it has been established during initial probe that the man extended his arm to grab Simran’s chain or valuables, immediately alerting her and making her turn around. “Her two-year-old daughter, whom she was carrying in her arms, fell on the road as Simran lost balance while trying to fight back. The snatcher also fell while trying to flee. Seeing himself trapped, the man got up and stabbed Simran twice in her chest with a knife and managed to run away,” the officer said.The CCTV then shows Simran picking up her daughter again. However, she collapsed just a few seconds later, right in front of her parents house.The security guard, Deepak Tiwari, who was on duty at the time of the incident, said he was on the other end of the lane where Simran’s parent’s house is located. “It was roughly around 9.10pm when I heard her cry for help. I saw a man was attacking her and I chased after him. However, he jumped on a scooter, on which his accomplice was waiting, and they sped away. I could not see his face or note down the scooter’s registration number,” said Tiwari, who has been working in the area as a security guard for the last two-and-a-half years.Simran was rushed to Fortis Hospital in Shalimar Bagh, where she died during treatment. The crime was reported to the police around 9.45pm. On Sunday evening, deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani in a statement said that multiple teams were formed to arrest the accused and following multiple raids, the two men – Fardeen,19, and Aqibul, 22, both residents of Jahangirpuri — were arrested. The weapon used in Simran’s murder and the scooter that the men had used to flee the spot, were recovered following their arrests, the statement said. A Special Investigations Team (SIT) has also been formed to further probe the incident. On one side of the spot where Simran was killed, is her brother’s photo studio and on the other side is here father Daler Singh’s house, both less than 20 metres away from the spot where she collapsed .Local residents said there is also a police booth which is fifty metres away from the spot but mostly remains unmanned.Simran’s cousin, Taranjit Singh, 20, who lives in the same neighbourhood said the incident was unfortunate and tragic. “I got a call late night informing that she had to be rushed to hospital. When I reached hospital, she was in the operation theatre, where she succumbed,” Singh said.When contacted, deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani did not respond to calls and text messages.Delhi police also tweeted on Sunday, “Two arrested for murder of a young woman, committed in desperate attempt of snatching in Adarsh Ngr. Reaffirming our commitment to #ZeroTolerance to crime for safety & security of citizens, @DelhiPolice dedicated to swift & professional investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/25yearold-stabbed-while-fending-off-snatching-bid-in-adarsh-nagar-dies-101614535458256.html
28-02-2021||Other||Pandemic prompts the elderly to make a digital switch||New DelhiIt is 11am on Friday and a digital literacy class has just begun on video communication platform Zoom. The learners — senior citizens aged 60 to 80 — are listening to the trainer, rapt; some are fervently jotting down notes. The first topic of the 15-day workshop is how to make a conference call on a smartphone. After 15 minutes of instructions, the participants are asked to make a conference call. Some flounder, but the faces of those who succeed brim with pride and amazement. “I did not know how to use this feature on my phone, though I needed it to connect with my family and friends. It is so easy,” says Om Prakash Goyal, 65, one of the most enthusiastic learners in the class, who took copious notes throughout the lesson. “But my prime objective is to learn how to book a doctors’ appointment, order medicines, and do banking online. The pandemic has made it necessary, ” says Goyal, a retired government engineer, who lives in Paschim Vihar. India has about 104 million people aged above 60 — just a shade below China —according to the 2011 Census. But digital inclusion has been a distant dream for them. The government’s National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) aims to empower at least one person per household. It, however, does not accord any priority to senior citizens. According to a survey by Agewell Foundation, an NGO, in 2018, among senior citizens in Delhi-NCR, around 86% of the 5,000 respondents were found to be digitally illiterate. But the pandemic has led to an exponential demand for digital skills among them, with senior citizens aged 60 to 85, turning to online workshops organised by NGOs, startups, volunteer groups. The lessons in these workshops, include smartphone use, digital payments, e-banking, e-shopping, booking an appointment with doctors online, using cab-hailing apps, and monitoring health through apps. “We get about 100 calls a day compared to 10 before the pandemic for our classes for seniors. Many of them are well-to-do and own expensive smartphones, but are unable to use them. Most say their children do not have time and patience to teach them digital skills,” says Himanshu Rath, founder, Agewell Foundation, which provides free online digital literacy classes for senior citizens. His organization’s digital training calendar is packed for the next few months. Santosh Kaul Ogra, 69, who coordinates with NGOs for digital literacy classes on behalf of many RWAs in Delhi, says that these days he is flooded with demands from senior citizens wanting to attend digital literacy workshops. “Their biggest concern is how to live with dignity during their old age,” says Ogra. “During pandemic they realized that the mobile phone is a powerful device, which they can use for information, entertainment, online transactions and connecting with friends and families.” Kusum Gupta, 77, from Saket, attended a digital literacy class last year. The skills she learnt, she says, are coming quite handy. These days, at 6am, she and her friends attend a yoga class on Zoom. “We are a group of about 20. Before the pandemic, we used to do yoga in the neighbourhood park but now, we do it online. Technology helped me remain connected with friends in these tough times of social distancing,” says Gupta. “My friends say I am quite a tech pro. I watch news, movies, listen to music on YouTube. But technology can help only if you don’t have any hearing or eyesight problems.” Earlier this week, Sushil Bawa, 70, a retired teacher in Rohini, decided to junk her paper diary for a calendar app. She is currently attending a digital literacy workshop. “Now I will use only my phone to get alerts about birthdays, anniversaries of my friends and family.I am also learning how to edit photos, make a photo collage to send personalized wishes to them on special occasions. It keeps me engaged,” says Bawa. Rajkumar Prajapati, 25, a digital trainer at Agewell Foundation, says, “Patience is the key while training elderly as you have to repeat things.” The questions he frequently faces include what is the difference between Chrome and Google; how can one look slimmer in photos, do Google Maps always give the right directions? Shreya Bajaj, 30, who in July launched Easy Hai, an initiative to impart digital skills to the elderly with her sister Surbhi, says demand for her Zoom sessions continues to grow. She charges ₹200 per session and organizes two sessions every day. “So far I have taught digital skills to over 5,000 people. During the lockdown, elderly members in my family struggled with technology. That is how this initiative was born. I have realized that every senior has his or her own digital competency level,” says Bangalore-based Shreya. “Initially, our participants were from Bangalore only; now they are also from Delhi, Chandigarh, Pune, Udaipur, Raipur.” Sonali Sharma, head, advocacy and elderly empowerment, HelpAge India, another NGO, which provides free digital training to seniors all across the country, says that of all the workshops her organization conducts for seniors, the digital training one is the most popular. “Demand for our digital classes is the highest in Hyderabad and Chennai, followed by Delhi. Most of our members are well- educated, middle-class senior citizens, wanting to use technology to live independent lives.” Agrees Saumyajit Roy, co-founder and CEO, Emoha Elder Care, a company that provides elderly care services, “Earlier, seniors who are our members, were quite hesitant about video calls and ordering things online. Now they feel it is better to acquire digital skills for their own safety and security. The pandemic has proved to be a catalyst for digital empowerment of the elderly.” Savita Verma, 64, has taken it upon herself to teach digital skills to her husband. “ I attend the class in the morning and take notes. In the evening, I teach him whatever I learn . I feel empowered and in control of my life, thanks to my newly acquired digital skills. It is really amazing how a smartphone can change your life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pandemic-prompts-the-elderly-to-make-a-digital-switch-101614535397573.html

28-02-2021||Gurugram||Students demand protection of Aravallis, withdrawal of amendment to land act||Students of classes 11 and 12 on Sunday held a demonstration, seeking protection for the Aravallis and demanding the withdrawal of laws aimed at amending the protection afforded to the Aravallis. The protest was held from 6.30pm to 8.30pm at Galleria Market in DLF Phase-4.“In your plans I cannot see any living beauty, I see mountains of trash higher than the Aravallis… I need trees, not toxic energy, because, I cannot breathe…,” recited by a 16-year-old during the protest, referring to the Haryana government’s amendment to the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA).Anushka, another 16-year-old who was protesting at the market on Sunday evening, said, “Aravallis are the green lungs, climate regulator, water recharge zone and shield against desertification of Delhi-NCR. We need to save the Aravallis for a better future.”Environmentalists echoed these sentiments and said they are awaiting the withdrawal of the amendment by the state government, as it puts 33% of the state’s forest cover at risk.Lt. Col (Retd) Sarvadaman Oberoi, a city-based environmentalist and activist said, “It’s a shame that Haryana, with the lowest forest cover in the country, tried to get rid of the PLPA act with an amendment retrospective to 1966. Fortunately, the Supreme Court stayed the amendments from coming into effect. We are hopeful that the government which protected the Mangar Bani sacred grove in 2016 will take concrete steps to protect the Aravallis of south Haryana for future generations of humans and future generations of wildlife.”The state government’s amendment to the PLPA on February 27, 2019, was stayed by the Supreme Court in March 2019, but in July 2019, the governor had approved the bill. However, the amendment is yet to be notified.VS Tanwar, the principal chief conservator of forests, Haryana forest department, said, “There has been no development or movement in the PLPA amendment case so far, since the matter was stayed by the Supreme Court. The orders of the apex court are still enforced.”On March 1, 2019, the Supreme Court had expressed concern over the bill, in a hearing related to the Kant Enclave judgment, and stated, “In order to get rid of this order, the state of Haryana has made certain amendments in Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, by virtue of that they are permitting construction in the forest area and PLPA region also [sic].”The apex court also warned the state government against enacting the legislation without the court’s permission. The bill passed by the state cabinet removes legal ‘forest’ status for about 60,000 acres of Aravalli land in the state.The law in discussion dates back to the 1900s, which was passed to protect common forest land from being bought under agriculture. In Haryana, the PLPA extends protection to forests and trees on private lands, community lands, panchayat and municipal lands in the uncultivable hills of the Aravallis in the south and Shiwaliks in the northern parts of the state.The PLPA act has two major types of provisions — regional notifications under General Section 4 of PLPA that cover entire districts and merely restrict tree felling (equivalent to a tree preservation rule), and Khasra (plot) number specific notifications, under Special Section 4 and Section 5 of the PLPA that extends protection against land use change to certain specified Aravalli areas, forests and trees. These may be community (shamlat) lands, panchayat, municipal lands, or private lands. The PLPA area under Special sections 4 and 5 approximately cover 30,000 hectares, around 33% of the effective forest land in Haryana.According to directives of the Supreme Court, the PLPA attracts protection under the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which states that “no state government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the central government, any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose.”Neelam Ahluwalia, a city-based environmentalist associated with the Aravalli Bachao Citizens Movement that has been demanding the withdrawal of the amendment for two years, said, “A total of 33% of Haryana’s measly 3.62% forest cover is at stake, which amounts to 74,000 acres of land, out of which 60,000 acres are in the Aravallis around Gurugram, Faridabad and south Haryana.”She further said that if the PLPA amendment bill is notified, it can have “disastrous consequences for our air quality, groundwater, and Gurugram and National Capital Region will turn into a desert.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/students-demand-protection-of-aravallis-withdrawal-of-amendment-to-land-act-101614533418512.html
28-02-2021||Gurugram||Stage set for Phase 3 of vaccinations in Gurugram||The third phase of Covid-19 vaccinations is set to begin at 20 session sites in Gurugram on Monday, said health department officials. Officials said that 10 of these sites would be set up at government hospitals and public health centres, while 10 others have been designated at government empanelled private hospitals. On Monday only walk-ins will be allowed for people who are older than 60 years and above and those above 45 years with co-morbidities, said health department officials. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that the vaccination at session sites will start from noon and that only walk-ins are expected as the registration on the Co-Win 2.0 portal will start at 9am on Monday. “On the first day, 40 doses per session site will be allowed for eligible beneficiaries, while 60 will be meant for health workers who will be taking their second vaccine shot,” said Yadav, adding that health department is geared up to ensure hassle-free vaccination for the general population from Monday. Yadav also said that the health department is looking at the third phase on Monday as a soft launch, expecting to vaccinate around 2,000 beneficiaries, which will later be expanded to cover a larger number of beneficiaries as the pace of online registrations pick up. Residents across the state can access the registration through www.cowin.gov.in for the third phase, which will be inaugurated by Haryana health minister Anil Vij through video conferencing on Monday, said a government statement.To ease the process of registration and enable beneficiaries to get vaccinated without much hassle, the union health ministry on Sunday stated that people can get registered through their mobile phones and four persons can register themselves on a single mobile number. However, all the registrants will have to carry their identity cards — Aadhaar card/letter, electoral photo card, passport, driving licence, PAN card, NPR Smart Card or pension document with photograph.State health minister Anil Vij on Sunday said that the vaccine will be administered free of cost at government hospitals and will be administered at a cost of ₹250 at government empanelled private hospitals. Vij said that all efforts are being made to ensure a smooth roll-out of vaccination for the third phase.Sharing details of phase three of the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, additional chief secretary (health), Rajeev Arora, said that beneficiaries with co-morbidities will have to get a certificate regarding the co-morbidity from a government or privately registered medical practitioner to qualify as a vaccine beneficiary.Arora said that the beneficiaries can approach any government-run Covid vaccine centres and get the vaccine administered free of cost or can register themselves on the Co-WIN portal or Aarogya Setu application.For the online registration for the vaccine, Arora said that the beneficiary can specify the date, time and vaccination centre where he/she would like to get the vaccine administered and then visit the centre on the specified date. The beneficiary should carry a photo ID and a certificate of co-morbidity.Meanwhile, on Sunday, 56 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the district, with around 3,007 RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests conducted in the last 24 hours. On Saturday, 62 persons had tested positive for Covid-19, while 3,468 tests were conducted by the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/stage-set-for-phase-3-of-vaccinations-in-gurugram-101614533417832.html
28-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG to acquire 100-metre hydraulic ladder for fire safety||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has approved a proposal by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to use its funds to procure a 100-metre hydraulic ladder for the city on a priority basis.In a city of over 1,200 high-rises, the Gurugram fire department only has a solitary 42-metre fire ladder capable of reaching only the fourteenth floor of a building. Gurugram has several skyscrapers measuring around 175 metres.As per IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety office (ADFSO), the Haryana government, earlier this month, had given approval to procure five 42-metre fire ladders for Gurugram when a state-level discussion was held on fire preparedness for all the districts in Haryana.Following the intervention of the Haryana CM, it was altered to a 100-metre fire ladder.In Gurugram, the local fire department comes under the ambit of the MCG.“The Haryana CM has authorised MCG to procure a 100-metre fire ladder using its own funds. Earlier, the proposal from the government’s own side was for authorising the procurement of only five hydraulic platforms for the city. The government has given such an approval exclusively for Gurugram,” said Kashyap.Kashyap added that such a ladder is only manufactured by a Finland-based company and it would cost around ₹30 crore to purchase.Kashyap said that although a private developer has a fire ladder equipped to reach such heights and can be called upon in case of an emergency the time spent in coordination can lead to a massive delay.“Although we have an understanding with all private firms in the district for helping each other out during any fire, we cannot afford to both spend time and rely on anyone else for procuring a 100-metre ladder as it can lead to a considerable delay in dousing or rescue operations. We need it readily available and hence, it is required on an urgent basis,” said Kashyap.The fire department’s demand for a 100-metre ladder has been pending since 2008. In last year’s state budget, Khattar had announced that all of Haryana’s municipal corporations, including MCG, will each get new fire ladders.“Saving lives and bettering the lives of citizens have always been MCG’s priority. All necessary procedures have been initiated to procure a new fire ladder and strengthen the local fire department,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Kashyap said that although the MCG’s funds will be used for the procurement of the ladder, the paperwork and other formalities for approaching the Finland-based company will be done through the Haryana directorate of supplies and disposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-acquire-100-metre-hydraulic-ladder-for-fire-safety-101614533417192.html

The GMDA had earlier set a deadline of March 2021, which got delayed due to the lockdown imposed by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. The authority has now set a deadline of June 30 and has directed implementing agencies to expedite work on the two structures. Jitendra Mittal, chief engineer (infrastructure), GMDA said, “We are aiming to complete the project by June-end and make the flyover and underpass fully functional from the beginning of July. Once the project is complete, it will help reduce traffic congestion at Huda City Centre, which witnesses heavy footfall due to the Metro connectivity to different parts of NCR.” Earlier, during the seventh meeting of GMDA in December 2020, the authority had stated in its agenda that the construction of the 270-metre flyover, the 735-metre underpass from Signature Road to Subhash Chowk, along with service roads and drainage work was being undertaken as part of a larger project. The work for the project started in February 2019 and is estimated to cost approximately ₹52.52 crore. The agenda, a copy of which was accessed by HT, states, “The flyover portion is 83% complete. The progress of civil works achieved is 41%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/flyover-underpass-at-huda-city-centre-to-be-operational-in-july-101614533416639.html
28-02-2021||Gurugram||Schools across Haryana to reopen for students of classes 1 and 2||Schools across the state will reopen for in-person classroom sessions for students of classes 1 and 2 from Monday onwards, nearly a year after they were closed across the country amid Covid-19 outbreak in March last year. Online classes for students who wish to continue to with remote learning will also continue and they will neither be bound to attend classroom sessions nor will their names be struck off the school roll, as per the SOP(standard operating procedure) issued by the education department earlier this week. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that the school will become fully operational with classes starting for classes 1 and 2. “Children in these grades will be returning to school after one whole year. Resumption of in-person sessions will give teachers the chance to provide more robust support to students, many of whom are not being able to keep up with online classes,” said Sharma. She added that the school had been in touch with parents and was expecting a good turnout on Monday. “We are taking necessary measures in view of the pandemic and expect children to return back to classrooms safely,” said Sharma. Schools across the country were closed in March last year amid the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Voluntary visits to schools in Haryana for doubt-clearing sessions were allowed from September onwards, followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. Schools were reopened for students in classes 6 to 8 on February 1 and classes 3 to 5 on February 24. As per the government directive, both government and private schools will be allowed to conduct classes of three-and-a-half-hour duration from 10am till 1.30pm for students in these classes. Students are also required to produce a parental consent letter. The directive also mentioned that cooked meals will not be provided in schools; instead dry ration will be provided. Most private schools said that parents were not willing to send children to school for in-person classroom sessions yet. Anita Malhotra, principal of Lotus Valley International School, said that the school had sought feedback from parents but there were not many takers for offline classes. “We had sought feedback from parents but most of them are not ready to send children to school yet. We will continue with online classes for now,” said Malhotra. She, however, added that the school might initiate classes from the new academic session in April. “When the school reopens in the new session, we might start with offline classes in batches. All these decisions will be taken while taking into cognisance of the evolving Covid-19 situation,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/schools-across-haryana-to-reopen-for-students-of-classes-1-and-2-101614533357812.html

28-02-2021||Gurugram||DHBVN officials assaulted by families in Gadoli village||The police on Saturday booked two families for allegedly assaulting and threatening officials of Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) in village Gadoli in Sector 10. The police said a team of DHBVN officials who went to check for electricity theft were assaulted by the families. According to the police, the suspects, Tilak Raj and Hukum Chand, were present at their houses and asked their wives to lock the gates when the officials reached the spot.Junior engineer Ram Bahadur, along with staff member Ravinder Kumar, went to check for electricity theft in Hukum Chand’s two-storey house in village Gadoli. “Chand has been drawing electricity directly from the electric pole by fixing two wires. Although, he had installed sub-meters for his tenants but there was no main meter. We clicked pictures and videographed the spot,” said Nathuram, sub-divisional officer (SDO) of DHBVN, adding that the officials are being treated for their injuries. He alleged that Hukum refused to cooperate with the officials, following which they went to another house to check for power theft.

Pramodji (Pramod Baitha), a native of Bettiah, was a technician at a factory manufacturing LED bulbs in Delhi. He understood the whole processes minutely while working there. But during the pandemic, he had to return to his native place. He himself started a small manufacturing unit,” said the PM in 74th edition of ‘Mann ki Baat’ . “He took along a team of local youths and achieved the journey from a factory worker to a factory owner in a few months,” said the PM. Baitha, a resident of Majhauliya block in West Champaran who was a migrant labourer till last year, utilised Covid as opportunity to turn into an entrepreneur after he set up the LED bulb manufacturing unit at his village. “This decision to set up the unit was not an easy one. For past 10 years, I have worked for different factories in Delhi, keeping my heart and soul together,” said Baitha, who started his unit in May last year with his hard earned money. Within the few months after setting up of the unit, the unit started to get good response.“Encouraged by the response, we procured some other equipment. Yet we are unable to meet all the demands owing to crunch in capital. Against the requirement of 10,000 LED bulbs, we are supplying 1,000 only. We will certainly be able to produce more, if we receive any assistance from government,” Baitha, who has engaged eight people at his manufacturing unit. “There is no reason to move outside our native place in search of work when we are earning between ₹400 and ₹500 every day here only,” said Rohit Kumar, a labourer at the factory. Baitha has been procuring raw materials from Delhi and other parts of Uttar Pradesh. “We also repair the fused bulbs at the unit,” he added.West Champaran recorded a footfall 84,019 migrants, above 18 years, following an ease in the nationwide lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.

The state power department has started a 100-day programme for strengthening infrastructure paving the way for uninterrupted power supply as per schedule, during forthcoming summer, the minister added. Nodal officers have been appointed to ensure that the plan is implemented in letter and spirit ensuring 18-hour power supply in rural areas, 20 hours at Tehsil headquarters and 24 hours in city areas.

Writing practice for the students is important,” added Gaikwad.The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education has declared the detailed time- table of the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations. The SSC exams are to be held between April 29 and May 20 and schools had planned the preliminary examinations accordingly. The preliminary examinations are considered as the final practice for the board examinations. This year, when most of the teaching has been conducted online, preliminary examinations has become important for students in terms of writing practice. “Throughout the year we have had online exams and most of them were multiple choice questions (MCQs). Prelims are necessary in order to get the experience before the board examination. Our prelims were scheduled to begin from March 8, but now schools will be closed I am not sure what the plan will be. When writing exams at home there are disturbances and manipulations. It’s a very different scenario from the board exam,” said Arya Dhanawade, an SSC student of the Rosary School in Warje. As the schools will remain closed till March 14, now schools are contemplating ways to conduct this examination. “Our syllabus is almost complete. Revision of some subjects is going on. We had planned a preliminary examination about March 15. If schools do not open by then, then it will be a problem. We have been conducting online classes, but the problem is, not all the students join in”, said Prachi Gumaste headmistress, Nutan Marathi Vidyalay. “We will begin the prelims from March 1, as per schedule, but we will conduct it online,” said Fr Rajesh Bansode, St Joseph’s School in Ghorpadi. “Luckily we completed the written preliminary examination for Class 10 on campus before schools closed from February 22. During the process of this test students realised which points and skills they need to work on. We have resumed online classes for Class 10 students. We don’t want them to be on their own during these uncertain times. We want students to get back into the academic routine again,” said Pallavi Naik, principal, Kalmadi high school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ssc-preliminary-exam-schedule-goes-for-a-toss-with-school-closures-101614522675675.html
28-02-2021||Dehradun||Akhadas, seers oppose Uttarakhand govt’s fresh Mahakumbh SoP on Covid-19||The latest standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the Uttarakhand government’s disaster management department have not gone down well with Akhadas, seers, local priests and the trader fraternity.The Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad has termed the restrictions as 'stern measures'. The SOPs include mandatory registration at government portals, negative Covid-19 report (not more than 72 hours old), e-pass allocation for pilgrims, among others. Stern legal action against violators will be initiated under the Disaster Management Act and Covid-19 regulations, as per the SOPs.Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri questioned the necessity of bringing in such measures for the Haridwar Mahakumbh when no such SoPs and restrictions were in place during the Magh Mela in Prayagraj and at Vrindavan fair.Also read: 6 states contributed to 86.37% of new Covid-19 cases, says govt"How under the umbrella of such stern restrictions, protocols and procedures a grand Kumbh can be organised? In name of fear of corona or safety measures, undue restrictions should not be put in place. Though the government has assured of conducting grand Kumbh fair, we urge it to ease restrictions as Covid-19 transmission has slowed down in the recent months and vaccination is also being done," said Narendra Giri.Shri Mahant Rajendra Das, president of Akhil Bharatiya Shri Panch Nirmohi Akhada, expressed displeasure over the delay in making arrangements for seers from other states, particularly Khalsa seers who are now heading for Haridwar Kumbh after completion of the Vrindavan fair.Akhada Parishad has also objected to the proposed one-month-long Mahakunbh 2021 instead of the earlier announced 60 days of Kumbh."Normally, every Kumbh is at least 4 months long in Haridwar but this time, the state government has shortened the duration to just a month. The government has shown no regard to saints, local priests and the trader community. It seems the government is not interested in organising Kumbh fair in reality while on paper it claims to organise a grand Kumbh," said former CM Harish Rawat after attending a religious event at Pathri village.Hindu Jagran Manch activists also met Shankaracharya Jagadguru Raj Rajeshwarashram at his Kankhal-based ashram and expressed their displeasure over the restrictions on Kumbh-bound pilgrims and saints."We are generating awareness among saints as well as the masses regarding the need to adhere to Covid-preventive measures. Negative Covid report conducted within 72 hours of the arrival of pilgrims and seers is mandatory as per the SoP," said Haridwar chief medical officer Dr SK Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/akhadas-seers-oppose-uttarakhand-govt-s-fresh-mahakumbh-sop-on-covid19-101614519910296.html

It requires all the intelligence and resources from all countries across the globe. It will be built in two places in Australia and South Africa. All the radio astronomers are a part of this,” said Gupta.He further added that radio astronomy is the emission that comes from celestial objects like the sun, stars, and clouds, among other objects. “Radio astronomy studies celestial objects at radio wavelength. The radiations that we study come to us due to different events. It is like we map one object through different ways to understand its origin, age and composition. Scientists have won the Nobel Prize by contributing on various interesting aspects of the subject,” added Gupta.In another session on the platform of Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER), Pune, Dr SG Srivatsan, associate dean of research and development at IISER Pune, spoke about “Making smart probes for the detection of Covid-19”.“If we develop diagnostics kits in India, the cost of testing kits will be much, much lower and its reach will also be more as compared to others. The Centre for cellular and molecular biology, Bengaluru, has recently launched a project of Indigenous diagnostics called Index. This project is funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, USA. IISER is also part of the project,” said SrivatsanHe added that IISER is dealing with the chemistry aspect of the project.“Index aims at the supply chain of Indian companies to make reagents and enzymes for diagnostic kits for Covid-19. We help companies maintain a high standard of diagnostic kit development so that problems can be avoided. Problems like false negatives and false positives can be completely avoided,” said Srivatsan.Along with this, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), and National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) also conducted their Science Day programs online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-institutes-ensure-science-day-stays-alive-wwith-online-sessions-101614517575113.html

28-02-2021||Delhi||One year on, LNJP corona warriors recall raging pandemic, challenges||At state-run LNJP Hospital, the nerve centre of Delhi's battle against the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, many doctors at times had to wear PPE kits for nearly 18 hours to attend to struggling patients in the sweltering heat when its first wave had hit the city and the mortuary was piled up with bodies.It's been one year since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the national capital, and daily cases and death counts have both come down significantly, and scenes of distress in the hospital's corridors and outside morgue have been replaced by talks about the ongoing vaccination.It was on March 1 that the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in the city, a few months after the "unpredictable virus" had wreaked havoc in Wuhan in China, where it was first reported globally.Rohit Datta, a businessman from east Delhi, who had returned from Italy last year, tested positive for the new virus that had left the world puzzled and in a grip of extreme fear.The world had not seen anything like this before since the Spanish Flu of 1918, and certainly not in India. As the cases began to spiral in large parts of the country, including Delhi, a nationwide lockdown was imposed late March by the government to contain the spread of the virus.While most people were practically left confined to their houses for several months and work for home became the new normal, healthcare workers faced the heavy brunt of the pandemic, as doctors, nurses, served patients day in and day out, without any weekly breaks, isolated from their family members for days, weeks or even months.Amit Anand, a 35-year-doctor at the 2,000-bed LNJP Hospital who has been on duty since the outbreak of the pandemic here, said, "It's one year of Covid in Delhi, and I also met my family back home, after a gap of one year."The Begusarai native, whose wife also holds an MBBS degree, told PTI, "I met my wife and son, now two-and-a-half years old, in Bokaro this February, and he almost didn't recognise me. The pandemic literally separated us from our families. But we have to do our job, which we have chosen, so that motivated us throughout this very tough period."LNJP Hospital, now a partial Covid-19 facility, was the first hospital to be converted into a dedicated coronavirus facility in Delhi, and soon Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH), GTB Hospital and other government hospitals were also roped in, besides reserving beds in private hospitals to treat increasing number of patients.On June 23, the national capital had reported its first wave of the infection with 3,947 cases, the highest single-day spike till then.Delhi went into a war mode, with government efforts to combat the pandemic being led by 'corona warriors' in hospitals in white lab coats and police in streets wearing khaki.Ritu Saxena, Emergency Department chief, at the hospital, which has treated a record over 11,000 COVID-19 patients till date, recalled that in June when the first wave had hit Delhi, a large number of people were dying daily and bodies would pile up beyond capacity in the mortuary."Some doctors at times had to wear PPE (personal protective equipment) kits for 18 hours in a day in harsh summer when temperature had gone above 40 degrees Celsius to attend to patients," she said.Delhi then battled the second and third waves of the pandemic in September (over 4,000 daily cases multiple times) and November respectively, the latter being the worst this year, but the city known for its resilience, soldiered on and eventually manage to surmount it.The highest single-day spike of 8,593 cases in Delhi till date was reported on November 11, while on November 19 the city recorded 131 Covid-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.Suresh Kumar, Medical Director of the LNJP Hospital and a Covid-19 survivor, says the past one year of battling the pandemic had taught "valuable lessons" to meet the challenges ahead."In this period, we also equipped ourselves with more medical infrastructure. So, we had 155 oxygen supply pipe lines in the beginning for beds, besides oxygen cylinders. We expanded it gradually to 1,000, to meet the 2,000-bed requirements. Also, we now know at least something about this virus and its behaviour," he told PTI.As one year gets over since the outbreak of the pandemic, while deaths have reduced significantly, daily cases have shown an upsurge in the last few days.Delhi recorded 243 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, while three fresh fatalities pushed the death toll to 10,909, according to data shared by the city health department.This was the fourth successive day when daily cases count have stood at the 200-mark or beyond.Delhi had recorded 94 fresh Covid-19 cases on February 16, the lowest in over nine months.Doctors on Friday warned that the numbers could go up in the coming months.While the vaccination drive which started on January 16 is currently underway, Kumar urged people to continue to wear masks and adhere to safety norms as the vaccine can only to cut the transmission of the virus.Asked what was the most memorable moment of this one year gone by, he said, "Entire period will stay with us in our memories, but feted by the government with floral showers from helicopters really touched our heart."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/one-year-on-lnjp-corona-warriors-recall-raging-pandemic-challenges-101614504356506.html
28-02-2021||Delhi||Noida metro trains 'skipping' some stations during peak hours; citizens protest||Hundreds of city dwellers are suffering due to the Aqua Line metro “skipping” 10 stations during peak hours, office bearers of residents' groups claimed on Saturday, as they held a protest against the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) here.Among the stations skipped by the metro train during the peak hours (8 am to 11 am and 5 pm to 8 pm on weekdays) are Sector 101 and Sector 50, which is dedicated to the transgender community, they said.The NMRC, which manages the Aqua Line, had started “Fast Trains” from February 8 which skip certain “low-ridership” stations during peak hours with an objective to reduce the travel time between terminus stations in Noida and Greater Noida by nine minutes.Around three dozen people, including office-bearers of residents' bodies like the Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association (NEFOWA), the Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association (NOFAA) and social activists, on Saturday staged a protest at the Sector 101 metro station, demanding a rollback of the NMRC move.The stations “skipped” during peak hours are: Sector - 50, Sector - 101, Sector - 81, Sector - 83, Sector - 143, Sector - 144, Sector - 145, Sector - 146, Sector - 147 and Sector - 148.“We need to strike a balance between convenience and speed. A nine minutes faster journey does not give any significant advantage to commuters but it definitely causes inconvenience to several commuters (whose stations are being skipped),” NOFAA president Rajiva Singh said.Citing the issues, he said many high-rise apartment residents have purchased flats keeping in mind the closeness of the metro station. There are many women commuters during peak hours, and students as well as senior citizens have to bear the brunt of this decision, he added.NEFOWA general secretary Shweta Bharti said the residents have been raising the issue for past two-three days but there has been no response from officials concerned.“Now metro does not stop at key stations like Sector 101 and Sector 50 during peak hours. There are dozens of residential societies in the vicinity of these stations where commuters are facing trouble because they have to go to other stations now,” Bharti said.She added that the problem would amplify in the coming days as schools and offices are reopening after a break due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The protestors also alleged that they were not allowed to travel from Sector 101 metro station to Sector 50 metro station by the metro where they wanted to hand over a memorandum to NMRC officials and take up the issue with them.“Our demonstration was peaceful. We would have purchased metro ticket and travelled like ordinary commuters but still we were not allowed,” Bharti claimed.There was no response immediately by the NMRC over the protest on Saturday.The Aqua Line connects Noida and Greater Noida through 21 stations, covering a distance of 29.7 km, according to officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/noida-metro-trains-skipping-some-stations-during-peak-hours-citizens-protest-101614514917950.html

28-02-2021||Other||Labs in city will now provide QR codes with RT-PCR test reports to counter fake results||PUNE Laboratories in the city will now provide QR codes with RT-PCR test reports to counter fake negative reports.Certain labs found that clients edited the Covid-19 RT-PCR reports to show a negative result, so as to meet commercial requirements.The move also comes after a requirement by the Dubai health authorities which, that passengers travelling to the UAE must have a QR code link to their original test report. Krsnaa Diagnostics currently already has this system in place. Shravan Mutha, Covid-19 manager at the laboratory chain, said, “We have already implemented the QR code system in our RTPCR reports for the past two months. The QR code take you to our portal where the patient can get the details. We have implemented it because of fake reports in market.”Abrarali Dalal, chief operating officer, Sahyadri Hospitals, said that the hospital had two cases wherein a forged report in hospital’s name was used. “In one case, the HR department of a company called us asking for a hard copy and when we checked our records, we could not find such a report. In Pune too, we found a similar case, following which we filed a complaint with the Kothrud police station. To counter such fake reports we are in the process of starting QR code based RT-PCR reports. Also we have had multiple requests from passengers wanting to go to Dubai, where such a report is required. The QR-code based report cannot be forged and also the customers will not be charged above the government-capped price for this,” Dalal said. “We do provide QR codes on the RT-PCR test results. Due to the increasing demand to provide the same, we recently made the decision to provide QR-codes for the test results across India and have been doing so since the past three days” said Dr Manish D Karekar, chief of Lab Services, Metropolis Healthcare.The government has restricted the price for RT-PCR rests at private labs at ₹850, and at ₹980 for home collection.As per the advisory issued by the Dubai health authorities on January 28, 2021, passengers travelling from India to Dubai have to carry a negative RTPCR report which is linked to a QR code. Pune has one flight to Dubai. A passenger who is to board a flight from Lohegaon airport to Dubai on Monday, on condition of anonymity, said, “I have a flight to catch Monday. I was asked to get a QR-linked RTPCR report and I enquired at many places, but didn’t get any private or government labs that give such reports. Finally, I found one private lab which has such a facility. Hopefully, I’ll get the report before the flight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/labs-in-city-will-now-provide-qr-codes-with-rt-pcr-test-reports-to-counter-fake-results-101614514935012.html
28-02-2021||Mumbai||MVA govt made strategy for no debate on performance, says Fadnavis||Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Sundayaccused the MVA government of preparing a strategy to ensure there is no debate on its performance during the budget session of the state Legislature which begins on Monday.Addressing a press conference on the eve of the 10- day budget session, Fadnavis said the BJP boycotted the meeting of the Legislature's Business Advisory Committee on February 25 since it had decided that there will be no debates and calling attention notices during the House proceedings.The state budget session is normally held for six weeks, but in view of the current Covid-19 pandemic situation, it has been curtailed.Fadnavis claimed the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA-comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) government is "directionless" and has failed on all fronts."Its single-point agenda is corruption in transfers of IAS and IPS officers," he alleged.He said the BJP will publish a booklet on "corrupt practices" in Mumbai while dealing with the C-19 pandemic.He said the state government has cancelled the customary tea party on the session's eve due to the pandemic."The political meetings of the Congress and NCP are allowed during the current situation. The Shiv Sena's show of strength is okay.Only what is not allowed is the tea party and the Shiv Jayanti celebration (wherein curbs were imposed earlier this month)," he said.Fadnavis also targeted Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rathod, who resigned as state cabinet minister on Sunday after facing flak from the opposition BJP over his name being linked to a woman's death."Despite evidence in the form of video and audio clips, there is no FIR against Rathod. I will not blame Rathod, but the higher ups for shielding him," he said, without naming anyone.The police official conducting the probe into the case should be immediately suspended, the BJP leader said.Fadnavis said NCP minister Dhananjay Munde also faced accusations from a woman. Even though the woman has withdrawn the allegations, the issue has not ended, he claimed."We are of the opinion that the proposed Shakti Act for crime against women is a farce. There is no action against ministers involved in cases of crime against women. Is the law different for ministers?" he asked.The condition of cotton and soybean farmers in the state is "extremely bad". There is no procurement of farm produceand even the loan waiver scheme is not operational as of now, he claimed.Targeting the government over complaints of high electricity bills received by consumers in the state, Fadnavis said 3.5 lakh power connections have been cut and notices for default in payment has been sent to 75 lakh consumers.The Shiv Sena, which heads the ruling alliance, talks of pride and self-respect over the issue of boundary dispute with Karnataka, but why is it not showing the same pride and self-respect over the BJP's demand for renaming Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar, Fadnavis said.Fadnavis further said he will ensure all central help to the state government in the legal battle in the Supreme Court over the Maratha quota issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-govt-made-strategy-for-no-debate-on-performance-says-fadnavis-101614514173486.html

NGT and the Supreme Court passed an order to stop work, and directed the PMC to remove debris from the floodline area, as it was creating obstacles to the natural flow of the river.However, PMC, in Koregaon Park, is constructing a new segregation centre. Interestingly, a PMC employees housing society is a stone’s throw away from the shed is being built.Former zonal commissioner Umesh Mali had warned solid waste department officials about the work going on within the floodline.Mali said, “The corporation has already set up an Avani waste compost plant and one garden shredding shed within the floodline in the burning ghat area. I took objection at the time, however, it was not considered. Now, there is another segregation shed coming up near the Avani plant. I spoke to Ajit Deshmukh, solid waste department head, one month ago. He gave me a positive response about looking into the matter. After that, he has gone on medical leave and the work is still going on.”Mali added, “Last year, the entire stretch where the work is going on was flooded. I have shared photographs with the concerned officials, but, nothing has happened till date.”Rajkumar Rajput, an official of the solid waste department, said, “I have to visit and check. However, the solid waste department hasn’t given any permission to set up a shed. For the Avani compost plan, I don’t know whether it has come in the floodline area because it was constructed earlier.”Vilas Kanade, joint municipal commissioner, with additional charge of the solid waste management department, said, “I have to check it. However, there is a chance that Swachh is constructing a shed in that area. If it is true, we will remove it.”Civic activist Vijay Kumbhar said, “In 2003, the high court had given instructions to the PMC to stop construction in floodline areas in one of the cases. However, it has not stopped. Now, the time has come to file a criminal case against the PMC over this issue.”The PMC is facing stiff opposition from residents over the setting up of garbage plants in residential areas in different parts of the city. Sus and Wadgaon Budruk garbage processing plants are recent examples of opposition from residents. Kumbar said, “It is not good to set up plants in flood-line areas. PMC cannot push citizens into danger to avoid agitation and opposition to solid waste plants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-building-garbage-shed-within-flood-line-of-mula-mutha-in-koregaon-park-alleges-ex-zonal-commissioner-101614513974968.html
28-02-2021||Mumbai||What made Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Rathod resign?||Maharashtra forest minister Sanjay Rathod resigned on Sunday after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mounted pressure on the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government calling for his sacking. Rathod, a Shiv Sena leader, was linked to the death by suicide of a 23-year-old woman in Pune. “I have given my resignation to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The way opposition is warning that they won’t allow the assembly session to function, I have distanced myself from it. I want a fair probe in the case,” Rathod said after submitting his resignation.The BJP had launched a state-wide agitation, demanding Rathod’s ouster from the state cabinet. Rathod has repeatedly denied any involvement in the suicide case.MLA, ministerRathod, 50, is a four-time Shiv Sena legislator from Digras assembly constituency in the state’s Yavatmal district. In the previous Devendra Fandnavis-led government, when the Shiv Sena was in an alliance with the BJP, Rathod served as minister of state for revenue for five years.Alleged link to woman’s suicide caseThe woman, an aspiring model and a resident of Parli Vaijanath in Beed district, died after falling from the balcony of an apartment in Pune’s Hadapsar area on February 8. Soon after her death, several photos and audio clips surfaced allegedly linking Rathod to her. Rathod did not make any public appearances for two weeks after her death. The Pune Police registered a case of accidental death and are treating the case as that of suicide. The woman’s family has not filed any complaint so far with the police.BJP’s state-wide agitationAfter the videos and photos surfaced, the BJP alleged that the Pune Police was under pressure by the state government and was not investigating the case thoroughly. The BJP’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil on Saturday announced that the party legislators will not allow the functioning of the assembly’s budget session. “If Rathod is not asked to resign before Monday and if Thackeray does not come clear on this case, we will not let the legislature function,” Patil said in a press conference.BJP leader Chitra Wagh on Saturday also questioned chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s silence on the issue adding that the Maharashtra government was shielding Rathod. “Despite substantial proof against him [Rathod], no action has been taken against him. In fact, the police have not even registered a first information report in this case. There are 45 missed calls in Rathod’s name on the victim’s phone,” Wagh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/what-made-shiv-sena-minister-sanjay-rathod-resign-101614513203912.html

28-02-2021||Other||57 transgender students enrol for SSC, HSC exams in Pune division||PUNE This year at least 57 transgender students from the Pune division will be appearing for the Class 10 and Class 12 examination.Pune division of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) tops the chart across Maharashtra.The board introduced the ‘other’ section in gender in 2019 and since then, there has been a gradual increase in students filling the forms under this section.Though the move is bold said activists, it also is a major challenge for these students.Bindumadhav Khire, director of Bindu Queer Rights Foundation, said that though the number of students is less, they represent that today’s generation is brave to have come out of the closet at this young age.“However, they are also more vulnerable than others. There is a need to counsel the students and their families and friends. To encourage more students, there should be more inclusive sensitisation of students, teachers and families,” said Khire.“Though the number reflects a hopeful trend, there still is a long way to go,” he added.Speaking about the issues of the students who enrol under the transgender section for the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and Secondary School Certificate (SSC), Disha Pinky Sheikh, member, Tritiyapanti Kalyankari Mahamandal said that students face tremendous issues.“In many cases, it is seen that many students are forced by their parents to not accept themselves as transgender while filing the forms. There is a need to counsel parents as well as the students if the number is to be increased,” said Sheikh.She further added that many students who have left their families and moved to a different city have to face the problem of accommodation.“There are no hostels for transgender students. And there are also no complaint cells where they can register their grievances. Many face differential treatment at educational institutions. These reasons deter a student from attending schools. If any schemes can help these students, they have to be on an inclusive platform. For that there has to be sensitisation of various stakeholders so that the students don’t face discrimination at any stage,” she said.She further highlighted that once the student clears Class 12, there should be a few seats reserved for them at the college level.“Transgender students can take admissions under these seats in a given time. If no students come to take the admission, then the seats can be given to other students. But having such reserved seats can encourage more from the community to complete their higher education,” said Sheikh.Dinkar Patil, chairman, MSBSHSE, said that a gradual increase in the number of transgender students is a good sign. “There is steady and slow progress in the numbers which is a positive sign. And the majority of these students have filled the forms from regular schools which is also good,” said Patil.As per the data furnished by the board, only ten transgender students, from HSC and SSC together have filled the Form 17 which is for private candidates across Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/57-transgender-students-enrol-for-ssc-hsc-exams-in-pune-division-101614512774824.html
28-02-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Rathod hands over resignation to Uddhav Thackeray||Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Rathod, facing allegations in death by suicide of a 23-year-old Pune woman, tendered his resignation to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday afternoon, Rathod said. However, the party has not made any official announcement of his resignation.Leaders aware of developments said that the forest disaster management minister, however, requested Thackeray not to accept his resignation until the inquiry is completed. Thackeray, who is also the Shiv Sena chief, was irked by Rathod’s show of strength at Pohradevi temple in Washim earlier this week."I have submitted my resignation to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray," Rathod told reporters outside Varsha, the official residence of the CM."Till the inquiry is conducted I have stepped down. There was politics being played out on the issue; the manner in which the opposition said they will not let proceedings happen, therefore I have stepped down. I want a fair inquiry to be conducted and the truth to come out," Rathod added after resigning as the forest minister.Leaders referenced above said that senior Shiv Sena minister Eknath Shinde, who met Thackeray behind closed doors, suggested that Rathod’s resignation should not be accepted till the inquiry report in the February 8 suicide case is submitted, bringing the truth about Rathod’s alleged involvement out. Earlier, Rathod met the CM in the presence of Sena ministers Anil Parab and Aaditya Thackeray.The resignation comes in the wake of the intensified attacks on the Sena-led government on the issue by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP is likely to further raise the issue and disrupt proceedings in the House from Monday if it considers it to be a token resignation ahead of the budget session.Also Read: Maharashtra Covid-19 surge: Curfew in Hingoli from March 1 to 7The BJP has alleged that the deceased woman was in a relationship with Rathod and he should be booked in the case. Several audio clips related to the case have gone viral in the past few days and the BJP claims that one of the persons in an audio clip is Rathod, who has been insisting on his innocence.Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil told TV channels that this is a “small beginning” in the suicide case of the 23-year-old woman. "Ideally Thackeray should have taken the resignation much earlier but we are happy that he has taken the minister’s resignation due to pressure from the people," he told TV channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-minister-sanjay-rathod-hands-over-resignation-to-uddhav-thackeray-101614509094631.html

28-02-2021||Other||Your Space: Stay fit, follow norms to fight the virus||PUNE As there is a surge in virus cases schools, colleges have shut down and night curfew is in place. The district administration has put in place various other restrictions to curb the spread of virus. Here is how Puneites are taking precautions to ensure there is no second wave of the Covid-19 infection. They also share how they are paying attention to personal hygiene and focusing on overall health and diet along with regular exercise to fight the virus.Eat healthy and stay fitAs virus cases are on the rise, it is our responsibility to pay attention to personal hygiene. Always wear a mask and maintain social distance in public places. Make sure you take all the possible care in case you are going out for work. Avoid social gatherings like marriages, political gathering and other functions. Make necessary amends in your diet and daily routine to boost your immunity and make yourself stronger. Most importantly, do not forget to do exercise. Take out time from your busy schedule and exercise regularly to keep yourself healthy.Gunratna SontakkeSafety is in our handsAs veterinary doctor, we wear face masks and face shields at the workplace. We follow strict social distancing as well. We do not allow pet owners without masks and we have made frequent hand washing, disinfection of our working area a daily routine to ensure safety for us and those who visit the clinic. As soon as I return home, I wash my clothes and have a bath. I refrain from touching any object in the house unless and until I have taken a bath. I have a five-year-old son at home and for the safety of my family, I follow all norms carefully. For my OPD, I have an entirely different dress and when I go to the OPD I wear that dress every day along with a separate pair of shoes or floaters. Following hand hygiene is equally important. Keep using sanitisers or soap to disinfect your hands regularly when you are out or at the workplace.Dr Prashant SalveThere is no reason to panic, follow precautionsThe city is again emerging as a hotspot for Covid. By rectifying previous mistakes we can avoid the second wave of this pandemic. The local government is taking necessary steps in this direction like identifying containment zones, intensifying testing, strict regulations regarding social distancing among others. But we need serious efforts from the citizens as well. Just like the previous time, there is no reason to panic as people are now more informed about necessary precautions, symptoms of the disease and possible treatment. We live in Susgaon which is at the edge of Pune city. Since last week, people have started wearing masks in public places more seriously. Gram Panchayat is spreading awareness about the virus precautions. At the society level, the management has made new rules to limit the entry of courier and daily items services to the main gate only. I am working for a UPSC coaching class and working from home. Also, I am a mother of a 10-month-old child therefore I am more cautious. We avoid unnecessarily going out and preferably bring all necessary things once a week itself.Leena BhangaleKeep your safety guards up!Avoid going out whenever necessary. Also, avoid going out together, when the work can be done alone. Meet people in safe places and maintain social distance. Wear masks constantly and sanitise hands frequently. Avoid inviting people home or going to other people’s houses unless it is necessary. Do not attend any public functions if it can be avoided, instead attend virtual functions. Meet friends and families on video call instead of meeting at public places. Incorporate healthy habits like cook and eat homemade food and exercise regularly. There are plenty of videos on the internet that can guide you with how to do effective exercise at home. Make sure you and your family exercise together to maintain good health.Amruta DeshpandePeople with comorbidities should be extra carefulAlong with following safety norms one must ensure the intake of healthy home-made food (avoid junk) and exercise regularly. Perform breathing exercises and include fruits like lemons, amla, oranges which contain Vitamin C which plays a major role in maintaining the integrity of body tissues. Patients with obesity, high BP, chronic lung diseases, diabetes, liver disease and other comorbidities have an increased risk of acquiring the infection. People who smoke or have undergone transplant surgeries also have higher susceptibility. Therefore, our efforts along with the measures directed by the state together are the only resorts to prevent the second wave, as it will take time for the vaccination practices to be followed nationwide and we can’t afford a hike at such a time. Most importantly, do not rely on and depend on non-approved medicines. If you encounter even any mild symptoms of Covid like cough, running nose, fatigue, body ache contact your physician immediately and follow all the instructions directed by the physician.Pratiksha Bhansali||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/your-space-stay-fit-follow-norms-to-fight-the-virus-101614506834444.html

And spreading awareness about it is one of the important tools in this regard,” he said.Also Read: Bihar to begin registration for 3rd phase of Covid-19 vaccination from March 1The commissioner added that an integrated command center, related to the AES, is to be set up at the Sadar hospital for day to day monitoring of the situation. “This center will start functioning from March 1 this year. Anybody can call this center and give information about the disease,” he said.The DM of Muzaffarpur, Pranav Kumar informed that awareness programmes started on February 3 this year.Muzaffarpur is one of the worst-affected districts by the AES.

The hub will be part of the economic zones of the upcoming Amritsar-Delhi-Kolkata freight corridor.The project has got in principle approval from the Centre, which will pay 50% of the cost for the project, a joint venture with the Centre. It is expected to boost economic activity in various states, said additional chief secretary, industry department, Brijesh Mehrohtra.The government wants to acquire 1650 acres of land for the hub and the process is expected to start from next month onwards. “A proposal for the land acquisition for the project will be sent to the cabinet soon. Once approved, the acquisition process will start,” said a senior official in the department, who didn’t wish to be quoted.The manufacturing hub will cater to the needs of big industries and medium scale manufacturing units including ancillary units and interested investors will be provided land as per their needs. “Land would be provided to manufacturing, ancillary and processing units based on applications. Till now, this is the plan. The ambit may be expanded for other enterprises later on,” said another officer in the department preferring anonymity.The other advantage of the site at Dobhi is its proximity to the upcoming eastern freight dedicated corridor passing through Gaya and the Kolkata-Delhi national highway. This will give manufacturing firms better logistical and transportation facilities, officials said.Also Read: Temperature soars to nearly 34°C in Gaya, Bihar as summer knocks earlyIndustry officials maintained that the project cost would be over ₹1000 crore but a clearer picture will emerge once the detailed project report (DPR) is finalised. “The land acquisition work would take six to eight months. In the meantime, the appointment of consultant and DPR work would be done,” said Mehrohtra.Meanwhile, the industry department is also focusing on developing the electronic park at Begusarai, where the required land acquisition has been made. “There has been interest shown by several sand firms in setting up units.

Gaya was the hottest in the state with maximum temperature at 33.8°C followed by Bhagalpur- 33.7°C and Purnea at 30°C.Most of the cities in the state recorded higher temperatures for this time in February, breaking past records. Even higher temperatures were seen in February 2017, when Patna and Gaya recorded a maximum temperature of 34.2°C and 34.1°C respectively.Amit Sinha, a meteorologist at Patna weather department, said maximum and minimum temperatures at most places in the state had gone past the normal since the past three to four days.“Usually, mercury above 30°C is recorded in March, but this year the mercury has exceeded the normal temperature in February-end itself. The reason behind above-normal temperature is lack of any active western disturbance. Last active western disturbance was witnessed on February 7. The westerly winds have cleared the lower level of atmosphere, leading to maximum penetration of sunlight hitting surface,” he said.Also Read: Congress MLA’s nephew shot dead at Bihar home, 4th murder in the familyHe also said that a gradual increase in maximum temperature is likely after March 1.“After extreme cold, we are feeling extreme hot.

28-02-2021||Kolkata||CPI(M)’s 1st rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Grounds; Congress, ISF invited||The Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), on Sunday will hold its first mega rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Ground, the biggest open ground in the city located in the sprawling Maidans, prior to the West Bengal assembly polls.In a bid to display the strength of the third front which has taken shape over the past few weeks, the CPI(M) has planned a mega show along with its partners in the Left Front. The Congress and the Indian Secular Front (ISF), a new platform launched by cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui from Furfura Sharif, have also been invited.Significantly, Congress leader and Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has been invited to the rally.Although the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main contenders in the bi-polar election, have been planning to hold rallies at the Brigade grounds, it is the CPI(M) and its Left partners who have managed to organise the first one.Thousands of Left supporters from the districts started arriving in Kolkata by trains and busses on Saturday. CPI(M) supporters took out numerous processions in Kolkata and its outskirts, asking people to attend the political programme.“With the Congress and the ISF taking part, we are expecting a mammoth turnout. Since all people will not be able to reach the main podium we have installed 620 loudspeakers so that the speeches can be heard from everywhere,” said Left Front chairman and veteran CPI(M) leader Biman Bose who visited the venue on Saturday.Kolkata Police officials said extensive security arrangements are being made. The rally ground has been divided into 11 security zones.Ailing former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, 76, expressed anguish over not being able to attend the rally because of his health condition.“I am getting a lot of information about the Brigade rally. I cannot explain the anguish I am going through for not being able to attend it. My comrades are fighting on the ground, while I am following the advice of doctors because of my illness. I could never imagine that I will be confined to my home while a meeting will be on at the Maidans. I wish it success,” Bhattacharjee said in a message that was released by his party on Saturday night.In October last year, Bhattacharjee was rushed to a private hospital in Kolkata with symptoms of breathlessness. He has been suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for more than a decade.CPI(M) leaders said Bhattacharjee was extremely unwell when the Left Front held its last rally at the Brigade grounds prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Yet, he came to the venue in a car and stayed for some time although doctors did not allow him to leave the vehicle. On Sunday, a speech by Bhattacharjee may be read out, CPI(M) leaders said.There is an old saying in Bengal politics that whoever manages to fill up the Brigade grounds with its followers wins elections. Only big parties hold rallies at this venue and whenever they do so, attempts are made to ferry as many supporters from the districts as possible since the grounds can accommodate close to one million people.The TMC leadership did not want to give any importance to the Left-Congress rally.“The writing is already on the wall. People will elect Mamata Banerjee as chief minister for the third time. It makes no difference if some party holds a rally at the Brigade,” said urban development minister Firhad Hakim.Also Read: West Bengal polls 2021: Special police observer Vivek Dubey to reach on SundayBJP leaders, too, tried to play down the Left’s campaigning.“This is a contest between the BJP and the TMC. Other parties do not matter,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh.The BJP won 18 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Seen in terms of assembly segments, the BJP was ahead of the others in 122 of the state’s 294 assembly seats while the TMC lead in 163.In terms of vote share in the 2019 polls, the TMC got 43.69 % in 2019 against 40.64 % secured by the BJP. The CPI(M)’s vote share came down to 6.34 % while the Congress got only 5.67%.For the TMC and the BJP, any change in vote share of the Left and Congress may play a crucial role. The Congress and the Left Front parties contested as allies in the 2016 assembly polls but couldn’t stop the TMC from coming to power with 211 seats. The Congress wrested 44 seats while the Left got 32. Their tie-up did not last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cpims-1st-rally-at-kolkata-s-brigade-parade-grounds-congress-isf-invited-101614484408872.html
28-02-2021||Election:||Delhi municipal by-polls: Voting underway at 5 MCD wards||Voters queued up on Sunday as polling for elections to five wards of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) began at 7:30am in the first set of polls being held in Delhi amid the coronavirus pandemic. Several people were seen queued outside polling booths in the city’s Ward No 32N, (Rohini-C), Ward No 62N, (Shalimar Bagh North) in north Delhi and Ward No 02-E (Trilokpuri), Ward No 08-E (Kalyanpuri) and Ward No 41-E (Chauhan Bangar) in east Delhi.Polling will go on till 5:30pm and the results for the two wards under North Delhi Municipal Corporation and three under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation will be declared on March 3. Four of the five wards fell vacant after their incumbent councillors were elected as the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) legislators in the assembly polls whereas the by-election in Shalimar Bagh was necessitated after the death of councillor Renu Jaju, who won the seat on a BJP ticket in 2017. The national capital went to assembly polls in February last year in which chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP emerged victorious with a huge majority. For nearly 15 years, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has ruled all three MCDs in the city. In 2017, while AAP won four of these five wards, Congress was pushed to a distant third with just 30 seats. While the Congress looks to improve its performance, state labour minister and AAP’s Delhi unit convener Gopal Rai on Saturday called the by-polls a “semi-final” to end the BJP’s 15-year control and that the election will write Delhi’s future for the next five years.“The BJP spread politics of hate during the Delhi assembly elections, but people again voted for an AAP government under chief minister Kejriwal. The AAP will defeat the BJP in the MCD by-election just the way it did in the assembly elections. This election is not about the Congress, but about defeating the BJP. The Congress will not do any good to the citizens of Delhi, but only split the vote,” Rai said.Chief minister Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and other cabinet ministers campaigned for their candidates on all five seats. The BJP, meanwhile, held roadshows and meetings at the booth level and has tasked each party worker to get support from at least 21 houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/delhi-municipal-by-polls-voting-underway-at-5-mcd-wards-101614483530349.html

28-02-2021||Mumbai||Ambani bomb scare: Vehicle used by suspects identified||The Mumbai Police have spotted on CCTV surveillance the Innova car used by two suspects to escape after parking a car laden with explosives near the residence of Reliance Industries’ chairman Mukesh Ambani. Police officials in the crime branch said the car was last seen on the Bhiwandi-Nashik highway. The police are now scouring nearby villages for clues and more details.On February 25 afternoon, a Scorpio car was found abandoned on Carmichael Road, about 600 metres away from the Ambani residence. Twenty loose Gelatin sticks were found in the car, although there was no timer or detonation device. The police subsequently released details of a letter found in the car, addressed to the Reliance chairman and his wife, claiming this was just “a trailer”.The 2.5kg of gelatin, in sticks, found in the SUV, is considered enough to trigger a low-intensity explosion. The SUV sported fake plates — the number was that of the lead car in the security convoy deployed for Nita Ambani.“Our teams are still trying to trace the Innova vehicle and scanning more CCTV footage. So far, we have recorded 25 statements during the probe. NIA is also conducting a parallel probe,” Milind Bharambe, joint commissioner of police (crime) said on Saturday.The police have so far scanned around 700 CCTV cameras in to track the route of the two SUVs, a crime branch official said.The Scorpio car in which the explosives were found has also been sent to a forensic lab for further examination.

Mumbai’s maximum temperature over the same period has ranged between 33.9 and 36.1 degrees C. These are between 5 and 7 degrees higher than normal. How unique is this? According to India Meteorological Department’s data, Delhi’s maximum temperature didn’t touch 30 degree C in 2020, 2019, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in February. There were 4 days with 30 degree C + maximum temperature in 2018; three days in 2017; and five days in 2016.“Normally, six western disturbances impact the northern plains in January and February and about four to five in March. The north westerly winds bring pleasant spring time weather as we head to summer. That hasn’t happened this year. Only one WD each impacted the NW plains in January and February each. Rest of the WDs impacted only the upper reaches of the Western Himalayas. Warm south-westerly winds have been blowing,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.There is likely to be a marginal fall in maximum temperatures starting Sunday for a brief period which will not be as pleasant as spring, he said, adding: “Today the wind direction switched for a bit to north westerly (from the direction of Western Himalayas which normally brings cooler air).” The change may result in a 2-3 degree C drop in maximum temperatures over the plains till March 3. “But maximum temperatures are already 5 to 6 degree C above normal, so a 2-3 degree C drop won’t bring back spring. From March 3, maximums will rise again to 34 to 35 degree C,” Srivastava said.According to an IMD statement on February 24, higher temperatures over northwestern plains can be attributed to absence of any weather system and prevalence of southwesterly surface winds, causing advection of heat from west Rajasthan towards the region.Earlier, meteorologists expected winter to be prolonged this year because of La Niña, a global weather phenomenon. El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.On Friday and Saturday maximum temperatures over NW India were 6 to 8 degree C above normal. On Saturday Hisar recorded 31.5,five degree C above normal; Narnaul 33.8, eight degree C above normal; Churu 33.9 degree C, five degrees above normal; Ambala 30.3, seven degrees above normal; Pilani 33.7, seven degrees above normal; Karnal 30, six degrees above normal; Jaipur 33.8, six degrees above normal; Delhi recorded 33 degree C, seven degrees above normal on Friday and 31. 7, six degrees above normal on Saturday. Other central and eastern Indian cities are also seeing an early summer. “The rise in maximum temperatures over northwest India is mainly due to south-westerly winds and the lack of weather systems which can bring rain. There has been snowfall and rain in the Himalayas on Friday so now temperature will fall temporarily but climatologically temperatures will continue to rise. In IMD’s terminology there is no spring. We move over to the pre-monsoon season from winter,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. And some parts of India will heat up faster than the rest. “Temperature starts rising peaking first in Odisha, Maharashtra, etc, in March and then in northwest India. So, we are also expecting temperatures to rise in Maharashtra from next week,” he added. “La Niña conditions are still moderate. But I think temperatures have gone up in northwest India due to south-westerly winds,” said DS Pai, senior climate scientist at IMD Pune said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weather-experts-weigh-in-on-why-spring-gave-delhi-a-miss-101614467930683.html
28-02-2021||Jaipur||Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot share stage, take on Centre over farm laws||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot on Saturday put up a show of unity ahead of bypolls to four seats in the state as they attacked the Centre over the three contentious farm laws and extended support to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.The two senior Congress leaders were involved in a political tussle last July over the functioning of the state unit, which threatened to topple the Gehlot government. The Congress brass eventually stepped in to resolve the month-long crisis.Bypolls to Sujangarh, Rajsamand, Sahada and Vallabhgarh are scheduled due to the deaths of sitting legislators.“Protest and agitation are ornaments of democracy, but the Central government is stubborn and not ready to listen to the farmers who are sitting on protest in extreme weather conditions for the last 90 days,” 69-year-old Gehlot said while addressing a kisan mahapanchayat in Bikaner.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and UP, have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November demanding a repeal of the three laws.Pilot, who travelled with Gehlot to two kisan mahanpanchayats, said the Centre was ignoring the legitimate demands of the farmers. “PM is not ready to listen to the farmers. Our leader Sonia Gandhi had united 24 parties against the farm laws. They want to shut all the mandis,” the 43-year-old said.State BJP president Satish Poonia rejected the Congress leaders’ allegations. “In the name of farmers, the Congress is trying to gain its lost ground. Generally, it is perceived that the party in power wins the bypolls, but the Congress government is afraid,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/ashok-gehlot-and-sachin-pilot-share-stage-take-on-centre-over-farm-laws-101614466407884.html

At least 28 fire tenders were pressed into service and they took nearly five hours to douse the fire that had spread to the second floor that had another factory.Officials suspect fautly wiring in the building that set off a short-circuit or an LPG cylinder in the factory.The dead man was identified as Upchand Kumar who was from Siwan in Bihar. His colleague, identified as Sushil was admitted at a city hospital. A fire officer also suffered burn injuries while attempting to douse the fire.Forensic experts and crime branch officials visited the site at around noon and took samples for investigation.Police registered a case at the Gulabi Bagh police station and are probing the cause of the fire.They said that a preliminary investigation revealed that the factory was run and managed by three persons from Gautam Budh Nagar district in Uttar Pradesh; they will be summoned to join the investigation into the fire at the factory, police said.Fire officials said that the factory was over 600 square yards. The ground had a bottle manufacturing unit, the first floor manufactured lipstick and the second floor packed toys.Kumar, fire officials said, was sleeping in a room on the first floor room. Kumar’s body was found at around 9am.His relatives who reached the spot said Kumar had been employed at the factory for several years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-killed-in-fire-at-factory-in-delhi-s-pratap-nagar-101614464825111.html
28-02-2021||Delhi||Bypolls in 5 MCD wards today||Municipal bypolls will be held in five wards on Sunday, two of which fall under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and three under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation.Polling will start at 7.30am and end at 5.30pm, and the results will be declared on March 3.The Aam Aadmi Party won four of these five wards in the 2017 MCD elections, which saw the Bharatiya Janata Party retain all the three civic bodies in the city. The BJP has ruled all three MCDs in Delhi for nearly 15 years now.The Congress, which was pushed to a distant third in the 2017 MCD elections with just 30 seats, is looking to improve its performance and make the polls a triangular battle, instead of a straight contest between the AAP and BJP.Sunday’s bypolls will be held in wards 32N, (Rohini-C) and 62N, (Shalimar Bagh North) in north Delhi and wards 02-E (Trilokpuri), 08E (Kalyanpuri) and 41E (Chauhan Bangar) in east Delhi.Four of the five wards that go to bypolls fell vacant after their incumbent councillors were elected AAP MLAs in the assembly polls in February last year. The bypoll in Shalimar Bagh, meanwhile, was necessitated after the death of councillor Renu Jaju, who won the seat on a BJP ticket in 2017.The AAP, which has fielded two former MLAs for Sunday’s bypolls saw its party supremo and Delhi chief minister Kejriwal campaign for five candidates, as did other cabinet ministers, including deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.Calling the bypolls a “semi-final” to end the BJP’s 15-year control of the civic bodies, state labour minister and AAP’s Delhi unit convener Gopal Rai said Saturday’s election will “write Delhi’s future for the next five years.”“The BJP spread politics of hate during the Delhi assembly elections, but people again voted for an AAP government under chief minister Kejriwal. The AAP will defeat BJP in the MCD by-election just the way it did in the assembly elections. This election is not about the Congress, but about defeating the BJP. The Congress will not do any good to the citizens of Delhi, but only split the vote,” Rai said.The BJP has been holding roadshows and meetings at the booth level, and has tasked each party worker with getting support from at least 21 houses, as part of their campaign.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the BJP will win all five wards, claiming that the people of Delhi believe in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s motto of “sabka saath, sabka vikas aur sabka vishwas”.“The Kejriwal government has not fulfilled any of its poll promises and is neglecting development work, which is what people want. The AAP has pushed Delhi towards anarchy as Kejriwal is now supporting those very elements who insulted the national flag and created chaos in the city on Republic Day as part of the farmers’ agitation,” he said.Meanwhile, the Congress, in its campaigns said the Capital was blighted by “multiplicity of authority”, and criticised the BJP and the AAP for not doing anything other than “bickering”, alleging that this has led to a governance paralysis in the city.Shaktisinh Gohil, Delhi Congress in-charge, said people are tired of the misrule and shadow boxing of the BJP and the AAP governments.“Governments of both the parties at the Centre and in Delhi have been self-obsessed without doing any work. In the past few years, they only made charges and counter charges against each other, about fund misuse, stalled developments and corruption. But, none filed FIRs despite they levelling charges of corruption on each other,” said Gohil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bypolls-in-5-mcd-wards-today-101614464642133.html
28-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds 243 new Covid-19 cases, three more deaths||The Capital reported over 200 cases of Covid-19 for the fourth day in a row, adding 243 cases on Saturday, amid concerns over the emergence of what appears to be new waves of the infection in at least five states in India — Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Chhattisgarh.The city’s average positivity has increased to 0.32% over the last seven days, in comparison to 0.25% the week before and 0.21% the week before that.Although the increase is minor, experts worry it may be indicative of an increase in virus transmission in Delhi.The city also recorded three Covid-19 deaths, the highest in 15 days. So far, 10,909 people have died of the infection in Delhi.“If the number of tests has remained more or less the same, it shows that the transmission of the infection is increasing again. What we need to do right now is tell people that the pandemic is not over. They have to continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to ensure the numbers remain under control,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Delhi conducted 67,484 tests for the infection on Saturday. Of these, 45,873 were conducted using the more reliable reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction method (RT-PCR). The positivity rate on Saturday — 0.36% — was marginally lower than 0.41% on Friday.Centre lists 226 private hospitals for Covid jabsThe Centre has released a list of 226 vaccination centres in private hospitals registered under Ayushman Bharat and CGHS in Delhi that will vaccinate people over the age of 60 and those with comorbidities in the second phase of vaccinations that will begin across India on March 1.All the 313 centres — government and private centre — already vaccinating health care workers and frontline workers will continue to vaccinate other beneficiaries as well, according to senior officials in the state’s health department.“The second phase of the vaccination drive will be rolled out across all the existing centres currently and then we will look at expanding the number of centre. A decision on which private hospitals will be included in the new list of centres will be taken after a meeting with the private hospitals tomorrow,” one of the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-243-new-covid-19-cases-three-more-deaths-101614463638111.html

Police said the arrests were made following an encounter in the Pilkhuwa area of Hapur district, and the suspects sustained gunshot wounds to their legs.Police identified the arrested men as Ankit Tomar, 26, and Akash Tomar, 21, her two fellow passengers in the auto, and Aakil, 27, the driver of the auto, which the 30-year-old woman had boarded from Lal Kuan intersection in Ghaziabad to go home to Greater Noida.Additional superintendent of police (Hapur) Sarvesh Mishra said the suspects belong to Galandpur village.He said the police identified the auto-rickshaw and suspects based on a tip-off from local informants.The woman had told the police the three men forcefully taken her in the auto to Hapur, to an isolated spot, where they took turns to rape her.A police team pursued the suspects around 5am, after spotting them in the auto-rickshaw near a dental college on NH-24. They fired at the police team when asked to stop. In the exchange of fire, they sustained bullet injuries to their legs, police said.Mishra said during interrogation, the suspects admitted to a prior gang-rape as well — of a girl whom they had abducted in their auto almost a month ago. They also admitted that they followed the same pattern with the woman on Wednesday night.“The first victim didn’t report the incident to the police. Ankit Tomar was sent to jail in 2013 in a rape case,” Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/3-held-for-raping-woman-in-uttar-pradesh-s-hapur-101614463015960.html
28-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal says city law, order in turmoil; Police disagree||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said Delhi’s law and order situation is in “serious turmoil” and demanded Union home minister Amit Shah and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal take action, in comments that came after an eight-year-old girl was murdered and a teenage boy stabbed in two separate cases in Delhi’s Patparganj and Kalkaji areas.“Deeply concerned by the murder of a 8-yr-old girl in Khichripur & attack on a 17-yr-old boy in Kalkaji. Delhi’’s law and order situation is in a serious turmoil, I appeal to Hon’’ble Home Minister & Lt. Gov (Lieutenant Governor) to take appropriate action to address the situation,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.Disagreeing with the Delhi chief minister’s tweet, the deputy commissioner of police (east), Deepak Yadav on Saturday evening responded: “We reaffirm our commitment to professional investigation and extending the best support to the aggrieved family.” In an attached statement, the DCP said a special investigative team headed by the additional DCP (east) had been formed to probe the matter.Earlier this month, during their annual press conference, Delhi police pointed out that crimes such as murder, extortion and those against women, reduced in 2020 over 2019. The data showed that cases of rape, molestation, and attacks on women declined.Also Read| 17-year-old critical after being stabbed by 5 in Delhi's KalkajiDeputy chief minister Manish Sisodia met the family of the deceased girl in Khichripur. He assured the family the case would be tried in a fast-track court and that best lawyers would be engaged to ensure death penalty to the guilty.Delhi BJP President Adesh Gupta also met the family of the girl. “The BJP stands by the family in this hour of grief. I have spoken to the area DCP and urged him to make the family feel safe and ensure that the child’s murderer is tried in the fast-track court,” he said.The minor girl was abducted from Khichripur and a complaint was lodged by her parents at Kalyanpuri police station.

28-02-2021||Delhi||17-year-old critical after being stabbed by 5 in Delhi's Kalkaji||Three persons were arrested and two juveniles detained for allegedly stabbing a 17-year-old schoolboy who tried to stop them from stalking his 18-year-old sister and passing lewd comments at her outside a government school in south-east Delhi’s Kalkaji on Friday afternoon. The boy is currently undergoing treatment at the AIIMS Trauma Centre and the family said his condition is critical.The sister has also alleged that the police who reached the spot shouted at her and questioned her claims when she tried to tell them of what had transpired.Police said a case of attempt to murder, stalking and sexual harassment was registered at the Kalkaji police station against the five suspects.The incident that happened outside a school attracted sharp criticism from politicians, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.“Deeply concerned by the murder of a 8-yr old girl in Khichdipur & attack on a 17-yr old boy in Kalkaji. Delhi’s law and order situation is in a serious turmoil, I appeal to Hon’ble Home Minister & Lt. Gov to take appropriate action to address the situation.(sic)” Kejriwal tweeted on Saturday.The chief minister was also referring to the kidnapping and murder of a minor girl from east Delhi’s Khichripur that was reported on Friday. Four men, who had kidnapped and killed the girl, and thrown her body in the fields near Modinagar in Ghaziabad, were arrested on Friday.The police said the four had planned to extort the girl’s family, but murdered her on finding the police on their tail.The schoolgirl in the Kalkaji incident, a class 12 student, told the media persons that on Friday afternoon, she and her brother had left school and were walking towards their home when five persons started following them and passed lewd remarks at her.“When my brother objected to this, a fight broke out between them. They stabbed my brother in the abdomen and fled. I alerted my father and we rushed my brother to AIIMS Trauma Centre. His condition is critical,” said the schoolgirl, adding that she knew the names of the boys who harassed her.The girl alleged that the policemen who reached the crime scene questioned her claims. They allegedly asked her why there was no blood at the spot, though her clothes were drenched in it.Deputy commissioner of police (south-east) RP Meena said the Kalkaji police station received information about the stabbing and a police team reached the spot to learn that the boy was taken to the hospital. The team went to the hospital and were told that he was in surgery.“The eyewitness (sister) who was present with him at the time of the incident stated that five people followed them and made indecent remarks about her. When her brother objected to that, they started beating him and one of them stabbed him in the abdomen before fleeing the spot with the others. We have registered a case,” said DCP Meena.The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) and Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) also took cognizance of the incident on Friday and sought a report from the police on the incident as well as action taken on the schoolgirl’s allegations on the police.DCPCR chairman Anurag Kundu tweeted about the incident: “There is a situation of deteriorating law and order in the city, particularly for children where they are neither physically nor sexually safe. I met the family at AIIMS, whose son was beaten and stabbed for objecting to molestation bid on his sister. Have passed directions (sic).”The directions passed by the Delhi child rights body included asking the station house officer (SHO, of Kalkaji police station) to conduct an inquiry into the matter expeditiously and submit a status report by March 3.The Commission also directed the station house officer concerned to conduct regular patrolling in and around the school around the time when classes get over.Additionally, the panel also directed the subdivisional magistrate (SDM) to depute at least two civil defence volunteers around the schools once classes are over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/17yearold-critical-after-being-stabbed-by-5-in-delhi-s-kalkaji-101614461131297.html

While one litre of petrol was available at ₹97.57 on Saturday, diesel was priced at ₹88.60 per litre. On Tuesday, one litre of petrol was available at ₹97.34, while diesel was priced at ₹88.44 a litre. On February 21, petrol price touched ₹97 per litre, while one litre of diesel was priced at ₹88.06 in Mumbai. Prior to the rise this year, the highest surge in fuel prices was witnessed in 2018, when a litre of petrol had reached ₹91.34 per litre, while diesel had crossed ₹80 per litre.Transporters across the country, including the Bombay Goods Transport Association (BGTA), have called for immediate intervention of the government to curtail the rising fuel prices. BGTA also supported the Bharat Bandh called on Thursday by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) against the price hike. “The transport industry is fully neglected by the government. Transportation rates cannot be flexible as per daily changing diesel rates. The non-uniformity of prices across the country also makes it difficult to compete fairly,” stated a statement from BGTA.On Friday, transporters met Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur to discuss their issues. “He assured to resolve the problems of parcel transportation/debarking of cargo at ports meant for short distances, arising on account of the amended electronic-way bill system.

Roshan had lodged a complaint with the cyber police at Bandra-Kurla Complex five years ago against an unidentified imposter, who had allegedly sent emails to several women. Last year in December, the case was transferred to CIU, after which summons were issued to Roshan for recording his fresh statement. The actor visited CIU at 11.40am on Saturday. He left CIU office about three hours later. A police officer attached to the crime branch said Roshan has reiterated his complaint in his statement.On the basis of Roshan’s complaint, the cybercrime had in 2016 registered an offence against unidentified individuals under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Information Technology Act. Roshan had alleged that a person was in contact with his friends and fans by using a fake email id: hroshan@email.com. The cyber police had then recorded the statements of Ranaut and her sister while probing the case. Ranaut in an interview had referred to Roshan as a “silly ex” without naming him. In March 2016, they had sent legal notices to each other. The centre of fights between the two actors was an email id from which Ranaut claimed to have received messages from Roshan, proving they were in a relationship. Roshan however, said he never had an email account on the said id, and that it was an imposter who had been communicating with Ranaut all along.He then filed the complaint to track those operating the email id (from which Ranaut received the mails). The police have been unable to track the user. An officer had then said that the emails had come from a United States server, and in the absence of data from there, no user could be identified. The police had later sent Roshan’s mobile phone to the forensic science laboratory but Ranaut had then failed to submit her device. Her lawyer had also questioned the “genuineness of the entire complaint.”The case was transferred to CIU after Roshan’s lawyer in December 2020 wrote to Mumbai Police commissioner alleging that there was no progress in the probe for five years. “Our client also met the top police officers and reiterated all the facts and informed them about the trauma caused to him and his family. He also reiterated his request for a timely investigation. However, there has been no progress in the investigation and the aforementioned cases are still pending. We thus request to kindly look into the matter and issue appropriate orders to direct completion of investigation at the earliest as it is pending since 2016,” stated the lawyer’s letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hrithik-roshan-gives-statement-in-fake-emails-case-101614455170957.html
28-02-2021||Mumbai||Despite renovation, Thane stadium still not the ideal sports ground||Three years since the Dadoji Konddev Stadium has been shut for renovation, sportspersons from Thane and nearby cities are left without a proper place to practice.The stadium was renovated in 2019, though it was reserved only for premier cricket matches while the local sportsmen were allotted a small piece of land to practice. This was the only stadium for sportspersons from Kalyan, Navi Mumbai and Thane. Around 400 cricketers, 500 athletes and a few other sportspersons practice and train here regularly.In February 2019, the stadium was converted into a state-of-the-art cricket pitch to host international-level matches. Hardly two women’s under-19 cricket matches have taken place here in the last two years.However, since renovation, the regular sportspersons are not able to practice or train properly. There are only two nets for cricket practice and a small synthetic track near the steps of the stadium for athletes.A senior officer from Thane Municipal Corporation, said, “Unlike earlier, we cannot permit sportspersons to use the entire ground at all times. Shoes with spikes can damage the cricket pitch. Moreover, we have made provisions for two nets and a synthetic track for athletes, Ghantali Prabodhini cricket coaching is currently conducting their training sessions here. Moreover, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has conducted two Under-19 women’s matches here. This shows that the BCCI is aware of the stadium.”Sportspersons have already been without any practice for months together during the lockdown. Now, when there is a need for more space to practice, the stadium continues to have restricted timings for players.“Unlike earlier, we are not able to continue practicing at the stadium due to restricted timings. Most of us juggle studies and training. This stadium is so aptly located, it becomes convenient for those from Navi Mumbai, Kalyan and areas within Thane to reach. However post renovation with restricted timings at the stadium we are not able to practice like before, many of us opt for other smaller grounds in Mumbra and nearby areas,” said Pooja Joshi, an athlete who has been practicing since the last five years at the stadium.Athletes and cricketers find it difficult to travel to other grounds for practice when they have a provision for everything at a single place.Shreyas Chavan, athletics coach, Thane, added, “Thane is a city with international level athletes and other sportspersons as well. There are many who come from nearby areas to practice and have attained fame at the national level too. While the civic body is making plans to expand and provide better facilities at the stadium, they should take into consideration the interests of all sportspersons and not just one particular sport.”Despite repeated calls, Minal Palande, sports officer, was unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/despite-renovation-thane-stadium-still-not-the-ideal-sports-ground-101614454210935.html

28-02-2021||Mumbai||Crocodile warning board to keep people away from Navi Mumbai creek||Following the rescue of a crocodile from the pond behind Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation headquarters in Belapur, the corporation has put up boards at the Sector 6 creek adjoining Palm Beach Road in Nerul, warning people to stay away from the water. The board is put up by the disaster management cell of NMMC.“Though the crocodile was rescued and shifted outside the city limits, there is always a risk of having more crocodiles in the water,” an official from the disaster management cell said. The board says that there is presence of crocodiles in water and hence one should not enter the water. In case of going by boat, one should not keep hands or legs under the water and also should not throw any food item into the water.“The local villagers go near the creek for fishing. Hence, to warn those, we decided to put up the board. After the rescue, no other crocodile was seen in the pond but yet we cannot be sure if there are no crocodiles,” the officer added.“There has been no study conducted in the Navi Mumbai area regarding the crocodiles in the creek and hence it is difficult to confirm if there are any more crocodiles or not. There used to be the sighting of one crocodile in Juinagar creek and people used to pelt it with stones. Prima facie, the belief is that it is the same crocodile that has been rescued recently. Even as the reptile is a female, it is difficult to find out if she had ever laid eggs. If at all there were any babies, it is difficult for them to survive in the creek. Babies can survive only in small streams,” Aditya Patil, president of Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA), which had rescued the crocodile, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/crocodile-warning-board-to-keep-people-away-from-navi-mumbai-creek-101614453070527.html

28-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh RLA extends deadline to get HSRPs to Sept 30||The Registration and Licensing Authority (RLA), Chandigarh, has extended the last date for affixing high-security registration plates (HSRPs) on vehicles in the CH01BK and BL series to September 30.The decision has been taken to avoid rush at the RLA office and other centres amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in the city.Initially, the RLA had set February 28 as the deadline, which was extended to March 31. On Friday, it had decided to extend it further up to May 31, but following a meeting with senior administrative officials on Saturday, September 30 was set as the new deadline. Once the deadline lapses, traffic police will start issuing challans to the violators. While two-wheeler owners have to pay ₹3,000 fine, those caught without HSRPs on four-wheelers will have to cough up ₹5,000.Officials reasoned that people’s safety, and not challans, were at the top of their priorities right now. The department is also working on other measures to streamline the process. In order to prevent rush, the authorities had already decided to go for a staggered enforcement for other series.Appointment system in works to reduce rushThe number plates are affixed by a third -party vendor, Test HSRP Chandigarh Private Limited, in Chandigarh. It’s head manager, Rachit Mathur, said: “At present, more than 50% of the applicants aren’t even from the BK and BL series. People are worried about getting challaned, and so are coming forward out of turn, leading to rush.”Mathur said an online portal is in the works for booking appointments and making payments. “We have also opened a separate window for women and senior citizens at the RLA office in Sector 17. Similar windows will also be opened at subdivisional magistrate’s offices in the Industrial Area and Sector 42 from Monday,” he said.“Most of the people turn up at the Sector-17 office, leading to a rush here. We are advising those from southern and eastern sectors to visit the respective SDM offices instead,” said RLA Virat.There is also a rush of vehicle owners who have HSRPs and only need to get the third registration mark (colour-coded stickers). Vendors are in the process of developing a system through which these stickers can be delivered to the doorstep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-rla-extends-deadline-to-get-hsrps-to-sept-30-101614452650425.html

28-02-2021||Mumbai||Centre’s new social media regulations dictatorial: Maharashtra IT minister Satej Patil||Maharashtra minister of state for information technology (IT) Satej Patil on Saturday criticised the Central government’s regulations for social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter and over-the-top (OTT) players such as content streaming platforms, calling them “dictatorial” and a threat to democracy and freedom of expression.Patil clarified that this is his personal stand and he is yet to discuss the issue with his colleagues in the state government. He told Hindustan Times, “The regulations curtail freedom of expression. With these regulations, privacy of individuals will be threatened. As of now, if the government wants anything which is anti-national and objectionable taken off the social media platforms, the social media companies cooperate. So there is no need to bring these regulations, unless the government wants access to everyone’s social media.”He added, “We saw what happened in the United States; former president Donald Trump’s Twitter account was deactivated. This shows that even presently in the law, there are mechanisms to ensure such type of content can be removed. What the government is seeking to do through these new regulations is gain control of the content, which is not acceptable.”Patil also said that some bureaucrats deciding on what can be published and what cannot on any social media is an attack on the freedom of press, and such orders will not have any standing in the court of law.On February 25, 2021, the ministry of electronics and information technology notified the Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code Rules, 2021 that social media companies and OTT platforms need to follow. One of the rules is enabling traceability of the originator of content. It also requires such platforms to remove content flagged by authorities within 36 hours as well as appointment of a grievance officer to receive complaints within 24 hours and resolve it within 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centres-new-social-media-regulations-dictatorial-maharashtra-it-minister-satej-patil-101614450850500.html

However, no casualty was reported even as thick smoke spread across the area leading to confusion amongst commuters and area residents. Three fire tenders and a water tanker were sent to the spot to control the flames, fire department officials said. The cause of the fire could not be ascertained until late in the evening. The fire was brought under control in 30 minutes, officials claimed. A large number of onlookers had gathered at the spot as firemen controlled the flames. The central brigade control room informed that a call was received around 3.43 pm and it was doused completely at around 4.15 pm. DCP (traffic) Rahul Srirame said, “The vehicles burnt in the fire incident belonged to the police station and were seized during different crime detections. No vehicle was of the traffic branch as we keep our vehicles segregated.” Fire officer Prashant Ranpise said, “Five two-wheelers were burnt during the fire which suddenly broke out in the compound and investigation is on to find out the reason behind the outbreak. No casualty was reported during the fire.” In a second incident, a major fire took place in the garbage yard opposite Pune District Milk Co-operative Credit Society in Katraj at 5 am on Saturday. Six fire tenders from Bhavani peth and Kondhwa fire stations were rushed to the spot to douse the flames. According to fire officer Sanjay Jadhav, since the garbage was mostly dry and made of plastic, waste plater and other combustible material like rubber and nylon, the fire aggravated.

28-02-2021||Pune||Despite Bhama Askhed completion, tankers in full swing in eastern Pune||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has received additional water from Bhama Askhed dam for the eastern parts of the city but the overall tanker numbers are the same. The PMC has refuted the claim saying that the tanker numbers have gone down drastically on Nagar road and the Vadgaonsheri area. It was expected that once the water from Bhama Askhed dam would arrive in the city, it would help bring down the tanker numbers but all the tanker points in the city are constantly busy with tankers trying to fill up. Water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “Earlier the requirement of tankers on Nagar road area was between 75 to 125 per day in the month of February and March but as water has arrived from Bhama Askhed, it has come down to 28 to 30 tankers per day. We are trying to bring it down to zero but it will take time.” Pawaskar said, “Some parts in Lohegaon like Khandvenagar which got merged recently did not have a water pipeline network. So it’s important to provide them with water through a water tanker. Even some spots in Kharadi are facing water problems, but it will get sorted out. We are developing water lines in the Lohegaon area after which it would be able to achieve the zero-tanker mark in the eastern parts.” Pawaskar accepted that there is a rush at tanker points to fill up the water. “It is mainly due to the additional responsibility of water for newly merged areas. These new areas did not have water lines. They got merged recently. So water tankers are going in those areas,” he said. One of the prominent tanker operators said on anonymity, “Tanker business in the Pune city would never die. By considering the city’s geography, there are always problems in some parts which would not get water. Even after every few years, new areas are going to add in the city. If the tankers get closed in some parts, they move in the newly merged areas. Even after water closure, the water supply got affected in many parts of the city. There is no option than providing water through tankers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/despite-bhama-askhed-completion-tankers-in-full-swing-in-eastern-pune-101614450669667.html
28-02-2021||Pune||Pune sessions court rejects anticipatory bail application of Wadgaon Maval JMFC in bribery case||Additional Sessions Judge SR Navandar has rejected the bail application of Wadgaon Maval Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Archana Jatkar filed under Section 438 of CrPC in connection with a case lodged against her at Dehu road police station by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) under sections 7A and 12 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Apprehending arrest, the judicial officer had approached the court seeking anticipatory bail. Jatkar was under ACB radar since the arrest of Shubhavari Gaikwad on January 15, who was caught red-handed accepting a bribe of ₹2.5 lakh. Gaikwad who impersonated as a court staffer and promised to manage the court’s decision in favour of the complainant identified as Swapnil Madhukar Shevkar, a resident of Induri in Maval taluka of the district. Shevkar who runs a milk dairy in the name ‘Kadjai Mata Dudh Sankalan’ used to supply milk to Amul Dairy of Khed. Shubhavari Gaikwad, approached him on January 4 and January 5 falsely pretending herself to be ‘Mhatre Madam’ and told him that there is a criminal case filed against him in the court of the applicant judicial officer. She also showed him a copy of a criminal complaint and pointed out that it was posted for hearing on January 6 and gave him an assurance that the case will be dismissed by managing the presiding officer if he made a payment of ₹5 lakh. Shevkar showed displeasure after which she reduced the amount of bribe to Rs. 3 lakh. The complainant, therefore, approached the office of ACB on January 6 and filed a complaint of demand for bribe after which a trap was laid leading to her arrest. The judge in his order observed, “The above observations prima facie denote serious involvement of the applicant in the commission of crime i.e. demand and acceptance of bribe through the accused number one (Shubhavari Gaikwad). There are statements of some litigants to whom the accused number one approached in similar manners in relation to the cases pending in the court of the applicant. In a similar manner, she gave proposals. There appears to be a serious conspiracy that needs to be excavated. The hidden network needs to be traced out and this cannot be done unless the applicant is interrogated in police custody. It is, therefore, the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant cannot be accepted. The applicant is a public servant. She owes a duty to render services without fear and favour of anybody, particularly when she is working as a judicial officer. When it is prima facie noticed that she is involved in corrupt practices, no relief of anticipatory bail can be granted to her.” The observation stated “APP PS Agarwal argued that there is sufficient evidence to show that the applicant is involved in the commission of a crime. He has taken me through the papers of investigation including scripts of conversations recorded during verification of bribe and during the trap. According to him, custodial interrogation of applicant is necessary. The offence is very serious and therefore anticipatory bail may not be granted The advocate for the JMFC argued that the amount of bribe paid to Gaikwad has been seized, she has been interrogated and now released on bail, nothing is remained to be seized from the accused and therefore her custodial interrogation is not necessary. It is, therefore, prayed for grant of anticipatory bail.” Box On January 13, 2021, a trap was laid on Shubhavari Gaikwad where she accepted a bribe amount, which consisted of real cash of ₹50,000 and duplicate notes of ₹2,50,000. Immediately, she was taken into custody. When her hands were checked under the ultraviolet lamp, those were found shining with the anthracin powder. Accordingly, a trap panchanama was prepared. Thereafter, an FIR came to be registered and the accused was formally arrested and interrogated in police custody. The order stated “The learned advocate for the applicant AL Dongare has argued that there are no direct allegations against the applicant in FIR that there is no evidence of her involvement either in demand or in acceptance of the amount and the applicant has been falsely implicated in the case. It is submitted that the applicant came in contact with the accused number one a few days ago when she was in search of the caretaker for her child. It is argued that the applicant contacted the accused number one only for the purpose of securing a maidservant and not with any another purpose. According to the advocate for the applicant, it is possible that the accused number one had taken undue advantage of the acquaintance of the applicant and demanded bribe in her name.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-sessions-court-rejects-anticipatory-bail-application-of-wadgaon-maval-jmfc-in-bribery-case-101614450670156.html
28-02-2021||Mumbai||Pandemic effect: Maharashtra issues guidelines to tackle learning losses||With schools in the state remaining shut for nearly 10 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra education department has issued guidelines for addressing concerns about loss of learning over these months.In an eight-page document, the department has laid out guidelines for bringing drop-out students back to schools and mitigate loss of learning over the past one year. “Not all students have access to online learning, and there are many limitations in reaching out to such students despite efforts from schools. Similarly, there has been a lot of reverse migration from urban areas to villages during the pandemic. There is a concern that children who migrated in such a manner might drop out or be forced into child labour. This is a key reason why some guidelines are needed to help bring such students back to schools and train the ones who might have suffered learning losses,” states the document.The guidelines include giving special attention to female students and children with special needs to ensure that they do not lag behind in their studies and do not drop out. Similarly, schools have been asked to conduct awareness drives among parents, assuring about the safety of the students in schools during the current situation. A list of students who have migrated is to be collated and such students should be contacted to ensure that they continue learning. Similarly, the guidelines also have several measures to mitigate learning losses. For instance, teachers have to stress on remedial learning when physical schools reopen and should focus on ensuring that students possess basic arithmetic and language literacy. Teachers need to be trained to address challenges with respect to loss of learning, states the circular.The education department has launched a drive to identify out-of-school students across the state from March 1. While schools in Mumbai and Thane are yet to reopen, those in other parts of the state have reopened for Classes 9 to 12 from November 23 and for Classes 5 to 8 from January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pandemic-effect-maharashtra-issues-guidelines-to-tackle-learning-losses-101614450614019.html

28-02-2021||Pune||Software engineer on a plogging mission to clean Pune||Vivek Gurav, a 25-year-old software engineer has taken it upon himself to clean the city through plogging initiatives. Gurav’s efforts to clean the Indrayani river ghat in Alandi as an engineering student won him huge praise in the area. “When I shifted to Pune for higher studies, I joined the MIT academy of engineering, Alandi in 2014. The river Indrayani was a place where I went for a daily walk with my friends in the evening. We observed people who carelessly dumped a lot of trash and plastic in the river as well as surrounding areas,” said Gurav. Initially, Gurav and his friends blamed the local body and government for all these actions, but he personally felt it was the moral duty of citizens including him to follow cleanliness norms and keep the city clean.He appealed to his friends to join him in cleaning the river Indrayani who initially was quite hesitant, but he took up a challenge and started the cleaning journey.With the support of a few friends, he adopted Indrayani river for a mega clean-up mission.“The efforts lasted for four years and we saw a behavioral change in the visitors after a span who minimized littering at the Indrayani ghat near Alandi temple. After my college days, we stopped the campaign and took up the charge to not only clean rivers but all the public spaces in the city,” Gurav said.Vivek has been picking trash while he is on an early morning walk or jogging every day. “I have integrated clean-up with my workout routine which has now made this a multi-tasking routine for me,” Gurav said.“Starting my day early morning at 5-6 am daily has helped me manage my work schedule. I do the morning walk for around 45 minutes covering 3 km stretch daily. That has helped me stay fit and healthy while contributing to the Clean City mission,” he said.Gurav added that he was called Kabadiwala, Kachrawala, rag picker initially but he has now created an identity where people call him a plogger. In order to clear the social taboo and stigma around picking up trash, Gurav tried to involve people from different professional backgrounds when he launched a community of Ploggers - Pune Ploggers. “Transforming the way, we pick up trash and gamification of Swachh Bharat Mission, I was able to attract more than 4,000 Ploggers across India and now people have started identifying us as Eco-Fitness warriors. Cleaning the city isn’t only the responsibility of the government, citizen participation will actually drive the mission of Swachh Bharat abhiyan and Fit India movement,” Gurav said.More than 5,000 tonnes of waste have been collected through different campaigns. Most of the waste collected from river bodies is sent for segregation. The recyclable waste is segregated and sent for recycling by giving up the trash to local Kabadiwalas as a source of income for them. “That’s how they were able to involve them in the community as well.We make Eco-bricks out of non-recyclable plastic waste; cigarette butts are being recycled as well. The glass bottles are upcycled by a team of rural women who get some extra income by selling those,” he said.Addressing the mindset of citizens, promoting zero-littering habits, raising awareness through schools and colleges, talking to local communities and making them a part of this mission will drive the true purpose why he started this cause. “I have been promoting a zero-waste lifestyle. I have been talking about how climate change is impacting all of us and the role of youth-led action can be the ultimate climate action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/software-engineer-on-a-plogging-mission-to-clean-pune-101614450611943.html
28-02-2021||Pune||IISER to train Science, Maths teachers from four states||After the success of training around 50,000 teachers from across Maharashtra in subjects like Science and Mathematics, the Indrani Balan Science Activity Centre (SAC) at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune is now planning to expand its program to four more states this year. The institute has taken various online initiatives to ensure that teachers are able to understand and explain basic concepts in science and mathematics to students in simpler ways through online education. Officials said that they are planning to work with the education department of other states in creating such study materials for other states in their own vernacular language. Harinath Chakrapani. professor and dean, international relations and outreach said that the training of teachers has received a very good response. “There are teachers with us from every district of Maharashtra and it is because of the proactive nature of the education department that we are able to reach so many teachers,” said Chakrapani. He further added that the institute is planning with other states to start similar programmes. “We are planning to reach four more states this year. Our intention is to reach proactive states that understand the value of training their teachers to effectively teach the students,” said Chakrapani. He also added that at present, the online videos are in three languages, namely English, Marathi and Hindi. “We have these three languages but as we expand the project, we will include experts from respective states to introduce more vernacular languages and help the child,” said Chakrapani. Also, under the SAC at IISER, Pune, there are activity-based online videos that are published each week which include various scientific experiments for children, parents and teachers. “After the lockdown last year, these videos became more popular as many students, parents and teachers started giving feedback. There were around 1 lakh views to each video we made. Also, we have video feedback from students who tried these experiments at home. These experiments are based on basic scientific principles and through the videos, we hope that these concepts are clear to the students,” said Chakrapani. Box Planetarium still under construction The planetarium at Pimpri-Chinchwad Science Park has been under construction since 2016. The project is on the verge of completion. Though there are various other Science day programs at the Science Park this year, the visit to the planetarium may need more time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/iiser-to-train-science-maths-teachers-from-four-states-101614450611438.html

We are now checking for internet connectivity, room space, AEFI management and in case the referral hospital is located far away in case of any AEFI we will not consider that centre.”For those willing to get the vaccine at private centres, each dose is likely to cost ₹250 at the session site. About 12 lakh vulnerable people are likely to be vaccinated in the city.As per the order issued by the central government to states, that as per the Co-WIN 2.0 meeting chaired by chief executive officer (CEO) National Health Authority and Union Health Secretary held on Friday, it was said that the service charge to be recovered from private hospitals acting as Covid vaccination centre would be subject to the ceiling price of ₹100 per person per dose. Besides, private hospitals will recover ₹150 per person per dose as the cost of the vaccine. So each beneficiary would have to pay ₹250 per dose per person. As recommended for maximum efficacy each person has to take two doses and so as per the current order, the vaccination would cost the beneficiary ₹500.As per the central government guidelines, the phase two vaccination centres must be government health facilities such as primary health centres, community health centres, Ayushman Bharat health and wellness centres, sub-division hospitals, district hospitals and medical college hospitals. All private hospitals empanelled under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (AB-PM JAY) and similar state health insurance schemes.The private health facilities must have adequate space for the vaccination process, basic cold chain equipment for storing the vaccine vials, have their team of vaccinators and staff and adequate facility for management of any AEFI cases. Although the guidelines also talk about advance self-registration, on-site registration and facilitated cohort registration, the local authorities and the possible private hospital still await more details.Dr Avdhut Bodamwhad, medical superintendent, Ruby Hall Clinic, which is one of the empanelled MPJAY hospitals, said, “We are yet to get any specific information about opening up our session sites for the vaccination of the general public. We currently have two of the four-session sites active, but we can open all four if the state permits.”“We are currently vaccinating frontline workers and our staff as we have about 3,000 people. We are awaiting more details,” he said.Dr Bharati said, “It is possible that the first few days beginning from March 1 would be for a dry run like the ones we had during the first phase. This could delay the ongoing phase-one vaccination. The state has promised no shortage of vaccines.”States and Union Territories have been asked to keep a vaccination scale-up plan ready which will include the granular weekly and fortnightly plans for scaling up the vaccination sites both within the government and private facilities and also the number of vaccine doses administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/42-sites-in-pune-city-shortlisted-for-free-covid-vaccine-shots-101614444309103.html
28-02-2021||Other||12% of healthcare workers have got second dose of Covid vaccine in Pune district||The district administration is now racing against time as the central government begins to vaccinate the general population. From March 1, the states have to begin vaccination for citizens above 60 years of age and those within the age bracket of 45 to 59 years with specified co-morbidities. This number alone would come to about 18 lakh in the district.However, the administration is currently lagging in vaccinating beneficiaries under the first phase itself as 12.07 % of the registered healthcare workers (HSCW’s) have got the second round of Covid vaccine dose while frontline workers (FLW’s) are yet to get their second dose.As per the state health department as of Friday (February 26), out of the 1,06,451 HCW’s in the district 73,493 have got their first dose and 12,853 have got the first and second doses.Also, out of the 84,154 expected beneficiaries, 37,131 FLW’s have got their first dose and will get the second dose in March (28 after receiving the first dose).Dr Ashish Bharati, chief health officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “Our vaccination drive for FLW’s and HCW’s has been halted by the state government for February 27 and 28, which cost us dearly. We could have vaccinated at least 8,000 workers in these two days if we were allowed to continue with the momentum.”“In the past two days we vaccinated more than the target and covered the maximum number of possible beneficiaries,” he said.The vaccination drive is likely to be hampered next week too as the state and the Centre would conduct a dry run of the Co-WIN app for the registration of the general public.The administration is now searching for additional sites which can be used to vaccinate seniors and those above 45 years with comorbidities. Along with the specifications mentioned by the central government, the site needs to have good internet connectivity which is a challenge for the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/12-of-healthcare-workers-have-got-second-dose-of-covid-vaccine-in-pune-dist-101614437768825.html

Chris Miller after he displayed a decal of an anti-government militia movement on his pickup truck parked at the U.S. Capitol during the deadly insurrection in January.The Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association asked for a state investigation Friday after photos of Miller's truck with a sticker for the Three Percenters surfaced on social media.Miller, a cattle farmer first elected in 2018, denied involvement with the group. He was in Washington, D.C., for former President Donald Trump's speech on Jan. 6. A day earlier, Miller's wife, freshman U.S. Rep. Mary Miller delivered a speech quoting Adolf Hitler that drew wide outrage.“My son received the sticker that was on my truck from a family friend who said that it represented patriotism and love of country,” Miller, of Oakland, said in a statement. “I have since removed the sticker.”Still, Kristina Zahorik, leader of the county chairs, submitted a request to the Office of the Legislative Inspector General to investigate Miller’s actions during the Jan. 6 insurrection.“Miller’s attendance at the rally that turned into a mob and insurrection of our nation’s Capitol is troubling, and to date many unanswered questions remain about his subsequent actions and whereabouts that day,” Zahorik said.Republican U.S. Rep.

28-02-2021||World||US children could receive coronavirus vaccine by year-end: Anthony Fauci||The United States could start vaccinating older children against Covid-19 by the fall and younger ones by year-end or early 2022, the White House's top pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci said Sunday.The mass vaccination of school-age children will allow millions of children to return sooner to in-person learning and ease the burden on millions of parents now caring for their offspring at home.School reopenings, an intensely debated matter, have varied sharply across the country, with some private and religious schools opening before public schools and teachers in some areas protesting any early return.But the decision Saturday by the US Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization to a new single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson has boosted the prospects for earlier reopenings."We now have three really efficacious vaccines," Fauci said on ABC's "This Week."For now, none of the three authorized vaccines in the US (also including Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) has been cleared for children under 16, but trials on children are under way.Children in high school -- roughly ages 14-18 in the United States -- should be able to get the vaccine "sometime this fall," Fauci told NBC's "Meet the Press.""I'm not sure it'll exactly be on the first day that school opens, but pretty close to that," he added.Data are still being compiled on the vaccines' safety and efficacy for children in elementary or middle school -- usually aged between five and 13 years old in the United States -- so "realistically" they many not be able to receive the vaccine until late 2021 or early 2022, Fauci said.Children and adolescents are less commonly infected with the virus than adults, and in-person learning in schools has not been associated with substantial community transmission.With Covid-19 still ravaging the US, the worst-hit country in the world, roughly half of students are currently attending school in person, the New York Times reported recently.Earlier this month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidelines urging schools to reopen safely and as soon as possible.The strategy emphasizes universal masking, handwashing and disinfection, as well as contact tracing. The plan spends relatively little time on the subject of ventilation -- where problems are more expensive to remediate -- despite this being the virus's main transmission route.The CDC recommends vaccination for teachers and staff as soon as supply is available, and calls for different approaches depending on the level of community transmission in a given area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-children-could-receive-coronavirus-vaccine-by-year-end-anthony-fauci-101614536434816.html

Moderna Inc's vaccine will be used, COGAT said.Israel has given at least one dose of Pfizer Inc's Covid-19 vaccine to more than half of its 9.3 million population, including Palestinians in East Jerusalem.But it has come under international criticism for not doing more to enable vaccination of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel captured the territories in the 1967 war. It quit Gaza in 2005, which is now under Islamist Hamas rule, but maintains a clampdown on the enclave's borders with Egypt's support.The Palestinians have received around 32,000 vaccine doses to date, for the 5.2 million people who live in the West Bank and Gaza.Israeli officials have said that, under the Oslo peace accords, the Palestinian health ministry is responsible for vaccinating people in Gaza and those parts of the West Bank where it has limited self-rule.Sunday's announcement drew a measured welcome from Dan Waites, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Israel and the Palestinian Territories."The Palestinian population remains, in the main, unprotected from Covid-19, and we would be glad to see more initiatives of this kind. We would like to see full, equitable access to vaccines for all Israelis and Palestinians," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-vaccinate-palestinian-labourers-against-covid19-101614533025081.html

We will have no further comment until the report is issued," special counsel to Cuomo Beth Garvey said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-backs-down-on-plan-to-review-his-alleged-sexual-misconduct-101614532839431.html
28-02-2021||World||Trump to proclaim himself as the future for Republicans in CPAC 2021 speech||Former President Donald Trump on Sunday will declare himself the dominant figure in the fractured Republican Party and attack President Joe Biden in his first major appearance since leaving the White House nearly six weeks ago."I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we began together four years ago is far from over," Trump will tell the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, according to speech excerpts released by his team."We are gathered this afternoon to talk about the future --the future of our movement, the future of our party, and the future of our beloved country," he will add.Trump’s tumultuous final weeks in office saw his supporters launch a deadly attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to block Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory, a win that Trump falsely claimed was tainted by widespread fraud.A civil war has erupted within the Republican Party with establishment figures like Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell eager to put Trump in the rear-view mirror and others, like Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham, believing the party's future depends on the energy of the pro-Trump conservative base."The Republican Party is united. The only division is between a handful of Washington D.C. establishment political hacks, and everybody else all over the country," Trump will say.Trump fervor at the four-day CPAC event has been so strong that Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. declared it "T-PAC" and participants rolled out a golden statue of the former president.Trump has discussed privately running again for president in 2024, according to advisers, but the speech excerpts gave no hint of what he might do."That's going to be a decision he makes down the road," Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel told CBS's "Face the Nation."In the short term, he is making plans to set up a superPAC political organization to support candidates who mirror his policies, an adviser said.Trump's speech will include attacks against Biden to try to position himself as the lead critic of the new president, including on immigration and security along the US border with Mexico, and the slow reopening of schools closed due to the pandemic."We all knew that the Biden administration was going to be bad--but none of us imagined just how bad they would be, and how far left they would go," Trump will say. "Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history."The Biden White House has made it clear it plans to ignore Trump's speech.“Our focus is certainly not on what President Trump is saying” at CPAC, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-proclaim-himself-as-the-future-for-republicans-in-cpac-2021-speech-101614531433139.html
28-02-2021||World||MyHeritage offers new AI tool to turn photos of the dead into ‘creepy’ videos||Genealogy website MyHeritage has unveiled a new tool, called DeepNostalgia, based on artificial intelligence (AI) that animates the faces in photographs. According to MyHeritage, the site has licensed the technology from an Israeli company D-ID that specialises in video reenactment using “deep learning”. The tool uses several drivers prepared by MyHeritage to animate the faces in photographs.“Each driver is a video consisting of a fixed sequence of movements and gestures. Deep Nostalgia can very accurately apply the drivers to a face in your still photo, creating a short video that you can share with your friends and family. The driver guides the movements in the animation so you can see your ancestors smile, blink, and turn their heads,” says the website.Since the feature requires a high-resolution face to apply the animation, MyHeritage has combined it with a photo enhancer to increase the resolution and sharpen the faces of small and blurry images, as is the case with old and historical photographs. The firm said that the technology doesn’t include speech to avoid the creation of “deepfake people”, however, they did create a voice for a reanimated Abraham Lincoln, the former president of the United States.Here’s the video:Read | TV network creates deepfake version of Queen Elizabeth’s Christmas speech, people share mixed reactionsIn its FAQs about the technology, the company admitted that the results of the feature can be controversial, adding that it’s “hard to stay indifferent to this technology.” “Some people love the Deep Nostalgia feature and consider it magical, while others find it creepy and dislike it,” the firm wrote. It has also requested people to use the feature in their own historical photos and not on photos featuring living people without their consent.Meanwhile, social media users have been sharing reanimated videos, which many have deemed unnerving, using the tool on the photographs of historical figures. They have shared the reanimated videos of Indian freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, philosopher Aurobindo Ghosh, and American scientist Rosalind Franklin among others.Here are some of the videos shared on social media:Kind of surreal to take a photo of the singularly inspiring Bhagat Singh -- a revolutionary voice in 1920s India, who was hung by the British in 1931, at the age of 24 -- run it through the Heritage AI algorithm, and see him reanimated. pic.twitter.com/CfC0Gu6GxkRosalind Franklin brought to life with #DeepNostalgia pic.twitter.com/DNQ3kzuf6hThe great master and teacher Aurobindo wrote, when he was young, a revolutionary spirit, and a restless mind, nearly a century ago: "The Time has perhaps come fot the Indian mind, long pre-ccupied with political and economic issues, for a widening of its horizon." pic.twitter.com/8U9BwxoE7ZWith our new Deep Nostalgia™, you can see how a person from an old photo could have moved and looked if they were captured on video!

28-02-2021||World||Biden in no rush to lift Venezuela sanctions, seeks 'serious steps' by Maduro||President Joe Biden’s administration is in “no rush” to lift U.S. sanctions on Venezuela but would consider easing them if President Nicolas Maduro takes confidence-building steps showing he is ready to negotiate seriously with the opposition, a White House official told Reuters.Signaling that the new U.S. president may be unlikely to loosen the screws on Venezuela anytime soon, the official emphasized that existing sanctions have enough special provisions to allow for humanitarian aid shipments to help Venezuelans cope with economic hardships and the Covid-19 pandemic.But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Maduro’s Socialist government has been “actively preventing the delivery of humanitarian assistance.”This suggests that for now Biden is prepared to stick with the specific sanctions, including crippling oil-sector penalties, imposed by former President Donald Trump on the OPEC nation, despite the failure to force Maduro from power.But Biden, by contrast, intends to move away from the mostly unilateral approach of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and enlist more countries to help seek a diplomatic solution, the official said in an interview.Biden’s administration has made clear it will continue to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president. Dozens of countries have backed Guaido’s claim following Maduro’s re-election in 2018 in a vote Western governments called a sham, though cracks recently have appeared in Guaido's international support.“We’re in no rush to lift sanctions,” the official said. “If the regime undertakes confidence-building measures that show that they're ready and willing to engage in real conversations with the opposition ... if they're ready to take serious steps, then we will consider the alleviation of sanctions."The official did not specify what steps Maduro would need to make but said he could not be allowed to use negotiations as a “delaying tactic” to consolidate power and divide the opposition, as he has been accused of doing in the past.Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet, has shown no signs of giving ground. Having retained support of the military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran, he has rejected or ignored previous demands for such concessions.The Biden administration also appears to have little sense of urgency for major gestures toward Cuba despite hopes for a softer approach after Trump, often citing its support for Maduro, rolled back historic Obama-era détente with Havana.Some Biden advisers had suggested earlier that he could start by loosening up the flow of remittances from Cuban Americans and ease restrictions on family travel to the Communist-ruled island.But while acknowledging such changes could have a positive impact, the official said a Cuba policy shift was not currently among Biden’s top priorities, which include the coronavirus pandemic, economic recovery and rebuilding alliances abroad. “Frankly, first things first,” the official said.There has also been no sign of any immediate plans to rescind Cuba’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, though Biden officials have said Trump’s last-minute decision to return Havana to the U.S. blacklist is under review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-in-no-rush-to-lift-venezuela-sanctions-seeks-serious-steps-by-maduro-101614525305234.html
28-02-2021||World||Andrew Cuomo's scandals dim luster of man dubbed ‘America’s governor’||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, less than a year after bravura performances in daily coronavirus briefings led to talk of a presidential run, instead finds himself facing multiple scandals and rumblings of a primary challenge.Revelations that his administration hid the number of people who died from the coronavirus in nursing homes, and by doing so underreported New York’s death toll, undercut his central claim to fame and have led to efforts to strip him of pandemic-era emergency powers.They’ve also raised questions about Cuomo’s leadership, especially after a Democratic state assemblyman accused him of threatening to destroy the lawmaker’s career for raising questions about the issue.Adding to that are two allegations of sexual harassment. In the first instance, Lindsey Boylan, a former economic-development aide, accused Cuomo in a Medium post of giving her an unwanted kiss, inviting her to play strip poker on a taxpayer-funded flight, and other abuse that led her to quit her job.On Saturday, a second former aide accused Cuomo of harassment, according to the New York Times. Charlotte Bennett, a former health policy adviser, said Cuomo had asked her questions about her sex life and made what she interpreted as sexual overtures. Bennett didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg News.Boylan tweeted early Sunday that Cuomo should resign, saying “his abuse of power never ends.”Cuomo has denied his call to Assemblyman Ron Kim was threatening, and rejected the harassment allegations as false. Four other state officials who flew with Cuomo when Boylan was present issued a statement through Cuomo’s office saying no such conversation happened.In a statement on Saturday, Cuomo said he had “tried to be supportive and helpful” when Bennett “opened up about being a sexual assault survivor.” Cuomo called for “a full and thorough outside review.” A former federal judge has been named to lead that process.The cascading incidents add to the political weight around Cuomo’s neck. In a statement on Saturday, Republican Representative Elise Stefanik of New York joined the calls for Cuomo to resign.The controversy for Cuomo, 63, comes after a long career that includes stints as a U.S. Cabinet official, state attorney general, and three terms as governor.The reviews were glowing for Cuomo in the early months of the pandemic, for his must-see briefings and heated rebukes of then-President Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic. The hashtag #PresidentCuomo was trending even as Joe Biden was struggling to campaign under pandemic restrictions.But recently, State Attorney General Letitia James released a report on Jan. 28 alleging the Cuomo administration undercounted Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50%, and may have obscured data available to assess the risk to patients.The state revealed that thousands of nursing-home deaths occurred in hospitals or outside the facilities, information that had been left out of state counts. More than 12,300 patients from New York nursing homes, assisted living, and adult care facilities have died since March 2020, according to Feb. 25 state data. Another 3,000 patients are presumed to have died of the disease, but their causes of death have not been confirmed.New York trails only California for the total number of people who have died from coronavirus, with 46,000, but its current case rate per million residents is in the middle of U.S. states.Now Cuomo is facing intense questions over whether his administration’s policies led to an unnecessary increase of virus deaths among elderly nursing home residents.Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo’s spokesman, rejected the criticism in an emailed statement.“New Yorkers know it was the governor who worked night and day to get them through the worst of this pandemic,” Azzopardi said. “From the strongest gun safety laws in the nation to a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition, he has a nationally significant record of progressive accomplishments that Washington is trying to match.”Still, Democratic circles are already abuzz with talk about who might run against Cuomo in the 2022 primary, an unthinkable concept when he was topping the charts for his Covid response. There’s no limit to the number of consecutive terms a New York governor may serve.‘Earned’ PrimaryNew York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who’s been approached to run against Cuomo in a primary, said he’s been pretty explicit with his criticism of Cuomo’s handling of the pandemic and his administration’s performance.“As I’ve said, the governor has earned himself a primary for a number of reasons -- most of which we’ve known about for a long time, but now the worst of the governor is coming out at a time when New Yorkers need the best of their government,” he said in an emailed statement. Williams said he remains committed to his city post.Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic consultant who worked on some of Cuomo’s campaigns, called the governor’s downfall “Shakespearean.”“The compassionate new Andrew that was created suddenly became a fraud,” he said. “The very thing that made him the hero made him the villain.”At the beginning of the pandemic, when New York was the nation’s Covid epicenter, Cuomo held daily briefings that were aired nationally. He shared data, he answered reporters’ questions, he told stories about his family.Leadership LessonsThe briefings, a stark contrast to the tone and substance to those coming from Trump’s White House, drew millions of viewers, earning him the nickname “America’s Governor.”In October, Cuomo released a book offering leadership lessons from the pandemic, and held up New York’s response as a national model. The next month, his televised briefings received an Emmy award.That was premature, said New York state Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt, a Republican.“As we learn more, I think history may tell a different story about this response and we may look at this years from now or even months from now and we may have a different view,” Ortt said. “It’s not the person who’s winning in the first quarter, it’s the person who’s winning in the fourth quarter.”Cuomo’s job performance rating, which hit 63% at the height of the pandemic, has cooled to 56%, according to Siena College polls. A Marist poll released Feb. 23 showed approval of his handling of the pandemic had dropped to 54% from 72%, with a majority of voters saying Cuomo did something wrong in his handling of nursing homes.‘No Heart or Ears’Critics have seized on the moment, even though the approval numbers are hardly fatal. Bills that attempt to strip Cuomo’s emergency powers have failed to take hold as lawmakers worry about the fallout from revoking his authority.State Senator Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat who heads the health committee, said he and other lawmakers have long criticized the governor, especially for keeping his inner circle small and what he said was a focus on politics over policy. Rivera described the administration as “all brain and guts, and no heart or ears.”Sheinkopf said Cuomo’s troubles show that the high-profile job of governor of New York -- the launching pad to the White House for four presidents, most recently Franklin D. Roosevelt -- has become too politically fraught to lead to higher office.The last Democratic governor of New York who was considered a serious contender for the presidency was Cuomo’s father, Mario, whose famous indecisiveness led him to not run in 1988 and 1992 and to later turn down a Supreme Court nomination that was a safe bet for confirmation.Ultimate SurvivorThe younger Cuomo seemed destined for big things as well, serving as secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton, marrying a member of the Kennedy dynasty, and bouncing back from a failed bid for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002 with a headline-making turn as attorney general.Since being elected governor in 2010, Cuomo has picked up critics among progressive Democrats by cutting deals with Republicans and working closely with a group that helped keep the state Senate in GOP hands from 2011 to 2019.Still, he’s fought off challenges from the left before, including an attention-grabbing but ultimately lopsided primary contest with “Sex and the City” actress Cynthia Nixon in 2018.But while Sheinkopf said things look pretty bad for Cuomo now, he may still win a fourth term, a feat even his father couldn’t pull off.“I’ve worked in American politics in 44 states, governors, congressmen, you name it,” said Sheinkopf. “If anybody could survive this, it’s Cuomo.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/andrew-cuomo-s-scandals-dim-luster-of-man-dubbed-america-s-governor-101614524714335.html

The sight of bodies washing ashore later has sadly become too familiar,” she added.Sunday's shipwreck was the latest along the Central Mediterranean migration route. At least 41 migrants were reported dead last week, part of a group of some 120 migrants on a dinghy that left the North African country on Feb. 18.Libya has become the major transit point for African and Arab migrants hoping to reach Europe, after the North African country plunged into a bloody civil war following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.Smugglers often pack desperate families into ill-equipped rubber boats that stall and founder along the perilous Central Mediterranean route. Over the last several years, hundreds of thousands of migrants have reached Europe either on their own or after being rescued at sea.Thousands have drowned along the way. Others were intercepted and returned to Libya to be left at the mercy of armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers that lack adequate food and water, according to rights groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-15-europe-bound-migrants-have-died-at-sea-off-libya-101614523532300.html
28-02-2021||World||Fauci worried that US coronavirus cases will stick at 70,000 a day||The baseline level of coronavirus cases needs to fall further before the U.S. can confidently resume normal activities, even as the vaccine rollout accelerates, Anthony Fauci said.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made the rounds of Sunday talk shows at a moment when news related to the pandemic has been positive, but fresh concerns are emerging.“We’ve seen what happens when you pull back prematurely,” Fauci said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “We will be” victorious over the coronavirus, “but we’re not there yet.”Even though cases have plunged from 300,000 a day to about 70,000, “that baseline’s too high,” Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “The thing you don’t want is to have a plateauing.”The country added 75,194 new cases on Friday, compared with the weekly average of almost 69,000.Fauci was asked on CBS about an incident at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida this weekend, where South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem got wild applause for her criticism of him.“I don’t know if you agree with me, but Dr. Fauci is wrong a lot,” Noem said on Saturday.“I’m sure you can get a standing ovation by saying I’m wrong,” Fauci said. “The numbers don’t lie.”On Monday, the U.S. passed the milestone of 500,000 deaths to Covid-19; that number is now closer to 512,000. The nation’s first death from the virus was announced during the CPAC meeting a year ago.The FDA gave formal approval Saturday to a third vaccine for use in the U.S. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which requires only a single shot, is expected to quickly accelerate the number of people who are fully protected once the company ramps up production later this spring. Vaccine Tracker: More than 236 million shots given worldwideJohnson & Johnson is prepared to ship 3 million to 4 million doses in the week ahead.“You now have three highly efficacious vaccines, for sure,” Fauci said on NBC. “If I would go to a place where they had J&J, I would have no hesitancy whatsoever to take it.”While the U.S. vaccine rollout has accelerated and is poised to do so further, health officials are worried that states will move too quickly in lifting restrictions, even as more contagious variants are gaining ground.California this month resumed outdoor high school sporting events, including football games, for first time in a year; and New York City resumed indoor dining on Feb. 12. Several states have eased mask mandates.“We understand the need and the desire, understandably, to want to just pull back because things are going in the right direction,” Fauci said.“But you’ve got to get that baseline down lower than it is now, particularly in light of the fact that we have some worrisome variants that are in places like California and New York and others that we’re keeping our eye on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-worried-that-us-coronavirus-cases-will-stick-at-70-000-a-day-101614523530173.html
28-02-2021||World||Brief history of CPAC that continues to maintain influence over US Conservatives||Former US President Donald Trump will address the Conservative Political Action Conference, better known as CPAC, on Sunday. This will be Trump’s first major post presidential appearance in which he is expected to criticize his successor, President Joe Biden. Other than Trump who has been a frequent CPAC speaker, Republican icons including nine sitting senators; two governors; 36 members of the US House— including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy — and various high-profile conservative media personalities and activists attended the CPAC this year. Trump has been keeping a relatively low profile since he retired from the White House to Palm Beach, Florida, in January. He only appeared last week to conduct a series of phone-in interviews to commemorate the death of conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.Founded in 1974, CPAC which is an annual event that brings conservative politicians, public intellectuals, pundits, and issue activists together in Washington, DC to discuss strategies for achieving their goals through the electoral and policy process is being held this year in Orlando, Florida. The conference consists of topical breakout sessions and major speeches from conservative leaders and sponsored parties. CPAC also conducts an annual “straw poll,” which surveys attendees on a range of issues, including who they’d prefer as the Republican nominee for president,In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, the then California governor Ronald Reagan gave the keynote address at CPAC. This helped in electing Reagan as the president. Since then, the event has become a meeting ground for various strains of the conservative movement.In addition to Reagan, the platform also helped George W. Bush in gaining wider popularity amongst conservative circles.The tea party movement of the Republican party also made itself known at the CPAC in 2010 after which the populist wave took over the party and eventually resulted in Trump being elected to the White House.Trump was a CPAC speaker even before announcing his presidential run in the summer of 2015. He attended the conference in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In 2016, CPAC was divided between traditional conservatives and Trump supporters and the straw poll conducted chose Ted Cruz as the preferred nominee for the post of the President.Trump won the 2016 nomination and the presidential election, surprising CPAC. But the fondness between the conference and Trump continues, and is not expected to end anytime soon!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-brief-history-of-cpac-that-continues-to-maintain-influence-over-conservatives-101614522931483.html
28-02-2021||World||Myanmar’s deadliest day since military coup leaves at least 18 dead||Myanmar saw its deadliest day since the Feb. 1 coup, with the United Nations saying authorities killed at least 18 protesters in a stark escalation of violence to quell persistent demonstrations against military rule.The deaths came after soldiers and police officers fired live ammunition into crowds in six cities across Myanmar, which also left more than 30 people wounded, UN Human Rights Office Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a statement on Sunday. Myanmar’s government said 12 people died.“We strongly condemn the escalating violence against protests in Myanmar and call on the military to immediately halt the use of force against peaceful protesters,” Shamdasani said.The rising death toll may increase pressure on governments around the world to take more action against Myanmar’s generals, who refused to recognize a landslide election victory by Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party in November. The Biden administration has announced sanctions targeting the country’s military leaders, while urging a return to democracy.“In shooting against unarmed citizens, the security forces have shown a blatant disregard for international law, and must be held to account,” said Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs. “Violence will not give legitimacy to the illegal over-throwing of the democratically-elected government.”Prior to this weekend, only three protesters had died among hundreds of thousands that have protested almost daily across the country. Yet the country has become increasingly ungovernable as more people join the protest movement, leaving hospitals understaffed, containers stacking up at ports and bank ATMs running out of cash.The Myanmar Police Force announced Sunday night that 571 protesters had been detained in 11 provinces.On Saturday, the junta fired Kyaw Moe Tun, Myanmar’s permanent representative to the UN, after he urged the international community not to accept the military regime and instead recognize the results of the November general election.“He failed to follow the state’s orders and instructions, committed treason, showed his loyalty” to the parliamentary committee led by Suu Kyi’s party, and “misused his authoritative powers as an ambassador of Myanmar,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday.Southeast Asian foreign ministers are making arrangements to meet this week to discuss the situation, Japan’s Kyodo news agency reported on Saturday. Most members of the 10-nation group have expressed a willingness to join, and the military-appointed foreign minister of Myanmar, an Asean member, has been asked to participate, according to Kyodo. Calls to Myanmar’s foreign ministry for comments on the meeting were unanswered.Riot police arrested five journalists across the country on Saturday for reporting on anti-coup protests, according to Myanmar Journalists Network. One of them is reported to be a photojournalist with the Associated Press, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a rights group.“The Myanmar security forces’ clear escalation in use of lethal force in multiple towns and cities across the country in response to mostly peaceful anti-coup protesters is outrageous and unacceptable, and must be immediately halted,” said Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. “Live ammunition should not be used to control or disperse protests and lethal force can only be used to protect life or prevent serious injury.”The National League for Democracy plans to put together a parallel government that could engage with the international community, the Financial Times reported, citing a party official who is on the run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-deadliest-day-since-military-coup-leaves-at-least-18-dead-101614522101287.html

Several large groups of armed men operate in the area and are known to kidnap for ransom money and the release of their jailed cohorts.“I pray for these girls, so that they may return home soon,'' the pope said. ”I am close to their families and to them,'' Francis said, asking people to join him in prayer.A resident of the area said the gunmen also attacked a nearby military camp and checkpoint, preventing soldiers from interfering with the mass abduction.On Saturday, authorities in Nigeria announced that nearly 40 students, teachers and relatives abducted on Feb. 17 from a school in northern Nigeria have been freed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-prays-for-liberation-of-317-kidnapped-nigerian-students-101614521031647.html

According to a Daily Mail report, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has forced Sanjeev Gupta, an Indian-origin British geologist, to work from home while Perseverance rover is getting ready for exploring the Martian surface after safely landing in the Jezero Crater.The mission control is at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory (JPL) in Southern California, where the Perseverance rover was built. “I should be at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, in a series of offices each one about three times bigger than this lounge, full of hundreds of scientists and engineers with their heads buried in laptops surrounded by large screens,” Gupta told the British daily.The 55-year-old geology expert at the Imperial College of London has been a part of Nasa’s Mars exploration program for a long time. He was a participating scientist and long term science planner on Nasa’s Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover mission for exploring Gale Crater. Gupta has co-authored a study on the existence of an ancient lakebed in Gale Crater which was published in Science journal in 2015.Jezero crater has also been determined as an ancient lakebed that dried up as the climate of the planet changed. Perseverance rover will be used to explore the rocks and return samples through future missions. Gupta and his colleagues will start directing the rover to various spots to drill the required samples.The team is currently working round the clock, prompting the professor to rent an apartment in Lewisham so his family can enjoy undisturbed sleep in the nearby home, reported the Daily Mail. His flat has five computers and two other screens for Zoom-style meetings with fellow scientists.Meanwhile, the Perseverance rover has been sending back photographs of the landing site to mission control and Nasa recently released the first 360-degree panorama taken by Mastcam-Z, a dual-camera system equipped with a zoom function.The Mastcam-Z sent 142 individual images after rotating its mast 360 degrees on the third Martian day of the mission and the US space agency stitched them together to create the instrument's first 360-degree panorama.A post shared by NASA (@nasa)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-nasa-scientist-controlling-perseverance-rover-from-his-london-flat-101614518755141.html
28-02-2021||World||What is Bangladesh's controversial digital security law?||Bangladesh saw another day of protests on Sunday following the death of a prominent writer and government critic in jail, with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets.Mushtaq Ahmed, 53, collapsed and died on Thursday 10 months after being arrested under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act (DSA) for comments on Facebook criticising the government's response to coronavirus.AFP looks at the legislation, which has alarmed foreign governments and which rights groups say is being used to silence dissent in the country of 168 million people under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.What is the law?Bangladesh's parliament passed the DSA in late 2018 after several major instances of deadly sectarian violence sparked by posts on social media, but the wording is vague and its provisions broad.It criminalises engaging in "propaganda" against the "spirit" of the 1971 Bangladeshi war of independence, the national anthem, the flag and the nation's founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of the current prime minister.Those falling foul of the law face hefty fines and lengthy jail sentences, even life imprisonment for certain repeat offences. Arrests can be made without a warrant."We've built a digital Bangladesh, and now it is our duty to provide the people with digital security," Hasina said on Saturday.How widely is it used?Citing data from Bangladesh's Cyber Crime Tribunal, Amnesty International says nearly 2,000 cases have been filed under the DSA, with journalists particular targets.Last year at least 10 editors of national and regional dailies and online news platforms faced legal charges under the DSA following critical reporting on leaders of the ruling Awami League party, according to Amnesty.Others falling foul include people like Ahmed, a successful crocodile farmer who became a vociferous critic of the government. He was arrested in May along with several others including rights campaigner Didar Bhuiyan and Ahmed Kabir Kishore, a cartoonist.According to rights group Article 19, which monitors press freedom in many countries, "freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of the media are being severely violated under the Digital Security Act".Rights groups say arrests have increased since the coronavirus pandemic.Members of Bangladesh's minority Hindu community have also been detained and jailed under the law for hurting the religious sentiments of majority Muslims.In September, for example, a young Hindu man was jailed for seven years under the DSA for posting comments on Facebook found to have blasphemed the Prophet Mohammed.What else has Hasina done?Hasina, 73, has ruled the country with a firm hand since coming to power in 2009 in a landslide election victory.She has used her power to settle some old scores, with several army officers accused of killing her father and much of her family in 1975 executed.At least five Islamist leaders and a senior opposition leader have also been executed for war crimes. Rights groups raised questions about the fairness of the trial.Hasina's main political opposition has been hobbled, with thousands of its activists behind bars on what they say are trumped-up charges.Her ailing arch-rival Khaleda Zia was jailed for corruption charges that the opposition says are politically motivated. Last March she was let out for medical treatment.Hasina was easily re-elected in 2014 and 2018, and both votes were clouded by allegations of irregularities.Earlier this year an Al Jazeera documentary alleged close links between Hasina's inner circle, the military and organised crime. The government denied the claims and a court ordered the programme removed from the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-bangladesh-s-controversial-digital-security-law-101614518108309.html
28-02-2021||World||UN warns of mass famine in Yemen ahead of donor conference||A UN humanitarian agency on Sunday warned that more than 16 million people in Yemen would go hungry this year, with already some half a million people in the war-torn country living in famine-like conditions.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said the risk of large-scale famine in the Arab world’s poorest country “has never been more acute,” adding that the years-long conflict, economic decline, and institutional collapse created enormous humanitarian needs in all sectors.The stark warning comes a day before a pledging conference co-hosted by Sweden and Switzerland. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will appeal for $3.85 billion in relief aid for Yemen this year.The response to the UN appeal is unlikely to meet expectations, given that the coronavirus pandemic and its devastating consequences hit economies around the globe. Wealthy Gulf donors such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which contributed generously to UN appeals in 2018 and 2019, cut back drastically on aid to Yemen last year.Yemen’s war started in 2014 when the Houthi rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north. The Saudi-led, US-backed coalition intervened months later to dislodge the rebels and restore the internationally recognized government. The conflict has killed some 130,000 people and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.Monday’s pledging conference comes as the Iranian-backed Houthis renewed their offensive on the central province of Marib, stoking fears of a new humanitarian crisis in a region that hosts the largest displaced population in the country, according to local authorities.The province, the location of the ancient Great Marib Dam, has served as a sort of haven for around 1 million Yemenis who have fled Houthi offensives since the start of the war, according to UN figures.The rebels have renewed their attacks on the oil-rich province, a holdout against them, but have faced stiff resistance and heavy airstrikes from the Saudi-led coalition. Hundreds, mostly Houthis, have died in the fighting.OCHA said the fighting in Marib has displaced more than 8,000 civilian people, particularly from the district of Sirwah, which hosts around 30,000 displaced people in at least 14 camps. Sirwah has seen the heaviest fighting, it said.The agency warned about possible displacement of another 380,000 people if fighting reached the actual city of Marib, capital of the province where camps for displaced people are already crowded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-of-mass-famine-in-yemen-ahead-of-donor-conference-101614517396654.html
28-02-2021||World||US expresses grave concerns over reports of abuses in Ethiopia||The US is “gravely concerned by reported atrocities and the overall deteriorating situation” in Ethiopia's Tigray region, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in the toughest statement yet from the US on Ethiopia's ongoing conflict.Accounts of atrocities by Ethiopian forces against residents of the country's northwestern region of Tigray were detailed in reports by The Associated Press and by Amnesty International. Ethiopia's central government and regional officials in Tigray both believe that each other's governments are illegitimate after the pandemic disrupted elections.“We strongly condemn the killings, forced removals and displacements, sexual assaults, and other extremely serious human rights violations and abuses by several parties that multiple organizations have reported in Tigray. We are also deeply concerned by the worsening humanitarian crisis,” said Blinken in a statement.Those responsible for abuses in Tigray must be held accountable, Blinken added, calling for an independent, international investigation into the reports of human rights violations.The US urged the immediate withdrawal from Tigray of troops from the neighboring country of Eritrea and from Amhara, the Ethiopian region bordering Tigray. It also called for the Ethiopian government to cease all hostilities in Tigray and to allow “unhindered delivery of assistance to those in Tigray.”USAID will deploy a disaster assistance team to deliver "life-saving assistance,” Blinkin said.Emphasizing the US concern over the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, raised the issue in a series of bilateral meetings with UN Security Council members.Alarm is growing over the fate of the Tigray region’s 6 million people as fighting is reportedly as fierce as ever between Ethiopian and allied forces and those supporting the now-fugitive Tigray leaders who once dominated Ethiopia’s government.No one knows how many thousands of civilians have been killed since November when the conflict began. Humanitarian officials have warned that a growing number of people might be starving to death in Tigray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expresses-grave-concerns-over-reports-of-abuses-in-ethiopia-101614516750214.html

It's really, really important,” said William, who was joined on the video call by wife Catherine/Kate Middleton."We've spoken to a lot of people about it and the uptake has been amazing so far. We've got to keep it going so the younger generations also feel that it's really important for them to have it,” he said.Shivali Modha has been shielding since the start of the pandemic due to a pre-existing medical condition and was joined on the video call by husband Hiren and their daughters Shyaama, 11, and Jyoti, 9.“The idea of this vaccination is new but the more people that get it then you realise that actually it's helping and the numbers are showing that, figures are coming down – all positive things,” said Modha.The royals listened as Modha – who has type 2 diabetes – said how posts on social media had concerned her, but that speaking to members of her family who had received their vaccine, and also medical professionals and the charity Diabetes UK had encouraged her to get a vaccine."So, it's great that Shivali you're taking the time to work it out and come to the conclusion that 'I need to do this' because social media is awash sometimes with lots of rumours and misinformation, so we have to be a little bit careful who we believe and where we get our information from,” said William."Especially for those who are clinically vulnerable as well, it's so important that those vaccinations are done, so good luck," he added.The latest royal intervention comes days after the Queen, in a video call with health officials, had spoken about how she had found her own experience of getting her first vaccine dose last month painless, and encouraged people to think about others and get their vaccine when called by the National Health Service (NHS).The 94-year-old monarch backed the NHS-led vaccination programme in the video call with health officials coordinating the rollout across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. She and husband, 99-year-old Prince Philip, received their first of two doses last month.Vaccinations are now being administered at more than 1,600 sites across England, including mosques, museums and rugby grounds, with the distribution of centres meaning 98 per cent of the country lives within 10 miles of at least one vaccination service.More than 18 million people have now had a first vaccine dose, equivalent to one in three adults in the UK, with July 31 as the government target to cover all adults.The vaccine rollout – currently involving the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs – has entered its next phase, after everyone in the top four priority groups was offered a jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-backs-anti-covid-19-vaccines-in-video-call-with-indian-origin-family-101614516900744.html
28-02-2021||World||Remove me if you can: Nepal PM Oli challenges Prachanda||Nepal's embattled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Sunday challenged the ruling Nepal Communist Party's splinter faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' to remove him from the top post if he can.Addressing an event in his home district, Jhapa, Prime Minister Oli challenged the Prachanda-led faction to table a vote of no confidence motion and endorse that, My Republica newspaper reported."K P Oli is still the parliamentary party leader of the NCP. He is the party chairman as well as the prime minister," 69-year-old Oli said. "If you have restored parliament, remove KP Oli from the prime ministerial post."Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).In a landmark ruling, a five-member constitutional bench led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher last week annulled the Oli government's "unconstitutional" decision to dissolve the 275-member lower house of Parliament. The court ordered the government to summon the House session within the next 13 days.The ruling party suffered a vertical split following Oli’s decision to dissolve the lower house."Remove me if you can. If I am ousted, I’ll emerge victorious with a two-thirds majority in the next election," Prime Minister Oli was quoted as saying by the paper.Prachanda has been making efforts to garner support from the opposition Nepali Congress and Janata Samajbadi parties in an apparent bid to oust Oli from power.Oli's Press Advisor Surya Thapa last week said the prime minister will not resign immediately and implement the Supreme Court’s verdict against him by facing Parliament.Oli is under pressure to step down following the court verdict.NCP Vice-president Bamdev Gautam, who maintained a balance between Oli and his rival Prachanda, last week urged the prime minister to step down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remove-me-if-you-can-nepal-pm-oli-challenges-prachanda-101614516763429.html
28-02-2021||World||US Supreme Court could put new limits on voting rights lawsuits||Eight years after carving the heart out of a landmark voting rights law, the Supreme Court is looking at putting new limits on efforts to combat racial discrimination in voting.The justices are taking up a case about Arizona restrictions on ballot collection and another policy that penalizes voters who cast ballots in the wrong precinct.The high court's consideration comes as Republican officials in the state and around the country have proposed more than 150 measures, following last year’s elections, to restrict voting access that civil rights groups say would disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic voters.A broad Supreme Court ruling would make it harder to fight those efforts in court. Arguments are set for Tuesday via telephone, because of the coronavirus pandemic.“It would be taking away one of the big tools, in fact, the main tool we have left now, to protect voters against racial discrimination,” said Myrna Perez, director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s voting rights and elections program.Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, said the high court case is about ballot integrity, not discrimination. “This is about protecting the franchise, not disenfranchising anyone,” said Brnovich, who will argue the case on Tuesday.President Joe Biden narrowly won Arizona last year, and since 2018, the state has elected two Democratic senators.The justices will be reviewing an appeals court ruling against a 2016 Arizona law that limits who can return early ballots for another person and against a separate state policy of discarding ballots if a voter goes to the wrong precinct.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the ballot-collection law and the state policy discriminate against minority voters in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act and that the law also violates the Constitution.The Voting Rights Act, first enacted in 1965, was extremely effective against discrimination at the ballot box because it forced state and local governments, with a history of discrimination, including Arizona, to get advance approval from the Justice Department or a federal court before making any changes to elections.In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the portion of the law known as Section 5 could no longer be enforced because the population formula for determining which states were covered hadn’t been updated to take account of racial progress.Congress “must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a conservative majority. “It cannot rely simply on the past.”Democrats in Congress will try again to revive the advance approval provision of the voting rights law. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act failed in the last Congress, when Republicans controlled the Senate and President Donald Trump was in the White House.But another part of the law, Section 2, applies nationwide and still prohibits discrimination in voting on the basis of race. Civil rights groups and voters alleging racial bias have to go to court and prove their case either by showing intentional discrimination in passing a law or that the results of the law fall most heavily on minorities.The new Supreme Court case mainly concerns how plaintiffs can prove discrimination based on the law’s results.The arguments are taking place against the backdrop of the 2020 election, in which there was a massive increase in early voting and mailed-in ballots because of the pandemic. Trump and his Republican supporters challenged the election results by advancing claims of fraud that were broadly rejected by state and federal courts.But many Republicans continue to question the election’s outcome, despite the absence of evidence. GOP elected officials have responded by proposing to restrict early voting and mailed-in ballots, as well as toughen voter identification laws.The challenged Arizona provisions remained in effect in 2020 because the case was still making its way through the courts.But Brnovich said last year’s voting is another reason the justices should side with the state. “I think part of the lesson of 2020 was that when people don’t believe that elections have integrity or that their vote is being protected, it will lead to undermining the public’s confidence in the system,” Brnovich said.Civil rights groups said the court should not use this case to make it harder to root out racial discrimination, which “still poses a unique threat to our democracy,” as the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund put it in a brief.Nearly 75 businesses, including PayPal, Levi Strauss and Impossible Foods, joined in a brief urging the court to “fully preserve the Voting Rights Act."The Justice Department will not be part of Tuesday’s arguments, a rarity in a voting rights case.The Trump administration backed Arizona. The Biden administration, in a somewhat cryptic letter to the court, said this month that it believes “neither Arizona measure violates Section 2’s results test,” but doesn’t like the way its predecessor analyzed the issues.The suggestion from the new administration could give the court a narrow way to uphold the Arizona provisions without making any significant changes to voting discrimination law.A decision is expected by early summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-could-put-new-limits-on-voting-rights-lawsuits-101614516073140.html
28-02-2021||World||Saudi columnists tell US President to not bully Riyadh||Saudi Arabia's sovereignty is a red line, Saudi columnists said on Sunday, ramping up rhetoric in defense of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after a US intelligence report implicated him in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Prince Mohammed, de facto ruler of the US-allied Gulf powerhouse, has denied any involvement in the 2018 murder of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The US administration on Friday imposed sanctions on some of those involved, but spared the prince. Washington released an intelligence report saying the crown prince had approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi."America does not have the right to bully a strategic regional ally and it is not in its interest to let domestic differences harm its regional interests and those of its partners," Khaled al-Malik wrote in local Al Jazirah newspaper.President Joe Biden's decision to publish the report withheld by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump, who enjoyed strong ties with Prince Mohammed, brings with it a refocusing of Washington's stance on dealing with the kingdom, on its human rights record, and on its lucrative arms purchases.Malik said Saudi Arabia, which has relied on the United States for its defence including during the first Gulf War and after 2019 attacks on its massive oil infrastructure, could look to China and Russia for weapons."But the kingdom prefers America due to their historic and strategic ties and common goals," he said, referring to Iran.Biden, who has ordered a review of Saudi arms sales, said his administration would make an announcement on Saudi Arabia on Monday.Abdullah al-Otaibi, writing in London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper which is Saudi-owned, said the kingdom, Washington's oldest Arab ally, was "not a banana republic to be shaken by threats".The Saudi government has repeated previous statements that Khashoggi's killing was a heinous crime by a rogue group, for which a Saudi court jailed eight people last year."We want to strengthen deep-rooted ties (with the US) but not at the expense of our sovereignty. Our judiciary and our decisions are a red line," Fahim al-Hamid wrote in Okaz newspaper.Since the US report was released, many Saudis have flooded Twitter with the hashtag "We are all Mohammed bin Salman".Saudi Arabia's highest religious authority issued a statement on Sunday rejecting the report as "false and unacceptable". The head of the kingdom's morality police tweeted that it was a duty under Islam to defend the kingdom and its leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-columnists-tell-us-president-to-not-bully-riyadh-101614514928589.html
28-02-2021||World||Germany limits travel from French region over Covid-19 virus variant||Germany announced Sunday that travelers from France’s northeastern Moselle region will face additional restrictions due to the high rate of variant coronavirus cases there.Germany's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said it would add Moselle to the list of “variant of concern” areas that already includes countries such as the Czech Republic, Portugal and the United Kingdom.Travelers from those areas must produce a recent negative coronavirus test before entering Germany.The Moselle region in northeastern France includes the city of Metz and borders the German states of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate.Clement Beaune, the French minister for European affairs, said France regrets the decision and is in negotiations with Germany to try to lighten the measures for 16,000 inhabitants of Moselle who work across the border. Specifically, he said France does not want them to face the daily PCR virus tests that Germany has applied elsewhere to travelers along some borders.“We don’t want that,” he said.He said France is pushing for the use of easier, faster testing methods and for tests every 2-3 days rather than daily. More talks were expected later Sunday, he said.The Robert Koch Institute recorded 7,890 newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Germany over the past day, taking the total to over 2.4 million cases. The death toll rose by 157 to 70,045.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-limits-travel-from-french-region-over-virus-variant-101614516179981.html
28-02-2021||World||Biden team readies wider economic package after virus relief||Looking beyond the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, President Joe Biden and lawmakers are laying the groundwork for another top legislative priority — a long-sought boost to the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure that could run into Republican resistance to a hefty price tag.Biden and his team have begun discussions on the possible outlines of an infrastructure package with members of Congress, particularly mindful that Texas' recent struggles with power outages and water shortages after a brutal winter storm present an opportunity for agreement on sustained spending on infrastructure.Gina McCarthy, Biden’s national climate adviser, told The Associated Press that the deadly winter storm in Texas should be a “wake-up call” for the need for energy systems and other infrastructure that are more reliable and resilient.“The infrastructure is not built to withstand these extreme weather conditions,” said Liz Sherwood-Randall, a homeland security aide to the president. “We know that we can’t just react to extreme weather events. We need to plan for them and prepare for them.”A White House proposal could come out in March.“Now is the time to be aggressive,” said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a former South Bend, Indiana, mayor who knows potholes.At a conference with state and local highway officials Thursday, he referred to the often-promised, never-achieved mega-initiative on roads, bridges and the like from the Trump administration.“I know you are among those who are working and waiting most patiently, or maybe impatiently, for the moment when Infrastructure Week will no longer be a kind of Groundhog’s Day promise — but actually be something that delivers generational investments,” he said.Much of America's infrastructure — roads, bridges, public drinking and water systems, dams, airports, mass transit systems and more — is in need of major restoration after years of underfunding, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, it gave the national infrastructure an overall grade of D.Both chambers of Congress will use as starting points their unsuccessful efforts to get infrastructure bills through the last session.Democrats passed a $1.5 trillion package in the House last year, but it went nowhere with the Trump administration and the Republican-led Senate. A Senate panel approved narrower bipartisan legislation in 2019 focused on reauthorizing federal transportation programs. It, too, flamed out as the U.S. turned its focus to elections and Covid-19.Biden has talked bigger numbers, and some Democrats are now urging him to bypass Republicans in the closely divided Congress to address a broader range of priorities urged by interest groups.During the presidential campaign, Biden pledged to deploy $2 trillion on infrastructure and clean energy, but the White House has not ruled out an even higher price tag. McCarthy said Biden's upcoming plan will specifically aim at job creation, such as with investments to boost “workers that have been left behind” by closed coal mines or power plants, as well as communities located near polluting refineries and other hazards.“He’s been a long fan of investing in infrastructure — long outdated — long overdue, I should say,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday. “But he also wants to do more on caregiving, help our manufacturing sector, do more to strengthen access to affordable health care. So the size — the package — the components of it, the order, that has not yet been determined.”Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, recently told the White House that he's ready to use the budget maneuver known as reconciliation to pass a broad economic recovery package with only Democratic votes. That drew stern warnings from Republicans who have already closed ranks against Democrats’ Covid-19 relief bill.West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said there's bipartisan support for ambitious steps on infrastructure. But that "should not extend to a multitrillion-dollar package that is stocked full with other ideologically driven, one-size-fits-all policies that tie the hands of our states and our communities,” she said.Capito will be helping to craft bipartisan legislation on the Senate side.Rep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, told the AP that he foresees a comprehensive House package that will go beyond roads, bridges and public transit.He also expects it to have money for water systems, broadband and the power grid — addressing a weak infrastructure laid bare after the crippling blackouts in Texas.He’s not ready to talk overall costs yet. DeFazio, D-Ore., said it will be up to the Biden administration and the House Ways and Means Committee to figure out how to pay for it.DeFazio said General Motors' recently announced goal of going largely electric by 2035 demonstrates the need for massive spending on charging stations across the country. Biden campaigned on a plan to install 500,000 charging stations by the end of 2030.“I’m totally willing to work with (Republicans) if they’re willing to recognize climate change," DeFazio said, “or if they don’t want to recognize climate change, they can just recognize that electric semis and electric vehicles are a flood on the horizon and we’ve got to get ahead of it.”Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., expressed a similar sentiment, urging strong action on carbon emissions and the vehicle charging stations to help achieve a “full transition to electric." She also wants states to have more federal grants for infrastructure repairs after natural disasters and extreme weather.At the Senate hearing where she spoke, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said there's bipartisan support among governors for relieving congestion, cutting red tape, leveraging private sector investment and ensuring projects can better withstand cyber attacks and natural disasters.Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said his goal is for his committee to pass an infrastructure bill by Memorial Day.In the House, Rep. Sam Graves, the top Republican on the transportation panel, said Republicans would be open to a larger package as long as it didn't greatly add to the national debt.But many lawmakers oppose an increase in the federal gas tax, one way to help pay for the spending, while groups such as the Chamber of Commerce argue against increasing taxes on companies during a pandemic.White House aide Cedric Richmond, a former congressman from Louisiana, told state transportation officials the president intends for most of the spending to be paid for, not added to the debt. In part, this would be by reversing some of the Trump administration tax cuts.Ed Mortimer, a vice president at the US Chamber of Commerce, said removing items in last year's infrastructure bill for renovating schools and low-income housing could lower the price tag, because the COVID relief measure passed by the House already has hundreds of billions of dollars for those purposes.“Affordable housing, school construction, very meritorious, but we’re not sure that that’s a key focus that’s going to get a bill signed into law," Mortimer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-team-readies-wider-economic-package-after-virus-relief-101614515112266.html

The newspaper said Lantenois appears to have been attacked because he is a journalist. It said he had driven to the neighborhood in a car bearing the newspaper's name.The prosecutors' office in Reims is investigating the attack as an attempted murder, L'Union said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/newspaper-photographer-attacked-seriously-hurt-in-france-101614514968229.html

Countries, especially those that see themselves as space powers, want to be able to rely on their own satellites and data to inform their activities, whether commercial or military in nature," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-launches-satellite-to-monitor-climate-in-arctic-101614512264705.html

The equipment was so big and awkward that it had to be taken apart like furniture, just to get through the hatch.“We know it's super tight in there,” Mission Control radioed.The astronauts headed with their unusually large load to the far port side of the station, careful not to bump into anything. That’s where the station’s oldest and most degraded solar wings are located.With more people and experiments flying on the space station, more power will be needed to keep everything running, according to NASA. The six new solar panels — to be delivered in pairs by SpaceX over the coming year or so — should boost the station’s electrical capability by as much as 30%.Rubins and Glover had to assemble and bolt down the struts for the first two solar panels, due to launch in June.🔴 LIVE: Cheer on our @NASA_Astronauts, Kate Rubins and @AstroVicGlover, on their spacewalk! Today's spacewalk is focused on preparing the @Space_Station for upcoming solar array upgrades. ☀️Watch: https://t.co/QLyMlTZwdL https://t.co/QLyMlTZwdLThe eight solar panels up there now are 12 to 20 years old — most of them past their design lifetime and deteriorating. Each panel is 112 feet (34 meters) long by 39 feet (12 meters) wide. Tip to tip counting the center framework, each pair stretches 240 feet (73 meters), longer than a Boeing 777′s wingspan.Boeing is supplying the new roll-up panels, about half the size of the old ones but just as powerful thanks to the latest solar cell technology. They’ll be placed at an angle above the old ones, which will continue to operate.A prototype was tested at the space station in 2017.Sunday’s spacewalk was the third for infectious disease specialist Rubins and Navy pilot Glover — both of whom could end up flying to the moon.They’re among 18 astronauts newly assigned to NASA’s Artemis moon-landing program. The next moonwalkers will come from this group.Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris put in a congratulatory call to Glover, the first African American astronaut to live full time at the space station. NASA released the video exchange Saturday.“The history making that you are doing, we are so proud of you,” Harris said. Like other firsts, Glover replied, it won't be the last. “We want to make sure that we can continue to do new things,” he said.Rubins will float back out Friday with Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi to wrap up the solar panel prep work, and to vent and relocate ammonia coolant hoses.Glover and Noguchi were among four astronauts arriving via SpaceX in November. Rubins launched from Kazakhstan in October alongside two Russians. They’re all scheduled to return to Earth this spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacewalking-nasa-astronauts-prep-station-for-new-solar-wings-101614512232554.html
28-02-2021||World||China rolls out first locally made single-dose Covid vaccine||China has given conditional market approval to the country’s first one-shot Covid-19 vaccine, state media reports said, adding that 500 million can be inoculated with it in a year.The vaccine was jointly developed by Cansino Biologics, a Tianjin-based private company, and researchers from the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences led by scientist Chen Wei.“The Chinese National Medical Products Administration granted conditional market approval to a recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine that requires only one shot,” official Xinhua news agency said in a report.Targeting people aged above 18, the vaccine can be transported and stored at a temperature ranging from 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.A state media report said the company can manufacture about 500 million doses annually.Phase-I clinical trials for the vaccine had started on March 16, 2020, making it the world’s first Covid-19 candidate vaccine that entered clinical trials.Pakistan was one of the countries where clinical trials for the vaccine were carried out.The protective effect can last at least six months after a single-dose inoculation and can increase immune response by 10 to 20 times if the second dose is taken half a year after the first one, Chen told national broadcaster, CCTV.“We have data for six months so far to prove the vaccine’s efficacy. People don’t need to take another dose within the first six months after their first inoculation. What if the epidemic is not over after six months? We have also developed the vaccine so that its effect is strengthened even after six months,” Chen said.Earlier this month, Pakistan health minister Faisal Sultan had announced on Twitter that Cansino’s vaccine was 65.7% effective in preventing symptomatic cases of the virus and 90.1% effective in preventing severe disease.Sultan said the figure was based on a multiple-country analysis of Cansino’s Phase III clinical trials, but the Pakistani subset with 30,000 participants showed slightly stronger figures of 74.8% protection against symptomatic cases and 100% protection against severe infections. Cansino has also tested its vaccine in Mexico, Chile and Argentina. According to a report in Fortune magazine, Cansino’s shot is based on similar viral-vector vaccine technology that Johnson & Johnson is using for its own one-shot vaccine.Cansino’s 65% efficacy rate also appears on par with Johnson & Johnson’s 66% figure. Cansino’s 65% efficacy figure would pass the World Health Organization’s recommended threshold of 50%, but it still lags behind the 94% and 95% figures posted by Moderna and Pfizer, respectively, the Fortune report added.Separately, China’s National Medical Products administration said last week that it has approved two more Covid-19 vaccines for public use. Besides the one from Cansino Biologics, the second one is from Sinopharm’s affiliate Wuhan Institute of Biological Product. The new approvals meant China had four locally developed approved vaccines for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rolls-out-first-locally-made-single-dose-covid-vaccine-101614514215691.html

28-02-2021||World||China rolls out first one-jab Covid-19 vaccine: Report||China has given conditional approval for a single dose Covid-19 vaccine, touted to be a rival to Johnson & Johnson’s one-jab shot cleared by the US drug regulator on Sunday.China's first Ad5-nCoV Covid-19 vaccine was rolled out on Friday, the state-run Global Times reported on Sunday.Phase-I clinical trials of the vaccine started on March 16, last year, making it the world's first Covid-19 candidate vaccine that entered clinical trials, it said.It is the only single-dose Covid-19 vaccine that has been given conditional approval to be rolled out in China, the report quoted last Friday’s story by the state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV).People can get desirable protective effect after 14 days of inoculation.The protective effect can last at least six months after a single-dose inoculation and it can increase immune response by 10 to 20 times if the second dose is taken half a year after the first one, the report said.With this, China’s medical products regulator has approved five coronavirus vaccines which include Sinovac, Sinopharm, CanSinoBio and another by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.One of the developers of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine said that the annual production capacity can reach 500 million doses, which means 500 million people can be vaccinated in a year.Phase-I clinical trials of the vaccine started on March 16, 2020, making it the world's first Covid-19 candidate vaccine that entered clinical trials, the Global Times report said.Though China has been supplying its vaccines to different countries, none of them have been approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO).The Ad5-nCoV vaccine is a recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine jointly developed by CanSino Biologics and researchers from the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences led by Chen Wei, who is an infectious disease expert and a researcher at the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences."We have data for six months so far to prove the vaccine's efficacy. People don't need to take another dose within the first six months after their first inoculation. What if the epidemic is not over after six months? We have also developed the vaccine so that its effect is strengthened even after six months," Chen said.The US Food and Drug Administration on Saturday approved Johnson and Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, the third jab to be authorised to fight the pandemic that has claimed over half a million lives in the country.The vaccine is set to be a cost-effective alternative to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator instead of a freezer.Trials found it prevented serious illness but was 66 per cent effective overall when moderate cases were included. The vaccine is made by the Belgian firm Janssen.China has been stepping up coronavirus vaccine production as it looks to vaccinate its 1.4 billion population and boost its vaccine diplomacy to make strategic gains.Last Friday, China welcomed India supplying more Covid-19 vaccines to a number of countries, playing down reports that New Delhi has beaten Beijing in its vaccine diplomacy around the world.Responding to a question on a report that India has beaten China at its own game of vaccine diplomacy, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin during a media briefing said, “We welcome that and hope to see more countries taking actions to provide vaccines to the world, especially developing countries, to help with the global response.”"China has been overcoming domestic difficulties to provide vaccines to other countries in concrete measure,” he said, flagging China’s own vaccine requirement to inoculate its 1.4 billion population.He reiterated that China has been providing vaccines to 53 countries and exporting vaccines to 27 countries, amid reports that many of those countries are yet to receive Chinese vaccines or the promised quantities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rolls-out-first-one-jab-covid-19-vaccine-report-101614511906163.html
28-02-2021||World||'Vindication of Prince': Saudi commentators thank Biden for report on Khashoggi||A US intelligence report blaming the Saudi crown prince for a critic’s murder is being celebrated by some commentators in the kingdom as an effective vindication.The four-page document released by President Joe Biden’s administration on Friday concluded that Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved an operation to capture or kill Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was dismembered by Saudi agents in Turkey in 2018. It also stated that Prince Mohammed supported “using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad.”For the prince’s backers at home, the report represented a practical victory, because it contained no new details, didn’t disclose any evidence on which it was based, and used equivocal words like “probably.” Sanctions announced against various Saudi officials didn’t include the prince, and Saudis who’d worried the report might harm the 35-year-old heir to the throne breathed a sigh of relief.“The Biden administration deserves thanks and appreciation from Saudis for publishing the report,” Salman Aldosary, a Saudi columnist who’s close to the kingdom’s leadership, wrote on Twitter. “It closed a door that overt and covert enemies sought to profit from.”Prince Mohammed has denied involvement in the Khashoggi killing, while saying he accepts symbolic responsibility as the country’s de facto ruler. A statement by the Saudi Foreign Ministry rejected the report, saying it was inaccurate and “unacceptable.”“The report is pretty much what someone thinks might have happened,” with “no actual concrete evidence pointing to the crown prince,” said Prince Talal Al Faisal, a businessman and junior royal. “It reads to me as something the Biden administration wanted to publish to placate a certain constituency within the US.”In Riyadh, the report sparked an outpouring of nationalism, with Prince Mohammed’s face broadcast on digital billboards across the city, celebrating his recent release from the hospital after an appendix removal. On Saturday, the prince was photographed attending a Formula E race in Riyadh.Climate of FearFreedom of speech is limited in Saudi Arabia, and a climate of fear caused by a political crackdown in recent years has silenced most critics of the crown prince. For those who had hoped the US administration would wound or chastise the prince, the report was a disappointment.The crown prince “should not be an exception to the rule of law,” said Abdullah Alaoudh, a member of the opposition National Assembly Party formed last year by a group of Saudi dissidents abroad.Traders initially appeared to be spooked by the report, which came out over the kingdom’s weekend. Saudi stocks fell the most in a month when the Tadawul All Share Index reopened on Sunday morning. The index later largely recovered, and was down 0.04% at 1:35 p.m. local time.Before the report was issued the US said it would “recalibrate” its relations with the world’s biggest oil producer.Apart from the pressure over the Khashoggi case, the Biden administration has put a hold on some key weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and is trying to bring an end to the war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia heads a military coalition against the Houthis.Recalibrating relations is “a common goal” for both countries, said Saudi political scientist Hesham Alghannam.“The Saudis are trying to be pragmatic in what they can achieve,” said Alghannam, a senior research fellow at the Gulf Research Center Cambridge. “They differentiate very well between what they want the region to be and what is possible at the current moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vindication-of-prince-saudi-commentators-thank-biden-for-report-on-khashoggi-101614511256812.html

28-02-2021||World||Amnesty International revokes Navalny's 'prisoner of conscience' status||Human rights group Amnesty International has revoked Alexey Navalny’s prisoner of conscience status because of past xenophobic comments. The jailed Russian opposition leader’s anti-migrant statements and nationalist dalliances are well-known. He has never retracted those views. Yet history books are full of imperfect crusaders — proof we can’t always choose a model citizen to galvanize others in the battle for political liberties and against corruption.This does not mean Western supporters, much less Russian citizens, should accept racism as a price to pay, or the means to an end. Offensive statements on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia, even made several years ago, require scrutiny. But is that the prime concern today? And how realistic is it to hold jailed political activists in the world’s most difficult corners to the highest Western standards?Criticizing President Vladimir Putin never made a saint of the Kremlin’s loudest detractor, or even a clear-cut liberal, for all his charisma and courage. He is unusual less for how inconsistent his views are, than for how publicly many of his positions have evolved. Poor judgement on some matters doesn’t make his imprisonment any less unjust.The reality is that support for Russian democracy campaigners is sorely needed at one of the country’s darkest times in recent memory. Western champions, governments and other observers would do well to focus less on the individual — tempting as that may be, especially when opposing a highly personalized regime — and more on the wider movement by backing civil society writ large. That would have the benefit of avoiding falling into the trap of lionizing deeply flawed figures, as has happened in the past. Also read: Putin critic Navalny transferred from a Moscow detention centreThe episode has been an uncomfortable muddle for Amnesty. The group initially referred to Navalny as a prisoner of conscience after his arrest last month, and then had second thoughts after concerns were raised over whether past comments qualified as advocating hatred. By backtracking, it has inadvertently fed a Kremlin smear campaign that seeks to cast Navalny, first and foremost, as a racist, an enemy of Russia, even a Nazi, emphasizing his attendance several years ago at a nationalist march of anti-immigration, far-right activists. One prominent pro-Kremlin television anchor earlier this month went so far as to liken him to Adolf Hitler, only less brave.Amnesty says it will continue to campaign for Navalny’s release. It denies being influenced by an orchestrated propaganda campaign, though it acknowledges old comments have resurfaced more frequently of late. “As a matter of principle, we cannot ignore the evidence before us,” the group said in a statement.It’s not the first time the group has tangled itself in its own orthodoxy. The organization defines prisoners of conscience as those who do not advocate or condone violence or hatred, but are imprisoned for who they are or what they believe. In 1964, it revoked Nelson Mandela’s status when he was found to support violent opposition to South Africa’s pro-apartheid regime.Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi, by contrast, became one of the most famous such prisoners of conscience during her house arrest. Yet once in power, she failed to stand up for free speech and actively defended the military against accusations of genocide in Rakhine state. Amnesty, which had made her an ambassador of conscience, withdrew that honor.Where Navalny is concerned, there’s no getting around the unpleasantness of the views expressed years ago and never disavowed, even against a background where such sentiments are not uncommon: A Levada Center survey last year found 73% of Russians wanted to limit the influx of labor migrants. His views are those of a politician learning on the go, who does not fit into a Western box. He is less a liberal in the mold of figures like Grigory Yavlinsky — who rose to prominence as a reformer in the last days of the Soviet Union, has been a fierce critic of both Putin and Navalny and resists compromise — than he is a populist, willing to bend to create broad coalitions.Why Navalny Is a ThreatIt’s possible to object both to his imprisonment and to his xenophobia. It’s just that for now, as Ben Noble, a lecturer in Russian politics at the University College London pointed out to me, the former is more pressing: With any prospect of Navalny coming to power very distant, concern should focus on getting Russia closer to the point where voters can freely choose their own leader.The debate over what is tolerable in particular contexts, and what is not, raises questions relevant beyond Amnesty’s headquarters. Supporters of opposition movements in authoritarian states regularly face conundrums over lesser evils.So far, Navalny has proven his courage, and an appeal that poses a real threat to the Kremlin. He can mobilize frustrated Russians in the most trying of circumstances. Still, those demonstrating after his arrest were largely anti-government protesters, not pro-Navalny campaigners, and his overall support levels among an indifferent electorate remain weak. He’s a compelling figure, but far more is at stake.Amnesty is rightly principled. Unfortunately, this diversion has served only the Kremlin’s purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amnesty-international-revokes-navalny-s-prisoner-of-conscience-status-101614500470696.html
28-02-2021||World||My dream is to see India and Pakistan become 'true good friends', says Malala||The old philosophy of having borders and divisions doesn't work anymore and the people in India and Pakistan want to live in peace, Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai said on Sunday, stressing that it is her dream to see the two countries become "good friends".She also said that minorities need protection in every country, be it Pakistan or India, adding that the issue is not related to religion but to the "exploitation of power" and must be taken seriously.Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist for girls education who miraculously survived a bullet to the head from the militant Taliban in October 2012, said the news of internet shutdown and arrests of activists "protesting peacefully" in India is "worrying" and expressed the hope that the government will make sure that people are heard."It is my dream to see India and Pakistan become true good friends and that we can visit each other's countries. You can continue to watch Pakistani dramas, we can continue to watch Bollywood movies and enjoy cricket matches," the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner said.She was speaking on her book "I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban" on the concluding day of the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) which is being held in the virtual mode."You are Indian and I am Pakistani and we are completely fine, then why is this hatred created between us? This old philosophy of borders, divisions and divide and conquer... they just don't work anymore, as humans we all want to live in peace," she said.The actual enemy of India and Pakistan is "poverty, discrimination and inequality" and both countries should unite and fight them, not each other, she added.Apart from "India-Pakistan friendship", Yousufzai said she also dreams of the day when every girl would get to go to school and have access to quality education.The 23-year-old activist also raised her voice for minorities across the world and said they are at "risk" and need to be protected globally by governments and human rights organisations."Minorities are at risk. Minorities' rights are not given to them. Be it Hindus and Christians in Pakistan, Muslims, Dalits and other minorities in India ... Palestinians, Rohingya refugees. It is not religion, it is the exploitation of power, it is just elites vs the poor and minorities."Minorities need protection globally from every country. They need a voice, need protection, and it is a reminder to governments, to human rights organisations to take this very seriously," she noted.During the discussion, she also applauded Indian girls and young women fighting for human rights, "speaking out" for farmers in India, climate change and protection of the minority rights, and called their work "empowering and inspiring".However, the news of the internet shutdown and arrests of activists protesting peacefully in India is "worrying", she claimed.".. You may not like their political opinion but it does not mean that you put them in jails and arrest them. It is a democratic right of every individual -- including women and girls -- to highlight their political opinions... So I hope that the government makes sure that people can protest peacefully and ask for their rights, and that they are heard," she added.The 14th edition of JLF featured over 300 speakers and performers representing around 25 Indian and 18 international languages and over 23 nationalities.Some of the big names who made it to the festival this year included American linguist Noam Chomsky, 2020 Booker Prize winner Douglas Stuart, Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz, Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates, and actor-author Priyanka Chopra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/my-dream-is-to-see-india-and-pakistan-become-true-good-friends-says-malala-101614509804445.html

Syria's state media said there were casualties among the crew.Russia joined Syria's war in September 2015 and has since helped tip the balance of power in favour of President Bashar Assad's forces. Russian troops are deployed in different parts of Syria, including the northeast.Syria's state news agency SANA said the incident happened near the village of Tel Tamr in northeastern Hassakeh province. One crew member was killed and others were wounded, the report said, without further details.The Russian Defense Ministry said a Russian Mi-35 helicopter made an emergency landing for technical reasons while patrolling Hassakeh province.“According to the crew's report, there was no firing impact on the helicopter,” the ministry statement said. It added the helicopter's crew was evacuated.“The crew of the Mi-35 helicopter was promptly delivered to the airfield by the search and rescue service. There was no threat to the fliers' lives,” the ministry said.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said the helicopter crash-landed near a Russian military post and said the reason for the crash wasn't clear. It said several people on board were wounded, including one critically.The Russian military has positions in different parts of Syria, including Tel Tamr, where their posts separate Turkey-backed opposition gunmen and U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-helicopter-crash-lands-in-syria-1-crew-member-killed-several-wounded-101614509235120.html
28-02-2021||World||Will 'never walk away' from royal family, says Prince Harry||Prince Harry recently opened up about his decision of stepping back from the royal role and starting a new life with his wife Meghan Markle.As per People magazine, the Duke of Sussex in a recent appearance on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden', candidly spoke about some of the reasons which made him and Meghan move to California.Airing just a few days after it was announced that the couple officially would not return as working royals, the prince made it clear that he "will never walk away" from his family or waver in his dedication to helping others."It was never walking away, it was stepping back rather than stepping down," he told Corden as the pair did a tour in a bus around Los Angeles. "It was a really difficult environment as I think a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like. It was destroying my mental health," Harry added."This is toxic, so I did what any husband and what any father would do which is 'I need to get my family out of here,' but we never walked away," he further stated.Harry also appeared to once again push back against Queen Elizabeth's statement last Friday that he and Meghan were "stepping away from the work of The Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service."He told Corden, a longtime friend who attended the couple's royal wedding in 2018, that he plans to continue to be the same man he was when he was working in a royal capacity."Whatever decisions are made on that side I will never walk away. I will always be contributing. My life is public service so wherever I am in the world it is going to be the same thing," Harry said in reference to the royal family.Last Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Harry and Meghan will not be returning as working royals. The announcement came just over a year after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex first shared their plans to step down, which came with a one-year review period.The Duke of Sussex also lost his honorary military appointments, which will subsequently be redistributed "among working members of The Royal Family."Buckingham Palace confirmed the news in a statement, "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have confirmed to Her Majesty The Queen that they will not be returning as working members of The Royal Family.""Following conversations with The Duke, The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of The Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service," the statement continued.In their own statement confirming the news, Harry and Meghan's office said that the duo "remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organizations they have represented regardless of official role.""We can all live a life of service. Service is universal," the statement read.In early 2020, Meghan and Harry had announced that they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. They live in Santa Barbara, California, and are expecting their second child.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will speak to American talk show host Oprah Winfrey in a wide-ranging interview which is set to broadcast on CBS next month. The interview was announced just a day after the couple revealed Meghan's second pregnancy.Apart from the upcoming interview, the pair struck a major multi-year deal with Netflix in September that will see them developing documentaries, feature films, scripted television shows, and children's series.They also recently launched a podcast on Spotify under their Archwell Audio production company, with the goal of building "community through shared experience, narratives, and values."Harry and Meghan, who tied the knot in 2018, welcomed their first child, Archie Harrison, in May 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-never-walk-away-from-royal-family-says-prince-harry-101614508987155.html

28-02-2021||World||Chinese investment in Australia plunges due to souring relation, Covid-19 impact||Chinese investment in Australia plunged almost two-thirds last year to less than $1 billion as the impact of coronavirus was compounded by increasingly fraught relations between the two countries.The reading marks the fourth straight drop and is just a fraction of the $13 billion injected into the country in 2016, with Canberra growing increasingly wary of the Asian superpower's intentions.Data from the Australian National University released Sunday showed direct investment plunged to US$800 million last year, from US$2.05 billion in 2019.The pandemic has almost halved investment globally according to United Nations trade body UNCTAD, but a much larger drop was seen in China-Australia flows, according to ANU economics professor Shiro Armstrong.Last year China's direct investment to Australia focused on just 20 projects in three sectors -- real estate, mining and manufacturing -- the fewest in a decade."Naturally, this kind of data is lumpy, because of big projects, but there is a pretty clear trend we can see, since the peak in 2016 it has fallen every year quite steadily, quite dramatically," Armstrong told AFP.In 2016 there were a number of large investments from the China Investment Corporation, a sovereign wealth fund, and China's State Power Investment Corporation bought Pacific Hydro.While China remains Australia's largest trading partner, political relations are at their lowest in decades, with Canberra recoiling at Beijing's efforts to translate economic might into political and military power.China has slapped punitive sanctions on a range of Australian exports as the two countries clash on a range of issues from influence operations, national security rules, China's internal crackdowns and transparency over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.There is also growing concern in Australia that Beijing has used trade, investments and diaspora groups to gain political leverage, which has prompted a slew of legislation.Armstrong said new Australian rules to screen investments for risks to national security had a particularly chilling effect and could help explain the decline."There is a national security test now for foreign investment, there have been high profile cases of Chinese investments being withdrawn" he said. "That shakes confidence in foreign investors."Australia has rejected Chinese bids for Japanese-owned Lion Dairy and local construction firm Probuild.The Treasury Department is also reviewing existing investments, a probe that could lead to some projects being unwound on national security grounds.That review is expected to conclude by December 10.According to Australian government figures, China is the ninth-largest investor in the country, well behind the United States, Britain, the European Union and Japan.Unlike official data, the ANU figures include investment from Chinese subsidiaries already operating in Australia, and track investments rather than announcements of investments to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-investment-in-australia-plunges-due-to-souring-relation-covid-19-impact-101614507726287.html
28-02-2021||World||At least 7 dead on bloodiest day of Myanmar protests against coup||Myanmar police fired on protesters on Sunday in the bloodiest day of weeks of demonstrations against a military coup and at least seven people were killed and several wounded, political and medical sources and media said.Myanmar has been in chaos since the army seized power and detained elected government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her party leadership on Feb. 1, alleging fraud in a November election her party won in a landslide.The coup, which brought a halt to tentative steps towards democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule, has drawn hundreds of thousands onto the streets and the condemnation of Western countries."Myanmar is like a battlefield," the Buddhist-majority nation's first Catholic cardinal, Charles Maung Bo, said on Twitter.Police were out in force early and opened fire in different parts of the biggest city of Yangon after stun grenades, tear gas and shots in the air failed to break up crowds. Soldiers also reinforced police.Several wounded people were hauled away by fellow protesters, leaving bloody smears on pavements, media images showed. One man died after being brought to a hospital with a bullet in the chest, said a doctor who asked not to be identified.A woman died of a suspected heart attack after police swooped to break up a Yangon teachers' protest with stun grenades, her daughter and a colleague said.Police also opened fire in Dawei in the south, killing three and wounding several, politician Kyaw Min Htike told Reuters from the town.The Myanmar Now media outlet reported two people had been killed in a protest in the second city of Mandalay.Police and the spokesman for the ruling military council did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.Police broke up protests in other towns, including Lashio in the northeast and Myeik in the deep south, residents and media said.'NEVER KNEEL'Junta leader General Min Aung Hlaing said last week authorities were using minimal force to deal with the protests.Nevertheless, at least 10 protesters have now died in the turmoil. The army said a policeman has been killed.The crackdown would appear to indicate determination by the military to impose its authority in the face of widespread defiance, not just on the streets but more broadly in the civil service, municipal administration, the judiciary, the education and health sectors and the media."The Myanmar security forces' clear escalation in use of lethal force in multiple towns and cities ... is outrageous and unacceptable," Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.Hundreds of protesters refused to leave the streets by early afternoon in Yangon. Many set up barricades while others chanted slogans and sang protest songs."If they attack us, we'll defend. We'll never kneel down to the military boots," said Nyan Win Shein from one Yangon protest.Early in the day, police swooped to disperse a teachers' protest with stun grenades, sending the crowd fleeing. One teacher, Tin New Yee, died of a suspected heart attack, her daughter and a fellow teacher said.Police also hurled stun grenades outside a Yangon medical school, sending doctors and students in white lab coats scattering. A group called the Whitecoat Alliance of medics said more than 50 medical staff had been arrested.State-run MRTV television said more than 470 people had been arrested on Saturday when police launched the nationwide crackdown. It was not clear how many were detained on Sunday.'INSTIL FEAR'Youth activist Esther Ze Naw said earlier people were battling the fear they had lived with under military rule."It's obvious they're trying to instil fear in us by making us run and hide," she said. "We can't accept that."The police action came after state television announced that Myanmar's U.N. envoy had been fired for betraying the country, after he urged the United Nations to use "any means necessary" to reverse the coup.The ambassador, Kyaw Moe Tun, remained defiant. "I decided to fight back as long as I can," he told Reuters in New York.While Western countries have condemned the coup and some have imposed limited sanctions, the generals have traditionally shrugged off diplomatic pressure. They have promised to hold a new election but not set a date.Suu Kyi's party and supporters said the result of the November vote must be respected.Suu Kyi, 75, who spent nearly 15 years under house arrest, faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios and of violating a natural disaster law by breaching coronavirus protocols. The next hearing in her case is on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-7-dead-on-bloodiest-day-of-myanmar-protests-against-coup-101614508061148.html
28-02-2021||World||Covid-19 effect: Progress in US industries tempered by losses says Powell||The first full month of Joe Biden’s presidency of the US looks likely to have featured limited progress for the labour market as the coronavirus kept a lid on growth.Economists surveyed before data on Friday anticipate an increase in the unemployment rate to 6.4%, with a tally of about 180,000 new jobs. Private payrolls will be watched closely after pandemic-related restrictions eased in many states in recent weeks, likely allowing for increased hiring at service businesses like restaurants.Policy makers including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen continue to see the labour market as a point of weakness for the economy. The central bank chief said last week that the pace of improvement has slowed in recent months and indicated that policy makers are nowhere close to pulling back on support.“Continued progress in many industries has been tempered by significant losses in industries such as leisure and hospitality, where the resurgence in the virus and increased social distancing have weighed further on activity,” Powell told the Senate Banking Committee.Meanwhile, the focus of Biden’s plan for $1.9 trillion in additional pandemic aid will turn to Senate consideration this week, following House passage on Saturday. Lawmakers hope to send the package to the president before March 14, when additional aid for many unemployed Americans expires.Also read: Powell is patient but markets aren’t, challenging new Fed policyWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:“The $1.9 trillion relief bill passed by the House is large enough to push US GDP above the pre-pandemic trend by midyear. Our analysis of the composition and associated multipliers -- the response of growth to fiscal aid -- could mean GDP growth in the vicinity of 7.4% for the full year on a 4Q-over-4Q basis, the best since 1983. Still, a recovery in economy-wide spending will not coincide with a full recovery in the labour market.”Elsewhere, the UK chancellor will unveil a new budget, and China’s National People’s Congress presents the country’s latest economic goals. Central banks in Australia, Malaysia and Poland are among those scheduled to set rates.Europe, Middle East, AfricaIn the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil the country’s much-delayed budget on Wednesday, marking the first formal assessment of the overall damage inflicted on the public finances from the coronavirus. Observers are keenly watching for evidence that he will follow through on his hints of fiscal tightening to pay for the ballooning costs of the crisis, with an increase in corporation tax touted as one possible measure.The euro zone’s inflation rate for February may provide a modicum of comfort for policy makers at the European Central Bank as they ponder the strength of the region’s recovery. Consumer prices probably held at 0.9% on an annual basis.Turkey publishes key data next week including fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Monday, which is expected to show that a campaign of cheap credit and rapid interest-rate cuts under the now-replaced economy team led to one of the world’s biggest expansions in the period -- at the expense of the lira, inflation and foreign-exchange reserves.A report on Wednesday will probably show Turkish inflation quickened to more than 15%, and some easing of virus restrictions is also expected during the week.Data on Friday will probably show the South African central bank continued buying state debt in the secondary market in February after first stepping in last year.AsiaChina’s all-important National People’s Congress takes place Friday, where the nation’s communist leaders unveil their annual budget, economic growth goals, and targets for everything from urban job creation to consumer price inflation.That follows the release of purchasing managers’ surveys on Sunday, that showed manufacturing activity dropped further in February as the Lunar New Year holidays disrupted production, while travel restrictions to contain virus outbreaks cut spending on services.In Australia, the central bank meets on Tuesday, with no change to its main policy levers expected, while GDP data for the fourth quarter is released the following day.South Korea trade figures out Monday are expected to confirm a continued resurgence in exports that points to the improving health of global trade. Korea will revise its GDP numbers on Thursday and release inflation figures that are seen showing a slight acceleration.Japan’s capital spending figures due Tuesday will be used to revise GDP data that already showed stronger-than-expected business investment. The country’s jobless figures are expected to inch up from 2.9%, still leaving it at a remarkably low level for the pandemic-hit world.Latin AmericaChile’s central bank on Monday posts its January economic activity report. The economy’s uneven recovery out of the pandemic recession took on a more balanced look in December as services rebounded sharply after lagging behind consumption and manufacturing.On Wednesday, Brazil’s 2020 performance will be laid bare with fourth-quarter and full-year GDP data. The government’s outsized response -- spending roughly 8% of GDP coupled with record-low interest rates -- probably limited the annual contraction to -4.2%, the least among the region’s big economies.The country’s challenges are mounting however: all that stimulus further battered Brazil’s finances and stirred up inflation that’s likely to hasten central-bank tightening.Later Wednesday, Mexico’s central bank posts its quarterly inflation report, with new inflation forecasts that are keenly anticipated just weeks before the next policy meeting.Rounding out the week, Brazil reports industrial production on Friday and Colombia posts monthly inflation data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-effect-progress-in-us-industries-tempered-by-losses-says-powell-101614500423452.html
28-02-2021||World||German states call for unused AstraZeneca vaccine to be given to younger people||Several German states called on Sunday for unused AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines to be given to younger people, as worries about side effects and efficacy, as well as a recommendation it be used only for under 65s, have meant low take-up of available doses.The German health ministry said this week it had administered only 15% of the AstraZeneca shots it has available, confirming concerns that Germans were being selective, slowing vaccination efforts.Elderly people are first in line to be vaccinated, but Germany has recommended that the AstraZeneca vaccine be given only to people aged 18 to 64. EU regulators have declared it safe for all.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe prime ministers of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria and Saxony told German papers on Sunday that if shots earmarked for older Germans stay unused, the prioritisation scheme should be softened, allowing younger people to get it sooner than originally planned."We cannot afford the vaccine sitting around and not being used because some of those entitled reject it", Baden-Wuerttemberg's prime minister Winfried Kretschmann told Welt am Sonntag. Bavaria's Markus Soeder made similar remarks to Bild am Sonntag and Saxony's Michael Kretschmer to Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.Health authorities in some European countries - including Germany - are also facing resistance to the AstraZeneca vaccine after side-effects including fever and muscle pain led some front-line workers to call in sick. The other shots approved in Europe, developed by Pfizer and Moderna, have been linked to similar temporary side-effects.The German government urged the public on Friday to take the AstraZeneca vaccine while the head of the Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lothar Wieler, said data from Britain and Israel showed it was "very, very effective".The recommendation that the vaccine go only to people under 65 came from Germany's expert panel on vaccine use (STIKO). STIKO's head, Thomas Mertens, said on Friday that it would update its recommendation very soon."Somehow the whole thing went kind of badly", he told broadcaster ZDF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-states-call-for-unused-astrazeneca-vaccine-to-be-given-to-younger-people-101614507596648.html
28-02-2021||World||Israeli-owned ship docked in Dubai after mysterious blast||An Israeli-owned cargo ship that suffered a mysterious explosion in the Gulf of Oman came to Dubai's port for repairs Sunday, days after the blast that revived security concerns in Mideast waterways amid heightened tensions with Iran.Associated Press journalists saw the hulking Israeli-owned MV Helios Ray sitting at dry dock facilities at Dubai's Port Rashid. Although the crew was unharmed in the blast, the vessel sustained two holes on its port side and two on its starboard side just above the waterline, according to American defense officials.It remains unclear what caused the blast, but the incident comes amid sharply rising tension between the US and Iran over its unraveling 2015 nuclear deal. Iran has sought to pressure President Joe Biden’s administration to grant the sanctions relief it received under the accord with world powers that former President Donald Trump abandoned.From the shore, Associated Press journalists could not immediately see damage to the vessel. The dock blocked the view of the vessel's starboard side down to the waterline and the port side could only be seen from a distance. The ship was anchored near Dubai’s storied floating hotel, the Queen Elizabeth 2. An Emirati coast guard vessel was seen sailing behind the ship, with Dubai police and Emirati armed forces vehicles parked nearby.Emirati officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the vessel docking in the country.Friday's blast on the ship, a Bahamian-flagged roll-on, roll-off vehicle cargo vessel, recalled a string of attacks on foreign oil tankers in 2019 that the US Navy blamed on Iran. Tehran denied any role in the suspected assaults, which happened near the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil chokepoint.Israeli ambassador to the US and UN, Gilad Erdan, told Israel's Army Radio on Sunday that “it was no secret that the Iranians are trying to harm Israeli targets," alleging the explosion on the ship bore the hallmarks of previous Iranian attacks.Meanwhile on Sunday, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for firing a ballistic missile and nine bomb-laden drones at “sensitive sites” in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh. The group’s military spokesman Yahia Sarei added that another six explosive drones targeted “military positions” in the southwestern cities of Abha and Khamis Mushait. The Saudi interception of the missile late Saturday set off an apparent explosion over Riyadh that startled residents and scattered shell debris, without causing casualties.The Helios Ray had discharged cars at various ports in the Persian Gulf before making its way out of the Middle East toward Singapore. The blast hit as the ship was sailing from the Saudi port Dammam out of the Gulf of Oman, forcing it to turn to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, for inspection.Iranian authorities have not publicly commented on the ship. The country's hard-line Kayhan daily, whose editor-in-chief was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, alleged the Helios Ray was “possibly" on an “espionage” mission in the region, without offering any evidence to support the claim. The Sunday report speculated the ship may have been "trapped in an ambush by a branch of resistance axis,” referring to Iranian proxies in the region.Iran also has blamed Israel for a recent series of attacks, including a mysterious explosion last summer that destroyed an advanced centrifuge assembly plant at its Natanz nuclear facility and the killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a top Iranian scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program two decades ago.Iran’s repeated vows to avenge Fakhrizadeh’s killing have raised alarms in Israel, particularly as the Gulf sees an increase in Israeli traffic following the country's normalization deals with the UAE and Bahrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeliowned-ship-docked-in-dubai-after-mysterious-blast-101614503868428.html
28-02-2021||World||Pakistan may resume import of cotton from India: Report||Pakistan may allow cotton import from India through land route as prospects of gradual restoration of bilateral trade ties have brightened after the new ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control, according to a media report on Sunday.Citing sources in the Ministry of Commerce, The Express Tribune reported that Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood may take a decision on whether to import cotton and yarn from India next week.They said that the issue of cotton shortfall has already been brought to the notice of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who also holds the portfolio of the commerce minister. Once a principled decision is taken, a formal order will be presented before the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet, the sources told the daily.The sources said that in-house deliberations have already begun but the final decision would be taken only after seeking the approval of the prime minister.“I cannot say yes or no at this stage and would be in a better position to respond on Monday,” Dawood told the daily, responding to a question on whether Pakistan was considering allowing cotton import from India.The trade ties between both the countries can help minimise cost of production in Pakistan and ensure sustained food supplies, the daily said.India and Pakistan issued a joint statement on Thursday to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the LoC and other sectors after the hotline discussions by their Director Generals of Military Operations.The two countries signed a ceasefire agreement in 2003, but it has hardly been followed in letter and spirit over the past several years.Relations between the two neighbours have nose-dived after a series of terror attacks in India perpetrated by terror groups based in Pakistan.Bilateral ties deteriorated further after India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. The move angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.The paper reported that against the annual estimated consumption of minimum 12 million bales, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research expects only 7.7 million bales production this year. However, cotton ginners have given the lowest production estimates of only 5.5 million bales for this year.There is a minimum shortfall of six million bales and Pakistan has so far imported roughly 688,305 metric tonnes of cotton and yarn, costing USD 1.1 billion, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. There is still a gap of about 3.5 million bales that needs to be filled through imports.Due to shortage of cotton and yarn, the users were compelled to import them from the United States, Brazil and Uzbekistan.Imports from India would be far cheaper and would reach Pakistan within three to four days.Importing yarn from other countries was not only expensive but would also take one to two months to reach Pakistan, the daily reported, quoting businessmen who deal in these commodities.The delay in yarn import can pose risk to timely deliver the export orders, according to the paper.However, the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) is exerting pressure on the Pakistan government not to allow cotton and yarn import from India.An industry insider told the daily that few millers have already hoarded the cotton and were now charging higher rates and import would dampen their short-term earnings. In an appeal to Dawood, Aptma said that the import of yarn from India will directly impact cotton prices in Pakistan.“The cotton sowing season is currently starting in Pakistan and the predicted drop in cotton price owing to import of yarn from India is approximately 10-15 per cent, discouraging farmers not to sow cotton,” according to the Aptma.On Thursday, India said it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan and is committed to resolving all issues bilaterally in a peaceful manner.Prime Minister Khan on Saturday welcomed the ceasefire agreement with India and said Islamabad remains ready to move forward to resolve "all outstanding issues" through dialogue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-may-resume-import-of-cotton-from-india-report-101614504313708.html
28-02-2021||World||Myanmar crackdown leaves at least five dead in violent weekend||At least five people died as Myanmar’s military government cracked down on protests over the weekend, and escalated non-tolerance for dissent with the ouster of the country’s representative to the United Nations along with the arrests of journalists and hundreds of protesters.Police in the city of Dawei in southern Myanmar opened fire into a crowd on Sunday, killing three and injuring more than 50 others, the New York Times reported, citing doctors. An official at the Byamaso emergency clinic in Mandalay said one demonstrator died and at least eight others were injured. A protester was shot in Yangon and died Sunday, a doctor with the CDM Doctors Network told Bloomberg News, declining to be identified for fear of retaliation.Riot police arrested five journalists in Yangon, and an unknown number in Monywa and Hakha on Saturday for reporting on anti-coup protests, according to Myanmar Journalists Network. One of them is reported to be a photojournalist with the Associated Press. State-run MRTV reported riot police arrested 479 protesters across the country on Saturday, while the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said 854 demonstrators have been detained so far.“The Myanmar security forces’ clear escalation in use of lethal force in multiple towns and cities across the country in response to mostly peaceful anti-coup protesters is outrageous and unacceptable, and must be immediately halted,” said Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. “Live ammunition should not be used to control or disperse protests and lethal force can only be used to protect life or prevent serious injury.”The junta on Saturday fired Kyaw Moe Tun, Myanmar’s permanent representative to the UN, after he criticized the coup and defended deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi. At an informal meeting in New York on Friday, Kyaw Moe Tun called on the international community to “take the strongest possible action” to reverse the Feb. 1 coup, stop the military from oppressing the Burmese people and return the country to democracy.“He failed to follow the state’s orders and instructions, committed treason, showed his loyalty” to the parliamentary committee led by Suu Kyi’s party, and “misused his authoritative powers as an ambassador of Myanmar,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday.The military’s power grab has triggered weeks of fierce protests within the country and sparked international condemnation. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have ignored bans on public gatherings, leading to occasional clashes with security forces that has left a handful of protesters dead. The Biden administration has announced sanctions targeting the country’s military leaders.Southeast Asian foreign ministers are making arrangements to meet this week to discuss the situation, Japan’s Kyodo news agency reported on Saturday. Most members of the 10-nation group have expressed a willingness to join, and the military-appointed foreign minister of Myanmar, an Asean member, has been asked to participate, according to Kyodo. Calls to Myanmar’s foreign ministry for comments on the meeting were unanswered.Police in major cities including Yangon, Mandalay and Monywa on Saturday arrested protesters gathering on the streets. In some places, shots were fired and tear gas was deployed to disperse crowds, witnesses said. Suu Kyi was arrested in the coup and faces a possible prison sentence on charges of illegally importing walkie-talkies and violating Covid-19 restrictions while campaigning last year.On Friday, Myanmar’s UN representative urged the international community not to accept the military regime, and called for recognition of the results of the November general election in which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won a landslide victory.Kyaw Moe Tun said “all strongest possible measures to stop the violent and brutal acts committed by the security forces against peaceful demonstrators and immediately end the military coup” are needed.The National League for Democracy plans to put together a parallel government that could engage with the international community, the Financial Times reported, citing a party official who is on the run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-crackdown-leaves-at-least-five-dead-in-violent-weekend-101614503579791.html

28-02-2021||World||Philippines to receive Covid-19 vaccine after delays||The Philippines is due to receive its first batch of COVID-19 vaccine Sunday, among the last in Southeast Asia to secure the critical doses despite having the second-highest number of coronavirus infections and deaths in the hard-hit region.President Rodrigo Duterte and top Cabinet officials will welcome the arrival of 600,000 doses of China-donated vaccine in a ceremony at an air base in the capital that will underscore their relief after weeks of delays, officials said. Vaccinations initially for health workers are scheduled to start Monday.Aside from the donated vaccine from Sinovac Biotech Ltd., the government has separately ordered 25 million doses from the China-based company. An initial 525,600 doses of Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca were also scheduled to arrive Monday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said.The initial deliveries are a small fraction of at least 148 million doses the government has been negotiating to secure from Western and Asian companies to vaccinate about 70 million Filipinos for free in a massive campaign largely funded with foreign and domestic loans. The bulk of the vaccine shipments are expected to arrive later this year.Resty Padilla, a spokesperson for a government panel dealing with the pandemic, said the vaccine could be a “game-changer” in a debilitating health crisis that has infected more than 574,000 people in the Philippines and killed at least 12,289 others. Lockdowns and quarantine restrictions have also set back Manila’s economy in one of the worst recessions in the region and sparked unemployment and hunger.“Although we are still a long way from herd immunity, the arrival of the initial supply of vaccine provides hope that our road to normalcy has finally begun,” Padilla told The Associated Press.Duterte’s administration has come under criticism for lagging behind most other Southeast Asian countries in securing the vaccines, including much smaller and poorer ones like Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos.The tough-talking leader has said wealthy Western countries, especially where the vaccine originated, have cornered massive doses for their citizens, leaving poorer nations scrambling to get the rest. In a sign of desperation, Duterte said last December that he would proceed to abrogate a key security pact with the United States that allows large numbers of American troops to conduct war exercises in the Philippines if Washington could not provide at least 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine for his country.“No vaccine, no stay here,” Duterte said then.The Chinese vaccine delivery was delayed due to the absence of an emergency-use authorization from Manila’s Food and Drug Administration. Sinovac got the authorization last Monday. Western pharmaceutical companies also wanted the Philippine government to guarantee that it would take responsibility for lawsuits and demands for indemnity arising from possible adverse side effects from the vaccine, officials said.Duterte signed a law last week giving pharmaceutical companies immunity from such liabilities for the emergency use by the public of their vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-to-receive-covid-19-vaccine-after-delays-101614500591403.html
28-02-2021||World||When Joseph Stalin's daughter Svetlana defected from India!||Former American ambassador to India Richard Celeste has come out with his memoir in which he shares many interesting facts including the sensational defection of Joseph Stalin's daughter Svetlana from India on a US visa.Celeste, who served as ambassador from 1997 to 2001 when Bill Clinton was president, first came to India in the 1960s as an assistant to the then envoy here Chester Bowles.In "Life in American Politics & Diplomatic Years in India: An Unvarnished Account", Celeste shares "as honestly as I can the influences that led me to devote my life to public service - both in and beyond the political arena".He says he has tried to "illuminate some of the dark corners of political life" in his book, published by Har-Anand Publications.Also read: China’s Xi Jinping is a successor to dictator Joseph Stalin: US NSA O’BrienOn a March night in 1967, Celeste was suddenly called to the American embassy. On reaching there, he came to know that a woman Svetlana Alliluyeva was at the embassy with a pair of suitcases asking for asylum. She had presented a Russian passport and claimed to be Stalin's daughter."It didn't take much imagination to suspect the Russians were up to something. A few weeks earlier the Soviets had sent a new number two to their embassy in New Delhi who, according to the agency, specialised in black propaganda," the author says."… There were regular efforts to recruit young American officers by Soviet intelligence. The Stalin daughter ploy might be another effort to embarrass us," he claims."Her story was hard to believe. Not only did this woman say she was Stalin’s daughter, she claimed to be the common-law wife of an older Indian gentleman who worked at the Foreign Language Press in Moscow…"Her husband had died the previous November. She had promised to bring his ashes from Moscow to immerse them in the Ganges. Six months had passed. She had stayed in India after scattering the ashes. She now wanted asylum," Celeste writes.According to him, all were worried that at "any moment that she might cry rape or that the Soviet Embassy would allege we had kidnapped her. We would be ordered to produce her and she would confirm whatever wild accusations had been made by the Soviets".Svetlana told the American officials she had come back to Delhi that weekend - March 5 was a Monday - and taken an apartment at the Russian Embassy compound. The Russians expected her to take the Aeroflot flight to Moscow very early Thursday morning.The last straw, she alleged, occurred when the Soviet Ambassador invited her to lunch that afternoon and served Polish ham. She ate the vegetables on her plate but didn't touch the ham, thus offending the ambassador."What's happened to you," he asked her, adding whether she has become a "vegetarian, a Hindu", the book says.After talking to her at the consular office here, the Americans were left with three options - inform the Indian government and make a formal request for its help in facilitating her departure, turn her away or give a visa to the US but buy her a ticket only half way, Celeste recalls.So it was decided to "give her the visa and let her know she has got to get on the plane on her own".Soon a cable message was sent to Washington around 2030 hours: "Individual claiming to be Stalin's daughter arrived at Embassy 1910 hours seeking asylum. Unable to confirm identity. Concerned that individual may be a provocation. Propose to issue US visa but send her to Rome on Quantas ETD 0100 hours. Seek your guidance."There was a Quantas flight to Rome that would leave at one in the morning.Thus Svetlana reached Rome from where she travelled to Geneva later."An already delicate situation became more delicate the next day when, at every post around the world, meetings between Soviet and American diplomats were called off. One of the reasons behind the Soviet Ambassador's eagerness to persuade Svetlana to return home was that he himself was headed back to Moscow for reassignment," the book says.The KGB chief too was livid and demanded an answer from the CIA station chief in Delhi on why Svetlana was "kidnapped".Celeste claims that later it was found out that the "Soviets had decided that Svetlana's departure was an Indian, not an American, problem"."The Indians had simply not taken proper care of this very important visitor. The Soviets went very hard at the Indira Gandhi government. After a couple of weeks LK Jha, the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister at the time, was sent by Indira Gandhi to meet Svetlana in Switzerland, where she'd moved," he writes."Jha tried to talk her into returning to Moscow saying that her defection was harming relations between two countries she loved and because her children wanted her back in Russia. One of her children was a doctor and the other was an academic, and she talked to them on the phone with Jha observing."The children urged her to return, but she refused, saying that she simply would not return to Moscow under any circumstances," the book says.Eventually Svetlana left Switzerland and came to the US. "The brouhaha in Delhi subsided."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-joseph-stalin-s-daughter-svetlana-defected-from-india-101614500374771.html

The cleric, his son and the student received multiple gunshot wounds and died at a hospital.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack and Khan said an investigation was underway to ascertain the identity of the assailants and the motive behind the killings.Ikramur Rehman was affiliated with the party of firebrand cleric Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who heads an 11-party opposition alliance to topple the government.Militant violence in Pakistan is on the rise. Last week, four vocational school instructors who advocated for women’s rights were traveling together when they were gunned down in a Pakistan border region. A Twitter death threat against Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai attracted an avalanche of trolls who heaped abuse on the young champion of girls education. A couple of men on a motorcycle opened fire on a police check-post not far from the Afghan border killing a young police constable.In recent weeks, at least a dozen military and paramilitary men have been killed in ambushes, attacks and operations against militant hideouts, mostly in the western border regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-kill-religious-cleric-his-teenage-son-student-in-pakistan-101614501605547.html

Several policemen were also hurt, including an officer who was rushed to hospital.He said more than 500 protesters were at the press club, trying to form a human chain to protest the death of writer Mushtaq Ahmed, who collapsed in a high-security prison north of Dhaka and died late Thursday.He defended the party not having sought permission for the protests at the National Press Club, saying that historically no clearance was needed to hold any rallies there."As they stood there for a human chain, (police) baton-charged indiscriminately," he said."It is a murder," he said of Mushtaq Ahmed's death. "We think the state is involved."International and local rights groups have demanded a swift probe into the death of the writer 10 months after he was arrested over comments posted on social media.Ambassadors from 13 countries, including the United States, France, Britain, Canada and Germany, expressed "grave concern" over the case.He had been detained under the controversial digital security laws that critics say are used to muzzle dissent.Ahmed was denied bail at least six times.Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday shrugged off criticism of her government's rights record, international concern over the internet law and Ahmed's death.Demonstrators have marched at Dhaka University over the last few days chanting slogans condemning the government's treatment of Mushtaq Ahmed as well as other writers, journalists and activists.sa/stu/qan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tear-gas-shells-rubber-bullets-fired-at-bnp-activists-101614501043456.html

Those walls still standing are scarred with bullet and shrapnel holes."It used to be a bit like the Jerusalem of the Nineveh plains," said Mosul and Akra's Chaldean Archbishop Najeeb Michaeel of "Church Square", the name given to the site that Pope Francis will visit on March 7 during his historic trip to Iraq.Michaeel fondly recalled how, before the U.S. invasion in 2003, Iraqi Christians from different denominations would attend each other's services on religious festivals.Those days are gone. Today just one of Mosul's surviving churches offers a weekly Sunday service to a Christian population that has dwindled to just a few dozen families from about 50,000 people.Tolerated by former President Saddam Hussein but persecuted by al Qaeda and then Islamic State, Iraq's Christians number around 300,000, one fifth of the total before 2003.Some are trickling back after Islamic State's defeat, but others still see little prospect in staying in Iraq and are looking to settle overseas.Mines and memoriesA Syriac Catholic, Syriac Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox and Chaldean Catholic church are situated cheek-by-jowl in and around the dusty square. Now the area lies in ruins, as do other parts of the city.The pope is due to hold prayers for the victims of war at Hosh al-Bieaa, known as Church Square in English, as part of a four-day trip starting on March 5, a visit Archbishop Michaeel described as highly symbolic and a message of hope."Where stones fell because of violence, there will always be life," he said.Workmen have been busy cleaning up the site before Pope Francis arrives.Funded by the United Arab Emirates, the restoration of the Syriac Catholic church of Al-Tahera is being carried out by UNESCO in collaboration with local partners and began in 2020.Holding pictures of the church before its destruction, assistant site coordinator for UNESCO in Iraq, Anas Zeyad, pointed to delicate Syriac carvings on pieces of greyish alabaster stone referred to locally as "Mosul marble".Damaged by Islamic State before its roof was shredded by air strikes, the church was used as a tribunal by the jihadist movement's religious police, Zeyad said.The adjacent Armenian Orthodox church, distinguishable by its dome, remains closed off to the public."It has not been de-mined yet," Zeyad explained, pointing to the sealed door leading to the church that Islamic State commandeered as a prison."Nearly all churches in Mosul were used by Islamic State," Archbishop Michaeel said.Standing next to a damaged piece of sculpted alabaster representing the Virgin Mary, Ali Salem, from Iraq's State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, said his team was reviewing many such artefacts to determine which could be repaired and used again."As a Muslim I am proud to help rebuild these churches," Zeyad said, adding that he hoped "we see Christians come back to these places, so that we live together again as we have for centuries."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-to-visit-churches-desecrated-by-islamic-state-in-mosul-101614499994981.html

It is hugely more transmissible than the virus's previous version, BBC reported.The Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) in an overnight statement said that Pakistan is among 92 countries in the world where the strain has been detected.“The new strain is being seen across the world and continues to be detected in samples in Pakistan. While this strain does not cause more severe disease, there is evidence that its transmission is faster,” the statement stated.The ministry asked the people that they should more vigorously follow the guidelines to avoid infection and seek vaccination as the ultimate solution.“This highlights the need to continue following prescribed standard operating procedures (SOPs) and guidelines issued by the government and to get vaccinated when your turn comes,” according to the statement.Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases reached 579,973 with the addition of 1,176 new patients in the last 24 hours, according to the ministry of NHS.It added that 23 more patients died, taking the number of deaths to 12,860.

The Southern Theatre Command is responsible for overseeing the vast waters claimed by China in the South China Sea.At the same time, the US has been stepping up reconnaissance activities in the area.The US also sent a reconnaissance aircraft to fly over the South China Sea off the coast of Taiwan on Saturday, the think tank said in another post.China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, something which is contested heavily by several countries in the region.China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-conducts-drill-in-south-china-sea-us-steps-up-vigil-report-101614497724842.html

Keeping the thresholds on hold rather than raising them would mean more people are paying taxes as wages rise.About 800,000 people who currently aren’t paying income taxes will do so before the next election is due, the paper said. In that period, another 800,000 people are expected to move into the next tax bracket, it said.The chancellor of the exchequer will set out the details in his March 3 budget after Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined a plan for reopening the UK economy that keeps some businesses closed until at least June 21. Sunak faces a daunting task to put the economy on a path to recovery after suffering its deepest slump in three centuries last year.

The modest decline allowed China to meet a government target to reduce the proportion of coal to around 57.5% in 2020. Still, total coal use climbed by 0.6% as energy consumption rose by 2.2% in 2020 from a year earlier.Also read: Pakistan's debt continues to mount, owes $6.7 billion to foreign lenders: ReportPresident Xi Jinping pledged China would target carbon neutrality by 2060 in a Sept. 22 speech to the United Nations. While he didn’t lay out details, Xi’s announcement implies the nation’s emissions will have to sharply decline to reach net-zero in less than 30 years after peaking in 2030.One proposal under consideration to accelerate China’s adoption of clean energy is to cut the share of coal in the energy mix to 52% by 2025, Bloomberg reported earlier. Still a gulf remains between China’s ambitious carbon-neutral goals and the desire of its companies to maintain breakneck growth.China may provide more details of its roadmap to carbon neutrality in its five-year policy blueprint set to be unveiled at legislative meetings that start next week. Beijing’s energy policy will need to juggle the competing demands of delivering economic growth, promoting energy security and mitigating the worst effects of global warming.The proportion of clean energy including natural gas, hydropower, nuclear and wind power in total energy use rose by 1.0 percentage points to 24.3% in 2020, according to China’s statistics bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-to-adopt-clean-energy-cut-usage-of-coal-in-energy-mix-to-52-by-2025-101614484892675.html
28-02-2021||World||German radio jockey Matthias Matuschik compares BTS to Covid, station apologizes later||A Bavarian radio station apologized Friday for a host's comments comparing popular South Korean K-pop band BTS to the coronavirus, saying his choice of words had gone too far but was in no way meant to be “hurtful or racist.”The statement came after legions of fans accused the station's Matthias Matuschik of racism for his comments on the band's cover of Coldplay's “Fix You,” taking to social media using the hashtags #Bayern3Racist, #Bayern3Apologize and #RassismusBeiBayern3 which translates as “racism at Bayern3.”“Racism is not an option,” wrote one user, @Vroseeeee1 in a blunt tweet in English, German, Korean and Spanish.The uproar came after a live show Wednesday, in which Matuschik derided BTS's version of “Fix You” as “blasphemy” and compared the band to COVID-19, describing them as “some crappy virus that hopefully there will be a vaccine for soon as well.”He then dug his hole deeper as he tried to roll back the comment somewhat, saying “I have nothing against South Korea, you can’t accuse me of xenophobia only because this boyband is from South Korea... I have a car from South Korea. I have the coolest car around.”Then he went on to say that in penance for the cover, BTS “will be vacationing in North Korea for the next 20 years.”BTS, which debuted in 2013, became the biggest boy band in the world, selling out stadiums worldwide and delivering a video message at the U.N. General Assembly this year.Their songs, filled with intimate, socially conscious lyrics, are credited for their success. Unlike other K-pop bands that carefully maintain the personas created by their labels, BTS is known for its active engagement with fans — known as ARMY — through social media. BTS has over 33.1 million followers on Twitter.Offense at the comments didn't only come from South Korea, with many social media users in Germany and elsewhere immediately condemning them.“I know which radio station I won't be listening to anymore, bye @Bayern3,” wrote user @fairesvmns in a German-language post that included audio of Matuschik's comments. “I really don't need racism of this shape and form in 2021.”Many South Koreans living abroad expressed concerns that the remarks could incite anti-Asian violence, already on the rise in many places.“This is not just about #BTS, it is about so many Asian people who are dealing with extreme racism especially due to pandemic,” Hansl Chang, a South Korean who lives in Germany, tweeted.In the station's apology, it said that while Matuschik was “presenting his opinion in an ironic, exaggerated way and with exaggerated excitement, his words went too far and hurt the feelings of BTS fans.“But he — and he has assured us of this — in no way intended this. He just wanted to express his displeasure over the aforementioned cover version.”It noted that Matuschik has been involved in helping raise aid for refugees and has a “constant campaign against right-wing extremism” and has shown he is against xenophobia or racism in any form.“That does not change the fact that many of you found his statements to be hurtful or racist,” Bayern3 said. “We apologize for this in every way possible. We will work on the matter with Matthias and the team in detail again in the next few days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-radio-jockey-matthias-matuschik-compares-bts-to-covid19-101614493187039.html
28-02-2021||World||OPEC+ faces calls to cool oil market frenzy with extra barrels||From trading houses in Geneva to Wall Street banks, much of the oil world agrees that global markets could use some more barrels. The big question is whether OPEC+ will provide enough of them.A crude glut that piled up during the pandemic is vanishing fast. Global inventories are plunging at the steepest rate in two decades, according to Morgan Stanley. Prices have rallied to pre-virus levels, while U.S. production has taken a hit from freezing storms. Talk swirls of market supercycles, and even the return of $100 oil.With the need for more supply evident, traders expect the OPEC+ coalition, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, will agree to increase production when it meets this week, reversing some of the output cuts made last year.But it’s unclear if the group will act vigorously enough. Wary of the virus’s persisting threat to demand, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has urged fellow producers to remain “extremely cautious.”If the alliance agrees an output hike that falls short of requirements, however, it could trigger a further price surge -- and the group would be forced to deal with its unwelcome consequences.“There’s a real risk they’re going to over-tighten the market,” said Bill Farren-Price, a director at research firm Enverus and veteran observer of the cartel. “It’s already super-tight, and if OPEC just focuses on keeping prices up, that’s going to eventually provoke supplies from their rivals.”The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies rescued the global oil industry from an unprecedented slump last year by slashing production when the coronavirus crisis pummeled demand. The strategy has revived international benchmark Brent crude to $67 a barrel, shoring up revenues for the producers’ battered economies.The 23-nation coalition continues to idle just over 7 million barrels of daily output -- about 7% of global supply -- and on Thursday will decide whether to revive a 500,000-barrel tranche in April. In addition, the Saudis will confirm whether an extra 1 million barrels they’ve recently taken offline will return as scheduled.Demand RecoveryGlobal oil markets are signaling that they could comfortably absorb the full complement of 1.5 million barrels.Demand in China, the world’s biggest oil importer, is back above pre-virus levels as its containment of the disease allows much of normal life and economic activity to resume. India, another key customer, warns that high prices are jeopardizing the global economic recovery. Propelled by cold weather, fuel use in Japan, the fourth-largest oil consumer, posted in January its first year-on-year increase since mid-2019.In the U.S., stockpiles of crude oil and refined products are back near levels last seen a year ago. Though demand for aviation fuels remains depressed, purchases of products that cater to working and consuming at home -- like diesel for trucks and plastics -- have boomed.OPEC’s own data show it can go ahead with this year’s scheduled production increases and still manage to deplete world oil inventories, whittling them down to their five-year average -- the group’s desired target -- by August.Futures markets testify that supplies are tightening sharply.Near-term Brent contracts are commanding a sizable premium over later months known as backwardation, with the six-month spread standing at $3.22 a barrel. That reflects “a sustained, strong short-term deficit” of about 2 million to 3 million barrels a day, according to Giovanni Serio, global head of market analysis at Vitol Group, the world’s biggest oil trader.Bullish CallsThe shift to a tightening market has sparked a wave of bullish projections.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Brent hitting $75 a barrel in the third quarter as a new commodities supercycle beckons, while trading giant Trafigura Group says it’s “very bullish” on the months ahead. Socar Trading SA, a unit of Azerbaijan’s state oil company, predicts $80 could be reached this summer and triple digits within two years.“The fear is that in 12 months there will be a shortage” even if OPEC+ revives output, said Socar Chief Trading Officer Hayal Ahmadzada. “It will drive the price very high, very fast.”It’s still unclear what exactly OPEC+ will decide.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has signaled that the country once again wants to proceed with an increase, noting on Feb. 14 that “the market is balanced” already. Saudi Arabia sounds more reserved, urging its counterparts to recall the “scars” of last year’s collapse.Prices are still far below the levels most OPEC nations need to cover government spending, and the International Energy Agency -- a leading forecaster -- anticipates a market setback in the second quarter as a seasonal lull briefly causes inventories to accumulate again.If Riyadh wants to limit the overall size of the group’s increase, it has a powerful bargaining chip: the pace it chooses to return the extra 1-million barrel cutback that’s supposed to expire at the end of next month.But for some in the market, the kingdom should instead be opening the taps wide. Keeping prices high will only rekindle investment by U.S. shale drillers, they contend, and bring a flood of new supply that cancels out OPEC’s hard work.Even the full 1.5 million barrels isn’t sufficient to satisfy demand, says Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC.“The market needs more -- but I don’t hear anybody talking about more,” said Stuart. “There’s an acute need for oil. The most obvious risk is they keep holding too much oil back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opec-faces-calls-to-cool-oil-market-frenzy-with-extra-barrels-101614493987317.html
28-02-2021||World||Prince William warns against anti-vaccination messages on social media||Prince William has warned that anti-vaccination messages are rife on social media and urged those eligible to get jabs, following a similar appeal by his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II."Social media is awash sometimes with lots of rumours and misinformation," the Duke of Cambridge said in video footage released by Kensington Palace on Saturday evening.It showed him and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, speaking to two women who are clinically vulnerable and eligible for first jabs soon.In one video call, a woman called Shivali, who has type 2 diabetes, said she had read a lot of social media posts that made her "a bit nervous" about getting vaccinated initially, while she was now confident about getting the jab.The prince told her: "We have to be a little bit careful who we believe and where we get our information from, especially for those who are clinically vulnerable as well, it's so important that these vaccinations are done.""Catherine and I are not medical experts by any means but if it's any consolation we can wholeheartedly support having vaccinations, it's really, really important."Vaccine uptake so far has been "amazing," the prince said, while the task now is to ensure that younger generations "feel that it's really important for them to have it."The video came after the 94-year-old Queen on Thursday urged people to take up the vaccine, saying it "didn't hurt at all," when she received it in January, along with Prince Philip.She said that those who feared getting the vaccine, "ought to think about other people rather than themselves."Her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, 72, who contracted a mild dose of Covid-19 last year, has also received his jab, as has his second wife, Camilla, 73.The royal family is speaking out as health officials have voiced concerns over lower take-up among ethnic minority communities.The UK so far has given more than 19 million people a first vaccine dose after launching its innoculation programme in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-warns-against-anti-vaccination-messages-on-social-media-101614486819714.html
28-02-2021||World||Jamal Khashoggi killing: For some, US report 'vindication' of Prince Salman||A U.S. intelligence report blaming the Saudi crown prince for a critic’s murder is being celebrated by some commentators in the kingdom as an effective vindication.The four-page document released by President Joe Biden’s administration on Friday concluded that Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved an operation to capture or kill Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was dismembered by Saudi agents in Turkey in 2018. It also stated that Prince Mohammed supported “using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad.”Also Read | US implicates Saudi crown prince in journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killingFor the prince’s supporters in Saudi Arabia, the report represented a practical victory, because it contained no new details, didn’t disclose any evidence on which it was based, and used equivocal words like “probably.” Sanctions announced against various Saudi officials didn’t include the prince, and Saudis who’d worried the report might harm the 35-year-old heir to the throne breathed a sigh of relief.“The Biden administration deserves thanks and appreciation from Saudis for publishing the report,” Salman Aldosary, a Saudi columnist who’s close to the kingdom’s leadership, wrote on Twitter. “It closed a door that overt and covert enemies sought to profit from.”Also Read | Jamal Khashoggi murder: Saudis reject chargeOn Saturday, Prince Mohammed was photographed attending a Formula E race in Riyadh, the same evening multiple blasts rocked the city during a missile attack that the government said came from Iran-backed Houthi fighters in neighboring Yemen. The kingdom intercepted the missile attack, and it was unclear if it occurred while Prince Mohammed was attending the race.Apart from the pressure over the Khashoggi case, the Biden administration has put a hold on some key weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and announced new efforts to bring an end to the war in Yemen where Saudi Arabia heads a military coalition against the Houthis.Prince Mohammed has denied involvement in the Khashoggi killing, while saying he accepts symbolic responsibility as the country’s de facto ruler. A statement by the Saudi Foreign Ministry rejected the report, saying it was inaccurate and “unacceptable.”Several states in the region rushed to back the Saudi government, with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait and Djibouti all expressing support for the kingdom’s rejection of the report.“The report is pretty much what someone thinks might have happened,” with “no actual concrete evidence pointing to the crown prince,” said Prince Talal Al Faisal, a businessman and junior royal. “It reads to me as something the Biden administration wanted to publish to placate a certain constituency within the U.S.”Climate of FearFreedom of speech is limited in Saudi Arabia, and a climate of fear caused by a political crackdown in recent years has silenced most critics of the crown prince. For those who had hoped the U.S. administration would wound or chastise the prince, the report was a disappointment.The crown prince “should not be an exception to the rule of law,” said Abdullah Alaoudh, a member of the opposition National Assembly Party formed last year by a group of Saudi dissidents abroad.Biden called the killing “outrageous,” and said in an interview with Univision News he’d told Saudi King Salman “that the rules are changing” in the relationship between the U.S. and the world’s biggest oil producer.Recalibrating relations is “a common goal” for both parties, said Saudi political scientist Hesham Alghannam.“The Saudis are trying to be pragmatic in what they can achieve,” said Alghannam, a senior research fellow at the Gulf Research Center Cambridge. “They differentiate very well between what they want the region to be and what is possible at the current moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jamal-khashoggi-killing-for-some-us-report-vindication-of-prince-salman-101614490103862.html
28-02-2021||World||Virginia votes to legalize marijuana, end disparate treatment of people of color||Virginia lawmakers gave final approval Saturday to a bill that will legalize marijuana for adult recreational use, but not until 2024, when retail sales of the drug would also begin.With a compromise bill clearing the House and Senate, Virginia becomes the first Southern state to vote to legalize marijuana, joining 15 other states and the District of Columbia. The legislation now goes to Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who supports legalization.The bill was a top priority for Democrats, who framed legalization as a necessary step to end the disparate treatment of people of color under current marijuana laws. But talks between Democrats in the House and Senate grew tense in recent days, and a compromise version of the massive bill did not emerge publicly until late Saturday afternoon.“It’s been a lot of work to get here, but I would say that we’re on the path to an equitable law allowing responsible adults to use cannabis," said Sen. Adam Ebbin, the chief sponsor of the Senate bill.Several Democrats said they hoped Northam would send the legislation back to them with amendments, including speeding up the date for legalization.“If we have already made the decision that simple possession should be repealed, we could have done that today and ended the disproportionate fines on communities of color,” said Sen. Jennifer McClellan.Also read: Teen use, mental health spur talk of marijuana curbs“Let's be absolutely clear — this bill is not legalization, and there are a lot of steps between here and legalization," she said.Northam's spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky, said the governor “looks forward to continuing to improve this legislation.”“There's still a lot of work ahead, but this bill will help to reinvest in our communities and reduce inequities in our criminal justice system,” she said.Under the legislation, possession of up to an ounce (28.3 grams) of marijuana will become legal beginning Jan. 1, 2024, at the same time sales will begin and regulations will go into effect to control the marijuana marketplace in Virginia.Under a provision Senate Democrats insisted on, the legislation will include a re-enactment clause that will require a second vote from the General Assembly next year, but only on the regulatory framework and criminal penalties for several offenses, including underage use and public consumption of marijuana. A second vote will not be required on legalization.The Senate had sought to legalize simple possession this year to immediately end punishments for people with small amounts of marijuana, but House Democrats argued that legalization without a legal market for marijuana could promote the growth of the black market.Lawmakers last year decriminalized marijuana, making simple possession a civil penalty that can be punished by a fine of no more than $25.Also read: US arrests wife of Mexico cartel chief El Chapo on drug chargesHouse Majority Leader Charniele Herring said that while the legislation isn’t perfect, it was a “justice bill.”"This moves us in a ... direction to strike down and to address those institutional barriers, and over-policing, over-arrests, over-convictions of African Americans who do not use marijuana at a higher rate than our white counterparts, but we seem to get the brunt of criminal convictions," Herring said.A recent study by the legislature’s research and watchdog agency found that from 2010-2019, the average arrest rate of Black individuals for marijuana possession was 3.5 times higher than the arrest rate for whites. The study also found that Black people were convicted at a rate 3.9 times higher than whites.The bill calls for dedicating 30% of marijuana tax revenue — after program costs — to a Cannabis Equity Reinvestment Fund. The money would be used to help communities that have been historically over-policed for marijuana crimes, with funds going toward scholarships, workforce development and job placement services, and low- or no-interest loans for qualified cannabis businesses.Virginians who have a marijuana-related conviction, have family members with a conviction, or live in an area that is economically distressed could qualify as social equity applicants who would get preference for licenses to get into the marijuana marketplace as cultivators, wholesalers, processors and retailers.The largest portion of the tax revenue from marijuana sales would go toward funding pre-K for at-risk kids.The bill drew sharp criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and and other racial justice advocacy groups.“Today, the Virginia General Assembly failed to legalize marijuana for racial justice. Lawmakers paid lip service to the communities that have suffered decades of harm caused by the racist War on Drugs with legislation that falls short of equitable reform and delays justice,” the ACLU said in a tweet.Groups that opposed legalization entirely have said they are concerned that it could result in an increase in drug-impaired driving crashes and the use of marijuana among youth.Republican lawmakers spoke against the measure Saturday night, saying such a critical issue deserved a less rushed approach."I would say there are not more than two or three members of this body that have a clue about the comprehensiveness of what this bill does," said Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virginia-votes-to-legalize-marijuana-end-disparate-treatment-of-people-of-color-101614480454644.html
28-02-2021||World||UK's NHS to invite 'over-60s' to book Covid-19 vaccine jabs at nearest centres||The UK's vaccination programme against COVID-19 enters a new phase on Sunday as the National Health Service (NHS) will begin contacting all over-60s to book their jabs at the nearest vaccination centre or with a general practitioner (GP) or pharmacy.Almost 2 million people aged 60 to 63 will be invited after over 64s had been covered in the previous phase and letters will start arriving from Monday explaining how they can make an appointment for the jab.They follow more than three in four people aged 65 to 70 taking up the offer of a vaccination and nearly 17 million people across England, over a third of the adult population, having received the “life-saving jab”.“Our incredible vaccination programme is accelerating and well over one in three people across the UK have now received their first jab,” said Nadhim Zahawi, UK Vaccine Deployment Minister.“We are now inviting those aged 60 to 63 to receive their vaccines and I urge everybody to come forward as quickly as possible to protect yourself and others from this terrible virus. Thank you to everyone on the frontline, including NHS vaccinators, GPs, pharmacists and volunteers, whose unrivalled dedication to protect the most vulnerable should be applauded,” he said.The latest move comes after the NHS wrote to almost 450,000 people aged 64 along with 600,000 who have recently been asked to shield due to underlying health conditions last week.“The NHS vaccination programme, the biggest in the health service’s history and fastest in Europe, goes from strength to strength. I would urge anyone who has been invited to take up the offer – it doesn’t matter when you were invited you can still come forward and protect yourself and others,” said Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director.The push to get as many of the most at-risk people protected means nine in 10 people in the top four priority groups have received a jab. The UK government aims to give a jab to all over-50s and those in specific at-risk groups by April 15 and all other adults are expected to be offered their first dose by July 31."Since around four-fifths of 65-69 year olds have now been vaccinated, we're rapidly working our way down the generations, with people ages 60 now able to come forward. As expected vaccine supply increases in March, we're planning for further acceleration as we head towards Easter," said Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England.England’s Deputy Chief Medical Office, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, added that “be reassured the queue is moving really fast and that you're going to get to the front of the queue because it's moving fast".It follows the updated recommendation by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) earlier this week that the rollout will continue to follow an age-based approach. The government has faced some calls to prioritise vaccines based on occupation, such as for teachers who will have to start reopening schools post-lockdown from next month."Thankfully, teachers are no more likely to catch COVID than any other member of the population who goes to work, and so trying to come up with a scheme which prioritises one professional group over another would have been complicated to put in place and wouldn't have done what we asked the JCVI to do... which is to make sure that we minimise the people who die," said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, during a Downing Street press conference on Friday.Vaccinations are now being administered at more than 1,600 sites across England, including mosques, museums and rugby grounds, with the distribution of centres meaning 98 per cent of the country lives within 10 miles of at least one vaccination service.Appointments are staggered to allow for social distancing and people are being asked not to turn up early to avoid creating queues. Everyone will receive a health status check and a pre-vaccination assessment before they have their jab.NHS teams are also visiting those who are housebound and cannot travel to a vaccination service.All four UK nations – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – will follow the approach recommended by the JCVI and begin expanding the age groups eligible for jabs over the course of the next few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-nhs-to-invite-over-60s-to-book-covid-19-vaccine-jabs-at-nearest-centres-101614487255948.html

It said police had given warnings before using stun grenades to disperse people.Several journalists were among those detained, their media organisations and colleagues said.Also read: Myanmar: Woman shot at during crackdown on protests'INSTIL FEAR'Youth activist Esther Ze Naw said people were battling to overcome the fear of the military they had lived with for so long."This fear will only grow if we keep living with it and the people who are creating the fear know that. It's obvious they're trying to instil fear in us by making us run and hide," she said."We can't accept that."One woman was shot and wounded in the central town of Monwya, 7Day News and an emergency worker said. 7Day and two other media organisations had earlier reported that she was killed.Junta leader General Min Aung Hlaing has said authorities have been using minimal force. Nevertheless, at least three protesters have died over the days of turmoil. The army said a policeman has been killed in the unrest.Saturday's violence came after Myanmar's Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun told the UN General Assembly he was speaking on behalf of Suu Kyi's government and appealed for help to end the coup.Also read: Myanmar's UN ambassador vows to fight after junta fired himMRTV television said he had been fired in accordance with civil service rules because he had "betrayed the country" and "abused the power and responsibilities of an ambassador".However, the United Nations has not officially recognised the junta as Myanmar's new government.UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said he was overwhelmed by the ambassador's "act of courage", adding on Twitter, "It's time for the world to answer that courageous call with action".Myanmar's generals have traditionally shrugged off diplomatic pressure. They have promised to hold a new election but not set a date.Suu Kyi's party and supporters said the result of the November vote must be respected.Suu Kyi, 75, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest during military rule. She faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios and of violating a natural disaster law by breaching coronavirus protocols.The next hearing in her case is set for Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coup-stalls-democracy-protesters-gather-in-myanmar-after-hundreds-arrested-101614478084575.html

The president is referring to the fact that on Monday, the State Department will provide more details and elaborate on those announcements, not new announcements," the official said.Khashoggi, a US resident who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of MbS policies, was killed and dismembered by a team of operatives linked to the prince in the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.The Saudi government, which has denied any involvement by the crown prince, on Friday issued a statement rejecting the US report’s findings and repeating its previous statements that Khashoggi’s killing was a heinous crime by a rogue group.Among the punitive steps the United States took on Friday was the imposition of a visa ban on some Saudis believed involved in the Khashoggi killing and sanctions on others, including a former deputy intelligence chief, which would freeze their US assets and generally bar Americans from dealing with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-saudi-announcement-to-come-monday-white-house-plays-down-new-steps-101614478027600.html
28-02-2021||World||Saudi Arabia says Huthi missile attack on Riyadh thwarted||Loud explosions shook Riyadh on Saturday as a Saudi-led military coalition said it thwarted a missile attack launched by Yemen's Huthi rebels, which sent debris raining down on civilian homes.The Iran-backed Huthis have escalated attacks on the kingdom, while they step up an offensive to seize the Saudi-backed Yemeni government's last northern stronghold of Marib.The Saudi-led coalition said it intercepted a Huthi ballistic missile targeting Riyadh, according to the official SPA news agency.Fragments of the missile scattered over several Riyadh neighbourhoods, damaging at least one home but no casualties were reported, state-run Al-Ekhbariya television said.AFP correspondents in the Saudi capital reported hearing multiple loud explosions. The night sky lit up with a bright flash following the interception of a missile, state television footage showed.Separately, the coalition said it intercepted six Huthi drones targeting the kingdom, including the southern cities of Khamis Mushait and Jizan.The rebels did not immediately claim responsibility for any of the attacks. They frequently strike southern areas and have previously targeted Riyadh with missiles and drones.The assaults came as Saudi Arabia hosted a Formula E championship on the outskirts of Riyadh, which state media said was attended by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The Huthis have escalated cross-border attacks on the kingdom even after the United States delisted the rebels as terrorists and stepped up efforts to de-escalate the six-year conflict.The designation, imposed by the administration of former US president Donald Trump, had been widely criticised by aid organisations, who warned it would hamper their efforts to alleviate a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.US President Joe Biden halted support to Saudi offensive operations in Yemen's war, which he called a "catastrophe" that "has to end". But he also reiterated US support for Saudi Arabia in defending its territory.Alongside the cross-border attacks, the Huthis are pressing ahead with a deadly offensive to seize the Yemeni government stronghold of Marib, where some of the country's richest oil fields are found.Years of bombings have failed to shake the rebels' hold on the capital Sanaa, and they have steadily expanded their reach in the country's north.Yemen's grinding conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions, according to international organisations, sparking what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-says-huthi-missile-attack-on-riyadh-thwarted-101614480091115.html
28-02-2021||World||Another former aide accuses New York governor Cuomo of sexual harassment||A second former aide has come forward with sexual harassment allegations against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who responded with a statement Saturday saying he never made advances toward her and never intended to be inappropriate.Charlotte Bennett, a health policy adviser in the Democratic governor's administration until November, told The New York Times that Cuomo asked her inappropriate questions about her sex life, including whether she had ever had sex with older men.Another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, a former deputy secretary for economic development and special adviser to the governor, recently accused Cuomo of subjecting her to an unwanted kiss and inappropriate comments. Cuomo denied the allegations.Cuomo said in a statement Saturday that Bennett was a “hardworking and valued member of our team during COVID” and that “she has every right to speak out.”He said he had intended to be a mentor for Bennett, who is 25.“I never made advances toward Ms. Bennett nor did I ever intend to act in any way that was inappropriate,” Cuomo's statement said. “The last thing I would ever have wanted was to make her feel any of the things that are being reported.”Cuomo, however, said he had authorized an outside review of Bennett's allegations.The governor's special counsel, Beth Garvey, said that review would be conducted by a former federal judge, Barbara Jones.“I ask all New Yorkers to await the findings of the review so that they know the facts before making any judgements,” Cuomo said. "I will have no further comment until the review has concluded.”The pair of harassment allegations represent a deepening crisis for Cuomo, who just months ago was at the height of his popularity for his leadership during the height of the coronavirus pandemic last spring.In recent weeks, he has been assailed, even by some fellow Democrats, over revelations that his administration had substantially underreported COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes.A state assemblyman went public with complaints that Cuomo had threatened to destroy him politically over statements he made in the press, prompting other politicians to share stories about having been bullied by the governor.Bennett did not immediately return a Twitter message seeking comment Saturday night.She told the Times that her most disturbing interaction with Cuomo happened last June 5 when she was alone with him in his Albany office. She said Cuomo started asking her about her personal life, her thoughts on romantic relationships, including whether age was a factor, and said he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.Bennett said she also dodged a question from Cuomo about hugging by saying she missed hugging her parents. She said Cuomo never touched her.“I understood that the governor wanted to sleep with me, and felt horribly uncomfortable and scared,” Bennett told the Times. “And was wondering how I was going to get out of it and assumed it was the end of my job.”Bennett said Cuomo also told her he wanted a girlfriend, “preferably in the Albany area,” and he was lonely since breaking up in 2019 with Sandra Lee, a chef and TV personality.Bennett also said she tried to change the subject when Cuomo's comments were making her uncomfortable, telling him she was thinking of getting a tattoo. Cuomo, she told the Times, responded by suggesting she put the tattoo on her buttocks to avoid people seeing it when she wore a dress.Bennett said she informed Cuomo's chief of staff, Jill DesRosiers, about the interaction less than a week later. She said she was transferred to another job on the opposite side of the Capitol. At the end of June, she said she also gave a statement to a special counsel for Cuomo.Garvey acknowledged that the complaint had been made and that Bennett had been transferred as a result to a position in which she had already been interested.Garvey said in a statement that Bennett's allegations “did not include a claim of physical contact or inappropriate sexual conduct” and Bennett “was consulted regarding the resolution, and expressed satisfaction and appreciation for the way in which it was handled.”“The determination reached based on the information Ms Bennett provided was that no further action was required which was consistent with Ms Bennett’s wishes,” Garvey said.Bennett told the newspaper she decided not to push for any further action by the administration. She said she liked her new job and “wanted to move on.”Jones, who will oversee the investigation, was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, in 1995. As a judge, she struck down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal recognition of same-sex marriage in a ruling later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.After retiring, she joined the law firm Bracewell LLP, where her work focuses on corporate compliance and investigations.Her arbitration work included a 2014 decision throwing out Ray Rice’s suspension by the NFL for punching his fiancé in an elevator in an attack recorded on video.Boylan said in Twitter postings Saturday night that she was proud of Bennett and alleged Cuomo “tried to destroy many, including me, in the press.”“You are not going to derail or destroy any more lives,” she tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-former-aide-accuses-new-york-governor-cuomo-of-sexual-harassment-101614479387954.html

He was dressed in surgical scrubs with a patient undergoing the procedure just out of view; the beeps of medical machinery can be heard in the background.“Hello, Mr. Green? Hi. Are you available for trial?” asked a courtroom clerk as an officer summoned to appear in trial raised her eyebrows. “It kind of looks like you're in an operating room right now?”“I am, sir,” Green replied. “Yes, I'm in an operating room right now. Yes, I'm available for trial. Go right ahead.”The clerk reminded Green the proceedings were being livestreamed because traffic trials are required by law to be open to the public, and Green said he understood. He appeared to continue working with his head down while waiting for Court Commissioner Gary Link to enter the chamber.When Link appeared and saw the doctor on the screen, the judge hesitated to proceed with the trial out of concern for the welfare of the patient.“I have another surgeon right here who's doing the surgery with me, so I can stand here and allow them to do the surgery also,” Green said.The judge said he didn't think it was appropriate to conduct trial under the circumstances. He told Green he'd rather set a new date for trial “when you're not actively involved or participating and attending to the needs of a patient.”Green apologized.“Sometimes, surgery doesn't always go as,” he said before the judge interrupted him.“It happens. We want to keep people healthy, we want to keep them alive. That's important," Link said.The board said it would look into the incident, saying it “expects physicians to follow the standard of care when treating their patients.”A call seeking comment from Green has not been returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-you-available-doctor-appears-in-court-video-call-while-performing-surgery-101614474352108.html

It has established mosques, madrasas, orphanages and Islamic centers in several cities including the capital city Kathmandu. It seems the IHH has taken a special interest in places like Sunsari that are close to the Indian border.The Islami Sangh Nepal (ISN), a Kathmandu-based organisation, came under the scanner of Indian intelligence agencies for allegedly providing sanctuary to fugitive Indian terrorists in 2018.The ISN's connection to Turkey's radical Islamists is not only limited to the IHH. It was also listed as a member of an organization called the Union of NGOs of the Islamic World (Islam Dunyasi Sivil Toplum Kuruluslari Birligi, or IDSB), a front outfit for Turkish paramilitary group SADAT.Turkish government's development agency TIKA is also one of the sponsors of ISN activities in Nepal.Ali Fuat Yilmazer, former head of the Turkish police intelligence section that specializes in radical religious groups, testified in court on August 16, 2016 that "the IHH campaigns are designed to provide aid for jihadists engaged in terrorism around the world and supply medical aid, funding, logistics and human resources for jihadists."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alqaeda-linked-turkish-group-expanding-base-in-areas-close-to-indo-nepal-border-101614471782289.html

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, warned the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Friday that no country should recognize or legitimize the Myanmar junta.If the Myanmar junta, led by General Min Aung Hlaing, tries to seek international recognition by installing a new U.N. envoy it could set off a fight at the world body that could culminate with a vote at the General Assembly.The U.N. has previously had to address competing claims for representation at the world body.In September 2011, the General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country's interim government. The move came after the United States, Russia, China and European nations had all recognized the new authorities.Kyaw Moe Tun told the United Nations on Friday that he was speaking for Suu Kyi's government and appealed for help to overturn "the illegal and unconstitutional military coup." Such an address - at odds with those in power in a country - is rare.Elected lawmakers ousted in the coup have formed a committee and Kyaw Moe Tun said that is the "legitimate and duly elected government of Myanmar and must be recognized by the international community as such."Guterres has pledged to mobilize international pressure "to make sure that this coup fails." The Security Council has voiced concern over the state of emergency, but stopped short of condemning the coup due to opposition by Russia and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-un-ambassador-vows-to-fight-after-junta-fired-him-101614473242368.html

28-02-2021||World||Lockdown announced in Auckland, second in a month||Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, woke up on Sunday morning to a second lockdown in a month as health authorities try to rein in a coronavirus cluster of the more contagious UK variant.The seven-day lockdown, announced late Saturday by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, follows a three-day stay-at-home order in mid-February after a local emergence of the UK variant of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.Genomic sequencing of a new case recorded on Saturday, which prompted the lockdown, was linked to the existing cluster, health authorities said on Sunday, bringing it to 13 cases."It's unlikely we wouldn't see more cases," COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins told the state-owned television network TVNZ on Sunday. "How many cases at this point we simply don't know."The new case has been considered infectious for a week. The person, a 21-year-old student, visited a number of public spaces during that time.The new lockdown, with Level 3 restrictions, allows people to leave home only for essential shopping and essential work. Public venues will remain closed. Restrictions in the rest of the country will be tightened to Level 2, including limits on public gatherings.The lockdown has complicated several high-visibility sporting events planned in Auckland. The organisers of the America's Cup yacht race are reviewing plans for the head-to-head final between Italy and New Zealand.New Zealand's fourth Twenty20 International cricket match against Australia has been shifted to Wellington where it will be played behind closed doors on Friday.New Zealand and neighbouring Australia have been highly successful in keeping the coronavirus pandemic from spreading through border closure, aggressive contact tracing and high community compliance with swift public health orders.New Zealand, with a population of 5 million, has recorded just over 2,000 coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic and 26 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-announced-in-auckland-second-in-a-month-101614470246580.html

The FDA told the company it will “rapidly work towards finalisation and issuance of an emergency use authorisation”, which is expected over the weekend.

28-02-2021||World||Jamal Khashoggi murder: Saudis reject charge||AgenciesSaudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, popularly referred to as MBS, had approved an operation to capture or kill Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, a US intelligence report said, drawing a sharp rebuke from Riyadh.“The government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia completely rejects the.... assessment in the report pertaining to the kingdom’s leadership, and notes that the report contained inaccurate information and conclusions,” the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency SPA after the US released the report on Friday.The US, however, sanctioned some of those allegedly involved in Khashoggi’s murder but not the crown prince himself, sparking criticism from some sections of the American media.“The crime was committed by a group of individuals that have transgressed all pertinent regulations... and the kingdom’s leadership took the necessary steps to ensure that such a tragedy never takes place again,” the Saudi foreign ministry added.“The ministry of foreign affairs affirms that the partnership between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States of America is a robust and enduring partnership,” it said.A Saudi Arabian court jailed eight people last year for between seven and 20 years over the murder of Khashoggi after his family forgave his killers and enabled death sentences to be set aside.Khashoggi, who was a critic of the crown prince, was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018, where he had gone to obtain documents for his impending wedding. His body was dismembered and removed from the building and his remains have not been found.The US intelligence report said that given the crown prince’s influence, it was “highly unlikely” that the 2018 murder could have taken place without his green light. The killing also fit a pattern of “the crown prince’s support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad”.UAE and Kuwait support Saudi Arabia’s positionThe UAE and Kuwait have both backed Saudi Arabia’s position on the US intelligence report. The UAE foreign ministry “expressed its confidence in and support for the Saudi judiciary rulings, which affirm the kingdom’s commitment to implementing the law in a transparent and impartial manner, and holding all those involved in this case accountable,” state news agency WAM reported.Kuwait’s foreign ministry said Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of King Salman and MBS, plays an important role in its rejection of violence and extremism, according to Kuwait News Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jamal-khashoggi-murder-saudis-reject-charge-101614469363291.html
28-02-2021||World||Myanmar: Woman shot at during crackdown on protests||Police launched their most sweeping crackdown in three weeks of protests against military rule on Saturday in towns and cities across Myanmar, and one woman was shot and wounded and dozens of people were detained.Three domestic media outlets said earlier that the woman shot in the central town of Monwya had died but an ambulance service official said she was in hospital. Police were not available for comment.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her party leadership, alleging fraud in a November election her party won in a landslide.The coup, which stalled Myanmar’s progress towards democracy, has brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets and drawn condemnation from Western countries, with some imposing limited sanctions.Police were out in force in cities and towns from early on Saturday in their most determined effort yet to stamp out the protests.Myanmar’s ambassador to UN fired: ReportMyanmar’s UN ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun has been fired, state television said on Saturday, a day after he urged the United Nations to use “any means necessary” to reverse the February 1 military coup.Kyaw Moe Tun had told the UN General Assembly he was speaking on behalf of the civilian government of Suu Kyi. State television said he had “betrayed the country and spoken for an unofficial organisation which doesn’t represent the country and had abused the power and responsibilities of an ambassador”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-woman-shot-at-during-crackdown-on-protests-101614469067110.html

One dose was 85% protective against the most severe Co-19 illness, in a massive study that spanned three continents — protection that remained strong even in countries such as South Africa, where the variants of most concern are spreading.“The more vaccines that have high efficacy that we can get into play, the better,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said ahead of the FDA’s ruling.Shipments of a few million doses to be divided among states could begin as early as Monday. By the end of March, J&J has said it expects to deliver 20 million doses to the U.S., and 100 million by summer.J&J also is seeking authorization for emergency use of its vaccine in Europe and from the World Health Organization. Worldwide, the company aims to produce about 1 billion doses globally by the end of the year. On Thursday, the island nation of Bahrain became the first to clear its use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jjs-1-dose-shot-cleared-giving-us-3rd-covid-19-vaccine-101614468364296.html

But the rise is not limited to Maharashtra. Several states where mutant strains have not been found are seeing a spike in the number of cases. And scientists dismissed any link between the resurgence of cases and the mutant strains.Here is what we know about Covid-19 mutants, variants> Mutants and variants are not the same, scientists have emphasised. While variants differ from the original virus, a mutation is a change in a nucleic acid base or amino acid molecule.> Mutations eventually accumulate to generate variants that differ from the original virus more and more, and so, a variant can have limited or even cumulative mutations, virologist Upasana Ray told news agency PTI.> The longer a virus stays in the population and spreads, the more the mutations and hence more variants.> Mutations are not surprising. Over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been documented, but these are not variants. A study from Hyderabad's CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology put the number of total mutations in India as 7,684.> These mutations were documents from the data analysis of 6,017 genomes sequenced so far. “That doesn’t mean 7,000 variants are going around in the country.

28-02-2021||India||Stress key reason for teachers to quit job before, during pandemic: Study||Before and during the pandemic, the teachers cited stress as the common reason for leaving the profession, suggest the findings of a new survey.The RAND Corporation survey was conducted of nearly 1,000 former public-school teachers. Three of four former teachers said work was often or always stressful in the most recent year in which they taught in a public school.In fact, teachers cited stress nearly twice as often as insufficient pay as a reason for quitting. Most former teachers went on to take jobs with less or equal pay, with 3 in 10 taking jobs with no health insurance or retirement benefits.Covid-19 appears to have exacerbated teachers' stress. Almost half of the public-school teachers who left the profession early and voluntarily since March 2020 listed Covid-19 as the main reason for their departure. Covid-19 has elevated stress by forcing teachers to work more hours and navigate an unfamiliar remote environment, made worse by frequent technical problems."Different Covid-19 stressors affected pandemic teachers differently," said Melissa Diliberti, lead author of the report and an assistant policy researcher at RAND, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organisation. "Insufficient pay and childcare responsibilities drove out younger teachers under 40, while older teachers were more likely to say health conditions made them leave."Those still in education report the top attractions about their new education jobs are more flexibility in their schedules and a better work climate. Of teachers who left the profession and are currently employed, about 3 in 10 holds a non-education-related job, 3 in 10 have a different type of teaching position, and the rest are in non-teaching education jobs.There is some good news for school districts: A substantial share of former public-school teachers are willing to come back to the profession under certain conditions."Despite the many reasons public school teachers left, about half of those who left primarily because of Covid-19 said they would be willing to come back once most staff are vaccinated or there was regular rapid Covid-19 testing of staff and students," said Heather Schwartz, co-author and director of the Pre-K to 12 educational systems program at RAND.The survey was conducted in December 2020 using the RAND American Educator Panels, nationally representative samples of educators who provide their feedback on important issues of educational policy and practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stress-key-reason-for-teachers-to-quit-job-before-during-pandemic-study-101614529986890.html

Abdullah was responding to media queries.Senior Congress leaders Kapil Sibal and Anand Sharma on Saturday had stated that the Congress party was “getting weaker”.“The point is what Rahul Gandhi is saying and what these G 23 leaders are saying… Why should I react to them? I mean, what have I got to do with them? I am not saying any of these things which they are saying. It is for them to decide and set their house in order,” said Abdullah.He, however, quickly added that he wanted the Congress to be strong.“I want the Congress party to be strong. I want the Congress to unite and fight the divisive forces of the country. Congress must unite and must become strong. People look up to the Congress in trying to sort things out in the country. They are part of this nation and a 150-year-old party,” added Abdullah.Also read: 8,293 new cases in Maharashtra as Covid-19 spike continues amid lockdown, curbsOn Saturday, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi alleged that democracy in India was “dead”. He was speaking at VOC College in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu ahead of the Assembly elections.On the killing of Krishna Dhaba owner’s son in Srinagar in a terror attack, Abdullah said, “He was cremated today. We have already reacted to it and it was very tragic. Those who shout from the top of the mountain that everything is hunky-dory here (J&K) and they bring the ambassadors to show them how good it is here, should answer for that. It should be the L-G. If militancy is dead, he should answer. The DG and police should answer who say every day that it is over.”On February 17, terrorists belonging to the ‘Muslim Janbaz Force’ - an offshoot of proscribed terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba - attacked Krishna Dhaba’ in Srinagar’s Durganag area when 24 foreign diplomats were visiting the Union territory.The son of the owner of popular food joint Krishna Dhaba, who was injured in the terrorist attack on the eatery, succumbed to his injuries on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-must-unite-to-defeat-divisive-forces-farooq-abdullah-101614529493401.html

No words are enough to express gratitude towards all the Corona Warriors, who risked their own lives to save the lives of others. It's unfortunate and a great personal loss for me that so many of them lost their lives during this time," he said.In this context, the Union Minister also noted GAPIO's efforts towards establishing the Global Indian Physician Covid-19 Collaborative to continuously share their knowledge and experiences to arrive at the best possible approach for the management of Covid-19, the statement said.Vardhan took the occasion to highlight the government's efforts in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic."It has been a result of our pre-emptive, proactive and graded approach that India has been able to perform well on various parameters related to Covid-19. We have continuously maintained one of the lowest fatality rates and highest recovery rates across the world," he was quoted as saying in the statement."Even with all the attention directed towards managing Covid-19, our government did not lose sight of ensuring continuity of other essential health services. Various policy interventions as well as the use of technology like telemedicine services played a key role in this regard. Our e-Sanjeevani platform has recorded millions of doctor-patient consultations in a short span of time," he said.The Health Minister also noted the contribution of scientists."Our scientists have done remarkably well, working round the clock to provide us with two vaccines which are being indigenously manufactured and have been approved for emergency use in India. The world's largest vaccine drive is underway in the country and is moving forward at a rapid pace with more than 1 crore doses administered already," he said."In what is a remarkable endorsement of our spectacular talent and capabilities, India which is often referred to as the pharmacy of the world, is now also emerging as the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing hub of the world," he added.Detailing the ongoing work within the ministry, he said it is now working towards further augmenting healthcare systems through a paradigm shift of policies and overarching programs like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana and Aatmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana.A new thinking is taking shape with the establishment of the National Medical Commission, Nursing Commission Bill and National Commission for Allied Healthcare Professions Bills. Ambitious plans have been made for expanding medical colleges and revamping the healthcare infrastructure in India, he said."We are constantly working to revolutionize the delivery mechanism of healthcare services in the country," he said.Vardhan also mentioned that all the endeavours of the government can greatly benefit from the support and assistance of associations like GAPIO.He added that facilitating exchange of ideas and knowledge will not only help formulate best practices but also expedite their implementation which will ultimately benefit society.Vardhan expressed his appreciation to GAPIO which since its inception in 2011 has endeavoured to bring 1.4 million physicians of Indian-origin across the world on a single platform to facilitate exchange of knowledge, skills and research, Vardhan said, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-lauds-contributions-of-medical-professionals-in-pandemic-101614528028635.html

28-02-2021||India||Appreciating BJP's work ethics, Congress' Rashid Alvi says party must work 24/7, formulate strategy for assembly polls||Praising the Bharatiya Janata Party's work ethic ahead of the Assembly polls in the four states and one Union Territory, Congress leader Rashid Alvi on Sunday said that his party will have work round the clock and formulate a strategy in the upcoming polls to fight BJP."BJP leaders work night and day not regardless of the size of the elections. They do just acts and unjust ones as well. Congress will have work 24/7 and form our own strategy, only then we will be able to fight them," Alvi said while speaking to ANI.This statement comes as 824 assembly constituencies are set to go for polls in four states--Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam-- and the Union Territory of Puducherry. The polling in these states will start on March 27 and conclude on April 29.On the question that Congress leaders are switching sides, Alvi said, "When the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was in power, the BJP's people used to line up to join the Congress but we did not let them in. Today, BJP tries to lure the leaders and indulges in horse-trading.""People with greed for power and those who are threatened by CBI and IT officers join BJP. This has nothing to do with ideology," he added.Slamming his own party for inducting Babulal Chaurasia in Madhya Pradesh, Alvi said, "Babulal Chaurasia, who worshipped Nathuram Godse, has joined Congress in Madhya Pradesh. I have condemned this development. I have written a letter to Sonia Gandhi and asked for his exit from Congress."He further commented on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's regret that he could not learn Tamil Nadu, during his monthly radio programme Maan Ki Baat."If he can learn English then why not Tamil. It does not take much to learn a language. But he is playing politics on language. He does not want to learn the language just want to please Tamil people," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appreciating-bjp-s-work-ethics-congress-rashid-alvi-says-party-must-work-24-7-formulate-strategy-for-assembly-polls-101614525518745.html

28-02-2021||India||Congress faces uphill battle in poll-bound states||The Congress is hoping to benefit from the anti-incumbency factor as well as the public protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and agri laws in the upcoming round of assembly polls, but still faces an uphill task in the coming days.Barring Kerala, where the party feels it is poised to defeat the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), the Congress is beset with ally troubles in all other poll-bound states-- Assam, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu -- and the Union Territory of Puducherry.In West Bengal, the party’s seat-sharing talks with the newly formed Indian Secular Front (ISF) are still underway with the Left-Congress alliance keen to have the fledgling party on board to pocket some of the 30 percent Muslim votes in the state.In Assam too, the party is yet to finalise the agreement with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF, its main ally in the polls.In Tamil Nadu, the Congress is banking fully on DMK to dethrone the incumbent AIADMK, while in Puducherry the grand old party is left with hardly any core strength after the recent fall of the government to face an aggressive BJP, which is leaving no stone unturned to make inroads in the eastern and southern belts.Though seat-sharing talks have started, the Congress is demanding over 50 seats this time which the DMK is reluctant to give.Sources say that DMK is citing the Congress' poor performance in recent polls as well as in the 2016 assembly elections when it won just eight seats out of the 41 it contested.Winning at least one state full steam is key to the revival of the sagging morale of Congress workers and the credibility of Rahul Gandhi as the numero uno in the organisation, observers say.Only yesterday, top Congress dissenters expressed lack of confidence in Rahul Gandhi’s leadership when they said in Jammu that the party was weakening and they had taken upon themselves the responsibility of rebuilding it.Rahul Gandhi and his strategists hope to wrest Tamil Nadu and Kerala as power switches sides in these states every five years. They also believe they can upset the incumbent BJP in Assam.That explains why Congress has announced "mission 100" in Assam which has 126 assembly seats. But this time, it does not have a stalwart like former chief minister Tarun Gogoi who passed away in November last year.BJP leader and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has, however, dared the Congress saying, "A Congress tsunami can only come in Bangladesh".The grand old party also faces a major challenge in West Bengal where the TMC and the BJP having long launched their poll slogans, while the Left and Congress are still dithering on their joint strategy.The eight-phase elections in West Bengal are likely to witness a keen contest between the TMC and the BJP, with the Left parties seeking to regain control after allying with the Congress.In 2016 assembly polls in Bengal, the Congress-Left alliance bagged 38% votes, 7% less than TMC. But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP emerged as the main rival to Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress and the combined vote share of the Congress and the Left plummeted to 15%.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal push in all the poll-bound states is making the road to victory even more rutted for the Congress.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has already started a high-pitched campaign in the southern states and has also toured Assam. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is also set to join the party's campaign in Assam on Monday and Tuesday, where she is likely to address smaller meetings as well as a big rally in Tezpur on March 2.Rahul Gandhi's recent remarks in Kerala about "South Indians being deeply interested in issues unlike North Indians" are being used by the BJP to spin an anti-Congress narrative.The grand old party is attempting damage control by saying Gandhi was talking about the need for people to debate national issues and not superficial matters.With elections announced and seat-sharing details in poll-bound states yet to be disclosed, it remains to be seen how big the turf the Congress gets to fight on as it struggles to retain its pan-India electoral footprint, having lost governments in MP, Karnataka and Puducherry.The Congress party is in power on its own in Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and in an alliance in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.The grand old party faces the challenge of performing well at the hustings in these polls or run the risk of losing its relevance as the principal opposition party, a leader said."Winning these elections is very crucial as it would give the Congress the much-needed confidence to emerge as a stronger opposition force against the Narendra Modi-led BJP," said the leader.It will also boost the Congress' prospects as it enters the next phase of electoral battles in Uttarakhand, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-faces-uphill-battle-in-poll-bound-states-101614524372475.html

On Thursday and Friday, the count consistently remained above 1,000 with 1,145 and 1,035 cases, respectively. Since the middle of February, the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra became a cause of worry as a steady rise in daily cases has been reported from districts.There are 12 active containment zones in Mumbai and 133 buildings have been sealed, according to data released by the Bhrihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.The Centre on Sunday said, six states, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat, contributed to 86.37 per cent of fresh Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours.Among other districts, Pune recorded 790 new cases, Navi Mumbai 153, Thane 211, Amravati 632, Nagpur 796.Maharashtra's Amravati is under lockdown as the district administration extended restrictions till March 8.

28-02-2021||India||Centre to begin live monitoring for toll-plazas to measure queues, waiting time||The ministry of road transport and highways on Monday will launch a live monitoring system for toll plazas across national highways to measure traffic queue length and waiting time on real time basis in a bid to provide immediate management response to reduce bottlenecks and improve efficiency of mandatory FASTag usage.The live monitoring system will measure the ‘Daily Congestion Index’ for each plaza as well as the overall congestion across the national highway network.“It will also give real time details of high peak hours’ traffic at toll plazas. So, our ground officials can concentrate more on that specific time,” a ministry spokesperson said.It also measures the socio-economic impact in terms of saving fuel, wait time and carbon footprint…It also measures external impact like change in weather (rain, fog its), festival season (Diwali, Holi) impact of traffic movement to create advance advisory and preparedness. It also helps to measure the traffic pattern at toll plazas and can compare it with the daily, weekly, monthly pattern,” he added.The Centre has made FASTags mandatory from February 15 midnight and any vehicle not fitted with it will be charged double the toll at electronic toll plazas across the country, as per the current rules.Following the mandatory payment of user fee through FASTags at the toll plazas the electronic toll collection has reached more than ₹100 crore per day, according to NHAI. As on February 25, the toll collection through FASTags reached the highest ever mark of ₹103.94 crore with over 64.5 lakh daily transactions.There have been several reports of long waiting queues across toll plazas since the mandatory FASTag roll out, officials said the live-monitoring system will ensure the initial hurdles are taken care of.“The live monitoring system is also designed to give a forecast of daily traffic for better toll plaza operation and management. It gives improvement suggestions, by automatically changing the lanes according to traffic density. So, the unused perishable road inventory can be utilized. It has an escalation and alert system, which will automatically intimate the problem via SMS/email to ground officials,” a ministry official said.It also gives the list of worst and best-performing toll plazas (on a daily, weekly and monthly basis) which will be analysed by the authorities.“It is simple and will help to improve traffic congestion problem at toll plazas/city roads/highways by using central monitoring system along with bundle of analytics and quick decision-making outputs,” the ministry spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-begin-live-monitoring-for-toll-plazas-to-measure-queues-waiting-time-101614521478027.html
28-02-2021||India||New agriculture reform laws death warrant for farmers: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday described farmers as true patriots and alleged that fake cases were being lodged against them in the context of the agitation against three new agriculture reform laws. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader was speaking at a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.He termed these new laws as a “death warrant” for farmers. Kejriwal said the farmers were in a “do or die” battle because they felt the government would hand over their land to corporates and they would become labourers on their own land.The chief minister said that all the governments in the past 70 years cheated farmers on their demand for an appropriate price for their crops, “but nothing happens after elections”.He also indicated that farmers had nothing to do with the violence that took place on Republic Day at Red Fort during the farmers' tractor rally.“What happened at Red Fort on January 26 was organised by them,” he said without mentioning any names.Also read: 6 states contributed to 86.37% of new Covid-19 cases, says govt“People met me thereafter and told (me) that protesters were deliberately diverted from the prescribed route and those who hoisted a flag at Red Fort were their workers. Our farmers can be anything but anti-nationals,” he added.Kejriwal demanded that fake cases should not be registered against farmers.He also presented a formula for giving a guarantee to purchase 23 crops at minimum support price (MSP).Kejriwal said that every day BJP leaders claimed MSP existed and it would remain.“I challenge Yogiji (UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath) to mention to me one mandi (market) in UP where crops were purchased at MSP,” he said.The Delhi chief minister also spoke about the issues of sugarcane payment, escalating electricity bills, rising prices of fuel and fertilizers.He appealed to the gathering to bring a government with clear intentions in the state and solve all their problems.“Bring a government with clear intentions and farmers would receive the payment before reaching their home after supplying sugarcane to mills,” he said as the crowd hailed him with slogans like “Arvind Kejriwal zindabad (long live Arvind Kejriwal)” and “desh ka neta kaisa ho Arvind Kejriwal jaisa ho (nation's leader should be like Kejriwal)”.The Aam Aadmi Party has already announced it would contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due in February-March next year.Kejriwal said he was the first person who contacted Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait after he burst into tears because of the “atrocities” on farmers at the Ghazipur border.“I was the first person to contact Rakesh Tikait on the phone and made arrangements for drinking water and toilets for the farmers on his appeal,” the AAP chief said.Referring to the Delhi government’s free electricity scheme, he said, “I was also under tremendous pressure and told that power companies were powerful, therefore, we can't do much to minimise power cuts and providing free electricity. But we did that.”AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, local farmer leaders and the party's state president Sabhajeet Singh shared the dais with Kejriwal. Sanjay Singh and Sabhajeet Singh had visited many leaders of khaps (clan-based councils) to mobilise support for the mahapanchayat.The stage had photographs of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, one of the tallest farmer leaders of the country, and the late BKU chief Mahendra Singh Tikait.Kejriwal ended his speech with the slogan “Chaudhary Charan Singh Amar Rahe”.He also honoured khap chaudharies (khap leaders) on the stage and sought their blessings.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-agriculture-reform-laws-death-warrant-for-farmers-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-101614523019519.html

The video then offers visuals of the great architecture of the Dakshineswar metro station designed to in tune with the Dakshineswar Kali temple and said to be one of the most beautiful metro stations in the country.The video states how metro stations used to be boring earlier with cheap infrastructure and ugly trains and then offers shots of the newly built metro station. As the video says, the medieval era architecture of the Dakshineswar metro station takes us to the times of Rani Rashmoni.As per the video, the 4.41km stretch between Dakshineswar and Noapara was sanctioned 11 years ago but more than 500 encroachments took over seven years for the work to progress. It was after 2016 that the work got accelerated and the dreams of lakhs to see a metro train in Dakshineswar got fulfilled.The north-south metro that went beyond Noapara to connect with Dakshineswar took two months of trial runs. The distance between Noapara and Dakshineswar that takes two hours by road can now be travelled in just 62 minutes, as claimed by the video.Also Read | Co-Win registration from 9am tomorrow as India enters 2nd phase of vaccinationThe metro train was described as one of the cheapest in the country with the distance of more than 31km between Dakshineswar and Noapara to be covered in just ₹25.The video also showed the world-class facilities at the metro stations like smart cards, escalators, aesthetical infrastructure and seamless interchange facilities for the passengers to switch between the metro train and suburban railways.This development comes ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections 2021 that is scheduled to be held in eight phases, with the first phase of polling to begin on March 27 and the last phase of polling on April 29.

28-02-2021||India||Co-Win registration from 9am tomorrow as India enters 2nd phase of vaccination||The new version of the Co-win app through which people can register themselves for vaccination is likely to be available on March 1, 9 am as India begins its second phase of vaccination, covering approximately 27 crore people. Senior citizens and those who are 45+ and suffering from co-morbidities will be able to register themselves.Co-Win 2.0 is not a new app. It's an upgrade of the existing app through which the government conducted the first phase of vaccination. For this upgrade, vaccination was stalled on Saturday and Sunday.Here is how you can access the app and register yourself> Cowin 2.0 can be accessed in three ways. You can go to cowin.gov.in, the website and look for the tab where self-registration is allowed (will be live only after the second phase is kicked off)> The app can be accessed through the Aarogya Setu app as well as a separate tab> The app can be downloaded from the Google play store.Private hospitals can't charge more than ₹250 per dose of vaccine> If one does not have access to the internet, spot registration is also allowed in this phase. But all beneficiaries will be registered mandatorily on the application.> As one registers himself or herself through a government ID, it will be authenticated through OTP.> The Co-WIN app can register as many as four family members.> Vaccination certificate will also be generated through this app.This is the first time that the application through which the government has been registering beneficiaries since January 16 is going public. This also comes with the threat of fake sites, applications trying to dupe people. Hence, the government has been urging people to only follow official information.This is also the first time the vaccine shots will be available at private hospitals. The government has fixed the price of vaccines at ₹250 per shot and has also released a list of hospitals, which will become vaccination centres from tomorrow.Several glitches were reported in the Co-Win app as the app was launched on January 16.

When the entire laws are black then they should be taken back. They (Centre) want to lock grains inside a locker, want to do business on hunger in the country, then that will not happen," the farmer leader said."It is necessary to hold mahapanchayats across the country because this is the problem of the entire nation. Dharna will also continue alongside these panchayats. As of now, we have planned programs till March 24. We will travel across the country," Tikait said.He also asserted that the 'dharna' will continue as the government has not agreed with the farmers' demands.On February 24, addressing a Kisan mahapanchayat in Rajasthan's Sikar, Tikait had threatened the Central Government and said that if the three laws are not repealed, the farmers will 'gherao' the Parliament on 40 lakh tractors.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-tractors-ready-as-you-may-have-to-reach-delhi-anytime-rakesh-tikait-101614518304524.html

Arrangements are also in place to incorporate the third prioritized group in the upcoming days.Gauba had asked all the states and union territories to closely monitor the trajectory of Covid infections to prevent surge in cases and assiduously expedite vaccination of priority groups. Chief secretaries of some other states participated in the meeting.Subrahmanyan informed the meeting that Jammu and Kashmir is conducting mandatory universal tests on all incoming travelers.He said that Jammu and Kashmir saw a 40% surge in weekly cases with travellers contributing to 2/3rd of all the positive cases. “In Srinagar district alone 50% of recorded positive cases were travellers,” Subrahmanyan was quoted as saying.The government spokesman did not say which week the chief secretary was referring to and to which it was comparing.However when HT compiled the government’s Covid-19 data for the current month, it found that the surge was not 40% but only around 21%. The data reveals that the UT recorded 403 cases in the first week of February, 432 cases in the second week, 526 cases in the third week and 574 cases in the last week. In terms of percentage, the surge was 7% from first week to second, 21% from second week to third week and 9% from third to fourth week.Dr Qazi Haroon, officer on special duty with the health department to assist the government with corona mitigation efforts and state immunization officer, did not respond to calls from HT. Calls to director health, Kashmir, Samir Mattoo did not connect.The government spokesman said that the chief secretary Subrahmanyan stressed that through concerted efforts the government is consistently monitoring the Covid trajectory among the local population with a special focus on districts with higher tourist footfalls.Currently, the bed occupancy in the designated Covid hospitals is less than 4% with approximately 100 patients admitted to health care institutes that have been prepared to accommodate 3000 patients. “In the given scenario, the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is by and large comfortable and under control,” Subrahmanyam said.The chief secretaries of Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Telangana, and West Bengal also participated in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/67-health-workers-59-other-frontline-workers-given-covid-19-vaccine-in-in-jk-101614517011534.html

28-02-2021||India||1 cr more free LPG connections planned in next 2 yrs: Oil secretary||The free LPG connection scheme is one structural reform of the Modi government that has been internationally acclaimed for ridding indoor household pollution and improving women's health.And now, the government plans to give one crore more free LPG connections to the needy over the next two years and make it easier to access cooking gas to achieve near 100 per cent penetration of the clean fuel in the country.Oil Secretary Tarun Kapoor said plans are in the works to provide LPG connection with bare-minimum identity documents and without insisting on residence proof of the place of availing the cooking gas.Also, consumers would soon get a choice of getting a refill cylinder from three dealers in his or her neighbourhood instead of being tied to just one distributor, who may not be able to provide LPG on demand due to availability or other reasons.In an interview with PTI, Kapoor said a record-breaking 8 crore free LPG connections were provided to poor women households in just four years alongside the aggressive rollout of cooking gas, taking the number of LPG users in the country to about 29 crore.The Union Budget earlier this month announced a plan to give out one crore more free cooking gas connections under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala (PMUY) scheme."Our plan is to complete these additional one crore connections in two years," he said.While no separate allocation for this has been made in the Budget for 2021-22, the general fuel subsidy allocation should be enough to cover the expense of about ₹1,600 per connection, he said."We have done a preliminary estimate of the people who are now left out. The number comes to 1 crore," he said. "After the successful Ujjwala scheme, households without LPG are very less in India. We have around 29 crore households with LPG connections. With the one crore connections, we will be close to 100 per cent LPG penetration."He, however, hastened to add that one crore unserved population was a dynamic number and there may be more families that may need LPG connections as they move to cities or other places for employment and other reasons.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's signature Ujjwala scheme for providing a free cooking gas connection to the poor had been lauded by the WHO in 2018 and by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in the following year as one that reduced indoor household pollution by helping families switch to cleaner energy sources and improving the environment and health of women.The carbon footprint of LPG is 50 per cent lower than coal. LPG helps reduce carbon dioxide and black carbon emissions, which are the second-largest contributors to global warming.Before Ujjwala, India was the second-largest contributor to global mortality due to household and ambient air pollution."We want to connect everyone in the country to the LPG network," Kapoor said. "Besides Ujjwala, we are also easing out the procedure for getting LPG connections."While theoretically, the current rule is that everyone is eligible to get a cooking gas connection, practically it is difficult to get one due to requirements such as proof of residence of the place, where the connection is being sought."We have asked our oil companies that those kinds of complaints should be eliminated. A person who is even shifting from one city to another, even temporarily, should also be able to get an LPG connection without hassles. We want to move to a stage where with very basic documents, just some proof of identity, one can get an LPG connection," he said.As a step towards that, a unified software for all the three fuel marketing companies - Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum - is being prepared."We are getting a common information technology-based system in place. Right now, the three companies have their separate IT-based systems. We also want to popularise the mobile applications that our companies have so that no one has to keep a physical booklet," he said.Through this software, inter-company migration will become very easy, he said, adding in cities a person would have a choice of seeking an LPG refill from three distributors of the same company.The Ujjwala Yojana was launched in May 2016 with a target to give free LPG connections to 5 crore mostly rural women members of below the poverty line (BPL) households. The list was later expanded to include all SC/ST households and forest dwellers, among others.In 2018, the scheme was extended to all poor households and the target raised to 8 crore connections.Under the scheme, the government provides a subsidy of ₹1,600 to state-owned fuel retailers for every free LPG gas connection that they give to poor households. This subsidy is intended to cover the security fee for the cylinder and the fitting charges.The beneficiary has to buy her own cooking stove. To reduce the burden, the scheme allows beneficiaries to pay for the stove and the first refill in monthly instalments. However, the cost of all subsequent refills has to be borne by the beneficiary household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-cr-more-free-lpg-connections-planned-in-next-2-yrs-oil-secretary-101614499682360.html

We intercepted a car and recovered a tiger skin when we searched the car after," Hemant Kathait, in-charge, Chalthi outpost in Champawat said.The two men were identified as Basant Bhatt, a resident of Amori and Mahendra Singh of Diwuri village (both under Champawat police station).A forest official estimated that the tiger was about 7 years old. It measured around 1.7 metres in length.The accused claimed that they had found the tiger’s carcass in the forest area of Diwuri some time ago. Instead of informing forest officials they skinned the carcass to earn money and were going to sell it on Saturday when they were caught, the police said.The recovery of leopard hides is common in Kumaon but a tiger’s hide was recovered after a gap of three years in the area. Forest officials had nabbed two wildlife smugglers in December 2017 for possessing a tiger skin and 8.33 kg its bones. Both were from Lakhimpur Kheri area of Uttar Pradesh.

If farmers who provide us with food can put up such a gallant fight, we too can do it here," he said."This grand alliance of the Left and the secular forces will fight to defeat the corrupt TMC government and the BJP in the state, will fight for a better Bengal," Yechury said while addressing a joint rally at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata ahead of the assembly election in West Bengal.The CPI(M) leader alleged that the Mamata Banerjee administration is doing the same to youths what the Narendra Modi government is doing against the farmers."Many people ask me what we would do in case of a hung assembly. I tell them to direct their question to the TMC as they are in the best position to answer it."The TMC has been part of NDA (for several years) since 1998. It was part of the NDA government (at the Centre). In case of a hung assembly, I am confident that the TMC would join hands with the BJP to form the state's government," he said."All the secular forces have to fight together to defeat the TMC and the BJP in Bengal. Once we stop this communal juggernaut in Bengal, we will stop it in the country also," Yechury said.He claimed that the BJP and the TMC are using religion to divert attention from the problems being faced by the people of the country and the state.Criticising the BJP for attacking several other political parties, especially the Congress, over the issue of dynasty politics, Yechury wondered how Union Home Minister Amit Shahs son became the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)."The BJP talks about corruption and dynasty politics. A stadium is named after Narendra Modi. Amit Shah's son is an office-bearer in the cricket association," he said."In the name of the corona, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set up a fund (PM CARES Fund), and that money is being used to buy and sell leaders during elections," he said.A number of leaders from various parties, mainly the ruling TMC, have joined the saffron camp ahead of the West Bengal assembly election.The CPI(M) general secretary asserted that West Bengal is headed for a triangular fight in the coming assembly polls as the Left-Congress electoral alliance is a formidable contender against the TMC and the BJP.Elections to the West Bengal assembly will be held in eight phases. The first and last phase of polling will be held on March 27 and April 29 respectively.

I am going to work doubly hard for water conservation," said Rajput, who is a second year student of the Bachelor of Arts course.The woman, a resident of the parched Bundelkhand area in MP, decided to revive the lake after her village, located about 100 km from the district headquarters, faced water crisis in 2018.Rajput said in January 2019, she along with 200 to 250 women from the village started digging a canal from a hill located nearby to channelise rain water through it into the lake and accomplished the task in 18 months.Last year, the village received rains only twice, but the lake had enough water for the needs of residents following the efforts made by Rajput and other women, some locals said.The villagers lauded Rajput's efforts towards easing their water woes.Rajput further said she belongs to a poor family and is studying in a college close to her village."My family can't afford to send me to a big city for higher studies," she said.The woman said she is now working on routing water to the lake from the other side of the hill with a canal so that it has sufficient water stock round the year.Rajput and other women from the village are also working on a project to make prudent use of water in agricultural fields.Chhatarpur's Bada Malhera Janpad Chief Executive Officer Ajay Singh said more work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) would be carried out at the lake to ensure it has ample water stock in the summer season.In his 'Mann Ki Baat' broadcast, Modi called for a 100-day campaign to clean up all water bodies and prepare them for rain water harvesting before the monsoon season starts.In this regard, the Union Jal Shakti Ministry is also launching the 'Catch the rain' campaign and its main theme is "catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls", he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-elated-as-pm-lauds-her-for-reviving-dried-lake-in-mp-101614510789713.html

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala is strengthening day by day. Even in West Bengal, BJP can not win due to the havoc that they have created with relation to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)."He said that the elections in West Bengal will be fought between Congress-Left Front and All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) with BJP nowhere in the competition.He also alleged that the Central government is trying to close public sector banks and industries to aid the growth of the private sector."For the upcoming MLC elections in Telangana, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has announced Vani Devi, daughter of late PV Narasimha Rao as their candidate because they knew that they are going to face defeat in the elections. They are using the name and fame of PV Narasimha Rao," Narayana said."Both the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and the opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu must come together to protect the Visakha Steel Plant, the pride of Andhra people," said the CPI leader.Narayana said that the Left parties are supporting a state-wide bandh in Andhra Pradesh on March 5 to ensure that the public sector continues in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-fail-in-all-5-upcoming-state-elections-says-cpi-national-secretary-101614509433887.html

The satellite has also started communicating with the ground systems, government sources told ANI.The satellite, if required, can also help in carrying out surveillance in specific areas such as the South China Sea or the pirate-infested areas near the Gulf of Aden and the African coast, the sources said.They added that the Sindhu Netra is one of the first in the series of satellites that would help the nation in enhancing its surveillance capabilities on land in areas such as the Ladakh region with China and the border areas with Pakistan.Seeking to keep a closer eye on the activities of the Chinese military both near the Indian territory as well as in its depth areas all along the 4,000 kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian security agencies feel there is a requirement of four to six dedicated satellites which can help them keep a check on the adversary's moves.Along with the setting up of the Defence Space Agency, the government also created a defence space research organisation to look after the ability to protect space assets from being attacked by adversaries there. The space arm of the defence forces would also be bolstered significantly in near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-deploys-surveillance-satellite-will-help-to-monitor-indian-ocean-region-101614509463927.html

These are in addition to 13.28 lakh golden cards issued under ABPM-JAY", Financial Commissioner, Health and Medical Education Department, Atal Dulloo said on Sunday.About 70 percent of eligible families have been registered so far under the PM-JAY scheme, he added.Dulloo said, “ABPM-JAY Sehat scheme is one of the most ambitious schemes of the government of Jammu and Kashmir. It is heartening to see residents availing free and cashless benefits from reputed empanelled hospitals of Jammu and Kashmir.”The scheme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in J-K on December 26.The Sehat scheme in convergence with PM-JAY aims to provide universal health insurance coverage of ₹5 lakh per family on a floater basis. ABPM-JAY Sehat has the same benefits as available under PM-JAY, Dulloo said.The scheme covers all residents of Jammu and Kashmir, including employees and pensioners of the UT administration and their families, he said.The scheme covers up to three days of pre-hospitalisation and 15 days post-hospitalisation expenses, such as diagnostics and medicines, of a beneficiary patient, Dulloo said."Benefits of the scheme are portable across the country i.e. a beneficiary can visit any of the more than 24,000 empanelled public or private hospitals (including 229 hospitals empanelled within union territory of Jammu and Kashmir) under ABPM-JAY in India to avail cashless treatment," he said."A network of more than 5,000 CSCs are up and working in J-K. About 30 lakh residents of UT of J-K have already registered under the scheme. Thus, about 56 percent of the families eligible under ABPM-JAY Sehat have been registered," Dulloo said.“So far more than 450 patients have already availed benefits in empanelled hospitals from outside J-K using portability feature of ABPM-JAY scheme,” he said.The ambitious health insurance scheme is going to be the game-changer as far as healthcare services are concerned, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-admin-issues-22-lakh-abpm-jay-sehat-cards-in-2-months-101614506099589.html
28-02-2021||India||IKEA India aims for 12 per cent of retail sales in kids' products||Swedish furniture major IKEA, which has a range of over 1,000 products as part of its children's range, is looking to scale up sourcing of toys from India for its operations here, said a top company official.Besides, IKEA India is also aiming to have around 12 per cent of sales from kids' range of products in the coming years.The company, which currently sources only cotton-based soft toys from India, is also exploring to expand in some other categories such as wooden toys, said IKEA India Country Commercial Manager Kavitha Rao.IKEA, which has participated in the India Toy Fair, said it is exploring opportunities to partner with several players in the toy segment, which is a big focus area of the company.When being asked as to whether IKEA is going to increase sourcing of toys from India, Rao told PTI, "Of course, yes. That is one of the main reasons why we are part of the toys fair.""Because we could be a large buyer and of course, it is contingent on meeting standards and design thoughts… but we feel that there is a great opportunity for us to come together with some potential suppliers as part of the player as well," she added.In India, 80 per cent of the households live with children."IKEA has a fairly large range of over 1,000 products as part of its children's range, which contributes around 6-8 per cent currently, and we aim to reach 10-12 per cent in the near future," Rao said.Also read: IKEA's malls arm plans first India site on outskirts of DelhiBesides toys, the range covers beds and mattresses specifically made for children, ergonomic storage and seating solutions made for a child, among others.IKEA said the India Toy Fair would help it connect with new partners and understand the ecosystem here."That is also the reason why we are participating in the toy fair, organised by the Government of India because it gives us an opportunity to also understand what the ecosystem is," she added.Besides cotton, IKEA is sensing an opportunity to source wooden toys for its stores."If you look at our range, we do have a range of wooden-based toys. So, if we had the opportunity to source some of that from India, we would definitely like to explore it," said Rao.However, she also added that IKEA with forestry-certified wood, as it always sources from sustainable sources.Recently, the government has created eight toy clusters with some significant investments in that space."We feel that it is a great approach because it will also give us the opportunity to look at possibilities for sourcing toys locally, from within India as well," she said adding that "this is a huge initiative and a big focus area for us".IKEA is working on new categories like furniture, mattress and sofas, besides building the textiles category which India is traditionally strong.Under the FDI policy for single-brand retailers, a local sourcing requirement of 30 per cent of the value of goods is mandated. This can be met as an average during the first five years, and thereafter annually towards its Indian operations.However, in August 2019, the government amended the provision by adding that all procurements made from India by a single-brand retailer for that brand shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported.IKEA has been sourcing from India for its global operations for close to 35 years. It is working with around 60 suppliers. IKEA India had opened its second retail store in Mumbai last December and is working on its next store in Bengaluru.Part of Ingka Group, IKEA India had opened its first retail store in Hyderabad in August 2018, followed by online stores in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Pune.On Saturday, while inaugurating the first India Toy Fair 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the toy manufacturers to use less plastic and more eco-friendly material, in addition to focus on innovation.He regretted that India's share in the USD 100-billion global toy market is very less, and about 85 per cent of the toys sold in the country are imported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ikea-india-aims-for-12-per-cent-of-global-retail-sales-in-kids-products-101614500449779.html
28-02-2021||India||Arrival of 'sticky bombs' in Kashmir sets off alarm bells||Security forces battling a decades-long insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir are alarmed by the recent arrival in the disputed region of small, magnetic bombs that have wreaked havoc in Afghanistan."Sticky bombs", which can be attached to vehicles and detonated remotely, have been seized during raids in recent months in the federally administered region of Jammu and Kashmir, three senior security officials told Reuters."These are small IEDs and quite powerful," said Kashmir Valley police chief Vijay Kumar, referring to improvised explosive devices. "It will certainly impact the present security scenario as volume and frequency of vehicular movements of police and security forces are high in Kashmir Valley."The Indian government flooded Kashmir, already one of the world's most militarised regions, with more troops in August 2019, when it split the country's only Muslim-majority state into two federally administered territories.The arrival of the sticky bombs in India-controlled Kashmir - including 15 seized in a February raid - raises concerns that an unnerving tactic attributed to the Taliban insurgents in nearby Afghanistan could be spreading to the India-Pakistan conflict.Afghanistan in recent months has seen a series of sticky-bomb attacks targeting security forces, judges, government officials, civil society activists and journalists. The attacks - some as victims sat in traffic - have sown fear, while avoiding substantial civilian casualties.None of the devices seized in Kashmir was produced there, a senior security official said, suggesting they were being smuggled from Pakistan. "All of them have come via drone drops and tunnels," he said, asking not to be named.Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan, which each claim all of the Himalayan region but rule only parts of it.India accuses Pakistan of backing the insurgency in Kashmir, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1990s. Pakistan denies the charge, saying it gives only moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiri people fighting for self-determination.New Delhi has attempted to maintain a tight grip over the Kashmir Valley, where high-speed mobile internet was suspended for 18 months until earlier in February, but the insurgency has simmered on.Officials said the bombs are particularly worrying because they can be easily attached to vehicles using magnets, potentially allowing militants to carry out assassinations or target military convoys that regularly criss-cross the valley.In February 2019, a suicide bomber drove a car laden with explosives into a convoy in Kashmir's Pulwama, killing 40 soldiers - the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region - bringing India and Pakistan to the brink of another war.Police chief Kumar said that security forces were changing protocols to deal with the new threat. The measures included increasing the distance between private and military traffic, installing more cameras on vehicles and using drones to monitor convoys.A difference between militants in Kashmir and Afghanistan is that the Taliban have tremendous ability to move around in urban and rural areas, which, along with the easier availability of explosives, make the bombs a potent threat.The Taliban, which initially said it was behind some of the attacks, has since denied any involvement in the attacks."The Taliban has targets, can reach them, and kill them with impunity. The whole structure of the attack - and its endless repetition - is what makes the bomb effective," said Avinash Paliwal, a senior lecturer in international relations at SOAS University of London."In Kashmir, the space for such ability to manoeuvre with ease is limited."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrival-of-sticky-bombs-in-kashmir-sets-off-alarm-bells-101614507407763.html
28-02-2021||India||'Centre can buy farm produce at MSP', says Kejriwal; shares formula||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday addressed a 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' in Meerut in Uttar Pradesh where he lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government. He said that farmers who are protesting for their livelihood have been branded as traitors.He also said that these protesters have braved biting cold and water cannons, but are still continuing their protest because it's a do-or-die situation for them. He also termed the three farm laws as "black laws".Kejriwal then focussed his attention on the issue of Minimum Support Price (MSP), which is one of the main demands of the protesters. The farmers want the system of MSP to continue, but the AAP chief claimed Centre doesn't want to buy crops at MSP.He then shared a formula how it can be done. "I heard from a central minister that buying crops at MSP us not possible because it will cost the government ₹17 lakh crore. But I have a formula using which the government won't have to spend a penny. You say ₹17 lakh crore will be spent but farmers are not asking the money for free, they will give you their crops," said Kejriwal.Further elaborating, the AAP chief said, "If the government buys the farm produce, it will sell it in the market, right? The government will sometime get ₹18 lakh crore, even ₹20 lakh crore. And at other times, it can also result in some loss and the government could earn ₹16 lakh crore," said Kejriwal."I think the government can afford a loss of ₹1-1.5 lakh crore, but keep the families of crores of farmers happy. All the losses will be recovered in 10-15 years," he added.He shared the steps taken by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi to regulate price of electricity. "I was told not to make tall promises of bringing down the rate of electricity in Delhi as the discoms are very powerful. But as you can see, our government fulfilled its promise in five years," said Kejriwal.He said that AAP was able to achieve the target because of its good intention."The Centre can waive ₹8 lakh crore of some of its friends, so why can't it implement this formula? That's because they don't have the good intention," the chief minister said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. They are also demanding a law to guarantee that.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured the farmers that the MSP system will continue. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha earlier this month, PM Modi had said the mandis in the nation would be modernised.“MSP was there. MSP is there. MSP will remain in the future. Affordable ration for the poor will continue. Mandis will be modernised," the Prime Minister had said.PM Modi also said that the central government has been making changes in the agriculture sector since 2014, aimed at improving the lives of the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-can-buy-farm-produce-at-msp-says-kejriwal-shares-formula-101614507020443.html
28-02-2021||India||'Could not see his tears': What Kejriwal said on farmer leader Rakesh Tikait||Addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Meerut, a stronghold of the Tikaits, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he reached out to Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait, one of the farmers’ leaders spearheading the protests against the three central farm laws, after he was manhandled by the police in January this year."I could not believe what I saw on television on January 28. India's famous farmer leader Baba Mahendra Singh Tikait's son who has been protesting on Delhi borders for so long for farmers was crying after the police sent by the government misbehaved with him. He has everything by god's grace but what he is doing is only for the farmers," Kejriwal said"I called Sanjay ji (Sanjay Singh) and he made me talk to Rakeshji. I told him don't worry, we are with you. I asked him what he needs. I asked him to be strong, not to worry. He said the Ghazipur site needs water and toilet infrastructure. We send our MLAs at night and ensured the needful was done. I told him don't give up, the entire country is watching you," Kejriwal said.After Republic Day violence, which Kejriwal said was orchestrated by BJP, sullied the image of the so-far peaceful protest of the farmers, protesters at Ghazipur border were asked to vacate the site by the Ghaziabad administration. As the crowd started becoming thin, Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait broke down and his emotional appeal revived the energy of the protest.Coming down heavily on the BJP, the Delhi CM said Red Fort violence was staged. He said farmers didn't know the roads of Delhi. "Those who reached Red Fort and hoisted flag were BJP workers. Our farmers can be anything but anti-nationals," Kejriwal said.Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party announced that it would contest in the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2022. His highly charged address at Meerut Kisan Mahapanchayat also came as a poll pitch, as he enumerated the welfare steps that his government has taken in Delhi.Taking on Yogi Adityanath government, Kejriwal said, "Show me one mandi where minimum support price is there. BJP ministers are claiming everywhere that MSP is there and will always be there. I want to ask the Yogi government to show me where it is implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-not-see-his-tears-what-kejriwal-said-on-farmer-leader-rakesh-tikait-101614506590283.html

28-02-2021||India||New social media rules may raise compliance cost, make competition tough for smaller companies: Industry execs||The new social media intermediary rules could raise compliance costs for players, making it difficult for smaller companies to compete against bigger giants like Facebook, according to industry watchers.The new rules, announced last week, distinguish between 'social media intermediaries' and 'significant social media intermediaries' with 50 lakh registered users as the threshold for the categorisation.Significant social media intermediaries will have to follow additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer - with all three officials residing in India.Large players like Facebook have said they are studying the rules.While many in the sector have lauded the new regulations, saying these aim to address concerns like grievance redressal, fake news and online safety of users, a section of the industry has aired concerns around increased compliance cost that could be challenging for smaller players.Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC) founder Mishi Choudhary said the rules call for an undue burden and compliance and "ensure only larger players with funds and wherewithal of big legal teams are the only ones who will be left to offer services"."(This could result in) increasing the barrier for entry and raising compliance costs for everyone," she added.India has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 44.8 crore YouTube users, 41 crore Facebook users, 21 crore use Instagram, while 1.75 crore users are on microblogging platform Twitter, as per government data.While players like Telegram and Signal do not disclose country-specific user numbers, these platforms have seen a spike in downloads in the last few weeks on the back of concerns around WhatsApp's privacy policy update that seeks to allow sharing limited user data with Facebook and its group firms.Telegram did not respond to queries on the impact of the new rules on the platform.Industry observers noted that players like Telegram and others may not have senior officials based in India and that they will now have to take a series of steps to ensure compliance with the new norms as their business scales up and user base grows in India.According to the amended IT rules, social media and streaming companies will be required to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist in investigations.The "Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code" designed to curb misuse of social media platforms require players like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter as well as streaming services such as Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime Video to appoint executives to coordinate with law enforcement, disclose the first originator of provocative content and remove, within 24 hours, content depicting nudity or morphed pictures of women.Any contentious content flagged by the government or legal order has to be taken down within 36 hours.An industry executive, who did not wish to be named, said some companies may choose to protect the privacy of users and challenge these rules in court.Also, the industry feels that there needs to be clarity on nuances like how long do users have to be active to be counted as registered users, and what happens if a platform drops below the threshold of 50 lakh registered users.Rameesh Kailasam, CEO of IndiaTech.org, had also cautioned that while these rules are robust and elaborate, it may translate into a certain degree of cost and operational challenges with it.Nasscom had noted that it is imperative that there is a balance between regulation and innovation as the world is in a phase of accelerated technology shifts.The industry body had also pointed out that there is a need for "responsible use" and building of technology for all stakeholders - government, industry, startups and citizens.The option of voluntary self-verification of user accounts, the right to receive an explanatory notification on removal or disablement of access, and to seek remedy against the action being taken by the intermediaries would be helpful for end-users, Nasscom had said.The association had also said the government has emphasised that the new rules will not curb creativity, and freedom of speech and expression of citizens as it urged the government to ensure that this is the 'design principle' followed during implementation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-social-media-rules-may-raise-compliance-cost-make-competition-tough-for-smaller-companies-industry-execs-101614503578855.html

"The Centre is behind the Red Fort violence, not the farmers. It misguided the farmers who did not know Delhi roads," Kejriwal said while addressing a 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' in Meerut.The AAP chief added that he is aware of what happened on the day the farmers took out a tractor parade, saying he is the chief minister of the Union territory. "The farmers of our country are unhappy. It has been more than 90 days that they have been protesting near Delhi along with their families. More than 250 farmers have died in these three months but the Centre has done nothing about it," Kejriwal said.Click here for full coverage of farmers' protestAmid slogans of ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan (Long Live Farmers, Long Live Soldiers)' and ‘Kala Kanoon Vapas Lo (Repeal The Black Laws)’, the AAP leader said that the protesting farmers faced atrocities which were not meted out even during the British rule. "And now, false cases are being slapped on protesters. Our farmers can be anything but not traitors. However, they have faced sedition charges. One son of the country is defending the country's borders, the other is at the border of Delhi," he said.The ' Kisan Mahapanchayat' or the farmers’ meeting comes months after the AAP's announcement that it would contest the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh in 2022. The address was initially supposed to begin at 11am but was delayed. Earlier in the day, AAP’s Rajya Sabha lawmaker Sanjay Singh posted a video on Twitter in which he is seen talking about the "three black laws", and said Kejriwal will join the cause of the farmers who are protesting against these laws.The AAP chief has been vocal in his support to the farmers. On Sunday, he said that these "black laws are like a death warrant for farmers". The party also plans to organise a 'Kisan Mahasammelan' in Punjab's Moga district on March 21.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at the borders of the national capital since November 26 last year. The three contentious farm laws are - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-addresses-kisan-mahapanchayat-in-meerut-101614502878918.html
28-02-2021||India||J&K Police carrying out IPDR analysis of phones seized from PDP leader||The Jammu and Kashmir Police is carrying out an Internet Protocol Detail Records (IPDR) analysis of arrested PDP youth president Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra, officials said, amid allegations that he was in touch with secessionists and terrorists across the border.The IPDR helps track details of a call or message generated by a phone device and includes details like the number from which the call was made, destination port, start and end date and time. This technology works with closer proximity in 2G environment.Senior police officials said the IPDR and call data records of Parra, who was arrested by Criminal Investigation (Kashmir), a subsidiary of CID of Jammu and Kashmir Police, are being scrutinised.During the hearing of Parra's bail plea on Monday, the police had informed the special NIA court in Srinagar that cell phones and other gadgets seized from his residence had been sent to forensic experts."CDR/IPDR in respect of some phones of the accused has been obtained and are being analysed. During preliminary analysis, it has emerged that (Parra) had contacts across the border suspected to be his associates and handlers in Pakistan..."During the course of investigation undertaken so far, it has surfaced that the accused (Parra) has been in constant touch with a number of militants," the court was informed.The IDPR, according to a research paper by IIT professor Ranjan Bose, Computer Science student at the University of Maryland Adya V Joshi, who did internship with Delhi Police in 2017-18, and senior IPS officer Madan Oberoi, currently executive director with Interpol, correlates the mobile users with other users of encrypted messaging service to make explicit the implicit call graphs in this data."When two suspects are talking to each other on WhatsApp, analysing their GPRS CDRs will reveal that both are connected to WhatsApp. The reverse is of course not true. Just because two people are connected to WhatsApp at the same time does not mean that they are talking to one another," the research paper stated."However, the more two people are on WhatsApp at the same time, the higher the probability that they are talking to one another. This means that by correlating two GPRS CDRs, we can see how often two suspects are using the same service at the same time, and potentially inferring that they are connected to each other," it said.The research paper was submitted by the trio at the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), world's leading professional organisation having over 4 lakh members from 160 countries during its 4th International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC) in 2018.Taking a cue from this technology, the police are analysing Parra's phones and have sought time from the court citing scrutiny of voluminous records made available by FSL experts, the officials said.This would serve as corroborative evidence in the case, they said.In the court, Parra's counsel had denied all charges and claimed that his client, who won the District Development Council elections last year, was being made a political scapegoat.The Criminal Investigation (Kashmir), a branch of CID mandated to probe cases under the Unlawful Activities and Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), had filed a case last year against unknown politicians and others based on "reliable and confidential sources" who said some political functionaries were misusing their power and helping militants.These politicians, as part of a criminal conspiracy, had established clandestine connections and relations with different Pakistan-supported terrorist and secessionist organisations operating in Jammu and Kashmir for a number of reasons.The conspiracy was hatched for furthering their political clout among local populace, countering the influence of rival political parties and their members, protecting their own financial and business interests and with medium-term motives of winning the trust of "the Pakistani establishment, dealing with subversion in Kashmir, including those in the United Jihad Council".These politicians have supported the terrorists and secessionists, directly and sometimes through middlemen, by the way of paying money and organising select physical attacks through terrorist elements.They also facilitated movements of terrorists and transportation of their arms and ammunition.In furtherance of the criminal conspiracy, these "unprincipled political parties functionaries" assisted and aided the terrorists and secessionists in intensifying the war against the Union of India with the main objective of ultimately making Jammu and Kashmir cede from the Union."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-police-carrying-out-ipdr-analysis-of-phones-seized-from-pdp-leader-101614501917784.html

"500 employees of the contractor company have worked hard for this. I congratulate the project directors, officers, contractor company representatives and project officials of the National Highways Authority, including those employees," the minister tweet, roughly translated from Hindi, read.राष्ट्रीय राजमार्ग प्राधिकरण (@NHAI_Official) ने हाल ही में सोलापुर-विजापुर राजमार्ग पर 4-लेनिंग कार्य के अंतर्गत 25.54 किलोमीटर के सिंगल लेन डांबरीकरण कार्य को 18 घंटे में पूरा किया है, जिसे 'लिम्का बुक ऑफ रेकॉर्ड्स' में दर्ज किया जाएगा। pic.twitter.com/tP6ACFGblPM Venkateswar Rao, the IJM India team leader for the project, said the project faced many technical and logistical challenges during the course of its construction. It was a task to cover an approximate distance of 18,701km in less than 18 hours by all the vehicles put together, he said according to media reports.Noting the feat, Gadkari also said that the Solapur-Bijapur highway will be completed by October 2021. "Currently 110 km of Solapur-Vijapur highway is in progress which will be completed by October 2021," the minister tweeted.The concept of measuring individual lanes instead of the total highway was taken into account by the government in 2018. Under this method, in order to measure the length of the highway, the length of each lane constructed is measured instead of the total overall length.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-firm-eyes-record-builds-25-54km-lane-in-less-than-18-hours-101614498788855.html

"The people of India sent back the British empire. We will too send Modi back to Nagpur, that too without any hatred, anger and violence. They can spit on us, kick and abuse but we will not do any such thing," Gandhi said.Gandhi was referring to the city in Maharashtra where the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has its headquarters. He made the comments while interacting with professors at St Xavier’s College in Tirunelveli of Tamil Nadu, where assembly elections will be held in April.Also Read | PSLV lifts off with Amazonia-1, 18 other satellites; ISRO says launch successfulAttacking the party at the Centre, Gandhi said the BJP-ruled government wants to take what belongs to people and give it to one or two big businessmen. "They take what belongs to farmers, labourers and teachers and give it to big businesses," he said.During this address, the Congress leader also talked about his party's vision to decentralise education and make it accessible to all. The Wayanad lawmaker slammed the central government for its centralised approach in the National Education Policy and using it as a weapon to communalise. He said that the government needs to provide a level playing field to all religions for free religious discourse.Gandhi said the aim of the secular alliance between the Congress and the DMK, if they come to power, is to make education universal. “We will increase access to education for the poor and women of this country,” Gandhi said while interacting with one of the professors.He also said that the government sees everything—agriculture, healthcare and education—as a financial commodity. He said ₹1.50 thousand lakh crores given by the government to five to six big businesses during the coronavirus pandemic should have been diverted to the education sector to make it accessible for all.The polls for 234 assembly seats in Tamil Nadu are to be held in a single phase on April 6 and votes will be counted on May 2. The Congress-DMK combine and the BJP-AIADMK alliance are the major groups contesting in the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-send-bjp-back-to-nagpur-rahul-gandhi-in-poll-bound-tamil-nadu-101614495630282.html

28-02-2021||India||Fuel prices may fall by April, says petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan||Union minister for petroleum, natural gas and steel Dharmendra Pradhan said that he has asked his counterparts in petroleum producing countries to increase their oil production so that Indian consumers get relief from soaring fuel prices.“In April last year, major oil-producing countries decided to cut production as there was a sharp fall in demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These countries are producing less fuel to make more profit. While less fuel is still being produced, the demand for fuel has reached the point as it was before pre-Covid situation. Therefore, petrol and diesel prices have increased in the country," Pradhan told reporters during an interaction in Varanasi on Saturday evening.“I am in touch with my counterparts of major oil-producing countries and have spoken to them. I have asked them to increase fuel production in order that prices of oil may come down in our country which buys fuel from these countries.”He said that as the largest oil buyer, India is creating pressure on oil-producing countries like Russia, Qatar and Kuwait among others to increase production. When production will increase, the cost of per barrel buying will come down and subsequently retail fuel price will also fall.Asked about a timeline by when prices of diesel, petrol and gas will come down, he said that no one can predict that. “But the prices of cooking gas, diesel and petrol may come down by March or April,” he said.Fuel prices have been on fire this month with oil companies raising petrol and diesel prices 16 times so far. The last upward revision of fuel prices was on Saturday.On Friday, Pradhan had said fuel prices are likely to drop as winter ends and attributed the rising rates to an increase in demand during the season.In Varanasi on Saturday, the minister said that all boats that along the Ganga in the city will now run on CNG for which a CNG station has been set up at Khidkiya Ghat.He also said that his ministry is working to ensure cooking gas connection in every house, in all eastern UP districts from Gorakhpur to Sonbhadra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-may-fall-by-april-says-petroleum-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-101614500206697.html
28-02-2021||India||'He was on vacation': Amit Shah jabs Rahul Gandhi for 'no fisheries ministry' remark||Union home minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Amit Shah on Sunday took a jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who had recently said if his party comes to power, he will create a ministry dedicated to fishermen of India."Some days ago, Rahul Gandhi had asked why there is no fisheries ministry. I want to know from people whether they want a leader who doesn't know that Department of Fisheries has been in existence for two years," Shah said in Karaikal while campaigning for Puducherry election.Rahul Gandhi was on 'vacation' when the NDA set it up in 2019, he added.The Union minister then highlighted the various initiatives taken by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for the welfare of the fishermen community. He said that the Centre announced ₹20,000 crore in the budget to improve the fisheries infrastructure in the country. "Puducherry will reap the maximum benefit from this scheme," Shah said.Earlier this month, Rahul Gandhi had visited Puducherry where he asked why don’t the fishermen have a ministry in Delhi. “I consider you to be the farmers of the sea. If farmers of the land can have their ministry in Delhi, then why is it that the farmers of the sea don’t have a ministry in Delhi?” Gandhi had said.At a public meeting in Puducherry, Prime Minister had expressed shock over Gandhi's statement. Many BJP leaders and Union ministers too had also taken a swipe at Gandhi.Union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying Giriraj Singh responded to Gandhi reminding him that the ministry had already been established.Responding to PM Modi's swipe, Gandhi had later tweeted, "Dear PM, Fisherfolk need an independent and dedicated ministry of fisheries, not just a department within a ministry."Dear PM,Fisherfolk need an independent and dedicated ministry of fisheries, not just a department within a ministry.

The camps were inaugurated by Union tourism minister Prahallad Singh Patel via video conferencing. Apart from Satkosia, a festival was also organised at Ramchandi beach in Konark, Bhitarkanika, Daringbadi and Hirakud.Transport commissioner Sanjeeb Panda and his IPS officer wife Santosh Bala (Home department special secretary), were in one of the three tents at the Eco-Retreat site that caught fire. Panda tweeted that the fire started at 5am and added that he and his wife were safe. Three cottages were gutted.“By the grace of God, me and Santosh escaped without any injury as fire broke out in our tent at Satkosia Eco Retreat at about 5am on 28.2.2021 due to an electrical short circuit. Three tents were burnt and there was no injury to anyone,” Panda tweeted, attaching a video clip of the fire.Fire services personnel and the police rushed to the spot and doused the flames. However, the three cottages were completely gutted by the time.While the exact cause of the blaze is yet to be ascertained, it is suspected that the fire was triggered by an electric short circuit in the power supply or in the air-conditioners installed in the cottages.Also Read: Odisha limits precautionary measures for travellers from five high-risk statesThe Odisha tourism department confirmed there was no injury or loss of life. "Safety of the tourists is paramount and all steps will be taken to prevent recurrence of such an incident in future," the department informed through a tweet.

28-02-2021||India||Bombay HC refuses to interfere in physical criteria for medical admission||The Bombay high court has refused to interfere with the eligibility requirement of intact upper limbs for admission to undergraduate medical courses, observing that it was not open for the high court to test validity of the statutory rule based on expert opinion.In administrative or quasi judicial matters, it may be open to questioning an expert opinion, but when it comes to legislative exercise, it would be practically impossible to question the wisdom of any legislation based on an expert opinion, said a bench of justice SC Gupte and justice Surendra Tavade."It is not open in such a case to examine the material before the experts and assessment of such materials made by experts to form their opinion, on the basis of which the particular law is framed," the bench added and rejected a petition filed by a medical aspirant from Pune district.The order of February 8 was uploaded on the high court’s website February 24.Anita Shinde, the petitioner, had moved HC in January this year after she was declared ineligible for admission to an undergraduate medical course as her left hand was amputated. She challenged the validity of a clause of the Medical Council of India's “Regulations on Graduate Medical Education, 1997."The clause required “both hands intact, with intact sensation, sufficient strength and range of motion" for the persons with locomotor disabilities to be eligible for undergraduate medical courses.The petitioner claimed he was wrongfully denied admission to a medical course for despite the disability, a person like her can perform all five roles that MCI wants Indian medical graduates to perform - clinician, leader and member of a healthcare team, communicator, lifelong learner and a professional.Her counsel, advocate Gaurav Bansal, relied on several extracts and national and international opinions submitted that the petitioner had the capacity and ability to undergo and successfully complete the under-graduate medical course. Bansal had added that undergraduate medical courses do not involve any surgery and hence, there was no rationale behind denying admission to a person with disability such as the petitioner.The submission, however, failed to impress the bench."Medical Council is a body of experts and there is no gainsaying that this particular stipulation is based on its expert opinion," said the court. "It is not open, for the reasons stated above, for this court to question the legislative wisdom of the Council or to question the expert opinion, on which its legislation is based," it added.The high court also rejected the argument that denial of admission to the petitioner on account of her disability amounted to discrimination, prohibited both under Section 3 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.The court, however, said sub-section (3) of Section 3 itself recognises the permissibility of an act of discrimination as proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. As regards Article 19(1)(g), the bench said the fundamental right to practice a profession, or to carry on an occupation of one's choice, is also subject to reasonable restrictions and prescribing eligibility criteria for enrolling for a degree course do come within these permissible restrictions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-interfere-in-physical-criteria-for-medical-admission-101614495251619.html

I feel - it is a regret of sorts that I could not learn the world's oldest language Tamil. Tamil literature is beautiful,” PM Modi said on his monthly radio programme.The Prime Minister said sometimes even a very small and simple question shakes the mind. “These questions are not long and are very simple, yet they make us think,” he said, adding that a listener Aparna Reddy of Hyderabad posed one such question to him a few days ago. “She said that - You have been the PM and CM for so many years. Do you ever feel that something is missing? Aparna ji's question is very simple but equally difficult,” he said.Also read | Be warriors not worriers: PM Modi tells students set to appear in examsThe Prime Minister said he pondered over Reddy’s question and told himself that one of “my shortcomings was that I could not make a lot of effort to learn Tamil.” “I could not learn Tamil.

And often you would get a communication that the desired slot has already been taken by some other group,” said a senior Congress leader.Manish Chatrath, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, also manages this prime estate at the heart of Lutyens’ Delhi for the party.The rising demand for the ‘war room’ also coincides with the shrinking real estate space for the Congress in the national capital. Till two years ago, the party’s activities were spread out in at least five places in central Delhi with separate space for research, data analysis, social media and liaison while the core poll activities took place at the 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road.Now, some of these properties are no more used by the party’s backroom boys, said two leaders involved in the poll exercises.“Before the 2019 elections, a new operations room was created in a small bungalow in Lodhi estate. The property hosted key meetings related to strategy, campaign and even data analysis. Every evening, a host of senior leaders would meet there. But now, that bungalow is not used anymore,” said a second senior leader.The activities at the 15, GRG, therefore, have increased manifold. Officially, the property belongs to a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress. But it has been refurbished as a highly-secured office for the party’s poll-related strategising. While Congress president Sonia Gandhi has never visited the place, Rahul Gandhi has frequently come here for key meetings.“No Congress leader, except the general secretaries and above, can enter the place without prior appointment. If your name is not given to the private security guards at the main gate, you will be denied entry,” said another Congress leader handling affairs of an eastern state.Must Watch: ‘PM Modi thinks Tamil Nadu is like his television’: Rahul GandhiSuch is the level of security that except a few top leaders, no one can take their cars inside despite ample parking space. A few years ago, a biometric entry and exit system was put in place for the regulars. “The social media team that works from the same property uses a separate gate altogether and their office has been walled off.While the office décor and the style of work remains the same at 15, GRG, it, however, has forever lost Ahmed Patel, one of the few senior leaders who would come almost daily to the ‘war’ room. One of the office cabins was allotted to Patel, who died due to Covid complications, before almost every poll. After many years, the Congress is going to polls without Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-war-room-abuzz-with-activity-as-battle-for-4-states-1-ut-draws-near-101614495237567.html

Congress functionaries on Twitter have launched a social media campaign over the past week demanding that the Prime Minister address the issues related to rising unemployment. Congress’ youth wing through social media also criticised the government for not addressing the issues faced by India’s youth.Gandhi has on several occasions attacked the government over the three farm laws, alleging that they are intended to benefit "handful of PM Modi’s friends". He alleged that instead of benefiting farmers, the laws will benefit the companies who invest in the agricultural sector.During a tractor rally in Kerala, Rahul Gandhi had said, “We have pop stars who are commenting on the situation of Indian farmers but the Indian government is not interested. They are not going to take back three laws unless they are forced.” He had also tweeted in support of the Bharat Bandh called by transporters’ union on February 26. “No employment, rising prices, government enjoying, eyes closed, therefore - Bharat Bandh,” Gandhi had tweeted.Congress has criticised the government over the issue of rising prices of fuel as well. Earlier on Friday, Congress said that citizens of the country have been hit by low growth and high inflation under the current regime. “What continues to be an area of concern, however, is the advance estimates for the entire financial year. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has lowered GDP growth rate for FY 2020-21 from its previous estimated minus 7.7% to now -8%,” party leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a tweet. He further added that the GST implementation and demonetisation exercise in 2016 also affected the economic growth of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-dare-rahul-s-latest-challenge-to-pm-modi-ahead-of-mann-ki-baat-101614492364665.html

The Prime Minister, on his monthly Mann Ki Baat programme, said water has been crucial for the development of humankind for centuries.“In most parts of India, rain starts in May-June. Can we start a 100-day campaign from now on to harvest rainwater, to clean the waters around us? With this thinking, a few days from now, the Jal Shakti Abhiyan - 'Catch the Rain' is also being started by the Jal Shakti ministry. The basic mantra of this campaign is - Catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls,” he said.Also read | Be warriors not worriers: PM Modi tells students set to appear in examsModi said this is the best time to think about water conservation ahead of the months of summer. “Yesterday was the festival of Magha Purnima.

28-02-2021||India||Forest clearance given to contentious Goa railway project through Western Ghats||The Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change has granted approval under the Forest Conservation Act for the diversion of nearly 140 hectares of protected Western Ghats Forest land for the contentious double tracking of the railway line between the Castlerock Railway Station along the Karnataka border with Goa and the Margao Railway station in South Goa. The state is to lose 50,000 trees for the project. In a communication to the forest secretary, the MoEF has informed that the consent is being granted based on Goa’s request subject to certain conditions.The letter of consent was issued by deputy inspector general of forests M K Shambhu after the regional empowered committee in its meeting held on January 27, 'carefully examined' the proposal and decided to grant an in-principle stage-I approval for diversion of the forest land subject to conditions including transferring of money equal to the net present value of the forest land being diverted to the CAMPA funds for raising, maintaining the compensatory afforestation for the degraded forest land.Curiously, despite the trees being felled in Goa on the windward side of the Western Ghats, the compensatory afforestation for these projects is being done in Sutagatti, Iddalahonda, Ramadurg, Kakati, Suldal and Shigeholi villages of Gokak and Karkati talukas in Belgaum District of Karnataka, which fall on the leeward side of the mountain range and are home to very different vegetation.The doubling of the railway line along the existing alignment is being staunchly opposed in Goa by some as the line will cut across the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park – these two are Goa’s oldest wildlife sanctuaries -- fearing that besides ecological damage, new construction will destabilise the vulnerable slopes of the Western Ghats mountain range and lead to landslides and other unforeseen consequences.The forest clearance is the latest in a long line of clearances that have been granted for the project. In April last year, the standing committee, National Board for Wildlife approved the project, based on the approval by the Goa State Wildlife Board.These clearances have now been challenged before the Central Empowered Committee on grounds that they have been cleared in haste and threaten the rich biodiversity of the region before the Bombay High Court at Goa. Opponents also allege that the projects are being planned solely to enhance the capacity to transport coal -- a source of severe air pollution due to its open air handling -- from Goa’s Mormugao Port to Steel units in North Karnataka.In 2010, the Ministry of Railways sanctioned the doubling of the existing 342 kilometres long Hospet-Tinai ghat-Vasco railway line in the states of Karnataka and Goa. The first phase between Hospet and Tinai ghat involved easier terrain atop the largely flat Deccan plateau and has already been completed. It’s the second phase between Tinai ghat and Vasco da Gama that involves crossing the steep slopes, raging rivers and the thick forests of the Western Ghats as well as densely populated areas of coastal Goa that’s being contested.The railways have said there is no alternative to locating the project in forest land as the alignment invariably has to pass through the protected area and that the existing single railway line is saturated. The authorities also announced mitigation measures in the form of four underpasses to allow for wildlife crossing for the railway project and elevated viaduct at 13 locations for the highway, which activists say are not nearly enough.Also Read: New climate pledges 'far short' of meeting Paris Agreement goals: UNThe railways have also claimed that it is not being done solely to transport coal but for the general ‘development’ of the region.“It has been misconstrued that the railway line double tracking is being done solely for the purpose of coal transport. Across the world, the focus is increasingly on non-conventional sources of energy. In the year 2015-16 the South Western Railway carried 12 million metric tons of coal (per year) while in the year 2019-20 we have carried 9 metric tons of coal which is a reduction of 25%,” Prashant Kumar Mishra, the additional general manager of South Western Railways which is tasked with the project, had said late last year.Despite the clearances, the project is likely to encounter further legal hurdles on account of the staunch opposition before work begins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-clearance-given-to-contentious-goa-railway-project-through-western-ghats-101614487713027.html

Equipped with the latest technology, the new terminal buildings are an integral component of the expansion programme, AAI said in an official statement.M. Suresh, Regional Executive Director of AAI in an official statement said, "Mainly this expansion will help the passengers to have hassle-free travel inside the terminal building - the airport access from the city to the terminal building. The good connectivity so that inside the passenger can enter.""Earlier, there was one entry point, now we have opened 2-3 entry points depending upon the traffic size, so that the queue for the passengers to be reduced. Similarly, for checking also we have increased or doubled the capacity of checking counters as well as check security counters we just doubled it," he added.It is not just the infrastructure, but AAI has been ensuring a seamless journey, even during the pandemic. The Covid-19, which turned things upside down for people across the world, is being methodically managed at these airports.Thorough screening, safety kits, frequent sanitization are part of the standard operating procedures being followed inside the airport premises. Airports in North-East Region have been able to successfully win the trust of the passengers."They are trying to keep the safe distance. They are giving us masks, shields to prevent the droplets," a passenger at Agartala Airport said.Rajeev Kapoor, Airport director at Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport in Agartala said, "The new terminal building will be able to handle 1,200 passengers at one time, a rise from 500 passengers we are handling currently. 1,000 in those will be domestic passengers while 200 will be international. So, our facility will be bigger than double the current size."Amid pandemic, on an average 180-190 flights are operational in the North-East region with a passenger footfall of 18,000 to 20,000 every day. With a consistent double-digit growth rate in passenger volume, the Indian aviation industry is gearing up to become the third-largest industry in the world.A surge in the number of operational flights from the North- East is its immediate plan of action.AAI believes in the homogeneous development of airports across all parts of India which is the key to the comprehensive growth of the industry and Airports in the vast region of north-eastern India could just be the beginning towards that goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airports-in-northeast-india-operating-expanding-amid-covid-19-pandemic-101614485353853.html

Alternatively, we shall construct a Bhajan Mandiram (prayer hall) or amenities complex on behalf of the TTD,” said Y V Subba Reddy, chairman TTD trust board. He added that he will write to the Ram Mandir trust for allotment of some land in Ayodhya to the TTD.A resolution to this effect was adopted at a meeting of the TTD trust board, held in Tirumala. The board has already decided to construct Lord Venkateswara temples in Mumbai and Jammu. “We shall perform bhumi pujan in both these places shortly,” he said.The trust board also adopted a resolution declaring cow as the national animal, based on the suggestion of the Hindu Dharmik Parishad. “We have decided to write to the Centre making a recommendation to that effect,” Reddy said.The board approved an annual budget of ₹2,937.82 crore for the financial year 2021-22. Reddy said this budget was smaller compared to the last year’s budget of ₹3,309.89 crore, which could not be realised due to Covid-19 pandemic.The board resolved to resume Arjitha Sevas (paid services to the deity) in Tirumala temple from April 14. It would allow physical presence of devotees for the advance booked Arjitha Sevas. “Devotees with Arjitha Seva tickets should observe all Covid guidelines and also procure Covid-19 test, not more than three days ahead of their Tirumala visit,” the TTD chairman said.The board also decided to frame certain guidelines for taking over of temples by the TTD and for providing them financial assistance under Sri Vani Trust. “We have also decided to frame uniform guidelines for leasing and construction of TTD kalyana mandapams (marriage halls) across the country.

28-02-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi accuses BJP, RSS of ‘destroying institutional balance’||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological fountainhead, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, (RSS) used money power to destroy “institutional balance”, which manifested in several ways such as “poaching” of MLAs and “infiltration” of judiciary. He also said that judges should have a cooling off period before they are re-appointed to “plum posts”, and called for subjecting electronic voting machines (EVMs) to scrutiny, among some of the measures to revive democracy, which, according to him, was “dead”. He also called for “mass action” for change while interacting with advocates in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district, where he landed on Saturday to campaign for the April 6 assembly elections in TN and Puducherry.“Over the last six years, there has been a systematic attack on elected institutions and free press that hold the nation together. Democracy doesn't die with a bang, it dies slowly. The RSS has destroyed the institutional balance,” Gandhi said.Gandhi said that the country requires a judiciary that is not penetrated by the RSS and the BJP, and agreed that there was a need to strengthen the anti-defection law. “We should absolutely have laws that don’t allow MLAs to move but first we need a functioning Parliament, we need a judiciary that is not penetrated by the RSS and BJP, a press that raises this issue,” said Gandhi.He stated that democracy was “dead” in India because of the RSS and the alleged erosion of Parliament, state assemblies, panchayats, judiciary and a free press. “It is dead because one organisation- the RSS, has combined with huge finances to penetrate and disturb and destroy our institutional balance,” said Gandhi. “There are many different manifestations of this: misuse of sedition law, killing and threatening of people, these are all symptoms""What happens when we come to power? There's full penetration of all institutions. We'll have to deal with 15 years of judges who have been placed in the judiciary because they support one political party. It's going to be a huge challenge for the country going forward,” Gandhi said.Gandhi compared the present situation to the fight against the British rule, when reliance on institutions wasn’t possible, which was a requirement for a functional democracy. He called for “mass action”, which he claimed was starting to take shape at Delhi’s borders, where farmers were protesting against the three farm legislations passed by the Centre.During his campaign in Puducherry about ten days ago, Gandhi had said that no one could hope to get justice from the judicial system without being “terrified of the consequences”. The Congress government in Puducherry collapsed last week after five party legislators resigned, two of whom joined the BJP. Gandhi said the Congress will have to win with two-thirds majority and wouldn’t be able to govern with 10-15 MLAs because they will be toppled. “Even if we put the right MLAs in place, it is not enough. The power is so strong and heavy that MLAs will not be able to sustain,” said Gandhi, suggesting alleged misuse of investigation agencies.He claimed that MLAs were bought to defect in various Congress-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Puducherry, Arunachal Pradesh, where, according to him, the “concentration of capital took the mandate away from us”. He added, “I know the amount of money that was thrown at MLAs in MP, Rajasthan. We’re talking massive amounts of money. When you have a party that is fighting elections with thousands of crores and other parties are not allowed to raise finance. The financiers who would like to support us say their business will be destroyed.”Also Read: Party is getting weak, say Congress 'letter writers'Gandhi also said that EVMs should be made accessible for scrutiny with transparency to dispel doubts over their functioning. “I think there are problems with EVMs,” he said. “As a first step, the election commission (EC) should allow political parties to study the machines.... Whenever Congress has asked to see the EVMs, do random checks on machines, we are told you can’t do”. During 2020 Bihar polls, Gandhi called EVMs ‘Modi Voting Machines’.In response to his allegations, an RSS pracharak and veteran BJP leader in Tamil Nadu, L Ganesan said, “RSS means discipline, nationalism and all other good qualities. If somebody says that RSS is influencing the judiciary or any field, people should feel happy that something good will happen. It is a compliment given by Rahul Gandhi to the judiciary. Long ago, when guruji Golwalkar was there, a similar question was asked if RSS is dominating the Jan Sangh and he replied, ‘not only Jan Sangh, we want to influence all political parties in India and all walks of life for the country’. Today, I’m telling the same thing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-accuses-bjp-rss-of-destroying-institutional-balance-101614480135231.html
28-02-2021||India||India all set for phase 2 of Covid-19 inoculation drive, jab to cost ₹250 at private hospitals||The second phase of vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) drive kick starts Monday with citizens above 60 years of age and those above 45 years of age with co-morbidities eligible for the shot. The government has also roped in private hospitals for this phase of inoculation which is likely to cover 270 million people. While the vaccine will be administered free of cost at government hospitals, the Centre has capped the price of the shot at ₹250 at private hospitals.The government has identified 20 co-morbidities for people in the 45-59 years age bracket. Those with co-morbidities need to produce a one page certificate signed by any registered medical practitioner.

28-02-2021||India||ISRO's first mission of 2021 today; will launch Brazil's Amazonia-1, 18 other satellites||The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will launch the Brazilian satellite Amazonia-1 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on Sunday. The countdown for the launch commenced on Saturday.This will be ISRO's first mission of the year 2021. It is scheduled to take place at 10.24 am today, according to ISRO.Along with Amazonia-1, 18 other co-passenger satellites will also be onboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C51). According to the last update from ISRO about today's launch, the filling of oxidizer for the second stage of the PSLV rocket has been completed.PSLV-C51/Amazonia-1 is the first dedicated commercial mission of NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), a Government of India company under the Department of Space. The NSIL is undertaking this mission under a commercial arrangement with US-based launch services and mission management provider Spaceflight Inc.The 637-kg Amazonia-1 is the optical earth observation satellite of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), the research unit of Brazil's ministry of science. This satellite would further strengthen the existing structure by providing remote sensing data to users for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon region and analysis of diversified agriculture across the Brazilian territory.The 18 co-passenger satellites are Satish Dhawan Sat (SDSAT) from Chennai-based Space Kidz India (SKI) and the UNITYSat which is a the combination of three satellites, designed and built as a joint development initiative by Jeppiaar Institute of Technology, Sriperumbudur, (JITsat), G. H. Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur (GHRCESat) and Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore (Sri Shakthi Sat). These satellites are intended for providing Radio relay services, a statement released by ISRO said.After this, the ISRO will gear up to launch its geo imaging satellite GISAT-1. The launch of GISAT-1 onboard GSLV-F10 rocket was originally planned for March five last year, but was postponed a day before the blast-off due to technical reasons.According to ISRO, GISAT-1 will facilitate near real-time observation of the Indian sub-continent, under cloud-free condition, at frequent intervals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isros-first-mission-of-2021-today-will-launch-brazil-s-amazonia1-101614476698657.html

India is one of 18 countries targeted by Taiwan's New Southbound Policy, which was introduced in 2016. India has already set up a permanent "AYUSH Information Cell" providing data about traditional Indian medicine and managing exchanges with the Chinese medicine community in Taiwan.The Ministry of Ayush and the World Health Organisation South East Regional Office (WHO SEARO) recently signed a letter of exchange (LoE) for the secondment or deputation of an Ayush expert to WHO's regional traditional medicine programme in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-funds-to-taiwan-to-boost-cooperation-on-traditional-medicine-report-101614475503085.html
28-02-2021||India||More tests for Covid-19 needed, says WHO chief scientist||Chief scientist of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Soumya Swaminathan on Saturday said there should be more Covid-19 tests as there was heterogeneity (on testing methods) among the states. "Testing is really an important issue. At the beginning, WHO found that many countries did not have diagnostics and those which had it was not enough. In fact we found out that diagnostics was lower than it should be," she said while addressing a session at 'Shaastra' organised here at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras. Stating that WHO has set a benchmark for how much diagnostics in testing was enough, she said if the positivity rate (of a disease) was five per cent or more, it means you should be testing more. "There is a lot of heterogeneity in response to testing between state to state and some states have done higher than the others," she said. "Tamil Nadu has done well in terms of testing and the Health Department had set up fever clinics in Chennai, when the cases were going up. So, the strategy needs to be decentralised," she said. Swaminathan said it was not only the Health Department that needs to cope up but also all other departments which have to play a role in providing additional food and service when people lost their jobs, when families were in distress due to the pandemic. "We now understand the disease (COVID-19) better, understand epidemiology and it is super-spreader. We know that only 15-16 people who are infected are responsible for the remaining 85 people. We need to be able to identify those situations where these kinds of super-spreaderscan happen," she said. "I think that (testing for Covid-19) will continue through 2021 as well," she remarked. Swaminathan said some low-income countries have done better than the high-income countries as community health workers in (the low-income countries) came to the rescue when Covid-19 outbreak happened by means of visiting houses, checking of new infections. "In low-income countries, the whole workforce for contact tracing, visiting houses, engaging community health workers are the ones who actually came to the rescue but whereas in the developed world, where the medical system is well advanced, public health system was neglected. Over the years that aspect collapsed," she said. She said these are the lessons to be learned whether the country was rich or poor and a country can learn from what went right and what did not go well so that the country can make those corrections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-tests-for-covid-19-needed-says-who-chief-scientist-101614474925714.html

The last three meetings will be held on March 20, 21 and 22 in Karnataka, Malik said."One event is scheduled on March 6 in Telangana, but we have not got permission for it yet due to some election in the state. If permission is granted, the meeting in Telangana will be held as per schedule," he told PTI.Thousands of farmers are camping at Delhi's border points at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur since November with a demand that the Centre should repeal the contentious farm laws enacted in September last year and frame a new one guaranteeing the minimum support price (MSP) on crops.Tikait is leading the protest at Ghazipur.The government, which has held 11 rounds of formal talks with the protesting farm unions, maintains that the laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-to-tour-5-states-in-march-to-drum-up-support-for-farmers-protest-101614473960302.html

28-02-2021||India||Onus on India after LoC ceasefire: Pakistan PM Imran Khan||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said the onus is on India to create an “enabling environment for further progress” in bilateral ties following Thursday’s surprise announcement about both countries recommitting themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC), a remark that came two days after India asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terrorist organisations.On Thursday, India and Pakistan jointly announced that they agreed to strictly observe all agreements on the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC). India told Pakistan “talks and terror” cannot go together and said it desired normal neighbourly relations.In a set of tweets marking two years of Pakistan’s action after the Indian Air Force (IAF) targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) camp at Balakot in 2019, Khan said Pakistan was ready to move forward to resolve “all outstanding issues through dialogue”. He also said India must take steps to meet the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination.“I welcome restoration of the ceasefire along the LOC. The onus of creating an enabling environment for further progress rests with India,” Khan tweeted.“India must take necessary steps to meet the long-standing demand & right of the Kashmiri people to self determination acc to UNSC resolutions,” he added.This was Khan’s first formal reaction to the decision by the armies of India and Pakistan on February 25 to strictly adhere to the truce on the LoC, following his return from an official visit to Sri Lanka this week.A statement issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Office to mark the same occasion said the country is committed to “peaceful coexistence and resolution of the long outstanding Jammu & Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people”.The statement added that Pakistan’s government and armed forces are “united against any threat or misadventure” and will act to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Khan’s tweets or the Foreign Office statement.The ceasefire, which was put in place in November 2003, has frayed due to thousands of violations in the past few years.The decision by both sides to recommit themselves to the truce was the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries.The external affairs ministry said on Thursday that the ceasefire agreement didn’t amount to a change of India’s position on key issues related to Pakistan.“India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan. We have always maintained that we are committed to addressing issues, if any, in a peaceful and bilateral manner,” ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.“On key issues, our position remains unchanged. I don’t need to reiterate it,” Srivastava added.Khan also hailed the role of Pakistan’s armed forces in the air strikes that were launched on the LoC by his country on February 27, 2019, following IAF’s bombing of the JeM facility in Balakot in retaliation for the suicide attack at Pulwama that had killed 40 Indian troopers.The air strikes triggered aerial battles between combat aircraft of the two countries and Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s IAF fighter jet was shot down in a dog fight. He was captured and briefly detained by Pakistan before Khan announced that Varthaman would be freed. “I congratulate the entire nation & salute our Armed Forces on the 2nd Anniversary of our response to India’s illegal, reckless military adventure of air strikes against Pakistan. As a proud & confident nation, we responded with determined resolve at a time & place of our choosing,” Khan tweeted.“We also demonstrated to the world Pakistan’s responsible behaviour in the face of India’s irresponsible military brinkmanship, by returning the captured Indian pilot. We have always stood for peace & remain ready to move forward to resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue,” he said in another tweet. Khan had earlier made the rolling back of the changes in Jammu and Kashmir a condition for talks with India. His tweets were silent on this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onus-on-india-after-loc-ceasefire-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-101614466996031.html
28-02-2021||India||2 held for ‘conspiracy’ to kill activist Sushil Pandit||The Delhi Police on Saturday claimed to have averted an assassination plot on human rights activist Sushil Pandit, with the arrest of two alleged contract killers from Punjab’s Faridkot, who they said were hired by a criminal facing trial in a murder case there.Pandit, a Kashmiri, is a prominent activist advocating the rights of Kashmiri Pandits. He was also very vocal about his support for the abrogation of Article 370, which had until then granted a special status to Kashmir. The police are also probing foreign links in the alleged conspiracy and said they suspected the involvement of Pakistan’s ISI (Inter Services Intelligence).When contacted, Pandit said, “For the past many years, I have speaking about and presenting facts about the situation in Kashmir. I have been very vocal about issues related to Kashmiri Pandits and Article 370, and these, I believe, were obviously not liked by people opposing them. The police should probe who all are behind the plot.”The two were arrested Friday from RK Puram with four firearms, including two pistols of a foreign make, four cartridges, and a mobile phone containing the photograph of Pandit, which was allegedly provided to them by the jailed murder accused, Prince Kumar alias Tuti. Police said Sukhvinder Singh, 25, and Lakhan, 21, were promised ₹10 lakh each for killing Pandit.Police are also probing why Tuti wanted Pandit dead.A case of criminal conspiracy, abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment of life under the Indian Penal Code sections 120B and 115 was registered at RK Puram police station.Since the police’s preliminary probe has indicated that a foreign hand may be involved in the conspiracy, the case has been transferred to the Delhi Police’s special cell for further probe.Police officers said they have reasons to believe that the conspiracy was hatched by people based in Pakistan and Dubai, having links with ISI.“We examined the cellphone recovered from the arrested contract killers and found that they were having conversations with people who are based abroad through Signal, an encrypted messaging platform. The two have identified one of their foreign handlers as Deepak alias King, who they claim is based in Dubai. The calls were made from international numbers,” said one of the officers, who did not want to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said the RK Puram police had received information that two men from Punjab had arrived in Delhi for committing a murder and were looking for a rented accommodation in south-west Delhi.The station team developed the information and caught the two suspects on Friday. .“They (Sukhvinder and Lakhan) were promised ₹10 lakh each for assassinating one Sushil Pandit, who is a human rights activist and CEO of Hive Communications India Private Limited. It also came out during interrogation that they were provided with four pistols– two countrymade and two foreign-made – along with four cartridges and a phone with Pandit’s photo,” DCP Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-held-for-conspiracy-to-kill-activist-sushil-pandit-101614465571461.html
28-02-2021||India||Subordinate legislation: Power invoked by govt to ratify rules||The new rules for social media intermediaries, over the top platforms (such as Netflix and Hotstar) and digital news media publishers have been cleared as a “subordinate legislation”. A subordinate legislation is a power invoked by the government to ratify new rules.“Subordinate legislation is the legislation made by an authority subordinate to the legislature… Most of the enactments provide for the powers for making rules, regulations, bye-laws or other statutory instruments which are exercised by the specified subordinate authorities. Such legislation is to be made within the framework of the powers so delegated by the legislature and is, therefore, known as delegated or subordinate legislation,” the Rajya Sabha Website sates.These rules do not necessarily have to be debated by Parliament; they only have to be placed at floor of the house. The central government has invoked section 87 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, to issue the new guidelines. The sweeping changes will impact all sectors and while increasing accountability of the platforms, they also give the ministry of information and broadcasting take down powers, which until now has only rested with the ministry of electronics and information technology.Experts say that the move is an executive overreach and the take down powers for websites have no legislative basis. According to them, the ambit of section 69(A) only extends to government agencies and intermediaries. ht||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/subordinate-legislation-power-invoked-by-govt-to-ratify-rules-101614465317034.html
28-02-2021||India||Media houses’ sites to come under ambit of Section 69(A) of IT Act||Websites of traditional media houses, which so far have not come under the ambit of section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, will now do so and also follow the new rules put in place for digital media by the government, an official familiar with the matter said on Saturday.The websites will have to separately furnish the details of their operations, including the email address of a contact person, to the information and broadcasting ministry. Officials from the ministries of I&B and electronics and information technology are slated to meet on Monday to discuss the issue. The government will also provide a format within which the news media entities will voluntarily furnish their details.Section 69 (A) of the IT Act allows the government to take action against posts and accounts that may pose a threat to public order or the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states.So far, traditional media houses have been governed the Press Council of India Act. They are mandated to follow a journalistic code of ethics to ensure the sanctity of the information. Digital news media, on the other hand, was not under any regulation and was only brought under the ambit of the I&B ministry last year. The Centre has repeatedly stated that the new rules will bring accountability to the sector and check the spread of fake news.“Digital news media and entertainment is growing at rate of over 30%,” the government official cited above said. “It is important that there are checks and balances. The rules will work within the framework of the judicial system. If someone believes that unfair action has been taken, it can be challenged in the court.”The emergency blocking guidelines, which so far have only been exercised by a designated officer of the central government, have rested with MeitY (the IT ministry). These have now been extended to the authorised officer of the I&B ministry, who will also head the top tier of the self-regulation system for grievance redressal for over the top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix and Hotstar and online news media organisations.The government in a clarification on Saturday said that the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 “provide an institutional framework for news publishers and OTT platforms on the digital media ecosystem.” They added that no new provision has been inserted.“Certain misgivings are being raised regarding Rule 16 under Part III of the rules, which mention that in a case of emergency nature, interim blocking directions may be issued by the Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,” the ministry said. “It is to inform that this provision is exactly the same as being exercised by the Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology since the past eleven years under the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009. Since Part III of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 would be administered by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, that is why the reference to Secretary MeITY has been replaced by Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting.”Hindustan Times on Wednesday reported that the Union government wants to treat online news media publishers at par with traditional media publishers, such as newspapers and news channels, and also bring them under the ambit of Section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act that gives takedown powers to the government, according to new guidelines.Digital media, as defined in a document that lays out the government’s framework to regulate online content, will cover digitised content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks. It includes intermediaries such as Twitter and Facebook, and publishers of news and current affairs content. It also includes so-called curators of such content.So far, online news media has remained unregulated, with the Information & Broadcasting ministry brining it under its ambit last year, but not yet formalising rules for it. Nor are intermediaries, especially social media companies that take refuge in their intermediary status when it comes to owing up responsibility for content. According to the guidelines titled Information Technology (Guidelines for intermediaries and digital media ethics code) Rules, 2021, digital news media publishers will need to follow rules that apply to print and electronic media.Newspapers and TV news channels are governed under the Press Council of India Act, 1978 and Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, 1995 respectively. According to the proposed changes, these acts will also apply to online news and current affairs portals under the Code of Ethics. They are expected to follow the norms, with the government also planning to put in place a three-tier self-regulation system to ensure compliance with the Code.An association of digital publications of news and current affairs has written to Union Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, expressing strong reservations against the guidelines.The online publications have called the new rules “unfair, the process of their formulation undemocractic and the method of their implementation an infringement upon the freedom of expression”.“From the early 1950s, with the setting up of the Press Council, the idea has been that the written medium be kept away from all executive interference in the interest of not just the publication, but of the wider public to ensure the widest possible dissemination of news and ideas,” the letter notes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-houses-sites-to-come-under-ambit-of-section-69-a-of-it-act-101614465083299.html
28-02-2021||India||IAF chief flies Mirage 2000 to mark second anniversary of Balakot operations||Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Saturday flew in a multi-aircraft formation from a premier air base in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior to mark the second anniversary of the Balakot operations — India’s unprecedented, peacetime cross-border strikes on the back of the February 2019 Pulwama terror attack, people familiar with the developments said.Bhadauria flew a Mirage 2000, the aircraft that was used for bombing Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) targets in Pakistan’s Balakot on February 26, 2019, said one of the officials cited above. “The IAF chief flew with pilots from the squadrons that were part of the operations,” he said. The five-aircraft formation consisted of Mirage 2000s and Sukhoi-30 fighters.IAF on Tuesday also released a video of a precision strike carried out by Mirage 2000s against a dummy target in Rajasthan to mark the second anniversary of the cross-border air strikes. “The strike was carried out by members of the squadron that carried out the actual operations,” the official said. The fighter jets dropped Spice 2000 bombs on the practice target.The IAF’s Mirage 2000s hit three targets in Balakot with five Israeli-origin Spice 2000 bombs with penetrator warheads that allowed them to pierce through the rooftops before exploding inside to cause maximum damage. While the actual bombing was carried out by the Mirages, Su-30s were part of the IAF’s strike package that day.The IAF chief flying the Mirage 2000 with the squadron that carried out the operations is a reaffirmation of the success of the mission at the highest level, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“When the head of the force flies solo, it shows that our commanders lead from the front. It also signifies that the IAF is proud of the professionalism and combat training status of its cutting-edge fleets,” Chopra said.“The Spice 2000 live mission by the squadron clearly sends a message that the IAF’s sword blade remains sharp, and ready to penalise a belligerent adversary,” Chopra added.Each bomb that hit the JeM targets carried around 80kg of explosives in a 900-kg steel casing, with the explosion caused by time-delay fuses sending a lethal quantity of shrapnel that instantly killed the occupants. The bombs hit their targets in a vertical attack angle, leaving holes measuring 80 to 90 cm in diameter on the rooftops of the structures, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The air strikes against the terror base were in response to the Pakistan-backed Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF men were killed on February 14, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-flies-mirage-2000-to-mark-second-anniversary-of-balakot-operations-101614459893734.html
28-02-2021||India||Party is getting weak, say Congress 'letter writers'||A meeting to felicitate former Rajya Sabha member of Parliament from Kashmir (and a former chief minister of the state) Ghulam Nabi Azad, and launch a campaign against the Bharatiya Janata Party, also ended up being a platform for some of the speakers — all Congressmen — to air their views on the state of their own party.Azad, and many of the other speakers, Kapil Sibal, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Hooda, Manish Tewari and Vivek Tankha are among the 23 signatories of an August letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking changes in how the party is run, including an election for organisational posts. The meeting was noticed in Delhi with Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi pointing out that the party would be better served if the leaders campaigned in election-going states. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Assam, and the Union Territory of Puducherry will go to the polls starting in March; the results will be announced on May 2.“This is an occasion and podium to speak truth and the truth is that Congress is getting weak and therefore we have assembled here to make it strong together,” said Rajya Sabha (RS) member of Parliament (MP) Kapil Sibal. Organised under the banner of a Shanti Sammelan’ or peace meeting by a body called the Gandhi Global Family (a reference to Mahatma Gandhi), the meeting was well-attended. Azad is a popular figure in the Union Territory.Last August, the 23 leaders wrote a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in which they called for “full-time and effective leadership”, elections to the Congress Working Committee (CWC), and a mechanism to guide the party’s revival. At the last meeting of the CWC last month, they decided to postpone internal elections which did not go down well with the letter writers. Subsequent, party appointments have seen younger leaders who want Rahul Gandhi back as the party president being given precedence in organisational appointments over some of the signatories.In his address, Sibal expressed his unhappiness that the party didn’t choose to accommodate Azad in Parliament after his retirement.“Now, what is the real role of Ghulam Nabi Azad… we need an experienced pilot to fly a plane and an engineer to fix any technical snag. Azad is experienced and an engineer too. Why am I saying this is because he knows reality of the Congress in every state and district. And, when we realised that Azad is being freed from Parliament we felt sad. We never wanted him to be freed from Parliament,” he said.“I fail to understand that why Congress is not using his experience.”Sibal said that they wanted the party to be strengthened in every state and every village because a weak Congress would mean a weak country.The Congress leader also took a swipe at PM Narendra Modi, saying: “Today, the problem India confronts is that she has a rajneta (leader) whose sole ambition is to empower his party and not the people of the country.”Azad avoided criticising the Congress and spoke of how he was impressed by the Gandhian philosophy while a student of SP College in Srinagar in 1969. He criticised the BJP government for dividing the state of Jammu and Kashmir(J&K) in two UTs in 2019“One-and-a-half years ago, we were dismembered... the state was shredded into pieces and today we are being divided in the name of religion and regions,” he said.“But we will keep fighting for statehood in Parliament and outside till we get it,” he asserted, telling the audience that while he has retired from the Rajya Sabha, he hasn’t from politics. Other Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Bhupinder Hooda, Raj Babbar and Vivek Tankha also addressed the rally.Anand Sharma said that for the first time since the 1950s, Jammu and Kashmir does not have a representative in the Rajya Sabha but it will be “corrected” soon.Speaking in Delhi at a press briefing, Singhvi responded to the meeting by saying that the leaders were “senior and highly respected, well-regarded persons of the party, and they are part of this Congress family”.“The best contribution to the Congress cause would be to get active in the various abhiyans which are going on in the various states that are going to elections. It is important to campaign in the five states and I would like to remind all of that.”In response, one of those who attended the meeting said: “None of us were put into the list of star campaigners in the last elections. So how do they expect us to campaign now?”Azad and Vivek Tankha are scheduled to address another meeting on Sunday. There are no fixed plans for future meetings yet, said the leader cited above, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/party-is-getting-weak-say-congress-letter-writers-101614453878301.html
28-02-2021||India||AG Venugopal refuses nod for contempt proceedings against ex-CJI Gogoi||Attorney general KK Venugopal has refused to give his nod for initiating contempt proceedings against former Chief Justice of India (CJI) and now Rajya Sabha MP Ranjan Gogoi for his comments on the Supreme Court at a recent event.Responding to a request in this regard by activist Saket Gokhale, the top law officer said that the former CJI’s statements were indeed “very strong” but added that they were made “for the good of the institution” and in no manner scandalised or lowered the authority of the highest judiciary.Gokhale wrote to Venugopal for his approval to the contempt proceedings against justice Gogoi in the wake of the former CJI’s statements regarding the state of the Indian judiciary during a panel discussion at an India Today event.Justice Gogoi, during the event telecast on February 12, used the term “ramshackle” for the judiciary and added that one would be ending up only “washing dirty linen in court” by filing defamation cases.According to Gokhale, these remarks by justice Gogoi “resulted in major scandalisation of the judiciary” and brought down the esteem of the institution since they came from a former CJI.The A-G, however, has found nothing contemptuous about justice Gogoi’s comments, saying these statements reflected the former CJI’s “deep frustration with the ills that undoubtedly beset the justice delivery system”.Venugopal’s reply to Gokhale added: “I had the occasion to watch the entirety of the interview. It is obvious that all that has been said was good for the institution and will not any manner scandalise the court or lower its authority in the eyes of the public.”Speaking to HT, Venugopal maintained that he had watched the entire interview of justice Gogoi and that the former CJI’s views were meant to highlight the problems the Indian judiciary was facing and what the judges had to go through“He (justice Gogoi) was trying to point out the negative factors of the judiciary to highlight the state it is in. His statements had also sought to reflect the issues the judges are facing and the frustration arising from these problems,” the A-G explained.Venugopal added: “There is no question of contempt in anything that justice Gogoi has said. I have gone through each and every statement and I find nothing remotely contemptuous. It would be improper to seek contempt action.”Under the Contempt of Courts Act and the pertinent rules, the Supreme Court can initiate criminal contempt proceedings either on its own motion or upon a petition filed by a private individual after obtaining consent of the attorney general or the solicitor general.In several rulings, the top court has held that the whole object of prescribing the procedural mode of taking cognisance was “to safeguard the valuable time of the court from being wasted by frivolous contempt petitions”.Gokhale now has the option of writing to the present CJI and other judges of the high court, requesting them to initiate contempt proceedings as a “suo motu” (on its own motion) matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-venugopal-refuses-nod-for-contempt-proceedings-against-ex-cji-gogoi-101614453372068.html
28-02-2021||India||Fuel prices record 16th hike this month||Oil companies on Saturday raised petrol prices by 24 paise per litre and diesel by 15 paise a litre, making the two fuels costlier by ₹4.87 per litre and ₹4.99 in just one month. With the 16th price hike in the current month, petrol was sold at record ₹91.17 per litre in Delhi on Saturday and diesel at ₹81.47 a litre, just 50 paise short of the all-time high. Diesel was sold at record ₹81.94 per litre on July 30, 2020 in Delhi.Domestic fuel retailers raised petrol and diesel rates on Saturday, even as international crude oil prices fell on Friday because of the strengthening dollar. Benchmark Brent crude on Friday closed at $66.13 per barrel, down by 1.12%. However, Brent crude surged by over 18% in February on supply disruptions in the US and a rapid demand recovery with the launch of Covid-19 vaccination programmes.According to the latest data released on Friday, the Indian economy has come out of contraction zone after the easing of lockdown restrictions and resumption of economic activities. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 0.4% on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter ending December 2020, after the economy suffered an annual contraction of 24.4% and 7.3% successively in the two preceding quarters because of a 68-day hard lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.“Petrol and diesel are deregulated fuels. Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international prices of petrol and diesel, and not with international crude price,” an oil ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014.State-run OMCs on June 16, 2017 implemented daily revision of petrol and diesel rates across the country. India’s fuel retail market is dominated by three state-run OMCs – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) — with almost 90% market share.Two executives working in state-run oil companies said retail prices of petrol and diesel are rising because of supply squeeze by producers’ cartel and high taxes on the two fuels by the Centre and states. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (Opec+) on April 12 last year announced an unprecedented 9.7 million barrel per day cut in oil output, a 10th of the global output, from May 1, 2020, but did not adhere to the planned restoration of the supply reduction.The other reason for high prices of petrol and diesel is central and state levies. According to IOC, while basic price of petrol is ₹31.82 per litre in Delhi, total levies on every litre of the fuel add up to ₹53.51 (central excise of ₹32.90 per litre and value-added tax of ₹20.61 a litre). Similarly, basic rate of diesel in Delhi is 33.46 per litre, but total tax on it is ₹43.48 per litre (central excise of ₹31.80 per litre and value-added tax of ₹11.68 a litre). Petrol and diesel rates vary across the country because of different value-added tax (VAT) and local levies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-record-16th-hike-this-month-101614451205528.html

28-02-2021||Today's||Making parliamentary proceedings more transparent||The first half of the Budget session of Parliament saw Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu reprimanding Members of Parliament (MPs) for using mobiles to record the proceedings. Such recordings had become a point of contention when the three controversial farm bills were passed amid bedlam in the Upper House. Each side blamed the other for the ruckus. To support their allegations, the government relied on the official Rajya Sabha TV (RSTV) feed, while the Opposition MPs produced mobile recordings. With only a limited number of journalists present in the gallery, it became even more difficult to ascertain the events.The electorate has the right to know what is happening in the Houses. But there exists no revelatory telecast of RSTV that can impartially establish what transpired in the House. Its footage available in the public domain is muted for over 12 minutes with the camera focused mostly on the Chair of the House. There’s no way of knowing what’s being said or done in Parliament. While contradictory mobile recordings exist, only the edited RSTV feed of the day will be considered authoritative. This is because RSTV has a monopoly over recording and streaming the proceedings. The same holds true for Lok Sabha TV too. This allows for our parliamentary telecast to not just be sanitised, but often, orchestrated to the advantage of those who control the Houses. The guidelines for telecasting proceedings, framed in 2010, prescribe censorship. They direct how the telecast will be moderated during “disorders”. On the one hand, they dictate that the telecast must be a true reflection of what is happening in the House, including scenes such as walkouts. On the other, they stipulate that during some disorders, including MPs entering the Well of the House, the camera shall focus only on the Chair of the House. The Chair has also been given the discretion to stop the telecast. There is no standard to determine which type of disorder should be telecast, covered up with visuals of the Speaker/Chair, or blacked out altogether. This enables both the government and the Opposition to peddle their version of the events, leaving viewers clueless. The earlier telecast guidelines, created under the aegis of former Speaker Somnath Chatterjee in 2005, in fact, allowed the airing of disruptions. Telecasting disruptions, he felt, would promote transparency and have “a sobering effect” on MPs by shaming them into behaving responsibly. However, within five years, these progressive guidelines were revised to their current, diluted form under the speakership of Meira Kumar. The reason for this change was never made public but a plausible explanation could be drawn from the Lok Sabha’s performance. The live telecast of parliamentary proceedings began in 1994. Till the 12th Lok Sabha (1998-1999), the productivity levels, in terms of there being fewer disruptions, exceeded 100%. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Lok Sabhas (1999-2014) witnessed overwhelming disruptions as they were formed by stitching together a fragile coalition. Disruptions became the most effective means for MPs to voice diverse, regional interests and get noticed, something procedural constraints would otherwise not allow. It is, therefore, possible that the telecast guidelines were revised in order to curb the ruckus. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government did get flak for this. The blackout during the 2014 Telangana Statehood Bill discussion led to vehement criticism for “subverting democracy”. What happened in the Upper House during the passage of the farm bills is a manifestation of this abusive practice put in motion by the UPA government and being exploited by the current regime. Such censorship and State monopoly on parliamentary telecast violate the democratic ideals of accountability, transparency, and keeping the electorate informed. If Parliament has to truly function as an “institution of accountability”, the General Purposes Committee, which oversees matters concerning the working of the House, must reform the telecast guidelines. It must also mull over the larger question of how accurate parliamentary records should be.Kinshu Dang is a media and policy researcher and Shreyas Narla is an independent legal researcher.
