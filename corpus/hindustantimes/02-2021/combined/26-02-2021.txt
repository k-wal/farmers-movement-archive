26-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt may restrict train travel for general public again in Mumbai||Maharashtra government is considering imposing restrictions again on the local train commuting on suburban trains in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) amid the upsurge in the cases in the region over the last two weeks. The decision is likely after a review of the cases in the next few days and the state government may either reduce the allotted time slots for the general public or completely revoke the permission allowing people working in essential services only.Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said on Friday that the state government was thinking of rescheduling the train timing in the wake of the rising cases. “We will not completely restrict the general public from commuting on the train, but will reschedule the timings,” he said.Experts and state officials are of the opinion that suburban train travel is one of the reasons behind the spike in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and neighbouring areas, in the past few days. Since the suburban train services were reopened for the general public during non-peak hours on February 1, an average of three million commuters has been travelling by the same. Crowded trains are being seen as one reason behind the spike.According to the officials from the state government, the review is expected to be taken next week. “It is true that the crowding in local trains is one of the reasons for the upsurge in the Covid-19 cases in the MMR. The number of passengers in all three lines has increased four times after the general public was allowed to travel in local trains from February 1. The state government either revoke the permission given to the general public completely or reduce the allotted time slot reduce the crowding in the locals,” the official said requesting anonymity.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his televised address last Sunday, had said that the decision over the lockdown will be taken in eight days after reviewing the situation of the Covid-19 cases spread.The state government allowed the general public to travel in non-peak hours excluding 9am to 12 pm and 4pm to 9pm from February 1. This resulted in around 3.3 million passengers travelling every day on three lines in local train services. 2 million passengers travel by Central Railway and 1.3 million passengers travel by Western Railway.Before the general public was allowed, the trains travel was restricted to the workforce from essential and emergency services and women travellers in stipulated time slot. The footfall of these passengers in local trains till February 1 was 8 million. Women commuters were allowed to travel from October 21 last year between 11am and 3pm and after 7pm.The cases in MMR rose to 1976 on February 25 from 1075 cases two weeks ago on February 10. “The crowding in the trains is one of the reasons for the rise in the cases. Passengers travelling from Thane, Kalyan-Dombivali, Vasai-Virar, Navi Mumbai may lead to the spread across the MMR,” said an official from the health department.Presently, the Central Railway operates 1685 local train services while the Western Railway operates 1300 local train services.Before lockdown was imposed in March last year owing to the coronavirus outbreak, the Central Railway operated 1,774 train services and the Western Railway operated 1,367 train services.Railway authorities have stated they have not received any proposal from the state government regarding the suspension of trains. “We have not received any proposal from the state government regarding the suspension of local trains,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway.Passenger associations have stated that they would protest along with commuters if train services are suspended. “The reason for the increase of coronavirus cases are not just local trains. There has been no direct link and if the state government decides to suspend the train services we will protest against the same on the railway tracks. Local train operations are important for the economy.” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-may-restrict-train-travel-for-general-public-again-in-mumbai-101614364020940.html
26-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body starts admissions for 10 new CBSE schools||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started pre-primary to Class 6 admissions for its 10 newly opened CBSE schools across the city from Thursday. “Admissions will be open until March 17. Similarly, the two new schools started under the CBSE and ICSE boards last year, will admit students in junior KG this year,” said an official from the state education department. Parents can apply either online on the BMC’s official portal or offline through the schools. The civic body has set up help desks at each school to help parents with the application process. In case the number of applicants exceeds the number of seats, the BMC will draw a lottery for allotting the seats. In 2020, the civic body had started a CBSE school in Poonam Nagar Jogeshwari and an ICSE school in Mahim’s Woolen Mill municipal school. To attract more students to BMC schools, it has now opened two schools in P north ward (Malad) and one each in G North (Dadar), F North (Matunga- Sion), K west (Andheri-Jogeshwari), L (Sakinaka, Chandivali), N (Ghatkopar), M East (Chembur), S (Vikhroli) and T(Mulund). The schools will begin classes for Junior KG to Class 6 in the first year and then go for gradual progression. Students will be given free education in these schools. Sainath Durge, a member of BMC’s education committee said that the schools have been getting a good response. “Many parents want good schools in English medium but cannot afford the high fees charged by private schools. The initiative would help give quality education to children from the low -income groups,” he added.In 2020-21, there were nearly 7 applications for every seat at the newly opened CBSE School at Poonam Nagar municipal school run by the BMC in Jogeshwari east. The civic body’s first ICSE affiliated school- the Woolen Mill Municipal School in Mahim, received 343 applications for 320 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-starts-admissions-for-10-new-cbse-schools-101614363780703.html

26-02-2021||Mumbai||February sees highest number of travellers in three months: Report||In the third week of February, India has witnessed 24,700 check-ins, reveals a report by RateGain, a leading provider of software as a services (SaaS) product that helps travel and hospitality companies with revenue and brand engagement. According to the report, the current week of February is seeing higher check-ins than Christmas, when India’s recovery crossed 116%. In contrast, December and January recorded 21,363 and 19,029 check-ins. The bookings surged in Goa for both February 15 and February 22 by over 20% after it had dipped in January. The cities that saw a spike due to Valentine’s day and wedding season, were Jaipur, Shimla, Mumbai, Pondicherry, Ludhiana, Chandigarh, and Delhi. However, Udaipur saw the highest amount of engagement in India on Facebook.The report states that Indians of all age groups have begun moving out of cities, filling flights to almost 100% capacity in domestic destinations as international travel which was mostly restricted to UAE. According to RateGain, India’s recovery was above 100% for all the weeks of December. “It was observed that Indians booked last-minute travel during the end of December and the first week of January. Popular destinations such as Goa, Shimla, and Jammu still figured in the top 10 destinations for the first month of 2021,” read the report.“ In the new normal, the Indian millennial travellers would play a critical role in the recovery of the region and therefore this recovery is not only encouraging for the domestic hotel industry but also for neighbouring Asian markets that rely on China and India to drive their tourism markets.” Kamesh Shukla, executive vice-president and head, Asia Pacific Middle East Africa (APMEA), RateGain said. “Inspired by travel taken by their family and friends, people continued to travel to tourist destinations such as Goa, Shimla, and Jammu two weeks after the New Year, emphasising the role that social media is now playing in the recovery of the industry,” he added.Highlighting the top social media trends, the report said hotels in the Maldives were ten times more engaged on social media in the last quarter of 2020 after it opened its corridor to India. “Indian hotels saw their highest surge in engagement during November, due to a surge experienced by hotels in Mumbai, as they received their guests during the long Diwali weekend for staycations. Hotels in Mumbai drove the most engagement on Facebook and Instagram, almost 150% higher than the average engagement received by hotels in other cities. The Bangalore industry witnessed the least engagement from Indian travellers. Goa which was the most booked destination in December and had the most check-ins in December and January, saw three times higher engagement during November on Facebook.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/february-sees-highest-number-of-travellers-in-three-months-report-101614363487083.html
26-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai university may miss NAAC grade yet again in upcoming academic year||This March will mark four years since the University of Mumbai’s (MU) National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) grade lapsed. It is unlikely that MU will receive a grade before the start of the next academic year. It has been almost six weeks since MU submitted its self-study report (SSR) to the NAAC committee, but there has been no response from the officials. “We have officially finished submitting every last document required by the grading committee and are currently waiting to hear from them about the team which will conduct a physical visit to our campus,” said a senior official from MU. Once the SSR is submitted, a peer team from the NAAC committee visits the university to verify the details submitted in the application. Thereafter, the committee takes around six months to announce the new grade for the university. This means the NAAC grade is impossible for the current academic year or the beginning of the next academic year. “We were sure of a peer team visit in mid-February, but with rising Covid-19 cases in the city as well as around the country, it looks like the physical visit will be delayed until further notice,” said the MU official. The official added that while it took time to put together the documents required for the application, by December 2019, the varsity had submitted the Institutional Information for Quality Assessment (IIQA) and the same was approved by the apex grading body. The process for SSR, however, got delayed as MU was shut for at least six months in 2020 due to the pandemic. The IIQA is a document recording the university’s compliance with the criteria and policies of the NAAC committee. SSR is a form of self-evaluation to identify strengths and rectify deficiencies. NAAC accreditation is a performance indicator for higher educational institutes and is mandatory for funds from Central agencies. The university had a ‘Grade A’ score from NAAC in 2012. However, the score expired in March 2017 after MU failed to apply for re-accreditation in time. “The fact that the university sat on the re-application process in 2017 itself was a big mistake, but not having managed to complete this process for almost four years now is unacceptable. Several students have suffered over the years and we hope the problem ends soon,” said Vaibhav Narwade, a senate member of MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-may-miss-naac-grade-yet-again-in-upcoming-academic-year-101614363360608.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi sees 256 fresh Covid cases, highest single day spike in 35 days||The Capital saw its highest single-day rise in Covid-19 infections in 35 days on Friday, adding 256 fresh cases of the infection. The city has seen the number of daily new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections inch up gradually, with over 200 cases being recorded for three days on the trot now, a spurt that comes as some states in the country — Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Chhattisgarh — have seen what appears to be the start of fresh waves of the infection.Further, Delhi’s Covid-19 test positivity rate has also increased gradually over the past few days, hitting 0.41% — the highest recorded in the Capital since January 29. Friday’s positivity rate was nearly double the 0.22% recorded in the city two weeks ago. Delhi conducted 62,768 tests, as per Friday’s bulletin, of which 41,775 used the gold standard RT-PCR method, while the rest used the rapid antigen method.The seven day average positivity rate – calculated on the basis of the number of tests and cases over the last seven days – has also increased to 0.30%, up from 0.24% last week and 0.21% the week before that. Experts regard the positivity rate as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection. To be sure, the World Health Organization recommends a rate below 5% for two weeks for an infection to be considered under control. Delhi has not touched this number in its positivity rate since December 2, when it recorded 3,944 new infections.“I hope I am wrong, but the positivity rate has almost doubled in the last two weeks. The speed at which the positivity rate has increased leads me to believe that we might again see an increase in the number of cases like it is being seen in other states like Maharashtra. Now, we need to trace the areas from where the new cases are being reported and probably look at pre-emptive containment,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), who headed Delhi government’s first expert committee on strategies to control the spread and manage Covid-19 cases. The fewest cases in a day was reported on February 16, when the city added just 94 new infections. The number of tests in the city has also gone down from its highest capacity of over 80,000 tests a day. This month on average 58,231 tests were conducted each day in the city. The proportion of the more accurate RT PCR tests has, however, increased to over 64%. Dr Sarin had also suggested that people living in regions reporting increase in cases be immunised as quickly as possible. However, Delhi has seen a decline in the number of immunisations, with just over 13,000 people getting the shot on Friday as compared to the highest of over 27,000. “The numbers have gone down because fewer people are coming in; there is a need for more motivation. Those who were motivated already took their first shot last week,” said a senior district level officer. Delhi, like much of the country, will not have immunisations on Satuday and Sunday as India transitions to CoWIN 2.0 that would allow people to self-register for vaccination. Government experts have also been stressing hard on not getting complacent, and to continue following Covid-19 appropriate behavior. “We have seen in other countries, wave after wave after wave, so we cannot afford to drop our guard just yet. There is a large percentage of population that is still susceptible so we must strictly follow Covid-19 appropriate behavior such as wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing, avoiding large gatherings as far as possible, and observing hand hygiene among other things,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, in Union health ministry’s Covid briefing earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sees-256-fresh-covid-cases-highest-single-day-spike-in-35-days-101614361740799.html

All of 11, the young girl has won accolades for her art from several countries. On Wednesday, one more feather was added to her cap as the Niti Aayog shared one of her paintings on its official Twitter handle, calling it “inspirational”.A student of class 6 at DPS Noida, Deepshikha is a keen observer and an accomplished artist, say her teachers. Kamini Bhasin, the principal of the school, said that in 2018, the student participated in the Annual International Painting Competition organised by NASA on the topic ‘Miss You My Dear’. “She is a child prodigy. It makes us proud that her painting was selected for the cover page of their 2019 calendar. She also stood first in the international category of the 22nd State Fish Art Contest, organised by Wildlife Forever, US,” she said. “Painting comes naturally to me. Apart from my mother’s help, I have never taken professional coaching,” says the 11-year-old.The elder of the two children of software engineer Debojyoti and homemaker Sarmishtha, Deepshikha’s accomplishments include two awards each from NASA, United Nations, UNESCO and Peace Pals International. Besides, she bagged the second prize in a painting competition organised by the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting. “My daughter has so far won 23 awards from the ministry of environment, two each from the ministry of power and ministry of culture. Besides, the National Human Rights Commission has also awarded her. Apart from these, she has many awards from the ministry of information and broadcasting, ministry of ayush, ministry of small, micro & medium enterprises, ministry of earth sciences, government of Gujarat, government of Odisha, the CSIR and IEEE,” her father said. For Sarmishtha – who introduced her daughter to the world of colours when she was only two – Deepshikha never gives up. “If she starts a painting, she’ll not eat or drink till she finishes it. I’ve just introduced her to fine arts like any Bengali mother does,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/niti-aayog-lauds-noida-girl-s-painting-shares-on-social-media-101614361679625.html
26-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police arrest 27-year-old for rape during his wedding event||Juhu police on Friday arrested a 27-year-old man during his wedding ceremony at Madhubani, Bihar, for allegedly raping another woman.According to the police, the accused Mohitkumar Bale Ram was absconding since August 2020 in connection with the rape case.On August 26, a 29-year-old woman had filed a rape complaint against the accused, said Shashikant Mane, a senior police inspector.Mane added that the accused and the woman had been living together in an apartment in Juhu since June. The survivor in her statement claimed that the accused who worked in a showroom befriended her and two were in a relationship for three months, during which, the accused raped her under the pretext of marriage.“As soon as the lockdown restrictions were lifted, the accused fled to his village,” said Mane. Following this, the woman approached the Juhu police and registered a case of rape against him.The police officers said that when they began tracing his phone, they noticed that the accused had been changing locations. On Wednesday, a police team traced his phone to Madhubani, following which, the police arrested him.“After we reached, we saw that a marriage function was going on. On searching the place and showing his photo around, we noticed that the accused was dressed in the groom’s outfit and it was his marriage underway,” said Mane.After some resistance from the locals, the Juhu police arrested Ram with the help of the local police and brought him to Mumbai on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-arrest-27-year-old-for-rape-during-his-wedding-event-101614361620274.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Winds keep Delhi mercury from breaking February record, temperature to dip this weekend||Strong winds came to the rescue of Delhi’s residents, keeping the city’s temperatures from soaring on Friday. India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said while the forecast for Friday showed that the mercury levels were set to peak and break the record for the highest temperature to ever be recorded in February, strong winds during the day kept the temperatures a notch short of that mark. On Friday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, considered the official marker for the city, was 33°C, seven higher than the season’s normal. But the minimum temperature touched 15.2°C, three above normal, and the highest recorded this season.IMD recordings show that apart from three days, this February has seen temperatures three to four degrees higher than the season’s normal. This has primarily been because of fewer western disturbances that have impacted the city this month, which has kept the skies clear and thereby allowed uninterrupted sunlight during the day. Met officials said that the city will witness a slight respite from the heat on Saturday. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre said strong winds will help Saturday’s mercury drop by one to two degrees. He also explained that the minimum temperature on Friday rose as a result of the high day time temperature recorded a day before. On Thursday, the maximum temperature recorded in the national capital was 33.2 degrees Celsius, the highest in February since 2006. “On Friday, the wind speed touched 25kmph for a while in the afternoon, which kept the maximum temperature lower than what was forecast. The wind speed will be on the higher side on Saturday too,” Srivastava said. He added that the temperatures will fall further from Sunday. “Wind directions are changing from Sunday and there is also a forecast of an active western disturbance passing over Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. These states are experiencing rain and snowfall and the winds coming from these states will bring cold winds, which will lead to this drop,” said Srivastava. Meanwhile, the air quality on Friday also improved marginally but stayed in the ‘poor’ zone. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 229. On Thursday, the average AQI was 298, also in the ‘poor’ zone. Union ministry of earth science’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said that an increase in wind speed and boundary layer height is forecasted for Saturday and this is likely to influence AQI positively. “The AQI is forecasted to stay well within the ‘poor’ category on February 27 and February 28. Though ventilation is favourable for better AQI, an increase in mineral dust contribution is expecting in the coming days as the winds are from dry desert regions,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/winds-keep-delhi-mercury-from-breaking-february-record-temperature-to-dip-this-weekend-101614361559629.html
26-02-2021||Noida||Noida: Traffic cops get high-speed bikes to chase violators||Noida: The traffic police department have formed a team of five mobile marshals who will be equipped with high-speed motorcycles to chase and fine traffic violators in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, (traffic) Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the traffic police personnel are mostly deployed only at certain locations which might leave room for violators to escape. “We have found that some violators try to speed up when officials signal them to stop. There have also been instances when violators mock the police personnel after escaping from the spot. In such cases, the mobile marshals will be able to chase the violators and fine them,” he said.Saha said that as of now, the traffic police have 20 high-speed motorcycles. “We have selected five marshals who will randomly visit different traffic crossings and issue fines to the violators,” he said. Officials of the team will be deployed from 8:30am to 8:30pm, with some intervals.The DCP traffic said that they had conducted a trial for this new system from February 6 to 25 during which the five traffic marshals issued 3.408 challans to violators. “At least 2,050 challans were issued for riding two-wheelers without helmets, 1,067 for wrong parking and 291 for wrong-side driving. The initiative worked well and hence we formally launched it on Friday,” Saha said.Earlier this month, the Noida traffic police had set up a Road Safety cell, which has a dedicated team of eight officials, including one traffic inspector, one sub-inspector, and two head constables to coordinate with different departments as well as civil society members. Saha said that the cell will be deployed at two traffic spots in Noida on Saturdays.Last year, the district traffic police issued a total of 4.96 lakh penalties worth a total of ₹17.9 crore, out of which ₹3.43 crore were realised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-cops-get-high-speed-bikes-to-chase-violators-101614361499549.html

The police said that according to the post-mortem report, the young farmer died due to a head injury as a result of the accident .The Delhi Police, represented by Delhi government standing counsel Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain, has also relied upon the footage collected from CCTV cameras located at the incident spot on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg -- where the young farmer died — and said that the man was driving the tractor at high speed and the vehicle overturned after hitting some barricades.It said that the footage also shows that the police personnel were running away from the speeding tractor and that none of them fired upon the vehicle or the driver.The Delhi Police has also said that CCTV footage further indicates that the protestors did not take the injured Navreet Singh to any nearby hospital and instead they attacked the ambulances that reached the site after hearing about the accident. They kept the body on the road for five hours and then spread rumours that he was killed in police firing.The UP police, in its status report, have stated that no FIR has been registered by it in connection with the death as claimed by the petitioner.“It is further submitted that the videography of the post-mortem or original X-Ray plates — which are medico-legal documents — cannot be given to the family of the deceased by the medical department,” it has said in its report.The petition, filed through advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, has sought a court-monitored SIT probe into the death of the young farmer.The high court on Friday listed the matter for further hearing on March 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-gunshot-wounds-on-man-who-died-during-r-day-delhi-up-cops-tell-hc-101614361444107.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Minor girl kidnapped from near Kalyanpuri three days ago murdered, body found in Modinagar fields||The body of a nine-year-old girl, who was kidnapped from east Delhi’s Khichripur three days ago, was found in the sugarcane fields of a village in Modinagar, near Ghaziabad, on Friday morning, the police said, adding that the autopsy has ruled out sexual assault. Four alleged kidnappers, who live in the same neighbourhood as the girl’s family, have been arrested in connection with the kidnap and murder. The arrested persons were identified by their first names -- Johnny alias Shiva, the key suspect, his cousin Naresh, Kailash and Tarun. “In the kidnapping and murder case of Kalyanpuri, four persons have been arrested and the weapon of the offence has been recovered,” said deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav.Police said the four had kidnapped the girl, who was playing outside her home, to demand a ransom from her family. Shiva lured her to a van after promising her a ride. The other suspects were already in the vehicle. They took her to a village in Modinagar and were planning to call the girl’s family to demand a ransom for her safe release. However, when they learnt that the police had leads that could end in their arrest, the men panicked and allegedly killed the girl by smashing her head with an iron rod, the police said.“They killed the girl and threw her body in the sugarcane fields. The body was recovered after the interrogation of the arrested suspects,” the officer said.As news of the girl’s murder spread through the neighbourhood, violence broke out by evening, with several people pelting stones at police personnel, alleging that the police had not taken the kidnapping complaint seriously and it was their laxity that led to her murder. A couple of police vehicles were damaged in the stone pelting. At least three persons were detained for the violence while police presence in the neighbourhood was intensified to maintain law and order.The girl’s murder also took on a political colour, as one of the wards in the area is going to municipal by-polls on Sunday. Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) legislator from Kalkaji Atishi said, “Despite having CCTV footage, the Delhi Police could not save the missing girl, even though there was heavy police presence in the area when BJP leaders came here to campaign for the municipal by-polls. People of Delhi, especially Dalits, feel unsafe because the Delhi Police is incapable of protecting their lives.”A senior Delhi Police officer, who did not want to be named, said it was a blind kidnapping case and the investigating team had been trying to gather leads from the day the case was registered.“The CCTV footage helped us get some leads about the suspects but their whereabouts were not known as they had switched off their cellphones. We searched the key suspect’s house and found the box of his newly purchased mobile phone. Through its IMEI number, we found that the phone’s last location was Modinagar. But by the time we could arrest him and the other three suspects, they had already killed the girl,” the officer said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “It is a sad incident, our sympathies are with the bereaved family and we will meet them soon. We urge political parties not to politicalise such a sad incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/minor-girl-kidnapped-from-near-kalyanpuri-three-days-ago-murdered-body-found-in-modinagar-fields-101614361439536.html

As per her routine, she boarded an auto-rickshaw to reach the Lal Kuan intersection at around 9.15 pm from where she took another auto-rickshaw.This second auto-rickshaw had three other passengers, police said quoting the survivor. “Then after one got off, the two others overpowered her,” said a police officer familiar with the case.The vehicle then allegedly moved to Masuri in Ghaziabad.“They stopped the auto-rickshaw at the Lal Kuan flyover for a brief moment during which they gagged me and people sitting behind (the men who boarded) told the driver to turn on the music system ... at the scene of crime, they raped me one by one,” the woman’s police complaint read.The alleged scene of the crime was a spot near a canal in Hapur close to Ghaziabad border. Superintendent of police [SP] (Hapur) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said he visited the scene of the crime and collected evidence.“At around 11.30 pm they took me to the main road and waited for a bus but passing buses did not stop. Thereafter, they made me board an auto-rickshaw back to Lal Kuan,” the woman’s complaint read. Police said that the driver dropped her at Masuri from where she approached the local police station.“We received a call at around 3.30am on Thursday from control room in Ghaziabad about the incident. We immediately registered an FIR under IPC section 376D (gangrape) based on her complaint. We formed three teams to trace the three unidentified men who she estimated to around 30 years of age,” said Hapur SP Jadaun. Police said they estimate the crime took place between 10 pm and 11.30 pm. The woman was taken to a hospital for medical treatment and examination, said police.“After the woman reached us, we inquired into the matter and alerted our counterparts in Hapur.

Sidhu, who was arrested by the police for alleged role in inciting people to resort to violence at the Red Fort on Republic Day, had moved court seeking to include all videos and other materials on record which allegedly proved his innocence. His plea had sought directions to the police to conduct a fair and impartial investigation in the case.On Friday, the court asked the police to look into the issues raised by the accused through his counsel Abhishek Gupta.“Police officials are directed to investigate on the points as mentioned in the application made by the complainant to unearth the truth…..“The IO (investigating officer) is duty bound to conduct proper investigation in the matter in a fair and impartial manner. He is not supposed to collect the evidence only to prove the guilt of the accused, rather he has to bring the true picture before the court,”Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gajender Singh Nagar said in his order.The court, however, added that appropriate action may be taken and appropriate sections may be added if Sidhu was trying to mislead the investigation by fabricating false evidence.During the hearing, advocate Abhishek Gupta, appearing for Sidhu, told the court that Sidhu was not an instigator of the incident at Red Fort, as alleged by the police.“There is no video of him calling the people to gather at Red Fort. He did not indulge in any kind of violence taking place at Red Fort. He was only a peaceful protestor,” Gupta claimed. He further contended that Sidhu was staying at a hotel in Murthal from where he checked out at 12 pm on February 26 and left for Delhi only after checking out.“The CCTV footage of the hotel, which was in working condition, checkout bill showing the time/payment details, as online payment was made, be obtained to ascertain this... Further, the car navigation system installed in the Ford Endeavor car used by him which is in police possession would also show the route taken by him to reach from Murthal to Red Fort along with timings and time taken in the same,” he submitted.He further said Sidhu reached the area around Red Fort only around 2 pm, which can be proven by his phone location and by that time a huge crowd has already gathered at the spot. He claimed there was CCTV footage of the Red Fort in which Sidhu can be seen helping the police by requesting the crowd to leave the rampart where they were trying to hoist the flag.Additional Public Prosecutor Rajiv Kamboj, appearing for the police, opposed Sidhu’s plea saying the accused cannot guide the police to conduct investigation in a particular manner.The court had on February 23 sent Sidhu to judicial custody in the case. Police had earlier alleged he was one of the main instigators of the violent incidents at the Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-asks-police-to-ensure-fair-probe-in-deep-sidhu-s-case-101614361380843.html

The Congress and other parties could not open their account in the municipality.Amid allegations by some AAP winners that the BJP was trying to make them defect, Kejriwal cautioned his party workers and said, “The BJP will try to poach you by pressure or by luring you. But stay united and inform the party if you receive such a call from the BJP.” Kejriwal, whose party had scored a zero in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, was visiting Gujarat for the first time in seven years. He had stayed away even during the campaigning for the local body polls, and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had managed the party’s campaign.Addressing a massive gathering in Surat on Friday, Kejriwal said, “Aapko Surat ki janta ney vipaksh ka kaam diya hai, unki (ruling BJP) naani yaad dila dena, ek bhi galat kaam mat hone dena (People of Surat have chosen you as the opposition party, don’t allow any corruption in the civic body).” “The entire Gujarat should know that we have arrived and won’t brook any illegal activities. People of Gujarat should know that a different politics is happening in Surat,” he said.Kejriwal said the entire country was discussing the AAP’s entry into Gujarat, especially in Surat. “Logon ne kamaal kar diya (You people did a miracle),” an elated AAP chief said, as hundreds cheered him.Although his party won only 27 seats, Kejriwal’s roadshow in Surat was like a veritable victory procession. For AAP, as he himself said, opening an electoral account in Gujarat, a BJP stronghold, was in itself an achievement. Kejriwal had a word of caution for his party workers to remain grounded and not get complacent. He said, “It is common that people who get elected develop an ego. But I am pleading with you not to have an ego and continue to introspect. Always treat people who approach you for help with respect because nobody wants to get insulted.”He asked the elected councillors to open an office in their locality and if they could not afford to do so, to open one at their residence. Kejriwal said, “Even if anyone calls you at 2am, remain available to them and try to help them,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-arrives-in-surat-to-a-hero-s-welcome-you-people-did-a-miracle-he-tells-residents-101614361379652.html

Both teachers and students of DU have objected to move and said they will not allow attempts to alter the present status of Venkateswara college.According to an official from the Andhra Pradesh(AP) chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s office, the CM had written a letter to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on February 12. Reddy’s letter said, “The Sri Venkateswara College in Delhi is managed by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which also manages the famous Lord Venkateshwara temple on Tirumala Hills. The TTD manages the college through a governing council, headed by the chairman of the TTD Trust Board, which nominates 10 of the 15 members of the council. It plays an active role in the management and growth of the college.”The Andhra chief minister has proposed that his government will amend the AP Universities Act, 1991, to expand the power of affiliation of Andhra University so that Sri Venkateswara College may be affiliated with it. This would facilitate greater access to higher education in Delhi for students from Andhra Pradesh, Reddy said. “There is a need for seats in that college to be made available to students from the state,” he said in the letter. Citing University Grants Commission(UGC)’s 2009 rules that barred state universities from operating colleges beyond their respective state’s jurisdiction, Reddy wrote in the letter, “I request the Central government to direct UGC under Section 20 of the UGC Act to exempt AU from clause (b) of the UGC and allow it to affiliate Sri Venkateswara College, as an off-campus in New Delhi, thus paving the way for students of AP to access quality higher education in Delhi.”Officials at the Venkateswara College said they have not received any communication either from their management or the Andhra government yet. DU spokesperson and dean of colleges Balram Pani said, “The Andhra government has not written anything to DU in this regard as yet. A state university cannot operate colleges outside their state; so there is no possibility of the merger of a DU college with AU or any other state university.”Sri Venkateswara College, which was established in 1961, comes under the south campus of the Delhi University.The staff association of Venkateswara College held a protest on the college premises against the development on Thursday, while a group of students protested on the campus on Friday. The teachers also submitted a memorandum to the college authorities saying, “Any move to affiliate to any state /another university will result in drastic changes in salary, employment tenure, and service conditions of employees that shall adversely impact the academic quality of the institution and also bring untold misery to their lives...The staff association resolves to remain firmly as a constituent college of the University of Delhi.”Students also started a campaign on Twitter with hashtags, #Venky_belongs_to_DU and #GobackAU. “It’s like taking someone’s identity. Students take admission to Sri Venkateswara College because it is affiliated with DU. If they wanted to take admission in AU or any other state university, they would have gone there,” said Naveen Kumar, a student of the college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-govt-seeks-to-affiliate-venkateswara-college-with-andhra-university-students-and-teachers-hold-protest-101614361380293.html

26-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC extends interim relief to Kangana Ranaut, her sister till March 10||The Bombay high court (HC) has continued the interim protection against coercive action for actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel, regarding a first information report (FIR) against them for alleged hate posts on Twitter. The court was informed that the documents filed by the complainant and the police in the HC, to oppose the petition filed by Ranaut and Chandel for quashing the FIR, were different from the documents submitted before the metropolitan magistrate court at Bandra, which ordered the registration of the FIR against the sisters on sedition charges.HC has called for the documents and posted the hearing of the actor’s petition for March 22.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing Ranaut’s petition, was informed by advocate Rizwan Siddiquee that the complainant, Munawwar Ali Sayyed, had not followed the procedure for lodging complaints as stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Siddiquee submitted that Sayyed had approached the magistrate court without informing the nearest police station or the higher police authorities. It was submitted that the magistrate had not taken cognisance of the same and had ordered the registration of the FIR in haste and without application of mind. He added that the documents placed before the HC were not the same as the ones submitted to the magistrate. However, advocate Rizwan Merchant for the Sayyed, submitted that a complaint had been sent to the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) of the said zone, after which his client approached the magistrate. He, however, added that there was some problem in the printing of the date on which the complaint was addressed to the DCP. Siddiquee refuted the argument, stating that he had got the records of the case from the magistrate court under the Right to Information (RTI) Act and it did not have the complaint sent to the DCP, as stipulated under section 153(3) of the CrPC, but the same was submitted before the HC. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that the magistrate should have taken note of whether proper procedure was followed and said that as Ranaut had raised a dispute on the documents submitted before HC and the magistrate, it wanted to scrutinise the documents and hence, called for the records from the magistrate court on or before March 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-extends-interim-relief-to-kangana-ranaut-her-sister-till-march-10-101614360780283.html

Citizen groups maintain that feeding the birds is an offence and fines must be recovered. They said that pigeon dropping could pose bird flu risk. A person cannot feed birds from a flat’s balcony creating nuisance due to droppings and filth for other occupants in a residential society, the Supreme Court had directed in 2019 and refused to interfere with an order restraining a woman from feeding birds from her balcony flat in a high rise building in Mumbai. According to medical practitioner Dr Suhas Divte, pigeon dropping is a serious threat to public health. Currently, citizens especially grain merchants are feeding pigeons which sometimes behave like a predator. “Pigeon feeding must be banned, and culprits punished,” he said. The dried and disintegrated bird dropping disperse over a wide area due to wind causing allergic and other hygiene problems, said social worker Danish Khan of Mohammadwadi. Dr Prakash Wagh, assistant medical officer (veterinary), PMC said, “When bird flu cases were reported, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had sent samples of pigeons to the state government’s animal husbandry department centre in Aundh. All tests were negative. We have been getting complaints from residents on pigeon nuisance.” The official said that the civic administration has put a ban on feeding pigeons at Rasth peth chowk to check the bird menace. “Staff are posted at certain places to stop public from feeding pigeons, though as per the Solid Waste Management rule, there is provision to impose fine for feeding pigeon,” he said. Meanwhile, PMC health chief Dr Ashish Bharti said that the solid waste management department handles the complaints related to pigeon menace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pigeon-feeding-raises-health-concerns-amidst-bird-flu-cases-101614360000488.html

According to the crime branch, a gang of over 20 youths comprising grownups and juveniles barged into the saloon in Nana peth where they assaulted a youth and attempted to kill him with a chopper. The youth managed to escape from the scene even as the attackers claimed that they were in search of a person named “MK” and threatened him with dire consequences if found. The gang which was armed with choppers raised their hands in the air brandishing the sharp chopper and said that they were “bhais of Nana peth” and whoever will try to cross their way will be hacked. The gang then went in the direction of Peru gate and left the scene. In the meantime, the shopkeepers downed shutters in the area fearing the armed youths who had strayed into the area with the intention to spread terror and fear amongst the citizens, crime branch officials stated. Sunny Vinod Mahapure (19), a resident of Katraj has lodged an FIR in connection with the incident after which Rishikesh Jalinder Kamble (21), Prateek Yuvraj Shinde (18), Yash Sanjay Chavan (20), Swaraj Nilejay Wadekar (20), Vaibhav Nitin Shahpurkar (20) and Devidas Babasaheb Galphade (22). The complainant runs a saloon and tattoo shop near Hatti Ganpati where the gang arrived and enquired about “MK”.

Also, the relevant sections of the Arms act and criminal procedure code have been invoked against the accused. The crime branch has recovered four choppers from the accused. The city police are going all out to curb the rising incidents of youths taking law in their hands to spread terror in the respective localities. Vehicle vandalism is particularly being investigated by the crime branch while the recent incident of gangster Gajanan Marne’s rally has kept the city police on its toes where all efforts are being undertaken to ensure that criminals do not find it easy to scare the citizens.

While walking from Good luck chowk to Agriculture college on the right-side footpath, a major portion is occupied by vendors selling clothes and other accessories. When HT visited the spot, the daily commuters and shop owners claimed that no action from the PMC anti-encroachment department has been taken on roadside vendors in the past one month. “If you visit the spot in the evening, you will see a number of vendors seated in line selling various things. You cannot even walk on the footpath. I have not seen an anti-encroachment vehicle in the last 10 days taking action on these vendors,” said Nikhil Rana from Chat House at FC road. Madhav Jagtap from PMC who heads the anti-encroachment department was not available as he did not reply to several calls and messages. “Many private hotels are using footpaths as part of their property and allowing customers to stand and have coffee. They have also put umbrellas in front of their hotels, and no one acts, said Rohit Salve, a regular visitor. Harshad Abhyankar, director, Save Pune traffic movement said, “There should be a dedicated space for hawkers on the footpath and space for pedestrians, bicycles since hawkers are even found on road where there is no footpath.” Dattatray Ramchandra Langhe, divisional encroachment officer said, “Every three days we conduct an encroachment drive on FC and Jangli Maharaj road. These vendors keep on coming even after we conduct drives. The number of vendors have gone down in the past and we are taking strict action against them.” More things to come up The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will take one more month to complete a few more things on the FC road stretch. “At Goodluck junction where Kalakar kata has been constructed, the PMC will be adding one mural painting. Near the police ground, we are also making one play area for children and it will take one more month. The footpath work is completed,” said Dinkar Gojare, superintendent engineer of PMC’s road department. Smart footpath The smart footpath work began two years ago in May 2018. The entire stretch on which the footpath construction work was undertaken is 2.5 kilometres starting from Goodluck chowk to Agriculture college. The project includes the building of a footpath on the left flank up to five metres, a cycle track and three metres on the right flank. The cost of the project is ₹25 crore that includes parking lots on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/smart-footpath-project-on-fc-road-sees-daylight-but-pedestrians-continue-to-fight-for-space-101614359940211.html

26-02-2021||Pune||Main entrance gate at Pune railway station opened, passengers relieved||Passengers will find it easy to travel through the Pune railway station as the railway division has opened the main entrance gate through the ramp which was closed since lockdown last year. HT reported about the issue on January 31, as daily thousands of passengers were facing difficulties to enter the station premises in order to board the train. Due to the countrywide lockdown, the passenger train operations were stopped, then gradually in the unlock process train operations started and now it is increasing. As the entrance was barricaded, there was huge traffic congestion and jams seen outside the Pune railway station main chowk daily. The passengers and commuters in the area were repeatedly demanding that the main entrance gate be opened up immediately.“The entrance gate was closed from the ramp entry gate earlier, as the number of passengers was less. Now, the passenger movement has also increased and after taking a review of the increasing train operations and passenger footfall this entry gate has been opened for the public now,” said Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, around 200 trains were in operation from Pune railway station daily with more than two lakh passengers traveling. After the unlocking process, train operations resumed from May 2020, slowly the number of train operations started increasing from the Pune railway station. At present, around 100 train operations are undertaken daily with over 40,000 passengers traveling from the Pune railway station. The Pune railway administration has made an entrance for the train boarding passengers from the front side of the station, where the main entrance gate with a ramp road is located. Now as it has opened, passengers can directly go inside the station premises without congestion, earlier they had to enter the station premises from two small entry gates for vehicles. The arriving passengers left the station premises from the second exit gate which is on the other side of the station towards Raja Bahadur Mill Road. “As the main entrance gate from the ramp road is now opened for passengers, we are relieved. I missed the train once due to the traffic jam on this road stretch, as the gate was closed, and long queues of vehicles were stranded. Now, vehicles coming to drop passengers easily go from this gate straight inside the station and other vehicles go from the road,” said Niranjan Waghmare, a passenger who regularly travels to Mumbai by train for his business-related work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/main-entrance-gate-at-pune-railway-station-opened-passengers-relieved-101614359879409.html

26-02-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee questions rationale behind conducting Bengal polls in 8 phases||Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday questioned the rationale behind holding the West Bengal Assembly elections in eight phases and scheduling polls in some districts on more than one day.She also attacked the Election Commission and alleged that the poll panel scheduled the election dates keeping in mind the BJP’s demands.“The district of South 24 Parganas is a TMC stronghold, hence elections have been scheduled there on three days. Has this been done on the directions of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi? Is it that after wrapping up the elections in other states they want to play a month-long game here?” she said soon after election dates were announced.Also read: Maharashtra records over 8,000 fresh Covid-19 cases again, 1,035 cases in MumbaiLeft Front chairman Biman Bose echoed her remarks and said, “Why should it be part 1, part 2? I don't know the reason behind part 1 and part 2. I have known elections since 1958.”South 24 Parganas, which Banerjee cited as an example, is a TMC bastion with Diamond Harbour being the Lok Sabha constituency from where TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, who also happens to be the chief minister’s nephew, won the 2019 polls.“Elections in West Bengal have never been held in eight phases. The maximum was seven in 2016. In 2011 and 2006, they were held in six and five phases respectively. Earlier, large districts such as Kolkata, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Praganas were held in two phases. But this time South 24 Parganas has been broken down into three phases and most of the districts have been broken down into two phases including Nadia, Howrah and Hooghly,” said a senior poll panel official.“I welcome the ECI's decision. But why only half of some districts are going to polls on one day and the other half in another phase? It should have been continuous so that force mobilisation and election machinery could have moved together,” said Banerjee.The ECI on Friday announced that Assembly elections in West Bengal would be held in eight phases – the longest till date in the state - starting from March 27. In at least 11 districts, the polls would be held on more than one day. The election in South 24 Parganas would be held in three phases.“If elections can be held in Bihar and Assam in three phases, then why are they being held in eight phases here? Who will be benefitted? The ECI should be more rational,” she said.The BJP hit back saying that it was Banerjee who used to demand seven to eight-phased polls before the TMC came to power.“Before she came to power in 2011, Banerjee had been demanding publicly that without a seven to eight-phased poll, elections can’t be held in a free and fair manner in Bengal. But now that she is certain that her party would be defeated, she is crying foul,” said BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya.Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said that it is not a big jump as in 2016, elections were held in seven phases. Even though there were six phases, the first phase was divided into two parts resulting in seven phases.“Never in the past have elections been held like this where elections in 11 out of the 23 districts are being held in more than one phase,” said Robin Deb, senior CPIM leader.With elections approaching, frequent clashes between the TMC and the BJP have been reported over the past few months. While the BJP claimed that more than 130 party workers have been killed in the TMC’s regime, the TMC claimed that many of the BJP workers who have been found dead died by suicide and were killed in internal clashes.Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha, said, “The law and order situation in West Bengal has touched the rock bottom. We apprehended massive violence in the run-up to the polls and on the election days. We are happy that polls would be held in eight phases. People should be allowed to cast their votes freely without any fear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-questions-rationale-behind-conducting-bengal-polls-in-8-phases-101614358125082.html

He was working for the woman, a financier, for the past few years and handled collection of payments.The victim’s father, Lakhvir Singh, 52, of New Satguru Nagar, complained to the police that the woman, Reeta Rani, who is in her 50s, used to harass her son at work, due to which he wanted to quit the job.“On Wednesday, my younger son, Rajvir, visited Rani’s office, where Parkash told him that she was not allowing him to go home. Rajvir visited him again in the evening and was shocked to find Parkash lying unconscious on the floor. He informed me and we rushed him to the hospital, but he could not survive,” the complainant added.He alleged that before breathing his last, Parkash revealed that Rani, her son, Ajay Kumar, and another woman had injected something into his veins, causing him to collapse.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Meet Ram, the investigating officer in the case, said the mother-son duo’s aide had been identified as Poonam of Friends Colony, Jassiyan Road.All three have been booked under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 34 (acts done in furtherance of common intention) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at the Daba police station. The ASI said the victim’s autopsy was conducted at the Ludhiana civil hospital and viscera samples were sent to the forensic science library in Kharar for further examination as it was suspected that he died due to drug overdose.More sections could be added in the FIR once the cause of death became clear, which could take several weeks, the investigating officer added.

26-02-2021||Chandigarh||Politics behind I-T raids at Meham MLA’s houses, offices||Even as the income tax (I-T) teams were busy digging out clues about hidden wealth or financial irregularities of firebrand Meham MLA Balraj Kundu and his associates, the I-T raids have given a new momentum and direction to political activity in Haryana.Kundu, 50, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rebel and first-term independent MLA, has been a thorn in the flesh of the BJP. Whether inside Vidhan Sabha during assembly sessions or outside, Kundu, known for deep pockets, has carefully crafted his image as that of an honest politician involved in philanthropic activities.Kundu, who is into the business of roads and building construction spread in West Bengal, is one of the richest legislators of Haryana. His declared wealth as per his 2019 assembly poll affidavit is ₹141 crore.Political watchers in the region say that Thursday’s I-T raids conducted at over 30 premises of Kundu and his relatives in Rohtak, Gurugram, and Hansi (Hisar) by a team of nearly 100 officials were clearly aimed at digging out anomalies, if any, from the records I-T teams seized during the day-long search.“This material evidence generated from the I-T raids will help his opponents to retaliate and dent Kundu’s self-created clean image. Clearly, the I-T raids are aimed at taming Kundu,” a veteran political observer said.And the raids have been conducted when the MLA, a known critic of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, has been openly pumping his resources to support the current farmers’ agitation that has already pushed the BJP in Haryana on the back foot.Also, the I-T raids are set to give more fire power to the principal opposition party the Congress ahead of what is likely to be a stormy Budget session beginning on March 5 in which, Congress will move a no-confidence motion against the ruling BJP-JJP coalition government.In the 90-member House, the party position is: BJP 40, JJP 10, Congress 30, independents seven, HLP one and two seats (Ellenabad and Kalka) vacant. The BJP-JJP government, hence, is comfortably placed even if there is a floor test.After BJP retained power in the October 2019 assembly polls with the help of 10 JJP MLAs, Kundu was one of the independent MLAs who supported the government.But his animosity with former BJP minister Manish Grover, who had to bite the dust in the assembly polls, was at the root of hostilities between Kundu and CM Khattar.The Meham MLA, in the last Budget session, was pressing for an independent probe into the alleged corruption by Grover.But Khattar gave clean-chit to Grover. Since then, Kundu has been pointing accusing fingers at Khattar’s clean image for having shielded Grover.TIMING OF RAIDS BEING QUESTIONEDA lament commonly aired Thursday was about the timing of the I-T raids.According to Dadri independent MLA, Sombir Sangwan, if the raids at Kundu’s premises were in retaliation to the Meham MLA raising farmers’ voices in that case “it is a painful move.”“If the I-T department has found some irregularities in the business activities of Kundu, they can investigate,” he added.Former education minister and Jhajjar MLA Geeta Bhukkal (Congress) said the I-T raids were in line with the BJP government’s policy of browbeating rivals who raise their voice against them.“The BJP government has been doing everything to throttle the voice of public and the Opposition,” she alleged.Endorsing these views, Anant Ram, a Bhiwani-based political observer, said the public perception about the raids at Kundu’s premises is that it’s the result of “political vendetta.”“Kundu,” he said, “withdrew support to the government after the CM did not accept his demand to hold probe against Grover.”“He is a businessman. These raids, it appears, may only help Kundu politically,” Ram said.Rohtak-based political analyst Satish Tyagi linked the raids with “political vendetta”.“The raids at two dozen places cannot be a routine exercise. Sadly, it has become a norm in our country to conduct raids at Opposition leaders’ premises. These raids will only prompt Kundu to hit out at the Haryana CM,” Tyagi said even as Kundu, who was at his Gurugram house, kept mum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/politics-behind-i-t-raids-at-meham-mla-s-houses-offices-101614335882059.html
26-02-2021||Chandigarh||HP assembly session off to stormy start, 5 Cong MLAs suspended||The budget session of the Himachal Pradesh assembly got off to a stormy start in Shimla on Friday with belligerent opposition Congress legislators interrupting governor Bandaru Dattatreya’s address and surrounding him as he left the House, leading to the suspension of five MLAs for the entire session. Speaker Vipin Parmar placed leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri and four other Congress members Harshwardhan Chauhan, Satpal Singh Raizada, Sunder Singh and Vinay Kumar under suspension for the session. Trouble started soon after the governor began his address at 11am with Agnihotri interrupting to claim that Dattatreya had skipped a major portion of his speech and had chosen to stay mum on inflation, unemployment and other concerns of the state. This led to an argument between treasury and opposition benches. Parmar tried to pacify both sides but in vain. Amid the sloganeering, he adjourned the House till 1pm and announced that the governor’s speech should be considered read. Scuffle between MLAs outside Vidhan Sabha, too The acrimony continued outside the House with Congress MLAs raising slogans against the BJP government and blocking gate number one used by the Speaker. A scuffle ensued between the ruling and opposition members as they surrounded the governor’s car. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and Parmar were seen trying to ensure a safe exit for Dattatreya. Later, Agnihotri said that the governor’s address was a “bundle of lies”. “There’s nothing in it. Not a word on inflation, unemployment and issues concerning the state. It’s for the first time that the state governor could not complete his address in the House and ran away,” he said. He claimed that Asha Kumari, the lone Congress woman legislator at the spot, was manhandled by ruling party members. CM meets ministers, security staff before House called again Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur met ministers and security personnel and for the first time in the state, the House was called again after being adjourned for the day. The Speaker said that after adjournment, the House was summoned again under Rule 346. No one from the opposition was present. Besides the chief minister, state parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj along with the Speaker described the incident as shameful. The treasury benches sought strict action against the opposition members who stopped the governor from leaving after his address. “The opposition members have attacked the Constitution. This is their tradition,” said Bhardwaj. “This is a criminal act,” the chief minister said, moving a resolution under Rule 319 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Himachal Assembly, seeking the suspension of the five Congress members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-assembly-session-off-to-stormy-start-5-cong-mlas-suspended-101614332998176.html
26-02-2021||Lucknow||Tent city to come up on sandy Ganga bank in Varanasi on the lines of Konark||The ancient pilgrim city of Varanasi, that is witnessing a host of developmental activities, including the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, will have a tent city on the sprawling sandy eastern bank of the Ganges, opposite the iconic city ghats, offering serenity and tranquillity to foreign and domestic tourists, said officials.If all goes well, the tent city is likely to be ready by October 2021 and will stay for three to five months, after which it will be dismantled and then reassembled the following year. It will come up along a five-kilometre stretch of the river on the lines of the nature camps at Konark in Odisha, according to officials familiar with the matter.It is not possible to keep the tent city going in the monsoon due to the flooded banks. The duration of the tent city will more or less coincide with the tourist season. The arrival of foreign tourists begins in Varanasi in large numbers from the last week of September.Around a month ago, a team of officials visited the Konark nature camps on the instructions of Varanasi divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal to collect details, ranging from setting up the camps or tented accommodations and their management. They submitted a detailed report.Agarwal said, “Instructions have been given to the tourism department officials to prepare the DPR (detailed project report) of the tent city as soon as they can so that further steps to materialise the project can be taken.”Agarwal also held a meeting with officials of the tourism department around a week ago.A monitoring committee and a technical-cum-executive committee for setting up the tent city have been constituted by the divisional commissioner. The monitoring committee is chaired by divisional commissioner and the executive-cum-technical committee by district magistrate Kaushalraj Sharma.Sharma said, “We will hold a meeting with officials of different departments and experts to chart out a complete plan for the tent city. Experts will give their suggestions on facilities in the tented accommodation, security arrangements and duration of the tent city, (whether) it should be for three months or five months.”These suggestions will be incorporated in the DPR which is likely to be ready by the first week of April.The tent city is likely to have 500 beds and be equipped with electricity supply, water supply, a washroom and a bio-toilet each. Roughly, each tent accommodation will be 200 to 300 square feet in area. There will be three types of tents — deluxe, semi deluxe and normal, the official added.Under the guidance of the district administration, the department was planning to develop the tent city in public private partnership (PPP) mode, said regional tourism officer (Varanasi) Keertiman Srivastava.Tenders will be floated to select a firm for developing and running the tent city, said the divisional commissioner. The tender was likely to be floated in the first week of June, said a senior official.After selection, the firm, in coordination with the tourism department, will develop the tent city under the supervision of the monitoring committee. It is to be decided whether the company will pay bills for water and electricity supply and other facilities to be provided by the municipality and the rent for the land to be provided by the district administration or if it will share revenue from the project, with the potential to generate direct and indirect employment for 4,000 locals.The divisional commissioner hoped the tent city will help give a fillip to the tourism industry in Varanasi by attracting foreign tourists in large numbers and domestic tourists in sufficient numbers, enabling all of them to enjoy the scenic view of the ghats while sitting in their tents at night.Also Read: BJP chief Nadda to be in Varanasi on two-day visit beginning Feb 28Rahul Mehta of the tourist welfare association said the tent city will attract those foreign tourists who wanted to spend most of their time along the Ganga, sitting silently for hours and watching the river flow calmly.In 2020, around 10 lakh domestic tourists visited Varanasi in January, February and March. In addition, around 70,000 foreign tourists visited Varanasi before the last week of March last year. After the Unlock phase began in June, over a lakh domestic tourists visited Kashi till December, according to people familiar with the matter in the tourism department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tent-city-to-come-up-on-sandy-ganga-bank-in-varanasi-on-the-lines-of-konark-101614331582203.html

26-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court grants bail to labour activist Nodeep Kaur||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday granted bail to labour activist Nodeep Kaur who was arrested in Kundli on the Delhi-Haryana border on January 12.Kaur had been demonstrating in solidarity with farmers, who have been protesting against the Central government’s three contentious agricultural laws for three months now.However, the police have accused her of extorting industrialists for money and inciting workers during the protest. The police said that on January 12, a unit in Kundli was gheraoed and its staff was manhandled by members of Kaur’s group. A complaint was lodged against the activists for allegedly extorting the factory owner for money on the pretext of providing workers their unpaid salaries.

26-02-2021||Mumbai||Viral auto driver Desraj: Will fund my granddaughter’s education now||Even at 74, Mumbai auto driver Desraj’s will to fend for his family, after the untimely demise of his two sons, is inspirational. And his story tugged at the heartstrings of social media netizens; many of whom have donated to help him raise a whopping ₹24 lakh! “Maine kabhi nahi socha tha meri life aise change ho jayegi,” says Desraj, adding, “I’m very happy, and grateful to everyone who helped me and my family.”Desraj’s story recently went viral on social media, when shared by Humans of Bombay. He lost both his sons in a matter of a few years, which made him become the sole breadwinner of his family of seven members. To add to his woes, his financial resources drained further when his wife fell sick. When his heart-wrenching story was shared on social media, his story prompted a concerned citizen to start a crowdfunding initiative to help this auto driver. “I had come to Mumbai with my father, who worked at a hotel. I’ve seen extreme poverty; itne paise life mein nahi dekhe. I drive all day, earn only ₹10,000 a month, and am used to living in my auto,” says the auto driver, who had to sell off his house to pay for his granddaughter’s education, and move his family to his relative’s place in Himachal Pradesh. What does he plan to do with the money now? “I could only teach my daughter till standard X. I want my granddaughter, Diya to study as much as she wants. I can now provide for her. She is very happy and hopes to pursue BEd. She’ll be the first graduate in the family! I can now pay for her tuition so that she can prepare for her higher education. She will appear for her 10th boards this year, and doesn’t have to worry about anything now,” says Desraj, adding, “I know women today are facing many problems, and an uneducated woman faces even more problems. I want my granddaughter to stand on her own two feet, absolutely independent.”Hailing from Himachal Pradesh, the auto driver is now in a capacity to buy a house of his own. But, does he wish to continue living in Mumbai? “I’ve been away from my wife for years because I had to earn, and sent her money back home. Now, she wants me to go back to her. Vo keh rahi hai bohot saal alag reh liye, ab ghar ajao. But for me, Mumbai is also like home. People and even kids here call me Papaji... it warms my heart. I might stay here for a while and then head home. But I’ll continue coming to Mumbai. I’ve been here for almost three decades; can’t leave just yet,” he says.

26-02-2021||Other||Slam dunk: Playing and thriving among the giants of NBA basketball... Why height isn’t sole deciding factor for hoop dreams||Consider the following reality: In a sport where there is a one in seven chance of making it to the highest competitive level if you are a 7-foot tall American male, the player who achieved the distinction of being the first to receive a $200 million contract is a player that is generously listed at 6 feet, 3 inches tall. This begs the question – in the modern world of position-less basketball, how much does height really matter? Additionally, what skills do the players not born with the naturally genetic trait of height master in order to succeed and have long careers at the highest level of professional basketball in the NBA?In a sport where the goal is 10 feet above the ground, it would make sense and be logical that height would be the primary trait prioritised and correlating with success.While certainly true in some regards, there is no ceiling (literally) on the potential of players who are highly skilled, regardless of their size. With the popularity and rise of three-point shooting in today’s NBA, the impact that players who aren’t height outliers can still have on the game is clearly obvious through players like Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry. The superior skill level of these players is clearly on display as they have become proficient in attempting shots from further and further ranges, skewing the spacing and range of defenses designed to contain them. Defenses are so thoroughly stretched out by the shooting ability of these relatively diminutive (both players are generously listed as 6 feet, 3 inches tall) players, that it results in open space for their teammates to score easier baskets with them on the court. So, it is therefore obvious that elite 3-point shooting skill is one way in which players that are closer to six feet tall can compensate for what they lack in height when compared to their much taller counterparts. There are many players throughout history that have not possessed height who thrived in the NBA. The name Isaiah Thomas comes to mind, referring to two different players, each of whom possessed similar intangible qualities that helped them thrive in this league of giants. While lacking extreme height, the Isaiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons teamed with Joe Dumars to form one of the most feared backcourt combinations of all time, winning two championships for the Pistons during their heyday as the “Bad Boys”. The “other” Isaiah Thomas, drafted in the current era, embodied many of the similar intangible qualities of determination, focus, and toughness, shown during the long list of accomplishments he achieved during his (potentially still ongoing) NBA career. These two examples reflect the importance of intangibles in basketball success, despite any lack of extreme height. Another physical trait that can compensate for lack of height is the “length” or “armspan” of a player. In fact, as was explored in an earlier piece on the evolution of NBA talent selection, many players are drafted based on having superior length for their position rather than solely for being tall. As three-point shooting continues to space out offenses further and further, defenders with the length to shrink the court become a priority. In fact, the combination of quickness and length in a player continues to be prioritised as teams seek to gain a competitive advantage. An example of a first-ballot Hall of Fame player with below average height, but elite length and quickness is Dwyane Wade. From these examples, it is evident that height is certainly not the only factor that can influence success in basketball. It is certainly possible to compensate for a lack of height in other ways such as skilled three-point shooting and dribbling ability, along with length and the intangible qualities of toughness, mental resilience and leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slam-dunk-playing-and-thriving-among-the-giants-of-nba-basketball-why-height-isn-t-sole-deciding-factor-for-hoop-dreams-101614323156856.html
26-02-2021||Kolkata||CBI, ED raid Kolkata businessmen, others in coal smuggling scam||CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials were raiding multiple places in Kolkata and other parts of West Bengal in connection with the multi-crore coal smuggling scam on Friday morning. Multiple teams of the CBI reached Bansdroni in south Kolkata and raided a businessman’s house and office following allegations that kickbacks used to reach the businessman, who in turn used to invest the money.Simultaneously, multiple teams of the ED were also conducting raids, including at a chartered accountant’s office in central Kolkata and in Asansol-Durgapur, which is a coal belt.It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, was sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. The BJP has been alleging that the money from the sales was whitewashed through shell companies and siphoned into the funds of the ruling party. The BJP has also alleged that the main beneficiary of the scam was Abhishek Banerjee.Earlier this week, the Central Bureau Investigation questioned chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee in connection with the same case. Abhishek Banerjee’s sister-in-law Menaka Gambhir was also questioned.The two prime accused in the coal smuggling scam – Anup Majhi alias Lala and TMC youth leader Vinay Mishra are now absconding. Mishra has also been named in a cattle smuggling case, which the CBI is probing.Must Watch: ‘TMC says one thing in Delhi, does the opposite in Bengal’: Owaisi lashes outFollowing the two scams, the BJP has sharpened attacks against TMC leaders targeting Abhishek Banerjee. Abhishek, however, has brushed aside charges and said publicly that he would walk to the gallows if corruption charges were proved against him.Elections are round the corner and the BJP, which has made deep inroads in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, was now targeting to win more than 200 seats out of the 294 assembly seats in poll-bound Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-ed-raid-kolkata-businessmen-others-in-coal-smuggling-scam-101614321198135.html

It rapped the presiding officer for failing to bring forth witnesses or evidence necessary for reaching the correct conclusion.Also Read | Refurbished cell at Arthur Road jail awaits high-profile inmate like Nirav ModiThe man was convicted on the basis of circumstantial evidence and eyewitness accounts. During the trial, the police informed the special court that it had recovered a nylon rope used to kill the child from the man’s home. The police also claimed to have recovered a lungi near the child’s body that allegedly belonged to the man’s father.The police told the trial court that two witnesses had seen the child with the man. They submitted statements of labourers, who worked with the man in Karnataka, saying he was tense and silent. Sudarshan Salunke, the man’s lawyer, said the special court failed to notice missing links in the chain of circumstantial evidence. He submitted the conviction was based on assumptions and inferences and relied on uncorroborated evidence as the medical report also did not indicate that the minor was raped.The rope and lungi were also not tested and that sniffer dogs had lost the trail when they reached the man’s village.“...we do not find such evidence before us which would convince us that it was this accused and no other person who can be said to have committed the crime. The chain of circumstantial evidence is broken...” the high court said. It granted the benefit of the doubt to the man while setting aside the special court’s conviction. “...we are indeed disturbed by the manner in which the prosecution has investigated the crime, collected evidence and conducted the trial in a most insensitive manner,” the high court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-cites-lack-of-evidence-acquits-man-convicted-of-rape-murder-of-child-101614319017194.html

At the same time, the court refused to intervene in the petition filed by two farm owners challenging a February 12 order passed by the authorities directing them to cull their birds and destroy the eggs. They called the decision arbitrary by stating that their own farms were at least a kilometre away from the affected ones.Representing the farm owners, advocate SP Brahme informed the division bench of justices SV Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni that repeated tests were conducted on their farms but all of them turned out negative. “In such a scenario, the authorities could not have directed culling of the birds as the possibility of infection spread was nil,” said Brahme. He added that said poultry farms were sealed on February 4 and samples were also taken for testing on February 17 and a report was awaited. Also Read | Bird flu confirmed in Maharashtra’s Palghar, says deputy collectorReferring to the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009, Brahme drew the attention of the bench to the fact that culling of the infectious birds or animals was a last resort and it was contemplated only for infected ones and not for other birds. He added that declaring a 2.5km radius as infected area would mean losses to the petitioners.Opposing the petition, assistant government pleader PK Lakhotiya submitted that 21 poultry farms around that of the petitioners were infected with bird flu. He added that farms within a distance of 2.5 km from infected poultry farms were declared infected zone and up to 10 kms was declared as surveillance zone. Disposing of the petitions, the bench said, “The authorities certainly would benefit from advice of the experts in the particular field and the authorities would be guided by the same. The court cannot substitute its views in place of the experts’ views.” The bench added that the authorities may revisit the decision of culling birds. “After considering all the aspects of the matter, may proceed with such steps as would appear to be proper for the spread of infection. The decision would solely rest with the authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/revisit-decision-on-culling-of-birds-hc-suggests-to-maharashtra-dist-101614318477386.html

Media persons were not allowed to come close to the encounter site.Speaking to reporters after his visit, IG Kumar ruled out involvement of liquor smugglers in the incident. “It appears the shoot-out took place during the raids to catch some of the criminals wanted in cases of murder, extortion and other offences,” he said, adding that a team led by superintendent of police of Sitamarhi has been set up to probe the matter.The IG faced the ire of the local residents, who were demanding the removal of some senior policemen, including the station house officer (SHO) of Majorganj police station, for their alleged patronage to criminals and the liquor mafia in the area.Rakesh Kumar Singh, former block pramukh (elected head of a block), reportedly told the IG that the life of sub inspector Dinesh Ram could have been saved had SHO Rajdeo Prasad acted swiftly. “Prasad and another SI, Raja Khan, with their firearms in their hands, stood as mere spectators when the gun battle broke out,” Singh told the IG.Also Read: Bihar saw 8-fold growth in budget size under both RJD and NDA: Tejashwi Yadav“Nothing has been done by the SHO to stop illegal activities in the village.

26-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi: At least 80 prisoners out on ‘emergency parole’ fail to surrender||At least 80 prisoners, who were granted emergency parole last year at the beginning of the pandemic to decongest prisons, are currently on the run, officials said.Prison officials said they will write to the Delhi Police with a list of names of all prisoners who had failed to return after the end of their bail period. Several jail officers, who did not wish to be named, said that among the 80, there are many murder convicts who were supposed to surrender this month. Also Read | Centre opposes petitions for same-sex marriage“The process of surrendering began on February 6. The prisoners had to surrender at Mandoli jail and quarantine there before their transfer to their respective jails. Officials at Mandoli have reported that there at 20-30 prisoners from each sub-jail, who have not yet surrendered. We had chosen Mandoli jail as the surrender point so that even if a prisoner was Covid-19 positive, the infection could be detected early before they are allowed to mingle with other prisoners,” said a jail officer.As one of the first measures to decongest jails and ensure social distancing at the start of the pandemic, nearly 1,000 prisoners were released on “emergency parole” in April last year. The three jails in Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini collectively hold over 18,000 prisoners. Apart from the 1,000 prisoners, those who had a clean record in prison; were not arrested in terror crimes or cases registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation were also released on interim bail. With the three prisons holding more than the sanctioned strength of prisoners, a high-powered committee of judicial officers, Delhi government and prison department had stressed upon the need to decongest the prison complex. Officials at the three jails have also been on high alert since the pandemic began and several jails in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh reported a high number of Covid-19 cases. This was the first time that so many prisoners were released on parole.The prisoners were originally supposed to surrender after eight weeks, but the surrender date was extended multiple times as Covid-19 cases kept rising till November last year. Finally, the surrender process started on February 6, during which jail authorities noted that many prisoners had refused to return.One such prisoner, who had been declared absconding was convict Shamshad Khutkan alias Rahul, 31, convicted in the 2010 Dhaula Kuan gangrape case. Khutkan, who was serving life imprisonment in the infamous case, was among those released last year on parole. Khutkan was to surrender on February 20, but went on the run. A police team arrested him on February 22 (Monday) after a shoot-out in north Delhi. Police said that Khutkan refused to turn himself in and was arrested with a pistol, which he used to fire at the police team on Monday. Delhi Police on Monday said that Khutkan was involved in at least 12 robberies in the last two months.A second jail officer said that apart from the 80 who are on the run, there are many elderly prisoners who have informed the prison department that they are waiting till the Delhi high court decides on a plea about the surrender of prisoners above 65 years. A city lawyer has filed a plea requesting the high court to extend the parole for all elderly prisoners. “There are a few elderly ones, who are in touch with us. We cannot call them absconding.”Sandeep Goel, director-general of prisons, Delhi, said, “At this stage, it will not be proper to estimate the number of prisoners who have not returned. The process of surrender is still on. We will be informing the concerned police station if prisoners fail to return.”Till date, Delhi prisons have reported two deaths due to Covid-19. At least 350 prisoners and officials were infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus but have recovered. Apart from testing new prisoners before they mix with other inmates behind bars, the prison authorities are also conducting regular tests within the prison complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-80-prisoners-on-parole-fail-to-surrender-to-be-declared-fugitives-101614313257006.html

RLD national vice president Jayant Chaudhary hit out at the Central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing hundreds of farmers at the panchayat and claimed that farmers will not end protests unless the three contentious farm laws were repealed."If the government felt the farmers would retreat during summers or wheat harvesting season, it was mistaken. ...There will be no 'ghar wapsi' for farmers till the three anti-farmers laws are repealed,” Jayant said.Ravi Verma, national general secretary of Samajwadi Party and former Kheri MP and Congress leader Saif Ali Naqvi also shared the stage.Chaudhary also attacked Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh and alleged that the ruling party leaders were making a “mockery” of the farmers’ agitation with no sympathy shown to their “rightful” demands. Referring to PM Modi’s ‘andolanjeevi’ jibe on the “culture of protests”, he said, the statement indicated an insensitive approach of the government towards farmers.Jayant claimed that the agitation against the farm reform laws was the first grassroots movement of the farmers which was above any caste and creed and any attempt to divide the farmers will prove futile.Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November last year, against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They claim the laws will take away the ‘mandi’ system and the minimum support prices (MSP), guaranteed by the government for their produce, and also make them vulnerable to exploitation at the hands of the corporate. The government has, however, termed the laws as necessary reforms needed to unlock the sector’s potential for modernisation and growth while increasing farmers’ income.Also Read: Farmers union writes to President demanding end to 'repression' on protestersChaudhary said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat in 2011, he had written a letter to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, demanding a law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers. “Now, when Modi is the PM, he has no intention to fulfil his own old demand,” Jayant said.Hitting out at Yogi Adityanath, the RLD leader said, “Around three and a half years back, Yogi government formed a Kisan Samriddhi Ayog but not even a single meeting of the Ayog had taken place so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-ghar-wapsi-for-farmers-till-farm-laws-are-repealed-jayant-chaudhary-101614310516383.html

Now, it’s the Delhi government’s turn to approve it,” North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said.Delhi government and PWD spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-mcd-gives-legal-status-to-new-temple-in-chandni-chowk-101614300909300.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||North MCD proposal: An EV charging station, battery swap point every 3km||North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Thursday approved a proposal to set up e-charging and battery swapping stations for electric vehicles (EVs) at every three kilometres. This comes months after the Delhi government notified the Delhi electric vehicle policy, 2020, to reduce air pollution and to kick-start the economy by spurring demand.The Delhi government aims to register at least five lakh EVs in Delhi in the next five years for which it decided to set up EV charging stations at every 3 kms.On Wednesday, the north MCD became the first of the three civic bodies in Delhi to endorse the guideline mandated under the EV policy. Maximum number of EV charging stations will come up in areas under north MCD. Cumulatively the three corporations – North (127), East (93) and South (75) – will develop 295 public e-charging stations across the city in the next one year.The North MCD proposed the plan earlier this month during the presentation of its budget for 2021-22. It was approved by the corporation’s standing committee on Wednesday. Civic officials said that the move will not only help in reducing air pollution but also generate revenue.Three weeks ago, the Delhi government floated a tender to set up 500 EV charging points at 100 locations across the city.A senior official of the north corporation said that as per the new building bylaws, it has now become mandatory to reserve 20% of total parking space for electric vehicles in bigger building projects.The official said people are still hesitant to buy e-vehicles because of lack of charging infrastructure.“Our aim is to bridge this gap. We aim to provide at least one charging and battery swapping station — where charged battery can be replaced with an empty one — in an area of three square kilometres so that people having an electric vehicles do not face problems,” the official said.He added that the work on this project is likely to be started next year. “Initially e-charging stations will be set up in 127 municipal parking sites and slots for electric vehicles will be reserved there. If we receive good response, we will set up more such stations at other public places,” the official said.Delhi currently has 72 operational charging stations.Mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation Jai Prakash said setting up of e-charging infrastructure will take nearly a year’s time as modalities are yet to be fixed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-proposal-an-ev-charging-station-battery-swap-point-every-3km-101614300722191.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||All depts will make EV switch by Sept: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||In what deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia termed a “historic move”, the Delhi government on Thursday mandated all its departments, companies and subsidiary agencies to shift from fuel-based hired cars to electric vehicles (EVs) within a time frame of six months.With this, the Delhi government will create a hired fleet of at least 2,000 electric cars within six months, which will be used by its departments and agencies.The order, signed by special secretary (finance) Prince Dhawan, directed all government departments, autonomous bodies and grantee institutions to make a shift from their existing hired petrol/diesel/CNG vehicles to EVs through a lease/hiring model within a time frame of six months. Dry lease/wet lease model has been encouraged by the government for the same, the order stated.Sisodia said the move will make Delhi the “EV Capital” of India. “The Delhi government today (Thursday) became the first in the world, and not just India, to mandate its entire hired car fleet to switch to electric within a deadline of six months. We hope that this decision will inspire cities and governments around India and the world to tackle pollution and climate change with the seriousness and urgency that it deserves,” he said.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the move will go a long way in curbing pollution in Delhi. “Delhi is fast becoming a modern city. Every Indian is proud of Delhi,” he tweeted.The Delhi EV Policy, 2020, which was rolled out on August 7 last year, mandates that the city administration shifts its entire fleet of cars to EVs.Thursday’s order stated that the state transport department will be the nodal agency to monitor the progress of the transition. “It will also be necessary for all departments to produce monthly action reports on the transition by the fifth of every month to the nodal department,” the order said.On February 4, Kejriwal through a digital press conference, had launched a new eight-week long campaign called “Switch Delhi”, to spread awareness about the subsidies provided by the city administration on buying EVs and also set a deadline of six months for the government to shift its hired fleet of cars to EVs.The Switch Delhi campaign aims at informing, encouraging, and motivating the people of Delhi to switch from polluting vehicles to zero-emission EVs. While the first two weeks of the campaign focused on promoting two and three- wheeler owners to switch to EVs, the third week targeted four-wheeler vehicle owners to adopt EVs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-depts-will-make-ev-switch-by-sept-delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-101614300268572.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: An oasis with a cab seat||Here’s a place to briefly escape from all the negativity.This refuge is by a busy road, on a pavement in south Delhi’s Panchsheel Park. The seat is... an ambassador car, the yellow cab often identified with Kolkata. Actually, it’s just the front of the cab; its middle portion lopped off and a nice cushiony seat fitted into it (which could as well be the back-seat of the same cab). Here you sit, quietly watch the traffic go by, while beside you the pavement is decked up with inspiring inscriptions like this one—“Our prime purpose in life is to help others. And if you can’t help them, at least don’t hurt them.”This street infrastructure is perhaps the kind of installations the city desperately needs in these times. A place for strained citizens to sit, catch a breath and get their mind relaxed by cooling words. Cold water is also available, in earthen matkas, or pots, to quench the summer thirst. Indeed, this spot is first and foremost a point to help oneself to free drinking water. Which in itself isn’t a novelty. In summers, charitable-minded house owners of upscale neighbourhoods, like Panchsheel Park, often keep cold water coolers or matkas for pedestrians outside their gigantic gates. But this water point is more elaborate. Nobody needs to hire Sherlock Holmes to find out the person behind this facility. His mobile number is displayed prominently, including his website, matkaman.com.A Panchsheel dweller, Alagarathanam Natarajan has occasionally been written about for setting up water pitchers in the area. But nobody has celebrated the extraordinary designing and layout of this drinking point. It’s so funky, so unusual, that one can imagine it has been shoplifted straight out of some art installation fair.The whole setup seems to be modelled after a motor car. The aforementioned sayings are inscribed in metal bars, which lie fitted among an assembly of machines you might find in a car. There’s also an array of speedometers. But the most startling eye-catchers are the stands for the matkas—they look like red metallic pipes swirled into a spring-like formation. This afternoon one of the pitchers is empty and has been turned upside down.Now, a pedestrian arrives, with his young son, and together they sit down on the car seat, watching the speeding cars go by. It’s a fun sight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-an-oasis-with-a-cab-seat-101614300019425.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Riots, markaz wounds still raw, Chauhan Banger gets ready to vote in civic bypolls||Two-hundred metres away from the Jafrabad Metro station, where stone pelting between the pro- and anti-CAA later snowballed into riots in northeast Delhi, campaigning for the municipal bypoll in the Chauhan Banger (ward no. 41E) is on in full swing.While the candidates of three main political parties are focusing on local issues such as mending broken roads, building a new library, addressing parking problem, improving sanitation service, riots and the crackdown on the members of the Tablighi Jamaat for attending a congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz in violation of the rules imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic also find frequent mention in the conversations.Chauhan Banger with 40,000 voters is one of the five municipal wards where bypolls are scheduled on February 28. The bypoll was necessitated in the ward, as the sitting AAP councillor, Abdul Rehman, won the assembly election from Seelampur last year. Most of the people here are Muslims employed in household industries and run small mechanical workshops.Although no violence was reported during the February riots from Chauhan Banger, locals recall the horror and fear which had gripped the area for days. Imamuddin Khan. 41, a resident of the ward, said, “We all were scared and didn’t step out for two days. I have been living here for nearly three decades, but I never saw such tension among people in the area.”Some residents feel that the riots may have a bearing on the election outcome. Maulana Mohd. Daud Amini (58), rector of Madrasa Babul Uloom in Jafrabad, vividly remembers the events preceding the violence. Amini said, “There was an anti-CAA protest near this [Jafrabad] Metro station. Though no violence was reported, but there was an atmosphere of fear as police took a few young men for questioning.”He alleged that Muslims also had to bear of the government’s action against the congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz. Over 2,300 people were evacuated from the Markaz and taken to quarantine centres. Amini said, “The way the Markaz issue was handled, the community felt targeted. It is the poor people who bore the brunt of the incident. The fruits and vegetable vendors from the community found it difficult to earn their livelihood during the lockdown. The community is hurt as it was vilified. Though it has been a year, the two incidents are still fresh in minds of people.”AAP candidate Mohd Ishraq Khan, a former MLA from Seelampur, said, “There is anger in the community. People talk about it when we meet them.”Khan is pitted against Zubair Ahmad, son of Congress veteran and five-time MLA from Seelampur, Mateen Ahmed, and BJP’s Mohd Nazir Ansari, a local party worker who has been actively working with the minority wing of the party for over two decades.Zubair said the Muslim community was angry over the way riots and the Markaz incident were handled. “While we are focusing only on development issues in our campaign, these issues do come up. The area needs sanitation services. The situation of essential services in the area has gone from bad to worse,” said Zubair, whose main promises include setting up a library and improving sanitation services in the area.Ishraq Khan dismissed the allegations of the government “mishandling the riots and Markaz” issues. “Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the riot-affected areas and the government made all efforts to provide immediate relief to the victims. The Congress has no relevant issue to talk about.”Hitting out at Zubair, Khan said, “His father represented the Seelampur constituency for over two decades, but he didn’t do anything. It is only after the AAP came to power that new schools and medical facilities were constructed here.”The AAP is going all out to retain the ward, which it won in 2017. Environment minister Gopal Rai, who is also AAP’s Delhi unit convener, recently campaigned in the area. The new state Congress team has been working hard to revive the party and hoping for a favourable outcome. The BJP, which has never won any municipal election from this ward, is banking on the central government schemes such as PM-UDAY for giving ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies to garner support. Mohd Nazir Ansari said, “Our focus is just on development. The area has been ruled by Congress and AAP in the past but look at the conditions here. The Centre has announced several schemes for housing, better employment, ease of doing business, etc. We are telling people about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/riots-wounds-still-raw-chauhan-banger-gets-ready-for-bypolls-101614299235957.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi court grants bail to 16 accused in violence at Singhu border||A sessions court on Thursday granted bail to 16 accused in connection to the incident at Singhu border in which the SHO of Alipur police station Pradeep Paliwal was stabbed during stone-pelting between the protesting farmers and some local residents on January 29. At least two people, including a police official, were injured in the violence.Additional sessions judge Shivani Anand granted bail to the 16 accused, stating injuries suffered by other police officials were superficial except those on the body of SHO Alipur.The court also said that the prosecution has failed to show as to why it did not seek the police remand of the accused despite arresting them.The judge also said that name of the accused would have been mentioned in the FIR, if the accused were overpowered from the spot.The police contended that though the names of other accused persons could not be mentioned initially in the FIR but police officials have properly identified the offenders in their statement.Meanwhile, a Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to a Class 12 student suffering from Bipolar disorder, arrested in connection to the violence at Nangloi Chowk during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day, saying that he was a young man with clean antecedents and has already been in custody for 29 days.Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that brings severe high and low moods and changes in behaviour.Additional sessions judge Samar Vishal granted bail to one Gursewak who was arrested for allegedly hitting the police barricades and police vehicles while driving a tractor, noting the “tender age” of the accused.The police alleged that the accused tried to run over the police personnel deployed at Nangloi Chowk and sped towards Peeragarhi.The judge said the acts of the protestors/ rioters cannot be condoned, however, the guilt or innocence of the accused is a matter of trial and nothing cannot be said about it at this stage.In an another case related to Nangloi violence, the judge granted bail to one Daljinder stating that the accused was just 22-year-old and does not have any criminal record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-grants-bail-to-16-accused-in-violence-at-singhu-border-101614298965508.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Toolkit accused Shantanu Muluk gets safety from arrest till March 9||A Delhi court on Thursday granted interim protection from arrest to Pune engineer Shantanu Muluk, an accused in the toolkit case, till March 9 in continuation of the 10-day transit bail given to him by the Bombay high court on February 16.Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said no coercive action would be taken against Muluk, who along with climate activist Disha Ravi and Mumbai lawyer Nikita Jacob, was booked for sedition for alleged formulation, editing and dissemination of the toolkit document related to the farmers’ protest against the three new farm laws.The police have alleged that Ravi, Muluk and Jacob allegedly created an online toolkit intending to help a section of protesting farmers. According to the police, the toolkit was a sinister design to defame India and incite unrest.The police registered a case on February 4 for sedition, promoting hatred among groups and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) after the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted the toolkit while expressing her support to the protesters.On Thursday, public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for the police, sought seven days to file their reply on the anticipatory bail plea and assured the court that the Investigating officer (IO) did not intend to take any coercive steps in the meanwhile.He also told the court that Muluk’s repolies to the police questions were inconsistent and full of contradictions.Advocate Vrinda Grover, counsel for Muluk, told the court that her client should not be arrested as he has been joining investigation whenever he has been called by the investigating agency.Noting the submissions of the police, the court said that no “coercive actions” will be taken against the accused and posted the matter for next hearing on March 9.In his plea filed through advocate Akram Khan and Sarim Naved, Muluk has said that he merely created the toolkit with information on the agitation, which was then edited by others without his knowledge.The application further said there was “absolutely nothing” in the toolkit that advised doing anything unlawful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/toolkit-accused-shantanu-muluk-gets-safety-from-arrest-till-march-9-101614298361713.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Police submit 3rd charge sheet in Delhi riots case||The Delhi Police special cell, in their third supplementary charge sheet on the conspiracy behind the north-east Delhi riots, submitted an animated video which they stitched together from the footage of 36 CCTV cameras located in different parts of Chand Bagh area to show that the riots were orchestrated and not spontaneous.Using the footage from each camera, police have made an attempt to show the court how on February 24, locals were mobilised between 11.30am and 1.30pm, given weapons and told to gather on the Wazirabad main road to attack police personnel. Police said it was on this road that the mob had beaten to death head constable Rattan Lal.Using the presentation, which shows residents from each lane arming themselves with stones and weapons, and then reaching the Wazirabad main road to attack the police teams, police have attempted to show that the acts of violence were not “spontaneous”.The presentation also showed a map of the Chand Bagh area, with 36 pins marking out the locations of the CCTV cameras, installed by the Delhi government, from which the footage was collected before they were destroyed.At the end of the presentation, police also showed a video of how each camera was later smashed, or covered by cloth, or its lens turned upside down by rioters to ensure that no one was captured on tape.HT has learnt that one such camera installed in one of the lanes of Chand Bagh, shows a man carrying a sword and walking with a mob carrying sticks.The same man was captured by cameras in multiple areas and he is seen walking towards the spot where head constable Rattan Lal and other police personnel were attacked.Police have also placed on record the footage of women handing over weapons and rods to menfolk. A rioter is also seen breaking a ladder and handing out the wooden pieces to locals.The court is likely to hear the matter on Monday.At least 53 persons were killed and 581 injured in the riots last year, which was allegedly triggered by a clash between supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and those opposing it. It later snowballed into a Hindu-Muslim violence that raged between February 23 and 27.The local police, crime branch and the special cell (anti-terror unit) are jointly probing the riots cases. Police registered 755 cases, of which 697 were probed by the local police, 57 by the crime branch and one by the special cell.The special cell is probing the role of several prominent anti-CAA protesters in allegedly orchestrating the riots. The special cell has claimed that the riots were not spontaneous but was planned by persons such as student leaders Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, local politicians Tahir Hussain and Ishrat Jahan, JNU student Sharjeel Imam, and activists Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi.They have been arrested and charged under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Police have already filed two other charge sheets against these persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-submit-3rd-charge-sheet-in-delhi-riots-case-101614298207304.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Water crisis looms as Nangal channel gears up for repairs||The closure of Nangal hydel channel will cause an “unprecedented water crisis” and even a “law and order” problem in Delhi, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha said, urging the Centre, the Haryana government and Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) to postpone the repair of the water channel scheduled to commence on March 25.Delhi receives at least 232 MGD (million gallons per day) water through the Nangal channel, which helps meet the city’s 25% water requirement, which is estimated to be 935 MGD.“The blind closure of the channel will affect supply of 232 MGD (million gallons per day) of water supply from the Beas River to Delhi for one month in March-April. It is 25% of water supply in Delhi and could lead to an unprecedented water crisis and even create a law and order situation,” Chadha said in his letter to the Centre.Chadha said during summers, Delhi’s water requirement shoots up to 1,000 MGD-1,200 MGD and urged Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to convene a meeting of all stakeholders to discuss the issue at the earliest.The senior AAP leader added that the Delhi government is in constant touch with the Centre over the issue.Being a landlocked city, apart from water of the Beas, Delhi also relies on water from rivers Yamuna and Ganga and groundwater aquifers for its water needs. However, the Nangal hydel channel is among the biggest suppliers of water for the city. Chadha warned that if the channel is shut off, the water supply to the President’s residence, the Prime Minister’s house, the Supreme Court, the Delhi high court, the National Green Tribunal and the embassies will also be hit.Shalabh Kumar, DJB member (water supply), said the shutdown of the channel has been proposed from March 25 to April 24, for the cleaning of the spill gates of Bhakra and Nangal dams.“The Punjab government is also asking for a complete closure of the channel because this is a lean period for irrigation for them. They are saying that the channel should be completely closed because a portion of a canal near Nangal in their state is currently lying in a dilapidated condition and they want it to be repaired,” Kumar said.He said that the DJB is also in talks with the Haryana government to ensure an alternative source of water.“But the problem is that there is no alternative sources, because during summers the flow of Yamuna is also less. If the work is postponed to monsoons, we can draw additional raw water from the Yamuna (Western Jamuna Canal) to meet the drinking water requirements for Delhi,” Kumar added.Sanjay Shrivastava, the chairperson of the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMS), however said that the channel will not be completely shut off.“The supply might be slightly affected for such routine repair work, but this channel cannot be completely shut off. The water supply in Delhi will not face any severe impact,” Shrivastava said.Water flows from Bhakra dam, which is in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, downstream to the Nangal dam where it is controlled and released into the Nangal hydel channel. This channel later becomes Bhakra main line after Ganguwal and Kotla power plants. The Bhakra main line supplies irrigation water to Haryana and the power generated at Bhakra Dam is distributed among Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Chandigarh and Delhi.The Haryana government did not respond to requests for a comment on the issue.“The Nangal channel is a major source of Delhi’s water and there is no doubt that if such a shortage of supply occurs people will extract more groundwater. There is also not enough notice that Delhi can work towards reducing its demands. The agencies should consider that such closure should happen around winters or monsoon when the demand for water is comparatively less,” said Manu Bhatnagar, water expert and principal director, natural heritage division, Intach||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-crisis-looms-as-nangal-channel-gears-up-for-repairs-101614297848465.html
26-02-2021||Bhopal||Man who worshipped Godse joins Cong; ‘now Gandhian’, says party||The induction into the Congress of a former municipal corporator who built a temple dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse has stirred a political controversy in Madhya Pradesh.The Congress on Thursday inducted Babulal Chaurasiya into the party in the presence of former chief minister Kamal Nath.Hitting out at the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party leader and state home minister Narottam Mishra said: “This has revealed the double standards of the Congress party. Congress party leaders use the name of Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi for votes only like they use the name of BR Ambedkar and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel during elections only.”Defending the party’s decision, Congress’s Gwalior MLA Praveen Pathak said: “Chaurasiya was an active member of the Congress. He decided to return to the party...we welcomed him because our party leaders are like Rahul Gandhi, who has even forgiven the murderers of his father to give them a chance...”Chaurasia himself admitted that he had been associated with the Congress in the past.“Now, the truth has come out that it was a Congressman who hatched the conspiracy to malign the image of the BJP-led state government [by glorifying Godse],” BJP leader Rajneesh Agrawal said.In 2017, Chaurasiya, who contested the 2015 Gwalior Municipal Corporation election as an independent candidate, built a temple dedicated to Godse. He was with the Hindu Mahasabha at the time. Indeed, as recently as 2020, he appeared in events supporting Godse.Following his induction into the Congress, Chaurasiya said he had been misguided by the Hindu Mahasabha. “The leaders of Hindu Mahasabha showed some fake books to me about Godse. But recently, I realized my mistake and left the organization,” he said .The Hindu Mahasabha contested this and said Chaurasiya was expelled three days ago.“How was it possible to misguide a person for six years? He was associated with the Hindu Mahasabha for the past six years. We have videos of his speeches in which he was seen praising Godse. Recently, we came to know that Chaurasiya used to take money from a local Congress MLA for sending people from his ward to Congress party political rallies. We removed him from the organisation three days ago after serving a show-cause notice to him,” Hindu Mahasabha national vice president Jaiveer Bhardwaj said.Chaurasiya’s induction appeared to create a divide in the Congress state unit as well.Senior party leader Manak Agrawal said: “It is wrong to welcome an admirer of Godse in the party. I don’t know the reason why he has been allowed to join the party but we will surely oppose this decision.”Former state Congress chief Arun Yadav tweeted saying he was ashamed of the induction. “Bapu hum sharminda hai…Mahatma Gandhi Amar Rahe (Bapu, we are ashamed…Mahatma Gandhi Long Live),” he tweeted.A political analyst from Gwalior, Jayant Singh, said: “Congress is trying to regain lost political ground in Chambal and Gwalior division. They are looking for Independent leaders, who have the support of common people, for local bodies’ election. Chaurasiya contested the election independently in 2015 and won with a good margin. He is very popular in his ward. To win, the party leaders are ready to ignore the fact that he was a part of an organisation which hates Gandhi and Congressmen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/man-who-worshipped-godse-joins-cong-now-gandhian-says-party-101614294606580.html

We have taken all measures to develop Delhi, improve schools for your children, improve hospitals for your families, made the bus rides free for women, and provided free electricity to the people of Delhi,” said AAP chief Kejriwal at a roadshow in Trilokpuri.The chief minister on Thursday participated in roadshows in Trilokpuri, Seelampur and Kondli localities, campaigning for party candidates ahead of municipal bypolls in five wards of Delhi scheduled on Sunday. Delhi goes to municipal polls in 2022.Kejriwal said, “The Aam Aadmi Party is the only party to challenge the BJP across the nation. The AAP is the only party to contest against BJP in all states.You must have heard about the municipal election results in Surat. We have emerged as the principal opposition to the BJP.”Earlier this week, the AAP won 27 seats in the Surat municipal corporation.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said people are not happy with the AAP government in Delhi. “It is because of the AAP that people in most parts of Delhi get unclean water, government schools and hospitals are in shambles, so are roads.”Delhi Congress vice-president Mudit Agarwal said, “Kejriwal has abandoned the people of Delhi. He is scared of the Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/only-aap-capable-of-challenging-bjp-across-states-says-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-101614294281969.html
26-02-2021||Delhi||Maximum temperature in Delhi jumps to 33.2°C, may rise more||Delhi on Thursday recorded a maximum temperature of 33.2 degrees Celsius, a slight jump from Wednesday’s 32.5 degrees Celsius, and looked on course to break the record for the highest maximum temperature notched in the month of February in the last 15 years.India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings show that the maximum temperature at Safdarjung weather station, which is the official marker for the city, was 33.2 degrees Celsius, eight degrees above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature also touched 13.4 degrees Celsius, a notch above what is considered normal for this time of the year.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was 32.5 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above the season’s normal and the minimum temperature was 12 degrees Celsius.Before this, in 2018 and 2017, the day time temperatures had crossed the 32 degrees Celsius mark. On February 23, 2018, the maximum temperature was 32 degrees Celsius, while on February 21, 2017, the maximum temperature had touched 32.4 degrees Celsius. According to IMD, this was the warmest February day in at least the last 15 years. The warmest February day was recorded in 2006, when the day time temperature had reached 34.1 degrees Celsius, Met officials said.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the maximum temperatures could rise further on Friday and reach around 34 degrees Celsius. He also said that there is a possibility that this time the record for the highest February temperature is broken.“The maximum temperature is likely to touch 34 degrees Celsius. Maybe the difference would be of a few points,” Srivastava added.He also explained that February this year has been recording higher than normal temperatures primarily because of fewer active western disturbances and clear skies; that has led to sunlight reaching the surface uninterrupted.“Generally, in the month of February we get around six western disturbances, but this year the last time Delhi got an active western disturbance was on February 4,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/maximum-temperature-in-delhi-jumps-to-33-2-c-may-rise-more-101614293906715.html

However, relief is in sight as rain up to 20mm is likely on Friday evening.The last warmest day in the month was recorded on February 23 in 2006, when the temperature had gone up to 32°C. The all-time highest was way back in 1954 when the mercury was 32.8°C on February 20. “Fewer Western Disturbances are primarily behind this sudden rise in temperature. The relatively cleaner air in the city may have also played a part in keeping it warmer. Pollutants, especially particulate matter, reflect sunlight, causing cooler days,” said Surender Paul, director, IMD, Chandigarh.He added that a weak Western Disturbance was likely to bring in rain from Friday evening onwards. “If the weather turns cloudy in the early afternoon, the maximum temperature may reduce, else it may go up to 32°C due to warmer winds blowing in the city,” Paul said.While dry weather will return on Saturday, another spell of western disturbances will affect the region in the first week of March.Over the next three days, the day temperature may hover between 32°C and 28°C, while the night temperature will remain around 14°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-records-hottest-february-day-in-15-years-rain-relief-likely-today-101614281096442.html

26-02-2021||Chandigarh||Health workers’ vaccination wraps up in Chandigarh with 43% coverage||The 41-day exercise to inoculate healthcare workers on priority ended on Thursday, with Chandigarh performing poorly on the coverage ratio amid reluctance towards the Covid-19 vaccine.The city falls among the league of four states and UTs with coverage for first dose less than 50%. Placed third among them, Chandigarh has achieved vaccination coverage of 43%, followed by Puducherry at 33.7%.Now, the second phase of the vaccination drive for people aged over 60 and those above 45 with comorbidities will begin on March 1. A meeting between the Centre and states on operational details of the next phase and covering the remaining health workers is scheduled on Friday. A few healthcare staffers will be immunised on Friday as their entries were recorded in the online registration platform on Thursday evening. Drive to provide the second dose will continue as per the schedule of the first jab. Meanwhile, frontline workers will continue to receive the vaccine till March 6. Comprising staff from the police and municipal corporation, the drive for frontline categories began on February 3 and has so far covered 35.6% of the targeted beneficiaries.“The fact remains that the exercise is totally voluntary. We cannot force the beneficiaries to get the vaccine. A decision on whether there should be an incentive for those who got the shot will be taken during the war room meeting after consultation with the respective department heads,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.Lukewarm response worrisomeThe low turnout among the priority groups can also cast its shadow on the upcoming phases, particularly when the city is seeing a resurge in the daily infections and new strains of the virus are surfacing. The number of daily cases has almost doubled in less than a week. On Thursday, 49 people tested positive against the 28 on February 21.“The steady upward trend, coupled with low vaccination coverage, is a matter of concern. The health workers have been hesitant as evident from the statistics. The numbers are increasing to some extent now, but are still far from encouraging,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.In a press statement on Thursday, the institute said with mask use down and mobility up, Covid-19 cases had accelerated and in one week, there had been a 100% increase in bed occupancy.Dr GD Puri, chairman of the Covid-19 management committee at PGIMER, said, “For a few months, the numbers had been decreasing consistently and had been stable over the recent weeks. However, the trend has reversed, with the cases again rising on a daily basis. There has been a surge in admitted patients at PGIMER, from 30 to 57 in a week, a 100% rise in positive cases at PGIMER.”He said frontline warriors should be the role models for society instead of falling prey to misconceptions and rumours regarding the efficacy, safety and side effects of the vaccine. “In fact, who knows more than the healthcare workers about how deadly Covid-19 is?” he added in the PGIMER statement. In an order on February 22, UT senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal had warned of disciplinary action against any police personnel not turning up for vaccination as per the list. He had tasked the unit in-charges with ensuring compliance. However, he did not elaborate on what the disciplinary action will entail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/health-workers-vaccination-wraps-up-in-chandigarh-with-43-coverage-101614280735156.html

26-02-2021||Chandigarh||Paying 30% cess on hiked water tariff a bane for Chandigarh residents||In addition to paying a hefty water tariff, which was hiked by 200% in September last year, residents must now also pay a sizable sewerage cess.In the latest bills received by city residents, the 30% cess charges imposed by the municipal corporation on the water tariff have increased manifold. For instance, a resident of Sector 16, who used to pay ₹700 as sewerage cess, has to pay ₹1,538 now, more than twice.The sewerage cess was introduced in June 2019, but with the recent water tariff hike, the real burden of the cess is being felt for the first time.Terming the imposition of the cess as arbitrary, advocate and legal analyst Anil Malhotra of Sector 16 said, “Section 399 of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, as applicable to Chandigarh, in Part B allows by-laws to be made relating to water supply, drainage and sewage disposal under 26 specified heads. However, none of them authorises or warrants levy of sewerage cess. Hence, the UT by-laws are beyond powers of the MC, unwarranted, unfounded in law and have no legal basis of levy.”After the MC General House had passed a resolution to the effect in 2018, the MC had notified in 2019 a sewerage cess of 30% of the water charges.In September 2020, the UT administration had notified a hike between 50% and 200% in water tariff depending upon the category of user and water consumption level. After facing a public outcry and criticism from the opposition, however, the MC General House had passed a resolution in October, asking the administration to withdraw the notification and stick to the existing rates till the pandemic lasts. The resolution was then sent to the administration for its approval.“Even though MC officials say that the increase in water tariff ranges between 39% to 184%, it is much more because of the sewerage cess,” said RK Garg, president, Second Innings Association.“Earlier it (cess) was fixed at ₹10 per water connection, then it was increased to ₹60. But fixing it at 30% of water charges is too steep. The MC should reverse it to fixed charges,” added Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paying-30-cess-on-hiked-water-tariff-a-bane-for-chandigarh-residents-101614280255618.html
26-02-2021||Chandigarh||Former MP Tanwar launches Apna Bharat Morcha||Fifteen months after he quit the Congress citing serious internal contradictions and existential crisis in the party, former MP Ashok Tanwar on Thursday launched Apna Bharat Morcha, a socio-political platform.“I am presenting this platform as an alternative to Congress and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). There is a lot of frustration among Congress and BJP workers. Many want to leave these parties provided there is a better alternative,” he said.Having remained in political wilderness for all these months, Tanwar said that the Morcha will be an agent of positive changes and a platform to give voice to the voiceless.“Our focus will be on overall and inclusive development of the country. Our slogan is ‘Nai Soch, Nai Disha, Aur Nai Rajneeti.’ (New Thinking, New Direction and New Politics!),” he said in New Delhi after the formal launch.When asked that past experience show that regional political outfits have a poor success rate, Tanwar said when people are with you, there is nothing challenging. “Ours is a socio-political platform of the people and for the people,” he said.Most regional outfits such as Bansi Lal’s Haryana Vikas Party (HVP), Bhajan Lal’s Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC), Gopal Kanda’s Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) and Venod Sharma’s Haryana Jan Chetna Party (HJCP) have limited to no success at all in electoral politics of Haryana.While HVP had managed to form government with the BJP’s support in 1996, it had collapsed in 1999 and later merged into Congress in 2005. HJC also came a cropper and merged into Congress. Kanda and Sharma’s outfits are virtually non-starters.The only credible exception is Om Prakash Chautala’s Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and its offshoot, the fledgling Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) which can claim to have tasted some success.Tanwar, a former state Congress chief, was sent packing after the 2019 Lok Sabha debacle where all 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana were won by the BJP.He had later held a protest outside the Delhi residence of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi against distribution of party tickets for the Haryana assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-mp-tanwar-launches-apna-bharat-morcha-101614280254467.html

A detailed order from the court is yet to be released.The FIR was registered on February 14, eight months after Yuvraj had apologised for the “unintentional remarks” made during an Instagram live video in April 2020.The FIR was registered on complaint of one Rajat Kalsan of Hansi under Section 153 A (promoting enmity) and 153B (assertions prejudicial to national-integration) of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Prevention and Atrocities Act 1989.“The remark was misunderstood and was widely shared on the social media, triggering outrage. The petitioner is a victim of gross prosecution and harassment meted out by the complainant who has initiated malicious prosecution,” the plea stated, adding that the live session happened in April 2020 and in June the video started circulating with allegations that the cricketer disrespected the Dalit community as he addressed two of his colleagues as “Bhangi”.An apology was issued on June 5, but complaints were filed against him, the latest one resulting in an FIR on February 14, the plea states, adding that all this was done in an attempt to harm his reputation.“The petitioner addressed his colleagues in a friendly manner but conveniently the issue was portrayed as an act in violation of the SC/ ST Act,” the plea states.“In the FIR, there is neither any averment of either promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion/ race/ place of birth residence/ language etc or doing any acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony. Hence, the Sections invoked deserve to be set aside,” the plea states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-coercive-action-against-ex-cricketer-yuvraj-till-further-orders-hc-to-haryana-101614279954434.html
26-02-2021||Gurugram||244 species spotted on Big Bird Day||At least 244 bird species were recorded from Delhi and the National Capital Region on the Big Bird Day 2021 held on February 21, the result of which was released on Thursday.Last year, birders recorded 253 species from Delhi-NCR. In 2019, 247 species were sighted while in 2018 the count was 237.Big Bird Day is an annual event, organised at the onset of spring when birders observe and record different species. The event started in 2004.This year, the Grey-headed fish eagle was spotted at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, making it the fourth sighting ever of this bird in NCR. According to the report, some other interesting sightings from NCR included Grey-winged blackbird, Tickell’s thrush, Great crested grebe, Greater White-fronted Goose and Spotted crake among others.Speaking on the marginal decrease in the number of bird species recorded this year, Nikhil Devasar, founder of Delhi Bird Foundation which organised the Big Bird Day, said, “One of the reasons for the low count this year could be because we are still in a pandemic and lesser number of people were able to come out this year to record birds.”He added that unusually high temperatures during the past few days may also have caused the lower species count this year.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 32.5 degrees Celsius -- the warmest day in February in the past 15 years. On Thursday, it was 33 degrees with meteorological scientists predicting further increase on Friday.Birds such as Red-crested pochard, Dunlin, Lesser Black-backed Gull, Black-necked Stork, Grey-headed fish eagle, Peregrine falcon were sighted at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. At the Budhera Water Treatment Plant in Gurugram, birds such as Great crested grebe, Black-necked grebe, Spotted crake, Eurasian Curlew, Jack Snipe and Great Bittern were spotted.At Dhanauri Wetlands near Noida, birders spotted Red-crested Pochard, Black-necked Stork; Desert Wheatear was sighted at Mangar Bani in Faridabad and at Kheda Jhanjhrola. Hume’s Lark (Hume’s Short-toed Lark) was also sighted at Kheda Jhanjhrola in Haryana.Pankaj Gupta, a birder from Delhi Bird Group said, “We recorded fewer species of birds this year, but the number of birds was not less as compared to previous years. The dip in the number of species could be due to various reasons such as lack of water near Sultanpur and Nafajgarh, prime areas for bird sighting. This year, the Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary was also closed on the day of the count due to Covid-19 protocols, so we could not go there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/244-species-spotted-on-big-bird-day-101614279266363.html
26-02-2021||Dehradun||Teen gets online task to 'kill someone', goes missing after attacking woman||A 17-year-old schoolboy, studying in class 12 in Uttarakhand's Dehradun, went missing after allegedly attacking a woman with a knife. According to police, by attacking the woman, he was completing a task given to him on an online chatting platform by his chat partner.The attack on the woman took place on Monday evening in the Nehru Colony area of Dehradun. The boy has been missing since then. His parents lodged a complaint about him going missing in the Patel Nagar area of the city where the family lives. The boy's link with the online platform came to light after police officials went through his mobile phone on Wednesday during the probe. He had left his phone at home before running away.Yogendra Singh Rawat, senior superintendent of police, Dehradun said, "The Nehru Colony police, while probing the assault case, checked his mobile phone during which it came out that he was involved in chatting with a stranger on an online chatting platform named Discord where he was given the task of attacking a person."Rawat said in the chat, the stranger had written, "Task- To kill someone, to suicide or to disappear."Also read: Pakistan stays in FATF ‘grey list’, given June deadline to implement action plan"It is really worrisome that children are falling into such online traps wherein sometimes they often become the target of online bullying, blackmailing and even threatening. Out of fear, these children often do such acts like in this case," said Rawat.He said the police are constantly trying to find him.Another police officer, who did not wish to be named, said, "He was last seen near Paonta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh which suggests that he might still be there. Police are trying to find him as soon as possible."He added, "Meanwhile, the woman who was attacked is undergoing treatment in hospital. She had sustained serious wounds in her neck and torso."Experts are of the view that such incidents happen due to the growing communication gap between children and their parents.Mukul Verma, a Dehradun-based psychiatrist, said, "Parents need to monitor the online activities of their children to check what sort of platforms they are accessing. They also need to talk to them more to reduce the communication gap which is pushing them more into mobile phones."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/teen-gets-online-task-to-kill-someone-goes-missing-after-attacking-woman-101614279357187.html

Around 1670 truckers are expected to go off the road. However, movement of vehicles carrying essential goods will not be impacted because of the bandh. The strike is called by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) against Goods and Service Tax (GST), rising fuel prices and introduction of e-invoice in place of e-way bill.“BGTA has been petitioning the government on various issues of transport industry, mainly on issues of un-practicable e-way bill under GST and unviable pricing policy of diesel. Our office-bearers have also been meeting government officials regularly to explain their problems. However, no resolution or respite has been provided. Ministers concerned are not making themselves available for any direct interaction with us,” said Jai Kumar Gupta, president, BGTA.A statement issued by BGTA said that increase in diesel price has made it impossible for transporters. “Transport Industry is a fully neglected lot by Government of India. Ever increasing diesel price has made it impossible for transporters to honour their contracts with customers. Transportation rates cannot be flexible as per daily changing diesel rates. The non-uniformity of prices across nation also makes it difficult to compete fairly,” read the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-transporters-to-join-nationwide-strike-essential-supply-won-t-be-affected-101614279534619.html

It is unfortunate that students are still not able to fix their preferences. We will have a discussion and see if another round is a possibility.” There are over 97,000 vacant seats in colleges across MMR after seven admission rounds.

What we are currently witnessing is unusual. Till January, we experienced intense winter but now, the temperature has suddenly risen,” observed Dr Sidhu.Foggy morning was a unique phenomenon:She said the recent phenomenon of foggy mornings was due to high-moisture level in the atmosphere.

With this, Ludhiana MC’s project to shift over 500 dairy units outside the municipal corporation (MC) limits has once again hit a roadblock. The project to shift the dairy units from Haibowal and Tajpur road dairy complexes has been hanging fire for a long time. This will also have a cascading effect on the ₹650-crore project initiated by the state government to clean Buddha Nullah. The seasonal stream cannot be made pollution-free as long as dairy waste and cow dung is dumped into it. While the authorities say they have been working for around two months to shift the dairy units to Gorsian Kadar Baksh, the village residents say the administration never took their consent before chalking out the proposal. The high powered committee formed by the local bodies department had finalised the site for shifting of dairy units.Gorsian Kadar Baksh sarpanch Jagdev Singh Deol said, “The administration never took our consent. We have around 400 acres of panchayat land in the village and the administration is seeking 200 acres for establishing a dairy complex. The gram sabha has decided that we cannot hand over the land as over 100 families in the village have taken the land on contract from the panchayat, and are dependent on it for livelihood.” “The gram panchayat gets an annual revenue of around ₹1.10 crore from the land which has been given to farmers on contract basis and we take up development works with that amount. After the officials visited the village on Tuesday, over 300 out of 550 voters in the village came together to complete the quorum of the gram sabha on Thursday and we have approved a resolution that the land will not be given to the administration for shifting of dairy units,” said the village sarpanch while adding that a copy of the resolution will be sent to the deputy commissioner’s office, MC and Punjab chief secretary’s office. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said that as per the rules, they cannot oppose the gram panchayat’s resolution and the deputy commissioner’s office should intervene in the matter. Despite repeated attempts, Mayor Balkar Sandhu was not available for comments. Meanwhile Deputy Commissioner Varinder Sharma said that he has not received anything in writing from the villagers till now and he cannot comment on the issue before he receives anything in writing.Earlier, National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also directed the authorities to shift the dairy units situated on the banks of Buddha Nullah in view of the pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-s-dairy-shifting-project-hits-another-roadblock-as-gram-sabha-denies-giving-land-to-govt-101614278695375.html
26-02-2021||Mumbai||MVA may ignore Governor Koshyari’s order, delay Speaker’s election||Though Maharashtra Governor BS Koshyari has asked the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to hold an election for the vacant post of Assembly speaker, the government may delay this process, opting instead to continue with the deputy speaker conducting business in the house. The ruling coalition is likely to convey this to the Governor soon and remind him about the appointment of the 12 names recommended for the legislative council. The nominations for the legislative council are pending with the Governor since November 2020, when the names were submitted to Koshyari. The budget session of the state legislature begins from March 1. After Nana Patole resigned on February 4 to become Maharashtra Congress chief, the post of Assembly speaker is up for election. The election will require a show of strength by MVA and reveal the number of members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) who are with them. If the ruling parties fail to win the election, the government will collapse. MVA got 169 votes in the house of 288 in November 2019. This time round, MVA has been planning to get about 175 votes but with the surge in Covid-19 cases, attendance is expected to drop. MLAs may have to undergo mandatory testing before the session begins. “At least four of our ministers have tested positive [for Covid-19] over the past week. If more legislators are found infected before the session, the situation won’t be good. In such a scenario, holding an election for the post of the speaker will cause unnecessary embarrassment,” said a Shiv Sena minister on condition of anonymity. “We have a deputy speaker who can conduct business in the absence of the speaker. In Madhya Pradesh, which is a Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP]-ruled state, the deputy speaker has been running the house for more than a year now,” the minister added. With the Governor having asked the state to elect the Assembly speaker last week, the MVA government is expected to send a reply informing the Governor that the election would be held at an appropriate time. “We will also remind him about the appointment of the 12 names recommended by the state Cabinet for nomination to the legislative council. The posts are lying vacant since November 2020, depriving the recommended leaders. If the Governor is so keen on parliamentary procedures while asking about the election to the post of speaker, he should first follow it,” the minister said. This is expected to lead to more friction between Raj Bhavan and the MVA in coming days and may be intensified by the BJP in the Opposition. BJP leaders have been questioning MVA over issues like cutting the budget session short; allegations of corruption against forest minister Sanjay Rathod; disconnection of power supply to domestic consumers; farmers’ issues, and more. Leader of Opposition and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said the state government is using Covid-19 to avoid contentious issues. “While all political events are being held without any hurdles, why is the budget session being cut short to 10 days? Why is the state government scared to debate on issues of interest to the people and corruption cases against ministers? The business the government has planned for the session is not according to the rules and hence we walked out of the business advisory committee [BAC] meeting today,” Fadnavis said on Thursday. Held on Thursday, the BAC meeting was to decide on the duration of the session and was attended by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Fadnavis and other Opposition leaders like Pravin Darekar. The state government has decided to hold the session between March 1 and 10. The budget will be presented on March 8. “In the wake of the upsurge in the Covid-19 cases, the session has been curtailed to 10 days. There will be debate on the budget for two days after it’s presented on March 8. There is no question of running away from debate, the walkout staged by the Opposition was after the BAC meeting got over,” said parliamentary affairs ministers Anil Parab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-may-ignore-governor-koshyari-s-order-delay-speaker-s-election-101614278574761.html
26-02-2021||Kolkata||Yogi Adityanath to visit Malda next week to boost BJP’s Bengal prospects||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath will visit Malda in West Bengal on Tuesday to participate in a ‘Poribortan Jatra’ and hold a rally in the key district. This comes in a bid to create space for the party in the region where tribals hold power in some seats and whose leaders are being wooed by the BJP.West Bengal is likely to go to polls in April-May and of the 12 Assembly segments in Malda district, tribal voters determine the outcome in about 4 segments, BJP leaders said.Adityanath’s visit will happen days after BJP chief JP Nadda launched the ‘Lokkho Sonar Bangla’ (revival of Bengal's golden days) campaign aimed at stopping the Mamata Banerjee-led ruling Trinamool Congress government from coming to power for a third consecutive term.Ahead of UP CM's visit, BJP cadres started connecting with tribal farmers in Malda. His itinerary is still being drafted and could include religious stopovers at important places of worship.Also read: Pakistan stays in FATF ‘grey list’, given June deadline to implement action plan“Of the seats in Malda with heavy tribal presence, the CPM had won two and the Congress one in the 2016 Assembly polls. The two CPM MLAs have since defected to the BJP. Several important MLAs and ministers of the Mamata government have joined the BJP and I won’t be surprised if more from the ruling party or the CPM defect to the BJP after Yogi ji’s rally,” a BJP leader said.UP’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and UP BJP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal have already been tasked with the Bengal campaign. Maurya, an OBC leader, is connecting with the OBC and the Dalit voters in Bengal while Bansal has been working out the organisational dynamics in the state where the BJP feels its political connect has been growing.This will be Yogi’s first visit to Bengal since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the BJP did very well and one where his visits kicked up a storm after BJP claimed his chopper was not allowed to land in the state. Chief minister Adityanath subsequently visited Bengal through Jharkhand and held a rally in Purulia targeting the Mamata government.“West Bengal has always been close to our hearts. Our ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee hailed from there. And, people having tried all options there, now have hopes from the BJP,” BJP's Harish Chandra Srivastava said.“Yogi’s visit will have an impact in the poll-bound state. Over the years, the BJP’s graph has been growing in Bengal. In 2011, the party contested 289 out of 294 Assembly seats and failed to open its account after garnering a meagre 4.06 per cent votes. But, its graph has been going up in Bengal since then. In the 2016 Assembly polls, the party won three seats and raised its vote share to 10.06 per cent and in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, it surpassed even its own expectations winning 18 of the 42 seats from the state with a vote share of 40.64 per cent,” he added.“Remember in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, our vote share of 40.64 per cent was just behind ruling TMC’s 43 per cent vote. We won 18 seats and the TMC won 22 seats. Naturally, the TMC is rattled by our growing popularity and the attack on our leaders and cadres only proves that it’s the ruling party which is now feeling the heat,” Srivastava said.The 18 seats that the BJP won in the 2019 general elections include Malda North, a BJP leader said explaining why the party has decided to get Yogi to begin launch a campaign from this district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/yogi-adityanath-to-visit-malda-next-week-to-boost-bjp-s-bengal-prospects-101614277813496.html

Reportedly, the professors and students were neither informed nor consulted about this development and heard it via social media and news channels. As a result of this, most classes in Venky were cancelled on Thursday, followed by a dharna organised in the college from 10am to 4pm where teachers protested peacefully against the proposal.Venky students find the development unfair and are in a state of worry regarding since they feel their identity as a DU alumni is at stake. “If our college’s affiliation changes, the move will clearly rob us of the very reason we took admission to the college — to be a part of the prestigious institution that is DU,” says Sameer Ahmed Siddiqui, a second year student of BSc (Hons). Echoing a similar sentiment, Divya Goyal, a first year student of BCom (Hons), adds, “Whenever I tell someone I am in Venky, I feel a sense of pride. But when I think things might change, it’s scary. Our batch might still be a part of DU, but think how immensely it will affect our placements!”The students have been holding an online protest and plan to create ‘Twitter storms’ with #Venky_belongs_to_DU and #VenkyIsDU to oppose the proposal and bring attention to the issue. Some members of Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) have organised an online protest along with the presidents of the student union of Miranda House, Sri Aurobindo College and Venky. And scores of students have started tweeting and participating in the online protest, making the hashtags trend on Twitter. Shubham Chaudhary, executive counsellor of DUSU, says, “We are all flabbergasted at the sudden development and deliberation. We don’t know what will happen next but if the issue remains unsorted or if the affiliation changes, we will switch to a physical dharna from the online mode. Venky was always a part of DU and we can’t imagine it otherwise.”Students across various colleges have formed protest groups on social media and are circulating an appeal to raise a voice and take a stand regarding retaining affiliation of Venky to DU. Mukul Malik, a final year student of Sri Aurobindo College expresses support to the students of Sri Venkateswara College, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it’s my college or not. We can’t imagine South Campus without Venky and we all are in shock. Freshers from Venky have been reaching out to us, and asking what they must do when their whole career is at stake because of probable affiliation change of their college. Their family members are distressed. How can you be a DU student and suddenly become a student of a different university within a span of few days?”The sudden uncertainty regarding the future affiliation of the college has garnered a distressing response from the faculty as well. “This move will dilute everything Venky stands for. It has a history, name and a present. Students come to the college because it’s part of DU,” says a senior professor on condition of anonymity.

These roads are mainly from Kothrud, Shivajinagar and Parvati assembly constituencies and other areas in the city.PMC’s decision is likely to affect residents who are living beside small roads and mainly people who live in bungalows.Prashant Waghmare, city engineer, said, “We are currently in the process of collecting suggestions and objections for the same. I can’t give the exact number of objections that we have received.”As many properties on six-meter roads are old properties, some of them were willing for redevelopment, but they were not able to do it earlier as they were not getting enough FSI (floor space index). Even developers were not coming forward as they were not benefiting from the deal.Hemant Ranse, chairman, standing committee, said, “The standing committee had approved the proposal to widen 323 roads in the first phase. We would check the response from the concerned stakeholders and then make a decision.”Avinash Joshi, a resident of Sahakarnagar, said, “ We are happy with the existing roads. If the roads are widened the traffic would increase and even commercial activity. If there is no demand from citizens, why PMC is forcing road widening in the name of redevelopment.”Sushil Zende, a resident of Bibwewadi, said, “We are not getting additional area for redevelopment, so our society is unable to be redeveloped. It would be better if we get benefits of the nine-meter road widening project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mixed-response-to-9-metre-road-widening-proposal-in-pune-city-101614265192968.html
26-02-2021||World||Myanmar's UN envoy dramatically opposes coup in his country||Myanmar’s U.N. ambassador strongly opposed the military coup in his country and appealed for “the strongest possible action from the international community” to restore democracy in a dramatic speech to the U.N. General Assembly Friday that drew loud applause from diplomats from the world body’s 193 nations.Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun urged all countries to issue public statements strongly condemning the military coup and refuse to recognize the military regime and ask its leaders to respect the free and fair elections in November won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party.“It is time for the military to immediately relinquish power and release those detained,” he said. “We will continue to fight for a government which is of the people, by the people, for the people.”Tun’s surprise statement not only drew applause but commendations from speaker after speaker at the assembly meeting including ambassadors representing the European Union, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the new U.S. ambassador, Linda Thomas Greenfield, who joined others in calling it “courageous.”She said the United States “stands in solidarity” with the people of Myanmar who are in the streets protesting the coup and reiterated President Joe Biden’s warning that “we will show the military their actions have consequences” and his appeal to the military “to immediately relinquish power.”The assembly meeting was called to hear a briefing from the U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, who said it is time to “sound the alarm” about the coup, ongoing violations of the constitution and reversal of reforms instituted by Suu Kyi, who was previously the de facto head of government.She pointed to restrictions on internet and communication services, the detention of about 700 people according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners in Myanmar.The huge protests in the country are not about a fight between Suu Kyi’s party and the military, she said, “it is a people’s fight without arms.”Addressing diplomats in the General Assembly chamber by video link, Schraner Burgener urged “all of you to collectively send a clear signal in support of democracy in Myanmar.”The Feb. 1 military takeover in Myanmar shocked the international community and reversed years of slow progress toward democracy. Suu Kyi’s party would have been installed for a second five-year term that day, but the army blocked Parliament from convening and detained her, President Win Myint and other top members of her government.Myanmar’s military says it took power because last November’s election was marked by widespread voting irregularities, an assertion that was refuted by the state election commission, whose members have since been replaced by the ruling junta. The junta has said it will rule for a year under a state of emergency and then hold new polls.Schraner Burgener told the General Assembly that “democratically elected representatives were able to be sworn in according to the constitution on Feb. 4 and have formed the Committee Representing Pyidaungu Hluttaw known as CRPH" and are seeking “to uphold their obligations to serve the people who voted for them.”Tun, the Myanmar ambassador, began his remarks to the assembly by reading a statement from CRPH stressing the legitimacy of the election results, declaring that the military overthrew the democratically elected government, citing the massive opposition by the people, and stressing that “now is not the time for the international community to tolerate crimes of the military” and the coup.“We ask the international community to take action,” the parliamentarians’ statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-un-envoy-dramatically-opposes-coup-in-his-country-101614363319541.html
26-02-2021||World||EU medicines regulator approves Regeneron Covid-19 therapy||Europe's medicines regulator on Friday provisionally approved use of US biotech firm Regeneron's Covid-19 therapy, saying it prevented patients with from getting worse.Regeneron's synthetic antibody treatment was used to treat former US President Donald Trump after he contracted coronavirus last year.The European Medicines Agency said preliminary results showed treatment with REGN-COV2 reduced the amount of the virus in the back of the nose and throat and led to fewer medical visits."The Agency concluded that... REGN-COV2 can be used for the treatment of confirmed Covid-19 in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at high risk of progressing to severe Covid-19," it said in a statement.REGN-COV2 is a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab, two monoclonal antibodies which is given to a patient via a drip, the EMA said.Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made versions of the body's natural infection-fighting defenses.The two antibodies have been designed to attach to the spike protein of the coronavirus at two different sites, stopping it from entering the body's cells, the EMA said.A rolling review of the two antibodies, which started on February 1 "was ongoing", the medicines regulator said, adding "once finalised it will be the basis for an EU marketing authorisation for this combination".The US-based Food and Drug Administration in November approved emergency use of REGN-COV2, experimentally used to treat Trump.On Thursday, France too announced it had distributed thousands of monoclonal antibody treatments to hospitals, with Health Minister Olivier Veran saying "there are new hopes... which strengthen our anti-Covid arsenal".The EMA however did not make an announcement Friday on the approval of Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus jab, which earlier this month applied for authorisation within the European Union.So far, three vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca have been approved by the EMA.A US panel of independent experts were meeting Friday to discuss whether to grant J&J's covid shot the go-ahead in the United States.Friday's announcements followed the Amsterdam-based EMA's monthly meeting, where it also recommended the approval of six other medicines including the first oral treatment for patients with certain types of spinal muscular atrophy.This rare and often fatal genetic disease causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-medicines-regulator-approves-regeneron-covid-19-therapy-101614361313426.html

In the United States, the effectiveness was 74% at 14 days and 72% two weeks later, while the shot was 64% effective at stopping moderate-to-severe Covid-19 after 28 days in South Africa, where a worrying new variant has swept across the country.The vaccine was 100% effective at preventing hospitalizations 28 days after vaccination and there were no Covid-19 deaths among those who received the shot."In the context of the pandemic, the FDA is likely to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) based on the data," said UBS analyst Navin Jacob ahead of the panel meeting.The J&J vaccine can be stored in normal refrigerator temperatures, making distribution easier than that of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc vaccines that use mRNA technology and must be shipped and stored frozen.J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response.Three to four million doses of the vaccine are expected to be rolled out next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-advisory-panel-to-review-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-with-thumbs-up-expected-101614360807133.html

JPMorgan has about 255,000 workers.Staff at Bank of America will have the option to use two half days, for up to four hours each, for vaccination appointments this year, the bank said Friday in a staff memo seen by Bloomberg. The policy is designed to accommodate the two-dose regimen current vaccines require.Bank of America’s time-off benefit is part of an effort “to help address the impacts of the coronavirus and to support the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our teammates,” the lender, which has roughly 212,500 employees, said in the memo. A bank spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo.Other companies have offered similar perks. Allstate Corp., one of the largest publicly traded US auto insurers, said it will provide paid time off for employees to get the vaccine during working hours. Bank of Montreal said earlier this month it was offering staff three hours, and will also cover some of the costs associated with getting the shots.PayPal Holdings Inc. said Friday it committed $5 million to pay for free or discounted rides by Uber Technologies Inc. to get people to vaccine appointments. PayPal said it was responding to a call by President Joe Biden’s administration for corporations to help support vaccination efforts.“Nobody should miss their shot at getting vaccinated because they lack transportation,” Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said in December it would extend pandemic benefits for employees who need child- or adult-care services, offering reimbursements for caregiver costs and boosting the number of days workers can use backup facilities or in-home care this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bank-of-america-gives-paid-time-off-for-us-staff-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-101614359509743.html
26-02-2021||World||Biden administration to promote vaccination with businesses||The Biden administration announced a partnership Friday with national business groups to urge the private sector to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and encourage vaccinations.The White House will partner with the US Chamber of Commerce; leaders of the Black, Latino and Asian business community; the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers on the efforts, White House adviser Andy Slavitt announced in a briefing.The campaign will urge businesses across the US to require masks and social distancing, to reduce barriers to vaccinations and to offer paid time off and bonuses for employees who get vaccinated, Slavitt said. The administration also will encourage businesses to advocate for the benefits of masks and vaccines.Actions by major companies include Walgreens, PayPal, Lyft and Uber offering free or discounted rides to vaccination sites. Firms such as Ford and Gap are donating masks.Best Buy and Dollar General will offer more than a half million workers paid time off or compensation for vaccination. Sports leagues and the live-events industry have offered more than 100 stadiums and venues available as vaccination sites. The government is making clear to corporations where the needs are but is not directing them, Slavitt said.The National Football League is offering its stadiums for use as mass vaccination sites, Brian McCarthy, vice president of communications at the NFL said. Ten of the stadiums are active vaccination sites, including the Mercedes-Benz stadium in Atlanta and the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.The partnership will include the debut in coming weeks of a public education campaign to promote vaccination, a spokeswoman for the Business Roundtable said.The National Association of Manufacturers announced a project to promote vaccination among 12 million workers in the manufacturing community, which has a higher rate of vaccine hesitancy than the general population.“We’re resolute in our determination to finish this fight,” said Jay Timmons, president and chief executive officer of the association, in a statement.The administration hopes to reach hundreds of thousands of businesses -- representing more than 100 million people -- to promote these efforts.“Through these partner organizations, step-by-step resources to help businesses operate safely will be available,” Slavitt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-promote-vaccination-with-businesses-101614359604045.html
26-02-2021||World||Biden team looking to stop Saudi arms deals that help it attack others||After pausing half a billion dollars in arms deals with Saudi Arabia out of concern over casualties in Yemen, President Joe Biden's administration may shift US policy not only to cancel past deals that pose human rights concerns, but limit future military sales to "defensive" weapons.Four sources familiar with the administration's thinking said officials are assessing the array of military equipment and training included in sales to the Saudis to determine what can be considered defensive. Those deals would be allowed.A State Department spokesperson said, "Our focus is on ending the conflict in Yemen even as we ensure Saudi Arabia has everything it needs to defend its territory and its people," adding Biden has pledged to end US military support for the military campaign against the Houthis.The Biden administration is recalibrating its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a country with which it has severe human rights concerns but which is also one of Washington's closest US allies."They're trying to figure out where do you draw the lines between offensive weapons and defensive stuff," said one congressional aide familiar with the issue, describing the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-team-looking-to-stop-saudi-arms-deals-that-help-it-attack-others-101614359486242.html
26-02-2021||World||Third US vaccine could raise question: Which Covid-19 shots are best?||The nation is poised to get a third vaccine against Covid-19, but because at first glance the Johnson & Johnson shot may not be seen as equal to other options, health officials are girding for the question: Which one is best?If cleared for emergency use, the J&J vaccine would offer a one-dose option that could help speed vaccinations, tamp down a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 people in the US and stay ahead of a mutating virus.“I think it’s going to be huge,” said Dr. Virginia Caine, director of the public health department in Marion County, Indiana, which includes Indianapolis. She expects the easier-to-use vaccine will give local officials more flexibility for mobile vaccination clinics or pop-up events.The challenge will be explaining how protective the J&J shot is after the astounding success of the first US vaccines.Two doses of the Pfizer and Moderna shots were found to be about 95% effective against symptomatic Covid-19. The numbers from J&J’s study are not that high, but it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. One dose of the J&J vaccine was 85% protective against the most severe Covid-19. After adding in moderate cases, the total effectiveness dropped to about 66%.“I don’t think it’s a second-tier vaccine, but we’ve got to avoid that perception,” said Dr. Thomas Balcezak of Yale New Haven Health System.The J&J shot was tested in the US, Latin America and South Africa at a time when more contagious mutated versions of the virus were spreading. That wasn’t the case last fall, when Pfizer and Moderna were wrapping up testing, and it’s not clear if their numbers would hold against the most worrisome of those variants.Importantly, the Food and Drug Administration reported this week that, just like its predecessors, the J&J shot offers strong protection against the worst outcomes. By 28 days after the injection, there were no hospitalizations or deaths in study volunteers given the J&J shot, compared with 16 hospitalizations and seven deaths in those given a dummy shot.Independent advisers to the FDA began daylong discussions Friday on whether to allow widespread use of J&J’s vaccine, setting the stage for a final decision within days.Despite declining cases, hospitalizations and deaths, government scientists warned that circulating variants could slow progress against the pandemic.“We are not out of the woods yet,” said Adam MacNeil of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.If the J&J vaccine is authorized, US officials expect to have only a few million doses to divide between states in initial shipments. But by the end of March, J&J has said it can supply enough to vaccinate 20 million people — a much-needed boost to stretched supplies.The bottom line: “Whatever vaccine is being offered is what you want,” said University of Pennsylvania immunologist E. John Wherry.Still, the nuances of the vaccines raise ethical questions.At Yale, Balcezak is struggling with how to make the best use of the J&J shot's advantages without appearing to target it to underserved populations. For example, it’s a logical choice for homeless shelters where people may have moved on before their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.“I’m very worried about how that would be perceived,” Balcezak said.The J&J vaccine is also easier to handle, lasting three months in the refrigerator compared to the Pfizer and Moderna options, which must be frozen.Balcezak said the Yale system has been working with pastors and other “cultural ambassadors” to answer vaccine questions from minority communities, and likewise will discuss the J&J shot's possibilities.In Washington state, health officials see some clear need for one-and-done vaccinations — including sailors in the maritime industry, who can spend months on cargo and fishing vessels.“This is the ideal vaccine for them,” said Dr. Scott Lindquist of the Washington State Department of Health. With the two-dose vaccines, the state “had to send second doses onward to the next port of call.”Other parts of the world already are facing which-is-best challenges. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, for instance, is cleared for use in Britain and Europe after data suggested it was about 70% effective.Italy’s government recently decided to reserve Pfizer and Moderna shots for the elderly and designate the AstraZeneca vaccine for younger, at-risk workers, sparking protest from the country’s main teachers’ union. Canada became the latest country Friday to allow use of AstraZeneca's vaccine.In the US, health officials say it's critical for the government to send a clear message.“Right now, it’s not vaccine against vaccine, it’s vaccine against virus,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-us-vaccine-could-raise-question-which-covid-19-shots-are-best-101614356398255.html
26-02-2021||World||US justice department pledges to probe, as attacks on Asian Americans increase||The US Justice Department said on Friday it would investigate the rising tide of hate crimes in America, as Asian Americans have experienced a growing number of racially motivated attacks since former President Donald Trump began referring to Covid-19 as a "China virus."“The United States is currently facing unprecedented challenges, some of which are fueling increased bigotry and hatred," said Pamela Karlan, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.She added that her office is working with the FBI, federal prosecutors and local police to "evaluate possible hate crimes," without providing further details.A Justice Department official told Reuters the statement was a direct response to the increasing reports of violence against Asian Americans.From March of 2020 to December of last year, there were more than 2,800 reported incidents of anti-Asian hate incidents in the United States, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that has been collecting data.While verbal harassment has made up more than 70 per cent of the incidents, more than 8 per cent involved physical assaults.In one such example, a surveillance video that has since gone viral showed a 91-year-old Asian man in Oakland, California, being shoved to the ground on Jan. 31.A suspect in the attack was later arrested, and now faces multiple assault charges for a number of Chinatown incidents. Prosecutors are also investigating whether the attacks were racially motivated.Another high-profile example includes the January murder of Vichar Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old immigrant from Thailand who was shoved to the ground in San Francisco and never regained consciousness after the fall.San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin has since charged a suspect in Ratanapakdee's death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-department-pledges-to-probe-as-attacks-on-asian-americans-increase-101614356449691.html

Apart from the date for calling on the meeting of house, other agendas related to ministries were also discussed," Shivamaya Tumbahangphe, Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation told ANI.The meeting comes after the Nepal Supreme Court had reinstated the House of Representatives (HoR) and directed the government to summon a session of the country's Lower House of Parliament within 13 days.The country's top court also decided to cancel all decisions that the incumbent Oli government took after December 20, the day when the House of Representatives was dissolved.The SC deemed Oli's move to dissolve the House as "unconstitutional", thereby overturning the decision, according to The Himalayan Times.As many as 13 writ petitions were filed in the apex court against the Oli-government's move. The court had earlier summoned all the writ petitioners for the final verdict, The Himalayan Times reported further.Kathmandu has been marred by anti-government protests on a daily basis which has been growing significantly over the period of time starting from December 20 when Oli dissolved the parliament.This move by Oli which has been called unconstitutional and challenged in court has split the ruling party and led to the expulsion of now caretaker PM from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-cabinet-recommends-president-to-call-meeting-of-reinstated-lower-house-101614354973495.html
26-02-2021||World||Caribbean countries ask wealthy nations to share vaccine supply||The 15-country Caribbean Community has asked wealthy nations to share their supply of Covid-19 vaccines, saying their economies won’t be able to recover from the pandemic without them.In a statement issued late Thursday, CARICOM said it was “dissatisfied and deeply concerned about the inequitable access to vaccines” it was facing.While members states belong to the World Health Organizations’ COVAX Facility, the only vaccines received so far have been 170,000 shots that the government of India donated to Dominica and Barbados, the group said. Those two nations have been sharing their supply with other CARICOM members.Even with the addition of the COVAX vaccines, CARICOM will only be able to cover about 20% of its needs, the group said. Some members have also been trying to broker deals through the African Union’s Medical Supplies Platform.In a not-so subtle reference to the U.S. and Europe, CARICOM said that nations that drive tourism in the Caribbean -- and host the Caribbean diaspora -- should share their shots “given the immediacy of the need.”CARICOM members include some of the most tourism-dependent nations on the planet, including Barbados, Belize and Saint Lucia, and access to vaccines is seen as vital to reopening their economies.“This limited supply will not allow us to attain the regional herd immunity, so necessary to fuel the resilient recovery that we are seeking,” CARICOM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/caribbean-countries-ask-wealthy-nations-to-share-vaccine-supply-101614354087515.html
26-02-2021||World||US conducts first military operation under Biden, hits Iran-backed groups in Syria||In the first military action conducted under President Joe Biden, the US on Thursday carried out airstrikes against Iran-backed militant groups in eastern Syria in retaliation for recent attacks on American and coalition personnel in Iraq.“At President Joe Biden’s direction, US military forces, earlier this evening, launched airstrikes against infrastructure utilised by Iranian-backed militant groups in eastern Syria,” John Kirby, the US defence department spokesperson, said in a statement. He added that the strikes had “destroyed multiple facilities located at a border control point used by a number of Iranian-backed militant groups including Kait’ib Hezbollah and Kait’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (which had previously claimed responsibility for attacks on US forces)”. The US had not released any casualty figures or estimates. But a war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, has said 22 members of the militant groups were killed and the toll could climb because some of the others had suffered severe injuries.Kirby said the US military operation was in response to “recent attacks against American and coalition personnel in Iraq” and was “proportionate”, and conducted alongside diplomatic measure, including consultations with coalition partners.A civilian contractor with the US-led military coalition was killed and a US service personnel was among six people injured in a rocket attack on an airport in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, last week. US troops have a military facility adjacent to the airport.A pro-Iran militant group that calls itself “Saraya Awliya Al-Dam” had claimed responsibility. Other Iran-backed groups have carried out attacks on US personnel and facilities in the past, as tensions have escalated in the region between US and Iranian forces directly and with Iran’s proxies.Analysts had called the Erbil attack as an early test for the Biden administration’s foreign policy in the region, specially as it seeks to re-engage with Iran on the 2015 nuclear deal — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — that the US had left under former President Donald Trump.Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote at the time in an article in Politico that President Biden is “squarely in the middle of a major foreign policy test as president, and while it has gone largely unremarked inside the US, the Middle East is watching closely to see how he responds to an attack on US forces”.Biden responded with airstrikes. Kirby said the US military operation sends “an unambiguous message: President Biden will act to protect American and Coalition personnel. At the same time, we have acted in a deliberate manner that aims to de-escalate the overall situation in both eastern Syria and Iraq”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-conducts-first-military-operation-under-biden-hits-iran-backed-groups-in-syria-101614355619802.html
26-02-2021||World||Half a million US chicks euthanised after storm hits Texas||On top of power blackouts and burst water pipes, the disastrous snow and ice storm in Texas last week could mean higher chicken prices for Americans.The severe weather forced Sanderson Farms Inc., the third-biggest US chicken producer, to euthanize 545,000 baby chicks at hatcheries in the state. Over 700,000 eggs were also destroyed. That means fewer pounds of chicken reaching grocery stores in the coming months.The chicken struggles add to increasing costs to feed the animals, a signal that consumers likely will be paying more for poultry just as a nascent economic recovery boosts meat sales.“It’s definitely going to take some production out away from us,” Chief Executive Officer Joe Sanderson said Thursday in an investor call, adding that the loss equals about 1% of the company’s output.While it’s unclear how many chicken producers experienced losses, even small percentage changes in supply can move the market, and prices have already been gaining.Shares for the company climbed as much as 4.5% after it reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings of 42 cents a share, beating the average estimate of analysts for a 49-cent loss and a $1.76 loss a year ago. Shares have climbed about 18% so far this year.Fast-food restaurants have been promoting new chicken sandwiches and other products, a strong point for meat producers. Prices for boneless chicken breast meat produced for restaurants moved “significantly higher” in January and February due to the trend, the CEO said.Meanwhile, Sanderson is balking at prices for grains that it needs to feed chickens. The company delayed purchases of some corn and soybean meal, which are the most expensive in six years due to China ramping up American imports. The Chinese buying is leaving fewer supplies for domestic feeders such as Sanderson, and the higher prices are eating away at profit margins.The company said it secured feed through March. The full impact of pricier feed will be felt in the coming months, the company said. In the meantime, they’re raising prices to offset the added costs.Right now, “the price on poultry products is taking care of that higher feed cost,” the CEO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-a-million-us-chicks-euthanised-after-storm-hits-texas-101614352377328.html

It has signed an agreement for delivery of COVAXIN during Q2 (April to June) and Q3 (July to September) (of) 2021," the company said in a statement.It added, "There is a strong interest in Covaxin from many countries around the world, and the company is fully committed to ensuring supplies promptly and efficiently."In January, India dispatched two million doses of Covishield vaccines to Brazil. Covishield has been developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and is being manufactured by Serum Institute of India.Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi by saying "dhanyavaad" for supplying the "sanjeevni booti" (the vaccine) against the coronavirus to the South American country, which has reported the second-highest death toll from the Covid-19 disease in the world.Earlier, the Brazilian President said that it was an honour to have India as a "great partner" against the "global obstacle.""Namaskar, Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) @narendramodi. Brazil feels honoured to have a great partner to overcome a global obstacle by joining efforts," Bolsonaro wrote in a tweet."Thank you for assisting us with the vaccines exports from India to Brazil.

Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said that the total includes, 67.5 lakh doses supplied under grant assistance 294.44 lakh doses under various commercial contracts."We will continue to supply these vaccines in the coming weeks and months in a phased manner," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bharat-biotech-confirms-deal-with-brazil-for-20-million-doses-of-covaxin-101614351190269.html
26-02-2021||World||US judge in Google case disturbed that even ‘Incognito’ users are tracked||When Google users browse in “Incognito” mode, just how hidden is their activity? The Alphabet Inc. unit says activating the stealth mode in Chrome, or “private browsing” in other browsers, means the company won’t “remember your activity.” But a judge with a history of taking Silicon Valley giants to task about their data collection raised doubts Thursday about whether Google is being as forthright as it needs to be about the personal information it’s collecting from users. At a hearing Thursday in San Jose, California, US District Judge Lucy Koh said she’s “disturbed” by Google’s data collection practices as described in a class-action lawsuit that says the company’s private browsing promises is a “ruse.” The suit seeks $5,000 in damages for each of the millions of people whose privacy has been compromised since June of 2016.Weighing Google’s attempt to get the suit dismissed, Koh said she finds it “unusual” that the company would make the “extra effort” of data collection if it doesn’t use the information to build user profiles or targeted advertising. Google has become a target of antitrust complaints in the last year filed by state and federal officials -- as well as businesses -- accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising and online search. Koh has a deeper history with the company as a vocal critic of its privacy policies. She forced Google in one notable case to disclose its scanning of emails to build profiles and target advertising.In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.Company DisclosureGoogle argues that every time people use Chrome’s private browsing mode, a full-page notice makes clear that other people who use the device won’t see their activity -- but that it may still be visible to, among others, websites they visit and their internet service provider. Andrew Schapiro, a lawyer for Google, said the company’s privacy policy “expressly discloses” its practices. “The data collection at issue is disclosed,” he said. Another lawyer for Google, Stephen Broome, said website owners who contract with the company to use its analytics or other services are well aware of the data collection described in the suit.Broome’s attempt to downplay the privacy concerns by pointing out that the federal court system’s own website uses Google services ended up backfiring.The judge demanded an explanation “about what exactly Google does,” while voicing concern that visitors to the court’s website are unwittingly disclosing information to the company.“I want a declaration from Google on what information they’re collecting on users to the court’s website, and what that’s used for,” Koh told the company’s lawyers. The case is Brown v. Google, 20-cv-03664, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-in-google-case-disturbed-that-even-incognito-users-are-tracked-101614351668367.html
26-02-2021||World||Farmers' protest shows need for laws in sync with stakeholders: UN rights chief||The continuing farmers’ protests in India against three farm laws highlight the importance of ensuring that legislations are based on meaningful consultations with stakeholders, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Friday.Bachelet made the remarks while updating the ongoing session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva on human rights issues in more than 50 countries. The UN human rights agency had earlier this month called on both protesting farmers and authorities to exercise “maximum restraint” and find “equitable solutions”.The UN high commissioner for human rights was also critical of action taken by Indian authorities against journalists covering the protests and efforts to curb freedom of expression on social media. She also said UNHRC was monitoring the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, where restrictions on communications continued to be a concern.“In India, continued protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers highlight the importance of ensuring laws and policies are based on meaningful consultations with those concerned,” Bachelet said in her address.“I trust that ongoing dialogue efforts by both sides will lead to an equitable solution to this crisis that respects the rights of all,” she said.“Charges of sedition against journalists and activists for reporting or commenting on the protests, and attempts to curb freedom of expression on social media, are disturbing departures from essential human rights principles,” Bachelet added.The government’s handling of the farmers’ protest, which began on November 26 last year, has been criticised by celebrities, lawmakers and political leaders in several countries. The government has defended the three new laws as necessary for long overdue reforms in the agricultural sector. After several rounds of unsuccessful negotiations with the government, the unions backing the protest intensified their agitation by organising a tractor rally in the capital on January 26 that descended into violence and chaos.Bachelet said UNHRC is continuing to monitor the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, “where restrictions on communications, and clampdowns on civil society activists, remain of concern”. She added, “Despite recent restoration of 4G access for mobile phones, the communications blockade has seriously hampered civic participation, as well as business, livelihoods, education, and access to healthcare and medical information.”Raids against human rights defenders in October and November “exemplify the continued restrictions on civil society”, and have an impact on the rights of Kashmiri people to “impart and receive information, and to engage in free, open debate on government policies affecting them”, she said.Bachelet also described internet access in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as a “serious problem” that had prompted student protests in the past year.She, however, lauded a pilot programme in Kerala, where officials, civil society organisations and community leaders have used innovative technology to ensure that the “voices of marginalised and poor people are heard, and their needs addressed, in the pandemic response”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Bachelet’s remarks.Turning to Pakistan, Bachelet said the unequal status of women continues to lead to “widespread denial of their rights, from education to the right to make decisions about their own lives; excessive maternal mortality; poverty, and high levels of violence and sexual violence against women and girls”.Last year, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) found “persistent discriminatory stereotypes" and expressed concern at the prevalence of child marriage and forced marriage, as well as so-called “honour” crimes, in Pakistan.“Women from religious minority communities are particularly vulnerable to forced marriage accompanied by forced conversion. I urge Pakistan to support and protect women human rights defenders and journalists who are at the forefront of efforts to promote legal and societal change,” she said.While China has made strong progress over the past year in reducing prevalence of Covid-19 and its severe impact on a broad range of human rights, fundamental rights and civic freedoms continue to be curtailed in the name of national security and the pandemic response, Bachelet said.“Activists, lawyers and human rights defenders – as well as some foreign nationals – face arbitrary criminal charges, detention or unfair trials. In the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, more than 600 people are being investigated for participating in various forms of protests – some under the new National Security Law,” she said.In Xinjiang, information in the public domain shows the need for “independent and comprehensive assessment of the human rights situation” and the high commissioner’s office continues to assess alleged patterns of human rights violations, including reports of arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and sexual violence in institutions, coercive labour practises, and erosion of social and cultural rights, she said.“I am confident that through our ongoing dialogue we will find mutually agreeable parameters for my visit to China,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-protest-shows-need-for-laws-in-sync-with-stakeholders-un-rights-chief-101614349607939.html
26-02-2021||World||Former Spanish king pays 4.4 million euros to tax agency||A law firm representing Juan Carlos I says that the former Spanish monarch has paid close to 4.4 million euros ($5.33 million) to the country's tax authorities in his latest attempt to regularize past undeclared income.The revelation prompted a new rebuke to the 83-year-old former king from the country's prime minister. Pedro Sánchez said Friday that he rejected the "uncivil behavior" of Juan Carlos, but fully supported the current monarch, King Felipe VI.The former monarch, who has been living abroad for more than half a year after media revealed fresh allegations of financial misdeeds, already filed for settlement for another tax debt in December for covert donations made to him between 2016 and 2018. That resulted in the payment of more than 678,000 euros including interest and a fine.Juan Carlos' lawyer, Javier Sánchez-Junco, said in a statement Friday that the latest tax debt relates to the payments that a private foundation, Zagatka, made on behalf of the former king for “several travel expenses and other services."The Liechtenstein-based foundation is owned by Álvaro de Orleans, a businessman and distant cousin of Juan Carlos who has publicly admitted having funded some of the former monarch's private expenses. Payments-in-kind are subject to taxes under Spanish law.Leading Spanish newspaper El País and online news website El Español, which first reported the new tax settlement, said that the foundation paid for flights with a private jet company for more than a decade up to 2018.The lawyer's statement said that the payment of overdue taxes plus interests and “surcharges” was voluntary and that tax authorities had not asked for it. The former monarch's tax obligations “have been regularized," it said. Under Spanish law, confessing to undeclared income and paying the outstanding taxes allows offenders to avoid being charged with tax evasion.The former king is the target of official investigations in Spain and Switzerland for possible financial wrongdoing. One of them involves possible kickbacks in a high-speed railway contract in Saudi Arabia.Those investigations prompted him to leave Spain in August for the United Arab Emirates. He has been photographed there in a luxurious hotel where Spanish media say he's living as a guest of Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed.The Royal Palace declined to comment on the new developments. King Felipe VI, who rose to the Spanish throne after Juan Carlos’ abdication in 2014, has distanced himself from his father.Felipe and Tax Minister María Jesús Montero avoided any comments on the latest development when both attended a previously scheduled business award ceremony Friday.Speaking to reporters at the government palace, Prime Minister Sánchez said Friday that Felipe's reign had been “a turning point in favor of exemplarity, transparency and proper use of public resources."“The current king,” the prime minister said, “has all my support.”But Juan Carlos’ scandals have emboldened those who want the monarchy abolished and deepened division in Sánchez's Socialist-led government. His junior coalition partner, the far-left United We Can party, has called for legal changes to improve the state’s oversight of the crown and on Friday demanded full disclosure of the tax agency's dealings with the former king.Sánchez admitted that the revelations cast a shadow on Juan Carlos himself but didn't question the monarchy as an institution.“I am going to reject, as do most Spanish citizens, this uncivil behavior,” Sánchez said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-king-pays-4-4-million-euros-to-spanish-tax-agency-101614349246204.html

Singh represents the riding (constituency) of Burnaby South in Canada’s House of Commons.Under the banner of Concerned Citizens of Burnaby, BC, they gave a memorandum to Singh’s staff, calling upon him to monitor and analyse hate speech against Hindus across Canadian schools, institutions, workplaces, and social media; address the root causes of “hate against Hindus arising from the Khalistani movement”; engage and support victims of hate speech and mitigate the current situation; mediate and build coalitions between Sikh and Hindu groups and protect and support the Hindus of Canada and stop these hateful attacks against them. Members of the community in Canada have in recent weeks reported multiple incidents of threats and intimidation of the Hindu community by pro-Khalistan elements.“Khalistan-supporting organisations are working under the pretext of the farmers’ rights movement in India. The discourse against the Indian government is being weaponised for political gain with incendiary rhetoric that stigmatises and dehumanises Hindus in Canada,” the protesters said in their memorandum to Singh. “Your silence can signal indifference to bigotry and intolerance, even as the situation escalates and vulnerable Hindus become victims to violence.” Organisers of a recent Tiranga rally in Vancouver had faced threats and even protest by those carrying Khalistan flags.One of the protestors standing in front Singh’s office said, “We are not against the farmers’ movement, but this movement has now turned into a Khalistani movement, which is targeting Hindu visible minorities and we expect our leaders to protect everyone without any racial discrimination.”Singh has been among the most vocal Canadian politicians in supporting those protesting the Indian farm laws. He recently appeared on the talk show A Little Late with Lilly Singh and discussed the issue. On January 29, after the events on Republic Day in New Delhi, Singh tweeted, “I am deeply concerned about the violence against farmers in India. Those calling to harm farmers must be held accountable and the right to peaceful protest must be protected I am calling on (Canadian Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau to condemn the violence, immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadians-protest-attacks-over-stance-on-india-s-farm-reforms-101614348719182.html

Purchases increased 2.4% from the prior month, following a downwardly revised 0.4% decline in December.The surge in incomes, and expectations of even more stimulus, is seen providing additional fuel for consumers at a time of pent-up demand in the wake of pandemic-related disruptions to the service economy.The January increase reflects the $900 billion pandemic aid package passed in December. The bill provided direct checks to millions of Americans and supplemented jobless benefits with an extra $300 a week payment. While many have saved the government support, the robust increase in spending shows others are spending it.Lawmakers are moving forward with President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion aid plan that has the potential to drive even more income growth. Another round of stimulus checks paired with a child tax credit and an increase in weekly unemployment benefit payments would buoy disposable income in the coming months.The personal saving rate rose to 20.5%, the highest since May.Government transfer payments rose 52% in January from the prior month, reflecting both stimulus checks and the supplemental $300 weekly jobless benefit payments.Inflation-adjusted personal spending rose 2% after a 0.8% decline. Goods spending jumped 5.1%, while outlays for services advanced 0.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soaring-us-incomes-help-drive-biggest-spending-gain-since-june-101614347718427.html

26-02-2021||World||Two rights groups quit Hong Kong as security law sends shudders through NGOs||At least two political rights groups advocating democracy have quietly quit Hong Kong and moved overseas, unnerved by a national security law that has fanned fears over the erosion of freedoms under China’s rule, sources told Reuters.In the past, China-focused rights groups had valued the wide-ranging autonomy, including freedom of speech and assembly, guaranteed for Hong Kong when control over the former British colony was returned to Beijing in 1997.But some non-government organisations (NGOs) say the new legislation means they face a choice of either having to leave Hong Kong or work with the same kind of fears and constraints they would encounter in mainland China.The New School for Democracy moved to Taiwan in September, two months after Beijing imposed the contentious security law on its freest city. Founded by Wang Dan, an exiled student leader of the crushed 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the group focuses on bringing together activists from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in order to promote democracy in Chinese society."Our organisation often criticises the Chinese government, and we participate in Hong Kong's democracy fight," Xing Zhong, the group's secretary-general, told Reuters. "We were quite concerned about the safety of our staff."Another reason the NGO has moved, according to a source with direct knowledge, is that the NGO receives sizable funding from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a Washington-based group that pro-Beijing newspapers Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao often label as a subversive agency.Wang declined to say whether his group received funding from NED, but said the authorities could now bar groups like his from having access to funds."Bank accounts opened by NGOs in Hong Kong banks are in danger of being frozen at any moment," Wang said, noting that authorities in Hong Kong had blocked the accounts of leading pro-democracy activists."That is why I believe that Hong Kong today is no longer suitable for the existence and activities of NGOs."The Hong Kong government said concerns over the "erosion of freedoms" under the national security law were totally "unsubstantiated and unwarranted."Under the broadly-defined security legislation, crimes such as subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorism can be punished with up to life in jail.Since the law was implemented in June, scores of pro-democracy activists have been arrested, legislators disqualified and books removed from library shelves as part of a sweeping crackdown on dissent.ARTICLE 54Concerns over funding for NGOs have also intensified.Global Innovation Hub, a unit of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, a German think-tank that was expelled from China in 1997, also moved to Taiwan in September, citing safety concerns for staff.The group, which promotes liberal democratic values without being specifically focused on China, has close ties to Germany's Free Democratic Party, and feared that it could have been considered a "foreign agent" under the new security law.Anna Marti, the head of Global Innovation Hub, told Reuters that Taiwan was now the best place in the region for the group to work on topics such as the digitalisation of democracy.Marti said the national security law had weakened a confidentiality "firewall" that had previously protected staff.Some groups have switched to more secure forms of communication such as encrypted messaging platforms like ProtonMail and Signal, while also enhancing their cyber security protocols, according to NGO staffers.Article 54 of the law authorises the national security bureau in Hong Kong "to strengthen the management of and services" of NGOs, a vague clause that critics say mirrors legislation introduced by Beijing in 2017 to give authorities more power to regulate the activities of foreign NGOs in the mainland."That's worrying," commented an independent human rights researcher who declined to be named, saying it could "effectively silence many NGOs" fearful of criticising the government.Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have become more cautious about signing joint statements, vetting their words carefully to avoid risks, 10 sources within Hong Kong's NGO community told Reuters.Roseann Rife, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Operations, said the group had no intention of leaving Hong Kong, while noting the extra risk stemming from the new legislation."The national security law defines its offences very imprecisely," Rife said. "And it is therefore difficult to have legal certainty about how one might be violating it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-rights-groups-quit-hong-kong-as-security-law-sends-shudders-through-ngos-101614344949287.html
26-02-2021||World||Climate pledges for 2030 put world far off 1.5 degree Celsius goal, warns UN||Updated plans to reduce emissions, submitted so far by about 75 nations ahead of November's COP26 summit, barely make a dent in the huge cuts needed to meet global climate goals, the UN climate chief said on Friday, calling for redoubled efforts.A UN report summarising the revised climate action plans - covering about 40% of countries in the 2015 Paris Agreement and 30% of planet-heating emissions - said they would deliver a combined emissions reduction of only 0.5% from 2010 levels by 2030."That simply is not good enough," said Patricia Espinosa, urging governments - including those that have already updated their plans - to come up with larger promised cuts before COP26.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said global emissions must fall by about 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels to give the world a good chance of limiting the rise in average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.Under the Paris accord, nearly 200 countries pledged to keep warming to "well below" 2C, and strive for a ceiling of 1.5C.So far, the planet has heated up by about 1.2C, bringing worsening extreme weather and rising seas.Espinosa said the synthesis report made clear "current levels of climate ambition are very far from putting nations on a pathway" to meet the 1.5C goal."It is incredible to think that just when nations are facing a (climate) emergency that could eventually end human life on this planet ... many are sticking to their business-as-usual approach," she told journalists.But if governments invest trillions of dollars in planned spending to revive their economies from Covid-19 on green, climate-resilient measures, "we stand a chance of changing the trajectory," she added.Espinosa emphasised that the report released on Friday was just a "snapshot" of climate action plans to date and another more complete assessment would be compiled before COP26.Many countries missed a 2020 deadline to submit stronger climate action plans because of disruption caused by the pandemic, with the COP26 summit in Glasgow postponed for a year.The 75 countries that did submit revised plans on time include COP26 host Britain and the 27 member states of the European Union, which are covered by one EU-wide plan.PRESSURE GROWINGChile's Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, who presided over the COP25 summit in Madrid in 2019, said the report "clearly indicated that significant work must be done, in particular by major emitters".Only two of the 18 largest emitters - Britain and the European Union - had so far presented an updated "nationally determined contribution" (NDC) containing a "strong increase" in their emissions reduction targets, she noted."Other major emitters either submitted NDCs presenting a very low increase in their ambition level or have not presented NDCs yet," she added in a statement.Niklas Höhne, who set up a tracker for national climate policies as a founding partner of the NewClimate Institute, said countries that had not boosted ambition in their new plans could be described as "violating the spirit of the Paris Agreement".The accord calls on governments to voluntarily deliver more ambitious climate plans every five years, starting in 2020.But the updated NDCs of Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and Vietnam fail that test, according to Climate Action Tracker, which is separate from the UN research report."It is a very, very small change that has happened so far, in comparison to the huge gap there is," Höhne said.The United States is due to announce its much-anticipated new 2030 emissions reduction target before a world leaders' climate summit hosted by President Joe Biden on April 22.Experts say China and India could announce new goals there too, and Japan plans to increase its 2030 target before COP26.Helen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, noted that more than half of G20 nations had now made commitments for net-zero emissions by mid-century but few had set 2030 interim targets in line with that.Those that did set bold targets last year - including Colombia, Argentina, Britain and the European Union - were now being overshadowed by those falling behind, she said."These laggards must stop fiddling while the world burns. It is in the interest of their own people and their economies to address the climate crisis, which knows no boundaries," she said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Friday's report "a red alert for our planet" and urged major climate-polluting countries to offer "much more ambitious" 2030 emissions reduction targets well before COP26."Long-term commitments must be matched by immediate actions to launch the decade of transformation that people and planet so desperately need," he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-pledges-for-2030-put-world-far-off-1-5-degree-celcius-goal-warns-un-101614344932198.html

China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.China hit back at the forum on Wednesday at growing criticism by Western powers of its treatment of ethnic minorities in the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet and of citizens in Hong Kong."I am confident that through our ongoing dialogue we will find mutually agreeable parameters for my visit to China," Bachelet said about negotiations with Beijing on the terms of a visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-chief-decries-violations-in-china-s-xinjiang-hopes-for-visit-101614342416245.html

The terms are similar to those in existing state-backed lending programs.The plan will replace Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans, its counterpart for large companies, CLBILS, and the fully state-backed Bounce Back Loans, which have lent a combined 73 billion pounds ($102 billion) to struggling companies. Sunak delivers the U.K. budget on March 3.The Treasury said in December that it was working on a successor to the current loans programs. It was keen to replace the Bounce Back Loans in particular, amid warnings that they’re susceptible to fraud. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said in December that taxpayers could be on the hook for about 26 billion pounds of loans that may never be repaid because of fraud or because companies can’t afford to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sunak-to-unveil-new-covid-recovery-loans-for-uk-businesses-101614340653805.html
26-02-2021||World||Trump's hold on Republican Party on display as conservatives gather in Florida||Donald Trump's hold on the Republican Party will be on full display as an annual gathering of prominent US conservatives starts in earnest on Friday, with a key question being whether the former president will run again in four years.Prominent congressional conservatives including Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley, and Representatives Steve Scalise and Matt Gaetz are among the Trump loyalists expected to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, which Trump will address on Sunday.Trump's tumultuous final weeks in office saw his supporters launch a deadly attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to block Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory, a win that Trump falsely claimed was tainted by widespread fraud.A total of 17 members of his party in Congress voted to impeach or convict him for inciting insurrection, although the Senate vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict. Some prominent Republicans including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted Trump for his role in sparking the conflagration, but more members still voice support for him.Trump also faces legal challenges, with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office conducting a criminal investigation of his family-run Trump Organization.Some advisers say they want Trump not to use his speech to relitigate the election at length but instead offer a road map to Republicans' taking back control of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2022 congressional elections."Obviously he will talk about his belief that the election had major problems in it," said one Trump adviser. "However, I believe and I hope that he pivots to how we fight Biden’s socialist agenda for America and hope that it will be about the future, not the past."Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, told reporters in the Capitol that he expected Trump to talk about his policy achievements, the drawbacks of Biden’s approach to immigration and energy and to lay out a hopeful future for his "America First" agenda.Graham said he told Trump it "would be a big mistake" to focus on the past election. Asked whether he thought Trump would follow that advice, Graham responded: "We'll see."2024 Candidacy?Trump, 74, is expected to dangle the possibility of running for president again in 2024, a prospect that complicates life for other Republican presidential hopefuls including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Vice President Mike Pence.Pence, who was in the Capitol with his family when rioters stormed in chanting: "Hang Mike Pence!" is not expected to attend this year's CPAC.Trump had repeatedly said Pence had the power to stop the certification of the election results, even though he did not.CPAC is an event organized by the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, is close to Trump. It is a prime venue for speakers who want to gauge interest in whether they should run for president based on the enthusiasm they generate.The list of speakers on Friday includes Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another potential 2024 candidate.Many Republicans think Trump will flirt with another run to freeze the 2024 field but believe he will ultimately opt out of running. Trump himself has mused privately to advisers that he would like to run."I wouldn't expect him to announce anything definitive," said a second Trump adviser. "There’s a lot of wait and see right now among those who are mentioned as probable candidates. But I think they’re all smart enough to know that they have to wait and see. They know they can’t compete against the former president."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-hold-on-republican-party-on-display-as-conservatives-gather-in-florida-101614338204660.html

Britain, France and Germany notably struggled to keep it alive and have been heartened by President Joe Biden’s willingness to bring the US back in.“I am convinced as coordinator of the JCPOA that we do have diplomatic space, a diplomatic window of opportunity to dialogue” in line with Biden’s aims, Borrell said. “We need to use this opportunity and focus on solutions to bring the JCPOA back on track in order for everybody (to fulfil) their commitments.”Iran this week effectively set a deadline to lift the US sanctions within three months, after which it said it would erase surveillance footage of its nuclear facilities. It has also limited some monitoring of its activities, which the EU says are meant to help ensure that Tehran's nuclear work is peaceful.The UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has also reported that Iran has added 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 20% to its stockpile as of Feb. 16 — far past the 3.67% purity allowed under the JCPOA.Borrell said that Iran’s latest moves “are very much concerning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sees-must-not-miss-chance-to-revive-iran-nuclear-deal-101614332874211.html
26-02-2021||World||Chinese court backs publisher calling homosexuality 'psychological disorder'||A court in China's eastern Jiangsu province recently ruled in favour of a publisher that described homosexuality as a "psychological disorder" in a university textbook.According to a copy of the Feb. 9 appeal ruling seen by Reuters, Suyu District Intermediate Court in the city of Suqian said the description resulted from "perceptual differences" and was not a factual error, upholding a judgment made in September last year."I feel at a loss, because they didn't even have a trial, they just handed down the judgment," said the plaintiff, who uses the pseudonym XiXi.In 2017, XiXi had sued Jinan University Press and a company owned by retailer JD.com for publishing and distributing factually incorrect content in the 2013 book on mental health education for university students."The teaching material classifies homosexuality as a psychological disorder, which it isn't," the 24-year-old NGO worker said, adding that she only found out about the ruling on her appeal through her lawyer on Feb. 22."I'm really disappointed, because we are seeing comments that are supporting this judgment."Homosexuality was decategorised as a mental disorder by the Chinese Psychiatric Association in 2001."It's quite damaging to the whole LGBT community, so we are sorely disappointed," said Peng Yanzi, the director of LGBT Rights Advocacy China."I'm not the only one who is disappointed, shocked and angry - the whole LGBT community is - but we also very much admire XiXi because she's spent years legally pursuing this."Jinan University Press and JD.com did not immediately reply to emailed requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-backs-publisher-calling-homosexuality-psychological-disorder-101614334267207.html

"If a vital public interest makes it impossible for a case to be fairly heard, then the courts cannot ordinarily hear it."Begum's case has been the subject of a heated debate in Britain, pitting those who say she forsook her right to citizenship by travelling to join IS against those who argue she should not be left stateless but rather face trial in Britain.After travelling to Syria, she lived in Raqqa, the capital of the self-declared caliphate, where she remained for four years until she was discovered in a detention camp.She has had three children since leaving Britain, but all the infants have since died, and she is now in the Roj camp, run by Syrian Kurdish authorities, where the UN rights experts said this month conditions were "sub-human".Reed said Begum's appeal should be stayed until she was in a position to play an effective part in it without endangering the public."That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible. But there is no perfect solution to a dilemma of the present kind," he said.Human rights groups said Britain had a duty to bring back Begum and those like her, and prosecute them, rather than making it someone else's problem."Abandoning them in a legal black hole – in Guantanamo-like conditions – is out of step with British values and the interests of justice and security," said Maya Foa, director of campaign group Reprieve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-top-court-says-runaway-schoolgirl-who-joined-is-poses-security-risk-cannot-return-to-britain-101614333644553.html

Media quoted prominent Baluch Sunni Muslim religious leader Molavi Abdulhamid as urging calm and calling for an independent investigation."The body of at least one person was delivered by Pakistan’s border guards. We are reviewing the incident," Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh was quoted as saying by Iranian media.Protesters stormed a governor’s office in southeastern Iran on Tuesday and set fire to a police car, according to videos posted on social media. Security forces used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the footage.Sistan-Baluchistan’s population is predominantly Sunni Muslim, while most Iranians are Shi’ite.

They then boarded a rail trolley and pushed themselves for about a kilometer (half a mile) across the border into Russia.Photos posted by the ministry showed embassy staff with their children and suitcases on a trolley. A video showed two people pushing the trolley across a railway bridge.The Interfax news agency reported on Friday morning that the group later took a flight to Moscow from the far-eastern city of Vladivostok.North Korea has claimed to be coronavirus-free, but has sealed its borders and halted passenger traffic with other countries.

The reserves fluctuate but have consistently been at or above 100 days worth of imports and rose as high as 120 days recently, one of the people said.Beijing set a goal of increasing government stockpiles to hold at least 90 days of net imports, Bloomberg reported in April last year. That target didn’t include commercial inventories. China’s National Energy Administration didn’t respond to a fax seeking comment.As the world’s largest oil importer a sufficient level of reserves is critical for economic resilience to supply shocks such as a war in the Middle East. The International Energy Agency, which China isn’t part of, recommends that countries have enough crude to cover at least 90 days of net imports.Unlike the US, where data about the nation’s strategic petroleum reserves are updated publicly and regularly, the size of China’s crude stockpiles are shrouded in mystery. There’s also less of a distinction between government reserves and commercial stockpiles, with many of the country’s biggest energy companies being state-owned.China was moving forward with plans to buy up oil for its emergency reserves in April of last year, people familiar the plans said at the time. The initial target was to hold government stockpiles equivalent to 90 days of net imports, which could eventually be expanded to as much as 180 days when including commercial reserves, they said.Last year’s crash in oil prices and China’s rapid rebound from the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic set the stage for a flurry of crude purchases. However, stockpiling has leveled off as oil prices rebounded and storage space runs out, Capital Economics Ltd. said in a note this month. Fuel demand has also fallen this year amid a resurgence of the coronavirus in some parts of China.Emergency reserves, including commercial storage, exceeded 100 days worth of net imports in the third quarter of last year, according to Yuntao Liu, a London-based analyst with Energy Aspects Ltd. “Going forward, as crude prices rise and plants launch seasonal maintenance from April, the need for re-stockpiling is not that urgent.”China’s crude imports averaged 10.9 million barrels a day last year, according to import data compiled by Bloomberg, suggesting current stockpile levels of around 1.09 billion barrel. That aligns with an estimate from market intelligence firm Kayrros that the nation’s oil inventories rose to 1.01 billion barrels in the week through Feb. 14. Stockpiles reached a record of around 1.04 billion barrels in September last year, according to Kayrros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-oil-reserves-are-close-to-reaching-storage-capacity-101614331454375.html
26-02-2021||World||Israel gives half of population at least one Covid shot||Israel has now vaccinated half its population against Covid-19, another milestone on the way to subduing the pandemic.More than 4.6 million people have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, according to Health Ministry data released Friday. With nearly 8% of the country having recovered from the disease and likely developing some resistance to reinfection, that could bring Israel closer to herd immunity.Vaccinating about 60% to 70% of the population should be enough to rein in infections, illness and death, estimates Raina MacIntyre, a professor of biosecurity at the University of New South Wales, based off the latest data from Israel.Hospitals have seen a steady drop in critically ill cases over the past few weeks now that more than 90% of those in the highest risk groups have been vaccinated or have convalesced from infection.The rate of overall spread has also slowed after Israel expanded vaccine eligibility to everyone older than 16 earlier this month. Almost 3.3 million people have been given two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.Israel’s vaccine campaign raced ahead of the world after the government inked a deal with Pfizer in exchange for data on the inoculation program. The government started lifting restrictions on the economy in recent weeks as the load on hospitals began to diminish.Reaching herd immunity will still be a challenge given that 30% of the population is at the moment too young to be vaccinated. That may change depending on the results from clinical trials in kids aged 12-15 by Pfizer and Moderna Inc., which are expected in a few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-gives-half-of-population-at-least-one-covid-shot-101614331710544.html

Skea was also not wearing a mask, which is required in Singapore.Eyamalai, 39, who married Skea in November, was sentenced to one week imprisonment for abetting him.The couple had both pleaded guilty and their lawyer S.S. Dhillon said they would not appeal the sentencing.The city-state has largely brought its coronavirus outbreak under control, with less than a handful of new local cases a day, due to strict quarantining of arrivals, contact-tracing and social distancing.Singapore requires most arrivals to undergo 14 days of quarantine at government-designated hotels. Quarantine violations can be penalised with a fine of up to S$10,000 or up to six months in jail, or both.The island nation has jailed and fined others for breaking Covid-19 rules, while some foreigners have also had their work permits revoked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/briton-jailed-for-breaking-singapore-s-strict-quarantine-rules-fiancee-jailed-for-abetment-101614330768421.html

These violent activities have fallen since their height during the 1982-1993 period when individuals and groups conducted numerous terrorist attacks. The 1985 Air India bombing, which killed 331 people, remains the deadliest terrorist plot ever launched in Canada".Sikhs in Canada are 1.4 per cent of the total population. Ontario, Alberta and Quebec are some of the provinces where the Sikh population is high.Among the Sikh Canadian MPs who openly speak in favour of Khalistan include Jagmeet Singh, the head of the New Democratic Party (NDP).Recently, he shared his video message on Twitter and termed the ongoing farmers' agitation in India as one of the largest protests in history and called on the world leaders to denounce the Indian government's violent response to these peaceful protestors.Khalistani separatists groups have been trying to gain ground through farmers' protests.Furthermore, more than 400 Twitter handles run from Pakistan had been narrowed down by Indian agencies which were active to add fuel to the fire.On January 26 when farmers assembled around Red Fort, members of Khalistani separatist groups staged a protest outside the Indian embassy in Washington DC.The protesters claimed that they had assembled to support the farmers protesting in New Delhi. Many in the mob held so-called 'Khalistan' flags and raised slogans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-to-raise-khalistan-issue-with-canada-during-virtual-trip-101614331184537.html

Her British husband Nigel Skea, 52, was sentenced to two weeks' jail and slapped with a fine of 1,000 Singapore dollar (USD 752), the Channel News Asia reported.In September, Nigel conspired with Eyamalai, his then-fiancee, to meet in a room at a hotel where he was serving a stay-home notice after arriving in Singapore from London.District Judge Jasvender Kaur said it was not harsh for her not to place mitigating weight on the explanation for their breach – that Skea had travelled to propose marriage and they both were overcome by emotions after not seeing each other for a very long time."The fact of the matter is that the restrictions are necessary to prevent the spread of the pandemic," she said."Disruptions to relationships are an inevitable consequence. It requires patience and sacrifice (from) everyone ... for the greater good," the Channel News Asia quoted Judge Kaur as saying.The pair pleaded guilty earlier this month. Skea admitted to two charges of exposing others to risk of infection by leaving his hotel room while on stay-home notice and failing to wear a mask.Eyamalai, who subsequently married Skea, pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring with Skea to breach his stay-home notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-woman-jailed-for-breaching-singapore-s-covid-19-safety-measures-101614330957141.html

26-02-2021||World||Canadian PM slammed for abstaining from Parliament meeting on Uyghur rights||While lauding the Canadian Parliament's recognition of the Uyghur genocide, the US-based Campaign For Uyghurs (CFU) has slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Cabinet for abstaining during the meeting of House of Commons on the matter.In a statement, the CFU expressed disappointment over Trudeau and his Cabinet's abstention from the meeting in the House of Commons."It is a complete disappointment, as the Uyghur Movement has expressed, that the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Cabinet abstained from this decision made by the House of Commons. The abstention of a government and its prime minister to subjecting the Uyghurs to the genocide, which says it is an example to the international public in defending human rights, shows that these claims are in vain," the Uyghur rights group said.Appreciating the Canadian Parliament's move, the group commented that the step is an "encouraging step for both the Canadian Government and other governments to recognize the Uyghur genocide.""In the statement, while it is expected that economic measures will be implemented against Beijing to stop the genocide in line with this decision, the importance of the call to hold the Winter Olympics in another country instead of China in the acceptance of the House of Commons in 2022 is emphasized," it added.The CFU also slammed Europe for forgotting "its 'never again' commitments after the Holocaust."Acknowledging the genocide that China has been perpetrating against the Uyghur people is recognition of the suffering of the Uyghurs and a step towards justice, the Uyghur rights group said that the evidence of genocide is overwhelming in the presence of forced labor schemes, the mass detention of Uyghurs, forced sterilization of Uyghur women, and the forcible transfer of Uyghur children to state-run facilities.While a definition will not bring an immediate end to the sufferings of the Uyghur people, it is a vital step towards addressing them by acknowledging the realities of what is happening, the group further remarked.There should be no further dancing around the issue: Beijing is committing genocide, and those who choose to downplay this are standing on the wrong side of humanity, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-slammed-for-abstaining-from-parliament-meeting-on-uyghur-rights-101614330715213.html

In the metropolitan area, level 2 of social distancing is currently in place, while level 1.5 is in place in the rest of the country. The measures were supposed to end on February 28, however, the authorities decided to extend them. The government previously said it could either increase, prolong or weaken the level of social distancing after February 28.According to Chung, restrictions on small businesses, such as restaurants and cafes, will also remain in place for another two weeks.South Korea has confirmed nearly 89,000 Covid-19 cases so far, with over 1,500 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-extend-current-social-distancing-measures-for-2-weeks-101614329705874.html

26-02-2021||World||EU told to back vaccine passports or Google may do it anyway||European Union leaders inched toward establishing bloc-wide vaccine certificates to enable countries to reopen to travel as Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that unless they hurry Apple Inc. and Google will step into the vacuum.During a five-hour video call, the EU’s 27 leaders focused on how to haul their nations back to a form of normalcy after a pandemic that’s claimed more than 500,000 lives and shut down large parts of their economies. While there was broad support for certificates of some sort, leaders didn’t agree on the type of privileges they would grant.“We have all agreed that we need vaccine certificates,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters after the talks on Thursday. “In the future, it will certainly be good to have such a certificate but that will not mean that only those who have such a passport will be able to travel; about that, no political decisions have been made yet.”Europe’s leaders have been anxious to find a response after facing criticism for a vaccination program that lagged behind the US and UK There’s also the prospect of a third wave of infections leading again to stricter lockdowns.It was the first such meeting as prime minister of Italy for Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank president. He asked leaders to adopt a more resolute and pragmatic approach to speed up vaccinations and told them the program has to move much faster, according to an official with knowledge of the call.Draghi also called for a tougher approach against companies that don’t respect delivery commitments, suggesting that their exports from the EU could be blocked not only during the period they don’t respect accords, but also for a certain period afterward.The growing support for a digital certificate with common criteria such as vaccination, negative testing or immunity was helped by Merkel seeming to soften her stance on the matter, backing work on such a document, according to two people familiar with her remarks. But von der Leyen urged the group to move faster before US tech companies fill the void.“It is important to have a European solution because otherwise others will go into this vacuum,” she said at a press briefing. “Google and Apple are already offering solutions to the World Health Organization. And this is sensitive information so we want to be very clear here that we offer a European solution.”A spokesperson from the WHO said the organization has taken a software-neutral approach to the development of a vaccination certification and “neither Google nor Apple are involved in this process.”A person familiar with Apple’s position on the matter suggested that von der Leyen had misunderstood the situation. Apple has never discussed a possible vaccine application with the WHO or the EU, the person said on condition of anonymity.“If we as European Union don’t provide a solution, somebody else will, whether it’s going to be the US big tech companies or somebody else, the solution will be provided,” Alex Patelis, chief economic adviser to Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told Bloomberg. “Let’s get the infrastructure ready.”Countries including Germany and Belgium have come under fire from the EU commission for closing frontiers with other European nations to keep the virus under control. While they said that non-essential travel should be restricted, their summit communique included no new commitments, merely reiterating that shutting borders should be proportionate and non-discriminatory.The convergence on passports comes with the bloc’s tourism-dependent economies, which suffered the steepest contractions last year, determined to open their doors to those who have been inoculated. Other nations, however, have resisted such moves, citing a lack of convincing evidence that vaccination halts transmission as well as concerns over granting certain citizens special privileges and legal considerations.Macron’s ConcernsFrench President Emmanuel Macron was more skeptical during the discussion, voicing concerns about unknowns like the duration of immunity, the infection risk of those who have been vaccinated as well as legal and ethical issues regarding the protection of personal data, two people familiar with his remarks said.“We’ll have, in the end, a harmonious EU approach,” he told reporters. “It’s obvious because there is no other choice.”The summit came after AstraZeneca Plc Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot spoke to the European Parliament and sought to deflect blame for a shortfall in Covid-19 vaccine deliveries to Europe.Soriot said his company would deliver 40 million doses to the EU in the first quarter, with the volume set to rise in coming months. Employees are working around the clock to increase production, but perfecting the process takes time and isn’t without setbacks, he said.“Typically in our industry we have years to refine the process,” he said. “Here we didn’t have that time, we didn’t have that luxury. We had six months.”Rising InfectionsDuring the leaders’ discussion, von der Leyen sought to reassure the group that any vaccine supply shortages will soon be over. According to a slide shown to EU leaders available doses in the following quarters will be sufficient to vaccinate the bulk of the bloc’s population by the end of September. Draghi wasn’t convinced, according to another official, saying deliveries in the second and third quarters couldn’t be predicted.Concerns over the vaccine rollout come as governments are again grappling with rising numbers of infections. Paris is among 20 French regions potentially facing tougher Covid-19 restrictions from next week as cases jump, Prime Minister Jean Castex said.The government has asked health authorities to closely monitor the situation in the capital and other districts as it seeks to avoid a third nationwide lockdown, Castex said on Thursday. While France has seen an average of about 20,000 new cases a day since December, and intensive-care occupancy recently showed a slight gain to 67%, there’s an increasingly pronounced regional variation.“A lockdown is a tool that we have to resort to when we can’t do anything else,” Castex told a weekly news conference in Paris. “We must do everything to put it off and allow the vaccines time to have an effect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-told-to-back-vaccine-passports-or-google-may-do-it-anyway-101614329587250.html
26-02-2021||World||Sri Lanka ends forced cremations of Covid-19 victims after Imran Khan's visit||Amidst mounting international criticism, Sri Lanka has revised a controversial mandatory order to cremate the bodies of Covid-19 victims, which denied minority communities, including Muslims, their religious rights.The government on Thursday revised a gazette notification issued in April last year. The new notification has allowed both burials and cremations.For 10 months, Muslim and Christian minorities in the country and international rights groups have been lobbying the government to end the policy of forced cremations.The government was resisting calls to allow burials citing health concerns. It cited the opinion of some experts who claimed that the burial of Covid-19 victims would contaminate the water table thereby spreading the pandemic further.The country had earlier come under intense criticism from rights groups, including the UNHRC, over the cremation order.They said it failed to respect the religious feelings of the victims and their family members, especially of the Muslims, Catholics and some Buddhists.The cremation of bodies is forbidden in Islam.The decision to end forced cremations followed the visit of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.The Muslim minority leaders, who met Khan, said the decision to allow burials was linked to Sri Lanka seeking the support of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) at the ongoing UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva.Sri Lanka is due to face a fresh resolution, which would pin the island to achieve reconciliation through a credible accountability mechanism over its human rights record.Pakistan is a member of the OIC.The OIC nations had appealed in Geneva when the sessions began to reverse the forced cremations decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-ends-forced-cremations-of-covid-19-victims-after-imran-khan-s-visit-101614329298931.html

I have contacted the embassy and haven't heard much more information yet," Kitazumi's Myanmar colleague, Linn Nyan Htun, said in a Facebook post on the arrest."I didn't witness it, but I received a message from him via Messenger app around 11:30 that he got arrested. After that I lost connection with him," he told Reuters by telephone.In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a regular news conference that Japan was still trying to confirm the facts.Police in Myanmar did not immediately return calls to seek comment. Kitazumi's phone, listed on his company's website, was unreachable.Myanmar has been roiled by protests for weeks since the army seized power from elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and detained her and most of her government.Kitazumi is the second foreigner known to have been detained since the coup.The first foreigner arrested was Australian academic Sean Turnell, an adviser to Aung San Suu Kyi on economic reforms and the most prominent international expert on Myanmar’s financial system.Kitazumi's company produces video content, from news to movie trailers, and trains journalists with emphasis on free speech, his company says on its website.Earlier on Friday, Kitazumi wrote a Facebook post titled "Peace," saying many of Myanmar's citizens were out on the streets despite the bloodshed and were thankful to the Japanese for their support of the protesters.Kitazumi left the Nikkei in 2012 after having worked as a reporter from 2001, a representative of the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-police-detain-japanese-journalist-at-yangon-protest-says-colleague-101614329170729.html
26-02-2021||World||Iraq's scattered Christians ask 'should I stay or go?' as their struggles persist||A jihadist message, "Islamic State endures", is still graffitied on the front gate of Thanoun Yahya, an Iraqi Christian from the northern city of Mosul, scrawled by Islamist militants who occupied his home for three years when they ruled the city.He refuses to remove it, partly in defiance of the militants who were eventually beaten by Iraqi forces, but also as a reminder that Iraq's scattered and dwindling Christian community still lives a precarious existence."They're gone, they can't hurt us," said the 59-year-old, sitting in his home which he reclaimed when Islamic State was driven out in 2017. "But there aren't many of us left. The younger generation want to leave."The stark choice facing many Christians in Muslim-majority Iraq will be highlighted during the first ever papal visit to the Biblical nation. Pope Francis's trip runs from March 5-8 and will include a stop in Mosul.Yahya sold the family's metalwork shop to pay a ransom for his brother, kidnapped by al Qaeda militants in 2004 at a time when Christians were being abducted and executed.Since then, he has watched siblings leave for foreign countries and work and income dry up.Of 20 relatives who once lived in the neighbourhood, only his family of six remain.Iraq's Christians have endured unrest over centuries, but a mass exodus began after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and accelerated during the reign of Islamic State, which brutalised minorities and Muslims alike.Hundreds of thousands left for nearby areas and Western countries.Across Iraq's northern Nineveh Plains, home to some of the oldest churches and monasteries in the world, the remaining Christians often live displaced in villages that fell easily to Islamic State in 2014 or in enclaves of bigger cities such as Mosul and the nearby self-run Kurdish region.The Islamists' rule over almost a third of Iraq, with Mosul as their capital, ended in 2017 in a destructive battle with security forces.'Only God Can Help'Physical and economic ruin remain. Iraqi authorities have struggled to rebuild areas decimated by war, and armed groups that the government has not been able to control vie for territory and resources, including Christian heartlands.Christians say they are left with a dilemma - whether to return to damaged homes, resettle inside Iraq or migrate from a country that experience has shown cannot protect them."In 2014, Christians thought their displacement would last a few days," said Cardinal Louis Sako, head of Iraq's Chaldean Catholic Church."It lasted three years. Many lost hope and migrated. There's no security or stability."Iraq's indigenous Christians are estimated to number around 300,000, a fifth of the 1.5 million who lived in the country before the 2003 invasion that toppled Sunni Muslim leader Saddam Hussein.Christians were tolerated under Hussein, but singled out for kidnappings and killings in the communal bloodshed of the mid-2000s onwards.Pope Francis is to visit Iraq on an historic trip that eluded his predecessors. He will say a prayer for the victims of conflict at a site in Mosul where old churches lie in ruins, once used as religious tribunals by Islamic State.Christians welcome the visit, but do not believe it will improve their lot."The pope can't help us, only God can," Yahya said.Displaced, DistrustfulYahya's family, who fled to Iraq's northern Kurdistan region during Islamic State's rule, is one of just a few dozen that have returned to Mosul out of an original population of some 50,000 Christians, according to local clergy.His two teenage sons help out at the local church, the only one fully repaired in Mosul, which fills to about half its modest capacity on Sundays.Firas, his eldest, finds little more than a day a week of casual labour and sees no future in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city."If I want to marry, I'll have to leave. Christian women from here are displaced to other areas and don't want to come back," he said. "Ideally, I'd go to the West."The experience of Islamic State, which told Christians to convert, pay a tax or be killed, and the inability of Iraqi and Kurdish security forces to prevent the group marauding through their hometowns, has left many Christians distrustful of any but their own.The nearby Christian town of Hamdaniya boasts its own militia, which local officials say is necessary because of the proliferation of Shi'ite Muslim paramilitary groups which seek control of land, and Islamic State militants who remain in hideouts across northern Iraq."If there were no Christian militia here, no one would come back. Why should we rely on outside forces to protect us?" said a local militia leader, who requested anonymity.Nearly 30,000 Christians, half of Hamdaniya's population, have returned, including a small number from abroad, and began rebuilding infrastructure thanks to foreign aid. It is a rare bright spot.In the neighbouring village, Christian leader Sako said most Christians were unable or unwilling to return out of fear of a local Shi'ite militia, and because non-Christians had bought their property in their absence.Some have showed interest in resettling in Hamdaniya, but local officials generally reject this, fearing it would weaken Iraqi Christians' presence."If people move here from their own villages, it empties those areas of Christians," said Isam Daaboul, the mayor of Hamdaniya."This threatens our existence in areas we've been for generations."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraqs-scattered-christians-ask-should-i-stay-or-go-as-their-struggles-persist-101614324206220.html
26-02-2021||World||Covid vaccination 'passports' may open society, but inequity looms||Violet light bathed the club stage as 300 people, masked and socially distanced, erupted in gentle applause. For the first time since the pandemic began, Israeli musician Aviv Geffen stepped to his electric piano and began to play for an audience seated right in front of him.“A miracle is happening here tonight,” Geffen told the crowd.Still, the reanimating experience Monday night above a shopping mall north of Tel Aviv night was not accessible to everyone. Only people displaying a “green passport” that proved they had been vaccinated or had recovered from Covid-19 could get in.The highly controlled concert offered a glimpse of a future that many are longing for after months of Covid-19 restrictions. Governments say getting vaccinated and having proper documentation will smooth the way to travel, entertainment and other social gatherings in a post-pandemic world.But it also raises the prospect of further dividing the world along the lines of wealth and vaccine access, creating ethical and logistical issues that have alarmed decision-makers around the world.Other governments are watching Israel churn through the world's fastest vaccination program and grapple with the ethics of using the shots as diplomatic currency and power.Inside Israel, green passports or badges obtained through an app is the coin of the realm. The country recently reached agreements with Greece and Cyprus to recognize each other's green badges, and more such tourism-boosting accords are expected.Anyone unwilling or unable to get the jabs that confer immunity will be “left behind,” said Health Minister Yuli Edelstein.“It's really the only way forward at the moment,” Geffen said in an interview with The Associated Press.The checks at the club's doors, which admitted only those who could prove they are fully vaccinated, allowed at least a semblance of normality.“People can't live their lives in the new world without them," he said. "We must take the vaccines. We must."The vaccine is not available to everyone in the world, whether due to supply or cost. And some people don't want it, for religious or other reasons. In Israel, a country of 9.3 million people, only about half the adult population has received the required two doses.There is new pressure from the government to encourage vaccinations. Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday passed a law allowing the Health Ministry to disclose information on people who have yet to be vaccinated. Under the policy, names can be released to the ministries of education, labor, social affairs and social services, as well as local governments, “with the purpose of allowing these bodies to encourage people to get vaccinated."The government is appealing to the emotional longing for the company of others -- in Israel's storied outdoor markets, at concerts like Geffen's, and elsewhere.“With the Green Pass, doors just open for you. You could go out to restaurants, work out at the gym, see a show,” read an announcement on Feb. 21, the day much of the economy reopened after a six-week shutdown.Then it raised a question at the center of the global quest to conquer the pandemic that has hobbled economies and killed nearly 2.5 million people: “How to get the pass? Go and get vaccinated right now.”It's that simple in Israel, which has enough vaccine to inoculate everyone over 16, although the government has been criticized for sharing only tiny quantities with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week he intends to send excess vaccine to some of the country's allies. Israel's attorney general said Thursday night the plan has been frozen while he reviews the legalities.Most countries don't have enough vaccine, highlighting the fraught ethical landscape of who can get it and how to lift the burden of Covid-19.“The core human rights principle is equity and nondiscrimination,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University professor and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law.“There's a huge moral crisis in equity globally because in high income countries like Israel or the United States or the EU countries, we're likely to get to herd immunity by the end of this year," he said. "But for many low-income countries, most people won't be vaccinated for many years. Do we really want to give priority to people who already have so many privileges?”It's a question dogging the international community as wealthier countries begin to gain traction against the coronavirus and some of its variants.Last April, the initiative known as COVAX was formed by the WHO, with the initial goal of getting vaccines to poor countries at roughly the same time shots were being rolled out in rich countries. It has missed that target, and 80% of the 210 million doses administered worldwide have been given in only 10 countries, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week.Ghana on Wednesday became the first of 92 countries to get vaccines for free through the initiative. COVAX announced that about 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in the African nation. That's a fraction of the 2 billion shots the WHO aims to deliver this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccination-passports-may-open-society-but-inequity-looms-101614324260112.html
26-02-2021||World||US achieves milestone of administering 50 million Covid-19 vaccine shots||The US has reached an important milestone of administering COVID-19 vaccines to a record 50 million people as part of its efforts to fight the deadly coronavirus pandemic, with President Joe Biden asserting that the country is on its way to taking the figure to 100 million within the first 100 days of his administration."But this is not the time to relax," Biden told his countrymen from the White House as the US reached the important milestone."We must keep washing our hands, stay socially distanced, and for God's sake -- for God's sake, wear a mask. Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing those things. And the worst thing we could do now is let our guard down,” he said on Thursday.“The more people get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to beat this pandemic. That’s why one of my first goals in office when just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my goal was to get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days as President,” he said.Biden said on Thursday the US reached the halfway mark of 50 million shots in just 37 days since he became President.“That’s weeks ahead of schedule, even with the setbacks we faced during the recent winter storms, which devastated millions of Midwestern cities, towns, and also the same in the South,” he said.“At first, critics said that goal was too ambitious; no one could do that. And then they said it was too small. But the bottom line, though, is that America will be the first country -- perhaps the only one -- to get that done,” he said.Biden said nearly 50 per cent of Americans over the age of 65 and 75 per cent of long-term care recipients have received at least one dose.“We’re moving in the right direction, though, despite the mess we inherited from the previous administration, which left us with no real plan to vaccinate all Americans," he said."Every time we administer another 50 million shots, I’m going to use that milestone to report to the American people on our vaccination program and on our overall fight against this pandemic. The good and the bad, I’ll tell you; the success and the failures,” he added.The US has the highest coronavirus case tally in the world at 28.4 million and the highest death toll at 508,114.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-achieves-milestone-of-administering-50-million-covid-19-vaccine-shots-101614322713757.html
26-02-2021||World||Novel chip for Covid-19 testing delivers results on smartphone||Scientists have developed a stamp-sized chip that simplifies Covid-19 testing, and delivers results on a smartphone in less than 55 minutes.The microfluidic chip developed by researchers from Rice University in the US measures the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, a biomarker for Covid-19, in blood serum from a standard finger prick.According to the research published in the journal ACS Sensors, the nanobeads bind to SARS-CoV-2 N protein in the chip and transport it to an electrochemical sensor that detects minute amounts of the biomarker.The researchers noted that their process simplifies sample handling compared to swab-based PCR tests that are widely used to diagnose Covid-19 and need to be analysed in a laboratory."What's great about this device is that it doesn't require a laboratory," said Rice lab of mechanical engineer Peter Lillehoj."You can perform the entire test and generate the results at the collection site, health clinic or even a pharmacy. The entire system is easily transportable and easy to use," he said in a statement.The team, including Rice graduate student and lead author Jiran Li, took advantage of existing biosensing tools to develop simple diagnostics, like a microneedle patch introduced last year to diagnose malaria.The new tool relies on a slightly more complex detection scheme but delivers accurate, quantitative results in a short amount of time.To test the device, the researchers relied on donated serum samples from people who were healthy and others who were Covid-19-positive.They said a longer incubation yields more accurate results when using whole serum.The team found that 55 minutes was an optimum amount of time for the microchip to sense SARS-CoV-2 N protein at concentrations as low as 50 picograms (billionths of a gram) per millilitre in whole serum.The microchip could detect N protein in even lower concentrations, at 10 picograms per milliliter, in only 25 minutes by diluting the serum fivefold.Paired with a Google Pixel 2 phone and a plug-in potentiostat -- a device that controls voltage and measures resulting current -- it was able to deliver a positive diagnosis with a concentration as low as 230 picograms for whole serum."There are standard procedures to modify the beads with an antibody that targets a particular biomarker," Lillehoj said."When you combine them with a sample containing the biomarker, in this case SARS-CoV-2 N protein, they bond together," he added.A capillary tube is used to deliver the sample to the chip, which is then placed on a magnet that pulls the beads towards an electrochemical sensor coated with capture antibodies.The beads bind to the capture antibodies and generate a current proportional to the concentration of biomarker in the sample.The potentiostat reads that current and sends a signal to its phone app.If there are no Covid-19 biomarkers, the beads do not bind to the sensor and get washed away inside the chip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novel-chip-for-covid-19-testing-delivers-results-on-smartphone-101614321246673.html

26-02-2021||World||White House expects Neera Tanden to have a high bar of civility and engagement||The White House has said that it expects Neera Tanden to have a high bar of civility and engagement when the Indian-American policy expert joins the Biden administration, as it backed her nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget.Tanden, 50, is facing a tough time for the confirmation of her nomination over her past Twitter outbursts against several lawmakers, including those from her own Democratic Party.“When Neera Tanden testified just a few weeks ago, she apologised for her past comments and that she would be joining an administration where, as we've noted in here, there's an expectation of a high bar of civility and engagement, whether that's on social media or in person," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Thursday."And we certainly expect she would meet that bar,” Psaki said.Tanden’s nomination is in jeopardy because of the hundreds of her tweets against several Republican and Democratic Senators, who now have vowed to vote against her during the Senate confirmation.Tanden reportedly deleted more than 1,000 tweets before her confirmation process started. She had apologised to senators during her confirmation hearings earlier this month.“The President (Joe Biden) nominated Neera Tanden because she is qualified, because she is experienced, because she has a record of working with people who agree with her and disagree with her, and she has decades of experience," Psaki said."...she has lived experience of her own, having benefited from a number of the programmes that she would oversee, as a daughter of a single parent and somebody who benefited from food stamps at certain points in time,” Psaki said.“She would bring a new perspective to the role. That's why he nominated her to the job and why we're continuing to fight for her confirmation,” said the White House Press Secretary.If confirmed by the 100-member Senate, Tanden would become the first person of colour to head the federal agency that prepares the annual budget of the US government.Meanwhile, The Hill newspaper reported that Tanden might drop out of the race as early as Friday.“The struggle to gain support for the longtime Democratic aide whose combative Twitter posts have drawn criticism reflects miscalculations by the White House and its chief of staff, Ron Klain,” The New York Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-expects-neera-tanden-to-have-a-high-bar-of-civility-and-engagement-101614321033457.html
26-02-2021||World||Canadian panel calls for ‘targeted sanctions’ on China for its role in Hong Kong||A Canadian parliamentary committee has called upon the government to work with like-minded countries to impose “targeted sanctions” on Chinese officials “responsible for or complicit in gross violations of human rights, freedoms and the rule of law in Hong Kong”.It is among the recommendations listed in a report released by the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations, marking yet another low in the two countries’ deteriorating ties. The panel is headed by Geoff Regan, a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party caucus.It also said that in “light of the allegations of threats and intimidation against people in Canada supporting human rights and democracy in Hong Kong, the government of Canada carefully review accredited diplomatic personnel in the People’s Republic of China’s diplomatic missions to Canada”. It asked the government to consider “issuing travel documents to facilitate the safe and immediate exit from Hong Kong of pro-democracy activists” while making clear that “it will not act upon or support any arrest warrants or requests for legal assistance that are connected to the enforcement of the national security law imposed on Hong Kong”.The report from the panel is the latest flashpoint in escalating tensions between Canada and China. Bilateral ties began spiralling downwards ever since Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, in Vancouver in 2018 on an extradition request from the US for alleged fraud and violation of sanctions placed on Iran. Earlier this week, Canada’s House of Commons had passed a motion that labelled Chinese actions against Uighurs in Xinjiang a “genocide”. It had also passed an amendment to the motion calling on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympic Games from China to another country.The 2022 Winter Games are scheduled to be held in Beijing and few other Chinese cities from February 4-20.Canadian activists have been consistently calling for the 2022 Olympics to be moved out of China and hosted by a “free country”.A joint statement to this effect was issued jointly by Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project, Canadian Friends of Hong Kong, and Students for a Free Tibet Canada. “If the new host city needs more time, the 2022 Olympics can be postponed by a year, as what Tokyo has done for the 2020 Games due to Covid-19,” the statement said, noting that “free” venues such as Vancouver-Whistler in Canada, which had hosted the 2010 Winter Games, “have the experience, existing facilities and infrastructure to host it again”.Referring to Beijing having hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Youdon Tsamotshang, who heads a Tibetan group, said, “It’s really shocking that China was given a second chance without bettering the human rights situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-panel-calls-for-targeted-sanctions-on-china-for-its-role-in-hong-kong-101614318117559.html
26-02-2021||World||United States asks Pakistan to play a ‘constructive role’ in the region||The United States on Thursday called upon Pakistan to play a “constructive role” in the region, especially across the border in Kashmir as well as in Afghanistan, in the backdrop of the ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) and growing calls from experts for a re-set of US-Pakistan ties.The US welcomed the India-Pakistan joint statement committing to a ceasefire along the LoC. “We encourage continued efforts to improve communication between the two sides and to reduce tensions and violence along the Line of Control,” said Ned Price, spokesperson of the US state department.Asked about the trajectory of the relationship between the US and Pakistan under the administration of President Joe Biden, Price said Pakistan has an “important role to play” in bringing peace to Afghanistan.But he went on to put Pakistan on notice, saying, “So clearly we will be paying close attention, and we urge the Pakistanis to play a constructive role in all of these areas of mutual interest, including in Afghanistan, including with Kashmir, including with our other shared interests.”The Biden administration’s highest-level contact with the Pakistan government so far has been between secretary of state Antony Blinken and foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. They spoke on the same day as Blinken and India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar did, for the first time. President Biden and Prime Minister Imran Khan have not spoken yet.Price’s response to a question about the forward trajectory of America’s relationship with Pakistan came amid growing talk of a reset of ties between the two erstwhile allies.“Voices sympathetic to Pakistan in Washington are advocating a reset of US-Pakistan relations, setting aside the bitterness of the past,” Aparna Pande, a South Asia expert with the think tank Hudson Institute, recently wrote in a piece calling for a reset of US-Pakistan ties.“Their essential argument is that as a nuclear weapons power with a large army, which has been a friend of the United States in the past, Pakistan simply cannot be ignored,” she said.Pande concluded, “The US should, of course, not ignore Pakistan. But Americans should be wary of plans that draw the US back into embracing Pakistan or depending on it. Pakistan is now China’s closest ally and its overtures to the US are designed only to evade the consequences of its anti-American conduct.”Price’s call to Pakistan to play a “constructive role” seemed to be a studied response to the growing call for a reset of ties, reminding advocates of a deep-seated suspicion of an erstwhile ally who took billions of dollars in aid to combat terrorism, but ended up fuelling it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-asks-pakistan-to-play-a-constructive-role-in-the-region-101614317517488.html
26-02-2021||World||Saudi Crown Prince implicated in Khashoggi murder, US finds||A US intelligence report expected to be declassified as soon as Friday implicates Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in approving the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a person familiar with the findings.The report builds on classified intelligence from the CIA and other intelligence agencies after Khashoggi’s murder in October 2018 inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the report hasn’t yet been released. It wasn’t immediately clear how much detail the declassified version of the report will provide about Prince Mohammed’s role in the killing.The decision to release the report, compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, reflects the Biden administration’s determination to recalibrate relations with Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, amid tensions over its human rights record.In advance of the report’s publication, President Joe Biden held a call Thursday with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Biden discussed regional security and the renewed US and United Nations effort to end the war in Yemen, and he “affirmed the importance the United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law,” the White House said in a statement.Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement in the killing, while saying he accepts symbolic responsibility for it as the country’s de facto ruler. Saudi officials have said the murder was carried out by rogue agents who have since been prosecuted.State Department spokesman Ned Price declined to comment when asked about the report Thursday but suggested that the US was looking at other ways to hold the perpetrators of the killing responsible for their actions. Among the options may be cutting back arms sales to Saudi Arabia and imposing sanctions.“I expect that we will be in a position before long to speak to steps to promote accountability going forward for this horrific crime,” Price told reporters in Washington. “Transparency, as it often is, is an element of accountability. I wouldn’t expect the accountability to stop there, however.”The decision to release the report, which was withheld by the Trump administration, reflects the difference in attitudes toward Saudi Arabia, and human rights issues, under Biden.Former President Donald Trump dismissed concerns about whether the crown prince approved the killing -- “Maybe he did, maybe he didn’t,” he said -- citing the economic rewards of selling arms to the Saudis. His secretary of state, Michael Pompeo, said the US had “no direct evidence” linking the prince to the murder and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner maintained a close working relationship with him.The US intelligence report isn’t the only finding to implicate the Saudi monarchy. A UN investigator, Agnes Callamard has said Khashoggi was the victim of a “state killing” and has said there was little doubt it was ordered at the highest levels of the Saudi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-crown-prince-implicated-in-khashoggi-murder-us-finds-101614316095480.html
26-02-2021||World||US lifts Trump-era ban on legal immigration||US President Joe Biden has revoked a ban on legal immigration that was ordered by his predecessor Donald Trump to save American jobs for local citizens in an economy crippled by the Covid-19 pandemic.In a proclamation issued on Wednesday, Biden said the ban “does not advance the interests of the United States”. He added, “To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here. It also harms industries in the United States that utilise talent from around the world.”The proclamation will allow people to begin applying for green cards with immediate effect - and not wait until March when the ban was supposed to expire. It did not revoke the ban on H-1B, L and other work visas. But they are set to lapse in March.In April 2020, Trump had temporarily suspended for 60 days the entry of legal immigrants - affecting green cards - as layoffs had begun to spike. There were some exceptions, such as dependents of US citizens. Then in June, Trump extended the freeze by another 60 days and added non-immigrants to the list, including holders of short-term work visas such as the H-1B and L visas used for intra-company transfers. He further extended these bans in December for another 60 days.“Without intervention, the United States faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labour supply outpaces labour demand,” Trump had said in the April proclamation.While the stated goal was to save US jobs for Americans, critics said the former president was using the pandemic to pursue a hardline immigration agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lifts-trump-era-ban-on-legal-immigration-101614306505899.html

The FATF recognises that Pakistan has made significant progress in its effort to improve its anti money laundering and counterterrorism financing framework. However, some serious deficiencies remain,” Pleyer told a virtual news briefing at the end of the watchdog’s three-day plenary meeting.All of these deficiencies are in areas that relate to terrorist financing. Out of 27 items on its action plan, three still need to be fully addressed. I again recognise the progress that Pakistan has made but I strongly urge the completion of the action plan,” he added.Focus on three remaining items in the action planThe statement called on Islamabad to “continue to work on implementing the three remaining items in its action plan to address its strategically important deficiencies”.The steps to be taken by the Pakistan government include “demonstrating that TF (terror financing) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities”.Pakistan should also demonstrate that terror financing “prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions”, and that there is “effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions” against all terrorists sanctioned under UN Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373, and “specifically those acting for or on their behalf”.“As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan before June 2021,” the statement said.Review at next plenary meeting in JunePleyer said that further steps taken by Pakistan will be reviewed at the FATF’s next plenary meeting in June.The statement noted that Pakistan’s “continued political commitment has led to significant progress across a comprehensive CFT (counter financing of terrorism) action plan”, including demonstrating that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity.The plenary meeting followed several rounds of meetings of the FATF’s working groups since February 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terror-financing-watchdog-keeps-pakistan-on-grey-list-101614305901298.html

However, border issues are not the whole of China-India relations and should be placed in an appropriate position in bilateral relations, he said.The statement quoted Wang as saying that the recent disengagement of frontline Chinese and Indian troops in the Pangong Lake area had clearly eased the situation on the ground.Wang told Jaishankar that both sides must cherish the current hard-won situation, jointly consolidate the existing results, maintain the momentum of consultation and further ease the situation.Wang said that both sides should improve the border control mechanism, advance the border negotiation process, continue to accumulate and enhance mutual trust, and achieve peace and tranquility in the border area.Jaishankar was quoted in the statement as saying that the recent disengagement of the two militaries in the Pangong Lake area is an important result of the two sides earnestly implementing the Moscow consensus of the two foreign ministers.India hopes to strengthen dialogue and consultation with China to achieve complete disengagement in other regions as soon as possible and promote the continuous cooling of the border situation between the two countries, Jaishankar was quoted as saying.Blaming India for the nine-month military standoff in eastern Ladakh, Wang said India’s policies towards China had changed in the last year and “pragmatic cooperation” between the two countries had been affected.The Chinese minister was quoted as saying that bad ties were not in the interest of the two countries, and that past experiences show that highlighting differences will not help resolve problems and would also erode the foundation of mutual trust.“Both parties agreed to establish a communication hotline to exchange opinions in a timely manner,” the statement said.Must Watch: Govt on thaw with Pakistan & China; updates on threats to Indians in CanadaThe phone call was the first formal contact between Jaishankar and Wang since they met on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow on September 10 last year, and it came days after India and China pulled back frontline troops from strategic heights around Pangong Lake along with armoured vehicles and artillery.“Spoke to State Councillor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi this afternoon. Discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement,” Jaishankar tweeted, without giving details.Asked about the situation on the LAC at a regular news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Both sides view the smooth and successful completion of disengagement in the north and south bank [of Pangong Lake] as a significant first step as this forms a basis for resolution of remaining issues so as to achieve the eventual goal of complete disengagement in all friction areas.”“The two sides have agreed to work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/border-dispute-objective-reality-should-be-put-at-right-position-in-ties-china-101614305292528.html
26-02-2021||World||Facebook signs pay deals with 3 Australian news publishers||Facebook announced on Friday preliminary agreements with three Australian publishers, a day after the Parliament passed a law that would make the digital giants pay for news.Facebook said letters of intent had been signed with independent news organizations Private Media, Schwartz Media and Solstice Media.The commercial agreements are subject to the signing of full agreements within the next 60 days, a Facebook statement said.“These agreements will bring a new slate of premium journalism, including some previously paywalled content, to Facebook,” the statement said.Schwartz Media chief executive Rebecca Costello said the deal would help her company continue to produce independent journalism.“It's never been more important than it is now to have a plurality of voices in the Australian press,” Costello said in the Facebook statement.Private Media chief executive Will Hayward said the new deal built on an existing Facebook partnership.Australia's Parliament on Thursday had passed the final amendments to the so-called News Media Bargaining Code.In return for the changes, Facebook agreed to lift a six-day-old ban on Australians accessing and sharing news. Access to Australian news sites did not appear to be fully restored until Friday.Google, the only other digital giant targeted by the legislation, has already struck content licensing deals, or is close to deals, with some of Australia's biggest news publishers including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Seven West Media.Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg on Wednesday took a veiled swipe at News Corp. in a social media post criticizing Australia's law, which is aimed at setting a fair price for the Australian journalism that the digital platforms display.“It is ironic that some of the biggest publishers that have long advocated for free markets and voluntary commercial undertakings now appear to be in favor of state sponsored price setting,” the former British deputy prime minister wrote.News Corp. Australia executive chairman Michael Miller said last week that his company had pay negotiations with Facebook.“Having been someone who's dealt with Facebook over the past months, we have some weeks where we're getting good engagement and think we're progressing and then you get silence. I think the door is still open,” Miller told a Senate inquiry into Australian media diversity.News Corp. owns most of Australia's major newspapers, and some analysts argue the US-based international media empire is the driver for the conservative Australian government making Facebook and Google pay. News Corp. has announced a wide-ranging deal with Google covering operations in the United States and Britain as well as Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-signs-pay-deals-with-3-australian-news-publishers-101614304136519.html
26-02-2021||World||US president Joe Biden believes it's important to modernise immigration system: White House||US President Joe Biden believes that it is important and long overdue to modernise the immigration system, and this includes taking steps to help ensure high skilled workers can stay in the country, the White House has said.Biden has revoked a policy issued by his predecessor during the Covid-19 pandemic that blocked many Green Card applicants from entering the US, a move that will benefit many Indians working in America on the H-1B visa.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently."The president believes that it's important and long overdue to modernise our immigration system, and that includes taking steps to help ensure that high skilled workers can stay in the country and can go through the proper processes to stay in the country,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Thursday."So, we are eager to work with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to get that done,” she said a day after Biden issued the proclamation reversing the decision of his predecessor Donald Trump.Indian IT professionals, most of whom are highly skilled and come to the US mainly on the H-1B work visas, are the worst sufferers of the current immigration system which imposes a seven per cent per country quota on allotment of the coveted Green Card or permanent legal residency.The H-1B visa, the most sought after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.Reopening the country to people seeking green cards, or legal permanent residence, Biden in his proclamation on Wednesday said that the policy of former President Donald Trump does not advance the interests of the United States.“To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,” he said.“It also harms industries in the United States that utilise talent from around the world. And it harms individuals who were selected to receive the opportunity to apply for, and those who have likewise received, immigrant visas through the Fiscal Year 2020 Diversity Visa Lottery,” Biden, a Democrat, said.Trump, a Republican, issued the ban last year, saying it was needed to protect US workers amid high unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic.The US is currently facing a backlog of nearly 473,000 qualified family-based Green Card requests.As a result of Trump’s ban on issuing green cards, as many as 120,000 family-based preference visas were lost. But this came as a big boon for issuing employment-based green cards, mainly those on H-1B visas.Thousands of Indian IT professionals who painstakingly waited for their Green Card, received their legal permanent residency as a result in the last few months of the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-believes-it-s-important-to-modernise-immigration-system-wh-101614303176227.html
26-02-2021||World||McConnell says he would support Donald Trump if he’s nominated in 2024||Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he would “absolutely” support Donald Trump if he were the Republican Party’s nominee for president in 2024.His remarks, in a Fox News interview, marked an about-face from less than two weeks ago, when he delivered an impassioned speech from the Senate floor in which he held Trump “practically and morally responsible” for the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6th.McConnell and other Republicans, including Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming have suggested that it was time for the party to move on and find new leaders despite polls showing that most Republicans remain attached to the former president.Yet the party is also keen to cast aside the notion that it’s engulfed in a civil war as it confronts the new Biden administration and prepares for the 2022 elections.“The Republican party is actually in very good shape,” McConnell said in the Fox interview. “We gained seats in the House, we elected 50 Republican senators when everybody was predicting we were going to lose the Senate. The Democrats didn’t flip a single state legislature, we flipped two, picked up a governor.”The Republicans did lose control of the Senate, but it remains divided 50-50.McConnell dismissed reports of party discord and said President Joe Biden “has made it quite easy for us to get together.”On Feb. 13, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on charges of inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection, but just minutes later condemned him in the floor speech. “The leader of the free world cannot spend weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe him and do reckless things,” he said.Trump fired back days later with a sarcastic response, mocking McConnell as “a dour, sullen and unsmiling political hack” and warned senators who remained loyal to their leader “will not win again.”When Trump was president, McConnell was his chief ally in shepherding the 2017 tax law and filling the federal judiciary with Trump’s nominees. But the two men had an uneasy relationship that McConnell managed by rarely engaging Trump publicly, making his floor speech all the more extraordinary.McConnell is not attending this weekend’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, in which Trump will be the star attraction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcconnell-says-he-would-support-donald-trump-if-he-s-nominated-in-2024-101614302652608.html

The singer is offering a $500,000 reward.The dog walker was shot once Wednesday night and is expected to survive his injuries, according to Los Angeles Police Capt. Jonathan Tippett, commanding officer of the department's elite Robbery-Homicide Division. The man was walking three of Lady Gaga's dogs at the time, but one escaped. That dog has been recovered safely.Tippett told The Associated Press that the dogs belong to pop star Lady Gaga. It's not yet clear if the dog walker was targeted because of his celebrity client, the captain said.Lady Gaga is offering the reward for the return of her dogs — whose names are Koji and Gustav — with no questions asked, according to her representative. An email address for tips, KojiandGustav@gmail.com, has been set up. The singer is currently in Rome to film a movie.Police were initially called to North Sierra Bonita Avenue, a street off the famed Sunset Boulevard, around 9:40 p.m. Wednesday following several 911 calls reporting a man screaming and the sound of a gunshot, said Capt. Steven Lurie, commanding officer of the department’s Hollywood Division.The victim, whose name has not been released, was walking the dogs when a white Nissan Altima pulled over and two men tried to steal the animals, police said.“Two suspects exited the vehicle and demanded the victim turn over the dogs at gunpoint. The victim struggled with the suspects and was shot once by one of the suspects,” a police statement said.The suspects nabbed two of the three dogs and drove off in the Nissan sedan, the statement said.There was little evidence of the previous night's violence on Thursday afternoon in the upscale neighborhood known as the Sunset Square historic district. There were faint blood spatters on sidewalk grasses and an errant black glove typically used by police left in the street. Neighbors, some of whom had doorbell security cameras, declined to comment on the shooting.French bulldogs can cost thousands of dollars. A woman in San Francisco was beaten in January at gunpoint, and three men stole her gray French bulldog puppy named Chloe, police said.Gaga has remained among the biggest pop stars in the world since breaking through with her 2008 album “The Fame,” known as much for her shape-shifting persona on stages and red carpets as for her danceable music and powerful vocal pipes.She has won 11 Grammy Awards, headlined Super Bowl halftime and has now also become a bona fide Hollywood star after co-starring in 2018’s “A Star is Born” with Bradley Cooper and winning an Oscar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lady-gaga-s-dog-walker-shot-french-bulldogs-stolen-in-la-101614302308237.html
26-02-2021||World||Explainer: What were the warnings before the Capitol riot?||Capitol Police leadership had plenty of intelligence warning that armed extremists were planning to target the Capitol over President Donald Trump’s election loss, according to new testimony Thursday. But their rank-and-file officers were still left exposed against armed rioters who came within steps of lawmakers.In an appearance before a House subcommittee, acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said none of the warnings forecast the mass attack that actually took place.Both Democrats and Republicans took issue with that, saying the intelligence sounded both specific and credible.“I cannot get past a glaring discrepancy between intelligence received and preparation,” Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said during Thursday's hearing before the House Appropriations Committee.Pittman became acting chief when her predecessor, Steven Sund, resigned in the wake of the insurrection. At the time of the attack, she was serving as assistant chief for protective and intelligence services.Here’s some of what was learned from Pittman’s testimony:WHAT INTELLIGENCE DID POLICE HAVE BEFORE THE JAN. 6 ATTACK?Three days before the attack, the Capitol Police department's own security assessment warned that militia members, white supremacists, and other extremists were planning to come to Washington and target Congress in what they saw as a “last stand” to support Trump.Pittman says the details of that assessment were shared throughout the department, with sergeants and lieutenants told to spread the word to rank-and-file officers.It's not clear how effective that messaging was, however. Four officers interviewed by The Associated Press last month say they had little or no warning of what would happen and felt they were left unprepared for the attack.Pittman also faced questions about an FBI memo, received the night before the attack, that warned extremists planned to wage “war” to prevent Joe Biden's election victory from being certified. She said that memo never reached her, but that it would not have changed the department's preparations anyway.SO POLICE KNEW VIOLENCE WAS LIKELY. WHAT DID THEY DO TO PREVENT IT?Pittman said the force took appropriate measures to protect the building and the lawmakers who were inside. She said they stationed armed officers at the homes of congressional leaders, intercepted radio frequencies used by the invaders, and deployed counterintelligence officers to the Ellipse rally where Trump was sending his supporters marching to the Capitol to “fight like hell.”But the mob made it through the police line and smashed their way into the Capitol, fighting past officers who were outnumbered and overwhelmed. Many officers didn’t know if they could use force and lacked guidance on how to stop the rioters, leaving some to improvise.WHY DIDN'T THE DEPARTMENT DO MORE TO PREPARE?Pittman argued that the intelligence from Jan. 3 was not specific or credible enough to predict the kind of insurrection that actually took place. The same goes for the FBI memo, she said. She said that even if department leaders had seen that warning, they wouldn't have changed their plans because it was considered “raw” intelligence and not something that the department could act on.“No credible threat indicated that tens of thousands would attack the US Capitol, nor did the intelligence received from the FBI or any other law enforcement partner indicate such a threat,” Pittman said. Questioned later in the hearing, Pittman acknowledged that police estimate around 10,000 people were demonstrating outside and around 800 people broke inside.Lawmakers seized on her claim that the warnings didn't lay out the actual threat.Clark, the congresswoman from Massachusetts, described the Jan. 3 assessment as a listing of “who, what, when, why.”WHAT HAPPENS NOW?Pittman noted that she had taken “corrective measures” to better share intelligence in the future. But there are still several investigations going on into the law enforcement response.Speaking after the hearing, Rep. Tim Ryan, the House subcommittee’s chairman, stopped short of saying Pittman should be fired. But he said there are “a lot of concerns” on the committee about her leadership and noted the lack of trust among the rank and file.The Capitol Police union issued a vote of no confidence last week against Pittman.“I think there’s some real questions about the decision making that was made, and I’m going to leave it at that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exlainer-what-were-the-warnings-before-the-capitol-riot-101614301942247.html

Illinois is the only state with a law that allows people to seek monetary damages for such unauthorized data collection.“While we disagree with the assertions, rather than go through lengthy litigation, we’d like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community,” TikTok said in an emailed statement.Facebook agreed to a $550 million settlement under the same law last February. The TikTok settlement must still be approved by a federal judge.Privacy advocates have praised the law as the nation’s strongest form of protection in the commercial use of such data, and it has survived ongoing efforts by the tech industry and other businesses to weaken it.Illinois is one of three states that have laws governing the use of biometric data. But the other two, Texas and Washington, don’t permit individual lawsuits, instead delegating enforcement to their attorneys general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-pay-92-million-in-us-privacy-settlement-101614301737218.html
26-02-2021||World||Boeing, hit with $6.6 mn FAA fine, faces much bigger 787 repair bill: Report||Boeing Co will pay a $6.6 million to US regulators as part of a settlement over quality and safety-oversight lapses going back years, a setback that comes as Boeing wrestles with repairs to flawed 787 Dreamliner jets that could dwarf the cost of the federal penalty.Boeing is beginning painstaking repairs and forensic inspections to fix structural integrity flaws embedded deep inside at least 88 parked 787s built over the last year or so, a third industry source said.The inspections and retrofits could take weeks or even up to a month per plane and are likely to cost hundreds of millions - if not billions - of dollars, depending to a large degree on the number of planes and defects involved, the person said.The Federal Aviation Administration said Boeing had agreed to pay $6.6 million in penalties after the aviation regulator said it failed to comply with a 2015 safety agreement.The penalties include $5.4 million for not complying with the agreement in which Boeing pledged to change its internal processes to improve and prioritize regulatory compliance and $1.21 million to settle two pending FAA enforcement cases."Boeing failed to meet all of its obligations under the settlement agreement, and the FAA is holding Boeing accountable by imposing additional penalties," FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement. Boeing, which paid $12 million in 2015 as part of the settlement, did not immediately comment.Boeing engineers are working to determine the scope of inspections, including whether jets can be used as-is without a threat to safety, two people said. Boeing has not told airlines how many jets are impacted, another person said.The FAA has been investigating instances of oversight lapses, debris left inside finished aircraft, and managers putting pressure on employees handling safety checks for the FAA, people familiar with the proceedings said.For example, in August 2020, Boeing told to the FAA about the flaw involving structural wrinkling in the interior fuselage skin where carbon-composite barrels that form the plane's lightweight body are melded together.But the defect went unnoticed for months or longer because computerized safeguards that crunch data looking for quality flaws had not been programmed to look for the gaps, a third industry source said.Delivery targetThe 787 production problems have halted deliveries of the jet since the end of October, locking up a source of desperately needed cash for Boeing.The fuel-efficient 787 has been a huge success with airlines, which have ordered 1,882 of the advanced twin-aisle jet worth nearly $150 billion (74.7 billion pounds) at list prices.But the advanced production process and sprawling global supply chain caused problems over the years.As of February, Boeing had fixed the 787 production process causing the wrinkling defect, according to two people familiar with the matter.However, planes rolled off the assembly line with the flaw for more than a year, at least, continuing even after the flaw was discovered in August 2020."It's difficult to see a definitive fix that is agreeable by the aviation authorities and all going forward," Boeing customer Air Lease Corp's CEO John Plueger told analysts on an earnings call Feb 22. "I don't think that we're there yet."Boeing has been working on the fuselage problem, and two additional potentially hazardous defects that arose since 2019, as it charted plans to consolidate final assembly of the 787 in South Carolina starting next month, at a sharply reduced rate of 5 787s per month.One senior supply chain source said they will have to cut rate again.Boeing said last month it expects to resume handing over a small number of 787s to customers later this quarter.It has an ambitious internal plan to deliver 100 of the jets this year, one person said. Analysts say deliveries are not expected to recover to 2019 levels until at least 2024.'Open heart surgery'But before any jet is delivered, it must go through invasive inspections and costly repairs.First, technicians must pull out the passenger seats, open up the floor paneling and use specialty tools to measure whether defects invisible to the naked eye are present, according to three people with direct knowledge of the process.The repair work - already underway at Boeing factories in Everett, Washington and North Charleston, South Carolina - is even harder.In the bowels of the jet, technicians have to remove multiple specialty fasteners on both sides of the inner fuselage skin, then install newly produced "shims" that fill out gaps and remove the structural dimpling. Workers then replace all the fasteners, re-paint, and re-install the interior, they said."It's like open heart surgery," one of the people said. "They'll be retrofitting the fleet for potentially several years."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-hit-with-6-6-mn-faa-fine-faces-much-bigger-787-repair-bill-report-101614301464278.html
26-02-2021||World||Biden, Saudi king speak ahead of Khashoggi murder report||US President Joe Biden and Saudi King Salman held a long-awaited first phone call Thursday, stressing the enduring strength of ties ahead of a potentially explosive intelligence report on the murder of a Washington Post journalist.The phone call was seen as the final precursor to the release of the report on the grisly killing in 2018 of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi national who had been an outspoken critic of Salman's expected successor Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.If, as expected, the report directly implicates Prince Mohammed in Khashoggi's murder, it will cast a huge shadow over relations between the United States and its most significant ally in the Arab world which had flourished under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump.In their phone call, Biden and the 85-year-old king discussed "the US commitment to help Saudi Arabia defend its territory as it faces attacks from Iranian-aligned groups," according to a statement from the White House.However, the US president also "affirmed the importance the United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law" in the call which came more than five weeks after Biden was sworn in and long after he had spoken with a host of other world leaders.The official Saudi news agency said that the king and Biden had both stressed "the depth of the relationship between the two countries" and discussed Iran's "destabilizing activities and its support for terrorist groups" in the region.The report's release, which is expected to come as early as Friday, is a sharp departure from the policies of former president Trump, who hailed his close friendship with Saudi Arabia and whose son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, became texting friends with 35-year-old Prince Mohammed.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday had his own telephone call with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and "discussed the importance of Saudi progress on human rights, including through legal and judicial reforms," State Department spokesman Ned Price said.Prince Mohammed, who is considered the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia due to the king's fragile health, has said he accepts Saudi Arabia's overall responsibility in Khashoggi's killing but denies a personal link.Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World, an advocacy group founded by Khashoggi, said that Biden needed to take action beyond sending the report to Congress."President Biden should now fulfill his promise to hold MBS accountable for this murder by, at minimum, imposing the same sanctions on him as those imposed on his underlying culprits and ending the weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia that would be controlled by an unelected, brutal murderer," she said.Five people were handed death sentences over the murder of Khashoggi who was killed and dismembered in 2018 inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.'Whitewash'But a Saudi court in September overturned them while giving jail terms of up to 20 years to eight unnamed defendants following secretive legal proceedings.Human rights advocates called the judicial process a whitewash aimed at blaming the hitmen while not touching the mastermind.CNN, quoting documents filed in a Canadian civil lawsuit, reported that two private jets used by the squad that allegedly flew to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi were owned by a company earlier seized by Prince Mohammed.A respected veteran journalist and editor, Khashoggi was in self-exile and resident in the United States, writing articles critical of the crown prince when he was assassinated on October 2, 2018The 59-year-old writer had been told by Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States to go to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul if he wanted to obtain documents for his forthcoming marriage.There he was killed and his body dismembered by a team sent from Riyadh under the direction of Prince Muhammed's top security aide, Saud al-Qahtani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-saudi-king-speak-ahead-of-khashoggi-murder-report-101614301280458.html
26-02-2021||World||'Who is at fault?' Investigation into Texas blackout begins||The catastrophic Texas blackout was a wider failure than the state's power grid, which teetered on the brink of an even bigger collapse during a freeze that knocked out electricity to 4 million customers, energy executives said Thursday.One CEO said he sounded warning days before what became one of the worst power outages in U.S. history, including to the office of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, whose regulatory appointees came under sharp criticism during the first investigative hearing since last week's crisis.Leaders of other power companies said they thought the system would hold, while also acknowledging that a failure to buttress their generators against subfreezing weather contributed to the outages.“Who is at fault?" state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican, demanded of witnesses during hours of testimony at the Texas Capitol.President Joe Biden is set to fly to Texas on Friday, in what will be his first visit to a major disaster site since taking office.Abbott has zeroed in almost singularly on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, accusing the state’s embattled grid operator of misleading the public about the readiness of a system that was minutes away from total collapse in the early hours of Feb. 15, when temperatures plunged and demand for electricity vastly outstripped supply.But energy executives, including those whose companies lavishly donate to Abbott and lawmakers, made clear that the fault is far wider.The testimony offered a troubling new look at how quickly America’s energy capital ran out of energy. Curtis Morgan, the CEO of Vistra Corp., told lawmakers at the outset that the blackouts affected plants that could have generated more power that was urgently needed. He said when officials from his company called utility providers, they were told they weren’t a priority.“How can a power plant be at the bottom of the list of priorities?” Morgan said.“You-know-what hit the fan, and everybody’s going, ‘You’re turning off my power plant?'" he said.At least 40 people in Texas died as a result of the storm, and 10 days after the blackout started, more than 1 million people in the state were still under boil-water notices.ERCOT officials have claimed that the scale of the forced blackouts — the largest in Texas history — were necessary to avert an even more catastrophic failure that would have wiped out power to most of the state's 30 million residents for months.“Obviously what you did didn't work," said Democratic state Sen. John Whitmire of Houston, which had more than 1 million outages.“It worked from keeping us (from) going into a blackout that we’d still be in today, that’s why we did it," ERCOT president Bill Magness said. “Now it didn’t work for people’s lives, but it worked to preserve the integrity of the system.”Among Vistra's subsidiaries is, Luminant, which operates nearly two dozen plants across Texas. Morgan blamed outdated lists of critical infrastructure in Texas for darkening gas processers and production sites as grid managers began shutting off parts of the system.Morgan didn't say how many of the company's plants were turned off or for how long, but he did say the company was within three minutes of power going offline at one nuclear plant, and that the main power grid in America’s energy capital was just moments away from total collapse Feb. 15. He said he had reached out to state officials, including Abbott's office, with concerns.“We came dangerously close to losing the entire electric system," Morgan said.Of Texas' power generators that were not operational during the storm, Magness said the freeze was responsible 42% of the failures. A lack of fuel and equipment damage unrelated to the weather also contributed, but Magness said that for 38% of the plant outages, the problem remains unclear.Republican lawmakers pulled no punches in criticizing DeAnn Walker, chairwoman of the Public Utility Commission, who was appointed to the regulatory agency by Abbott. Several were frustrated by her claims the commission had little enforcement leverage over ERCOT.“You are the chair, I would contend you are choosing not to leverage the authority we have given you. That is a serious problem," Sen. Brandon Creighton said.The outages lasted days for millions of Texas homes, and millions more lost water as water treatment plants shutdown and miles of pipes burst across the state. The toll of the storm included at least 15 hypothermia-related deaths around Houston, said Democratic state Rep. Ana Hernandez, vice chairwoman of the House State Affairs committee.The crisis has put Texas' power and fossil fuel industry under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers who reap millions of dollars in unlimited political contributions from energy interests, more than any other sector.Since 2017, Vistra Energy and its political action committee has donated more than $1.4 million to Texas politicians and groups associated with both political parties, according to state campaign finance records. Lawmakers also heard early Thursday from the top executive of NRG Energy, which has donated more than $405,000 since 2017, including $30,000 to Abbott.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-at-fault-investigation-into-texas-blackout-begins-101614300733233.html
26-02-2021||World||US bombs facilities in Syria used by Iran-back militia||The United States launched airstrikes in Syria on Thursday, targeting facilities used by Iranian-backed militia groups. The Pentagon said the strikes were in retaliation for a rocket attack in Iraq earlier this month that killed one civilian contractor and wounded a US service member and other coalition troops.The airstrike was the first military action undertaken by the Biden administration, which in its first weeks has emphasized its intent to put more focus on the challenges posed by China, even as Mideast threats persist.“This proportionate military response was conducted together with diplomatic measures , including consultation with coalition partners,” the Pentagon's chief spokesman, John Kirby, said in announcing the strikes.“The operation sends an unambiguous message: President Biden will act to protect American and coalition personnel. At the same time, we have acted in a deliberate manner that aims to deescalate the overall situation in eastern Syria and Iraq.”.Biden administration officials condemned the Feb. 15 rocket attack near the city of Irbil in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish-run region, but as recently as this week officials indicated they had not determined for certain who carried it out. Officials have noted that in the past, Iranian-backed Shiite militia groups have been responsible for numerous rocket attacks that targeted US personnel or facilities in Iraq.Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, had said Tuesday that Iraq is in charge of investigating the Feb. 15 attack.“Right now, we’re not able to give you a certain attribution as to who was behind these attacks, what groups, and I’m not going to get into the tactical details of every bit of weaponry used here," Kirby said. "Let’s let the investigations complete and conclude, and then when we have more to say, we will.”A little-known Shiite militant group calling itself Saraya Awliya al-Dam, Arabic for Guardians of Blood Brigade, claimed responsibility for the Feb. 15 attack. A week later, a rocket attack in Baghdad's Green Zone appeared to target the U.S. Embassy compound, but no one was hurt.Iran this week said it has no links to the Guardians of Blood Brigade.The frequency of attacks by Shiite militia groups against US targets in Iraq diminished late last year ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration, though now Iran is pressing America to return to Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal. The US under the previous Trump administration blamed Iran-backed groups for carrying out the attacks. Tensions soared after a Washington-directed drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and powerful Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis last year.Trump had said the death of a US contractor would be a red line and provoke US escalation in Iraq. The December 2019 killing of a US civilian contractor in a rocket attack in Kirkuk sparked a tit-for-tat fight on Iraqi soil that brought the country to the brink of a proxy war.US forces have been significantly reduced in Iraq to 2,500 personnel and no longer partake in combat missions with Iraqi forces in ongoing operations against the Islamic State group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bombs-facilities-in-syria-used-by-iran-back-militia-101614300364252.html

The release also was delayed as Salman's son and the de facto ruler of the Kingdom, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, underwent surgery earlier this week, the person said."The contact with the Saudis is very important," said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.It was yet not clear if the call would take place later on Thursday, possibly leading to the report's release on Friday.The report is a declassified version of a top-secret US intelligence assessment that sources say singles out the crown prince, known in the West as MbS, for approving the Oct. 2, 2018, murder of Khashoggi in the Kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.Khashoggi, who wrote Washington Post columns critical of the crown prince's policies, had been a US resident.The release of the declassified report on his death - mandated by a 2019 defense bill - is part of Biden's recalibration of US-Saudi relations in part over Khashoggi's murder.But Biden has made clear that he wants to maintain strong ties with one of Washington's closest Arab allies."Our administration is focused on recalibrating the relationship," Psaki told a White House briefing. "And certainly there are areas where we will express concerns and leave open the option of accountability.""There are also areas where we will continue to work with Saudi Arabia given the threats they face in the region," she added in an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia's main rival, Iran."There are a range of actions that are on the table" regarding Saudi Arabia," Psaki said, adding that the next step was for Biden to speak to Salman "very soon."Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi mission. There, he was killed by an MbS-linked team of Saudi operatives, who dismembered his body. It has never been found.Saudi Arabia called Khashoggi's death a "rogue" extradition operation gone awry, but denied the crown prince was involved.Five people were convicted of the murder and given the death penalty in a 2019 trial, but their sentences were commuted to 20 years in jail after Khashoggi's family forgave them. Three other received sentences totaling 24 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-call-with-saudi-king-expected-very-soon-says-white-house-ahead-of-report-on-khashoggi-murder-101614298644009.html
26-02-2021||World||United States loosens Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine shipping regulations||U.S. regulators are allowing Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine to be shipped and stored at less-frigid temperatures, which should ease distribution and administration of one of the two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the country.The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that it’s allowing the additional option after reviewing new data from New York-based Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech.The FDA said the vaccine, which is shipped in frozen vials, now can be transported and stored for up to two weeks at the temperatures of freezers commonly found in pharmacies. That’s after Pfizer provided the FDA with data on Feb. 19 that showed its vaccine remains stable for up to two weeks at those standard freezer temperatures.Until now, the vaccine was required to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures — from minus 112 degrees to minus 76 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 80 degrees to minus 60 degrees Celsius) — so Pfizer ships the vials in a special thermal container packed with dry ice to maintain that temperature range. That requirement meant vaccination sites had to either obtain expensive ultracold freezers, keep adding dry ice to the shipping container to keep to the correct temperature range, or administer all the doses in each shipment quickly so none spoiled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-loosens-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-shipping-regulations-101614295237027.html
26-02-2021||World||EU vows to speed Covid-19 vaccine roll out, presses drug makers||European Union leaders vowed Thursday to accelerate the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and pressed pharmaceutical companies to respect their delivery commitments, as concern mounts about the spread of new variants of the virus.However, the leaders could offer no prospect of short-term respite for curfew-weary, mask-wearing citizens, many of whom have often worked from home over the last year — if they have not lost their jobs. The leaders also said that restrictions, including on travel, should remain in place in many parts of the 27-nation bloc.Covid-19 has killed more than 531,000 people across the EU.“Our top priority now is speeding up the production and delivery of vaccines and vaccinations,” EU Council President Charles Michel said, adding a warning for vaccine makers: “We want more predictability and transparency to ensure that pharmaceutical companies comply with their commitments.”The European Commission has sealed deals with several companies for well over 2 billion vaccine shots — far more than the EU population of around 450 million — but only three have been authorized: jabs from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca. Officials say the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could be approved next month.But some seniors officials at the big pharmaceutical companies, a few of whom were grilled by EU lawmakers not far from where Michel was chairing the videoconference summit in Brussels, said it's no simple matter to build new vaccine production sites.Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said production problems are inevitable as companies work around the clock to do in one year what normally takes 3-4 years. Most of the company chiefs said they expect an improvement in the second quarter.“Every time there is a human error, equipment breaking down... or raw material from one of our suppliers late by a day, you cannot start making the product because it will not be safe, you will not have the right quality,” Bancel said, explaining the technological issues facing producers.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said a big challenge is to improve yield — the number of doses that can be extracted from a liter of vaccine. He also rejected the idea that companies can simply open new production sites to solve the problem, saying that engineers must spend a lot of time training staff.“Our teams are absolutely stretched to the maximum. There’s no way they could train any more people,” he said. Soriot insisted that most companies developing vaccines probably face the same constraint.Soriot came under fire after he confirmed that the company would deliver less than half the vaccines it had committed to in the first quarter. The EU has partly blamed supply delays for lagging far behind nations like Israel, the United States and Britain when it comes to vaccinations. By early this week, 6.5% of the adults living in the EU had been vaccinated, compared to more than 27% in the U.K.Soriot said AstraZeneca would deliver 40 million doses to the EU in the first quarter, attributing the delay to complicated production issues, including “lower than expected output in our dedicated European supply chain.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted pointedly that in terms of companies honoring the delivery commitments in their contracts with Europe, “there is room for improvement” at AstraZeneca.Still, despite the slow vaccine rollout in Europe, delayed by almost a month compared to former member the U.K., von der Leyen said the bloc still aims to inoculate 70% of all adults — around 255 million people — by September.“This is a goal that we are confident we will reach,” she said.Border checks remain a sore point. Divisions among EU member countries, including Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Czech Republic, on restrictions to stave off transmission has again raised the specter of travel delays and long traffic backups in a bloc that prides itself on being a seamless market.Michel told reporters that “non-essential travel may still need to be restricted, but measures should be proportionate.”The leaders were also updated on the movement of fast-spreading new variants of the virus within Europe, with the so-called U.K variant now present in 26 member countries. The variant first detected in South Africa has been identified in 14, while the Brazilian type is known to be in 7. This means that restrictions could well continue through coming months.“There is a growing Covid fatigue among our citizens. It has been a very trying year, but we should not let up now,” said von der Leyen.Also debated was the issue of "vaccine certificates," which could help smooth a return to air travel and possibly avoid another disastrous summer holiday season, as the tourism industry and broader economies suffer from restrictions.Southern European countries dependent on tourism, like Greece and Spain, support such a system, but their northern EU partners, like Germany, doubt whether the certificates would work.Von der Leyen said it would be technically possible to develop a “green pass” using a minimum of data indicating whether a person has been vaccinated, tested negative, or is immune after contracting the disease, within about three months, but that many political issues must first be resolved.French President Emmanuel Macron insisted the EU nations should move in lockstep.“None of us will accept that to attract tourists, one country would have looser rules than another and would be taking risks by making people come from the other side of the world to fill up its hotels,” he said.“The most important question remains whether you can still transmit the disease. It is a crucial question,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters. He also raised concern about other issues, like the exclusion of those who have not been vaccinated, or cannot be.Rutte also said Europeans should consider whether the discussion on vaccination certificates should involve other international institutions such as the World Health Organization, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Air Transport Association.“You have to be careful that by adding more weight to it, the whole thing does not collapse onto itself,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-vows-to-speed-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-presses-drug-makers-101614289315160.html
26-02-2021||World||US says Khashoggi report will help bring 'accountability'||The United States on Thursday prepared to release intelligence on the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi that is expected to implicate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying the report would help bring accountability.As part of a new focus on human rights, President Joe Biden will imminently declassify the report into the grisly October 2018 murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul of the US-based journalist, who had written critically about Prince Mohammed.Biden will speak "very soon" to King Salman before the release of the report and is weighing additional action, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said."There are a range of actions that are on the table but the first step," she said, "is for the president to speak with the king."State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters the administration would soon have more to say on "steps to promote accountability going forward for this horrific crime.""It's an important step in the direction of transparency. Transparency, as it often is, is an element of accountability," he said of the report's release.On the impact of ties with Saudi Arabia, Price said that Biden "will review the entirety of that relationship to make sure that it advances the interests of the American people and to ensure that it reflects (their) values."The report's release is a sharp departure from the policies of former president Donald Trump, who hailed his close friendship with Saudi Arabia and whose son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, became texting friends with 35-year-old Prince Mohammed.Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday had his own telephone call with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and "discussed the importance of Saudi progress on human rights, including through legal and judicial reforms," Price said.Prince Mohammed, who is considered the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia due to the king's fragile health, has said he accepts Saudi Arabia's overall responsibility but denies a personal link.Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World, an advocacy group founded by Khashoggi, said that Biden needed to take action beyond sending the report to Congress."President Biden should now fulfill his promise to hold MBS accountable for this murder by, at minimum, imposing the same sanctions on him as those imposed on his underlying culprits and ending the weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia that would be controlled by an unelected, brutal murderer," she said.Five people were handed death sentences over Khashoggi's killing but a Saudi court in September overturned them while giving jail terms of up to 20 years to eight unnamed defendants following secretive legal proceedings.Human rights advocates called the judicial process a whitewash aimed at blaming the hitmen while not touching the mastermind.CNN, quoting documents filed in a Canadian civil lawsuit, reported that two private jets used by the squad that allegedly flew to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi were owned by a company earlier seized by Prince Mohammed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-khashoggi-report-will-help-bring-accountability-101614289062316.html
26-02-2021||World||Medical oxygen scarce in Africa, Latin America amid Covid-19 crisis||A crisis over the supply of medical oxygen for coronavirus patients has struck nations in Africa and Latin America, where warnings went unheeded at the start of the pandemic and doctors say the shortage has led to unnecessary deaths.It takes about 12 weeks to install a hospital oxygen plant and even less time to convert industrial oxygen manufacturing systems into a medical-grade network. But in Brazil and Nigeria, as well as in less-populous nations, decisions to fully address inadequate supplies only started being made last month, after hospitals were overwhelmed and patients started to die.The gap in medical oxygen availability “is one of the defining health equity issues, I think, of our age,” said Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who said he survived a severe coronavirus infection thanks to the oxygen he received.Doctors in Nigeria anxiously monitor traffic as oxygen deliveries move through the gridlocked streets of Lagos. Desperate families of patients around the world sometimes turn to the black market. Governments take action only after hospitals are overwhelmed and the infected die by the dozens.In Brazil’s Amazonas state, a pair of swindlers were caught reselling fire extinguishers painted to look like medical oxygen tanks. In Peru, people camped out in lines to get cylinders for sick relatives.Only after the lack of oxygen was blamed for the deaths of four people at an Egyptian hospital in January and six people at one in Pakistan in December did governments address the problems.John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said medical oxygen is a “huge critical need” across the continent of 1.3 billion people and is a main reason that Covid-19 patients are more likely to die there during surges.Even before the pandemic, sub-Saharan Africa’s 2,600 oxygen concentrators and 69 functioning oxygen plants met less than half the need, leading to preventable deaths, especially from pneumonia, said Dr. John Adabie Appiah of the World Health Organization.The number of concentrators has grown to about 6,000, mostly from international donations, but the oxygen produced isn't pure enough for the critically ill. The number of plants that can generate higher concentrations is now at 119.Yet without formal requests from governments, nearly $20 billion in World Bank coronavirus funds for the world’s poorest countries remains unspent so far, the organization told The Associated Press.Nigeria was “struggling to find oxygen to manage cases” in January, said Chikwe Ihekweazu, head of its Centre for Disease Control.A main hospital in Lagos, a city of 14.3 million, saw its January virus cases increase fivefold, with 75 medical workers infected in the first six weeks of 2021. Only then did President Muhammadu Buhari release $17 million to set up 38 more oxygen plants and another $670,000 to repair plants at five hospitals.Some oxygen suppliers have dramatically raised prices, according to a doctor at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to talk to reporters. That has driven up the cost of a cylinder by 10 times, to $260 — more than the average monthly wage — and a critically ill patient could need up to four cylinders a day.Money and influence don't always help.Femi Odekunle, a Nigerian academic and close ally of the president, went without adequate oxygen for nearly 12 days at the Abuja University Teaching Hospital until two state governors and Ministry of Health officials intervened. He died anyway, and relatives and friends blame the oxygen shortage, the Premium Times newspaper reported. The hospital attributed his death to his severe infection.In Malawi, the president promised funding for protective gear for medical workers and the immediate purchase of 1,000 oxygen cylinders.Corruption was blamed for defects in a new oxygen plant at a hospital in Uganda's capital of Kampala, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported. Workers had to rely on rusty oxygen cylinders blamed for the deaths of at least two patients.“While top health officials basked in the oxygen of good publicity, patients were literally choking to death,” the newspaper said.Leith Greenslade of the Every Breath Counts Coalition, which advocates for wider access to medical oxygen, said the looming shortages were apparent last spring.“Very little was done. Now you have a second wave, not just in Africa but in Latin America and Asia, and the oxygen shortages are becoming at crisis levels,” she said.The World Bank has set aside $50 billion for the world’s poorest countries alone during the pandemic, and $30.8 billion has been allocated, including $80 million for oxygen-related upgrades.“We make money available for countries, but it’s countries, governments who have to make a decision about how much they spend and what they spend it on,” said Dr. Mickey Chopra, who helps with the World Bank’s global medical logistics response.A global task force focusing on oxygen was formally announced Thursday and will include the World Health Organization and World Bank, among others. Already, $90 million was identified in immediate oxygen funding needs for 20 developing countries, including Nigeria and Malawi.Many countries view oxygen supplies primarily as an industrial product for more lucrative sectors such as mining, not health care, and it has not been a focus of many international donors. Oxygen manufacturing plants require technicians, good infrastructure and electricity — all in short supply in developing nations.The main provider of medical oxygen to Brazil’s Amazonas state, White Martins, operated at half capacity before the pandemic. The first infections hit the isolated city in March and led to so many deaths that a cemetery was carved out of the jungle.Doctors in its capital of Manaus were forced last month to choose which patients to treat as oxygen supplies dwindled.Brazil’s Supreme Court began an investigation into management of the crisis after White Martins said an “unexpected increase in demand” led to shortages.“There was a lack of planning on behalf of the government,” said Newton de Oliveira, president of Indústria Brasileira de Gases, a major oxygen supplier.Only after deaths averaged 50 a day did the government say it would build 73 oxygen plants in the state. Within a month, 26 were up and running.Oxygen shortages remain critical in Peru, where Dani Luz Llamocca waited five days outside a distribution center in Lima, saying her virus-stricken father was down to less than half a tank of oxygen. She was willing to wait as long as it took. "If not, my father will die,” said Llamocca.In all, health experts estimate that 500,000 patients in developing countries currently need 1.1 million oxygen cylinders a day.The WHO's Appiah said countries with mining industries could convert their systems to produce medical-grade oxygen. India's national trade body for gas makers suggested that last April and industrial storage tanks were repurposed at hospitals, said Surendra Singh, a manager at the multinational Linde corporation.“It’s not rocket science,” said Saket Tiku, president of the All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association. “The decision saved thousands of lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-oxygen-scarce-in-africa-latin-america-amid-covid-19-crisis-101614278206821.html
26-02-2021||India||February temperature in Bhubaneswar crosses 40 degree mark, highest in 58 years||With the maximum temperature in Bhubaneswar touching 40.4 degrees Celsius on Friday, its highest temperature of February in the last 58 years, the state school and mass education department ordered that classes of students from class 9 to 12 be held from morning hours with effect from March 1.After topping the temperature chart in the country for the last 2 days, the mercury in Bhubaneswar on Friday shot past 40 degree Celsius. Though Jaisalmer in Rajasthan was the hottest city in the country with 43.1°C, in Bhubaneswar the maximum temperature was its highest for the month of February since February 23, 1963 when the mercury had climbed to 42.7 degrees Celsius.On Wednesday, the capital city of Odisha recorded 38 degrees Celsius while on Thursday the maximum temperature recorded was 39.4 degrees Celsius, the highest in the country on both days.With other cities in the state recording a rise in daytime temperature, the school and mass education department announced that classes 9 and 11 would be held between 7 am and 9 am. Similarly, classes 10 and 12 will be held between 9 am and 11 am.Weather officials said the rise in maximum day time temperature in Bhubaneswar was due to several factors. “A high-pressure zone extending up to Jharkhand and West Bengal exists over Bhubaneswar. Due to the presence of the high-pressure zone, the air parcels sink downward (towards Earth’s surface), and as a result adiabatic warming takes place. Moreover, factors like solar radiation (Insolation) and lighter wind add up to the heat. These phenomena together are behind the rise in city temperature to around 40 degree Celsius,” said IMD Bhubaneswar director HR Biswas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/february-temperature-in-bhubaneswar-crosses-40-degree-mark-highest-in-58-years-101614362428714.html

Though the numbers were not high, it had spread panic.On Friday, 34 new cases were detected as positive in the state taking the total to 217,518 cases. One death was also recorded in Assam taking the death toll to 1092. At present, the state has 287 positive cases.Till Friday, 1,95,807 people had been vaccinated with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine while 27,743 had got their second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-puts-decision-of-no-covid-19-tests-at-airports-railway-stations-on-hold-101614361704290.html

It has only said that those who will get their shots at private hospitals will have to pay.Health ministry says over 1.37 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses administeredFor the first phase of vaccination, which began on January 16, India procured the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute, at the cost of ₹200, excluding taxes. It was a discounted offer for the government, as it was said. For other countries, the price is around ₹400 per dose. But the government may cap the price once it is available in the market. One dose of Covaxin, produced by Bharat Biotech, will also cost around ₹295.For the first time, vaccines will be available at private hospitals starting from March 1. Senior citizens, and people above the age of 45 years with co-morbidities will be able to register themselves to get the vaccine shots. The parallel process of inoculating frontline workers free of cost will also go on.The move to rope in private hospitals where vaccines will be available for priority groups gives a shot in the arm of the vaccination process, which has already covered 1.34 crore doses as on Friday evening.Not only in India, Serum Institute — the world's largest vaccine producer by the volume of doses produced, is playing a major role in global vaccine distribution. British-Swedish pharma giant AstraZeneca and US pharma company Novavax have said that they can scale up their vaccine production to over 300 million doses in partnership with Serum Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/honour-to-meet-you-adar-poonawalla-briefs-amit-shah-on-vaccine-capacity-101614359395876.html
26-02-2021||India||Former CECs say decision to hold 8 phases of polling in WB must have been based on assessment of law and order situation||As the EC's decision to hold assembly elections in West Bengal in eight phases triggered sharp criticism from the state chief minister and others, two former chief election commissioners on Friday justified the move, saying that the decision must have been based on a law and order situation assessment while another CEC advocated single-phase election given that rumours fly thick and fast in this age of social media.Referring to seven-phase voting in West Bengal during 2016 assembly polls, former CECs --O P Rawat and N Gopalaswami-- noted that whenever the EC feels there is enhanced security requirements based on ground realities, it takes these precautions.Though he noted that the EC's decision must be based on its assessment of the law and order situation and availability of security forces, S Y Quraishi, who was the CEC from July 30, 2010 to June 10, 2012, said in the age of social media wherein all kinds of rumours fly thick and fast during elections, there should be an attempt to reduce the duration and number of phases."Ideally, it should be a single-phase election," he added.The Election Commission on Friday announced the poll schedule for five assemblies --Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry-- with West Bengal to have the maximum eight phases from March 27.Immediately after the announcement, TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee criticised the EC decision and said she suspects that the dates were announced as per the suggestions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for better management of the BJP's poll campaign.Senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar also attacked the EC, alleging that the poll panel has tried to help the BJP."I believe it has been done deliberately and in a way, the EC has tried to help the BJP. They (BJP) feel that it will help them, but it will not as far as I know about the people of Bengal. They are revolutionary in nature...they may deviate for some time but ultimately, Bengal is Bengal," Anwar said.Justifying the poll panel's decision, Rawat said,"the EC in its own wisdom might have felt this time it is more contentious and so more security measures required. Accordingly, it has decided to hold the elections in eight phases.”Rawat, who joined the poll panel in 2015 and retired as the CEC in December 2018, said, "whenever the Commission feels there is requirement of more security so that nobody faces any problem, it takes those precautions.”Asserting that it was for the EC, based on ground realities, to assess, Gopalaswami, who headed the poll panel from 30 June 2006 to 20 April 2009, said look at the number of polling stations (in West Bengal) which have been increased due to Covid (distancing norms), one will get the answer."You need forces. West Bengal is much bigger in size and needs a higher number of central forces. The total number of polling stations in West Bengal is 1,01,916 instead of 77,413 in 2016 polls -- an increase of 31.65 per cent. Due to COVID norms, the number of voters per polling station has been restricted to 1000 from 1500," he added.Quraishi said the commission's decision to hold the election in eight phases spread over a month must be based on its assessment of the law and order situation and availability of security forces."Bengal has the tradition of multi-phase elections," he said, adding that there is not much difference between seven and eight phases.Quraishi, however, advocated holding elections in a single phase. "In the age of social media wherein all kinds of rumours fly thick and fast, there will be an attempt to reduce the duration of elections and number of phases. With more paramilitary forces being available …, one hope as soon as possible the number of phases will be reduced. Ideally, it should be a single-phase election," he said.The EC said the assembly polls in 294 constituencies in West Bengal will be held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29. The counting of votes will take place on May 2, along with that of Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Polling in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry will be held in one phase on April 6, while Assam will go to polls in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6.Reacting to the EC's decision, Banerjee said, "with all due respect to the Commission, I want to say that questions are being raised on why elections will be held in so many phases in Bengal while other states will be voting in one phase. If EC doesn't provide justice to the people, where will the people go."“I have information from my sources that the poll dates are similar to the ones BJP wanted. Have the dates been announced as per the suggestions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah? The PM and the home minister cannot misuse their power for the state elections," she claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-cecs-say-decision-to-hold-8-phases-of-polling-in-wb-must-have-been-based-on-assessment-of-law-and-order-situation-101614357638397.html

I am confident that MSMEs will stand together in generating and consuming solar power using their rooftops."The minister observed that a large amount (average ₹8 and higher per unit) is being paid by the MSMEs for power consumption, which contributes to up to one-fifth of the overall production costs. "To assist MSMEs in implementing rooftop solar projects, the ministry is working with the World Bank on a credit guarantee program to make financing accessible to unrated MSMEs. Considering the rates of solar power from large utility power plants have come down to a record INR 1.99/kWh, MSMEs must leverage this opportunity to bring down their energy expenses," he said. Addressing the event, Junaid Ahmad, Country Director India, World Bank, said the World Bank is committed to the cause of MSMEs and an investment in this industry will aid India's aim to become 'Aatmanirbhar' or 'self-reliant'. "By facilitating MSMEs to decarbonise their power consumption in a sustainable manner, India can achieve a twin objective of greening the economy and uplifting MSMEs to become highly competitive by reducing its power costs," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-urges-msmes-to-avail-concessional-finance-and-install-rooftop-solar-101614358358109.html

People of Chhattisgarh have caused loss to you (by electing Congress) so you will not give free vaccine here? We don't have a dearth of funds. We have kept (funds) for it," he said."If the Union government refuses (to provide free vaccine to all), then we would facilitate Covid vaccination of people in the state at our own expenses," Baghel said.Reiterating his government's decision to use Covaxin vaccine in the state only after its third phase of trial, the CM questioned why Covaxin had been administers to only one per cent of people inoculated in 11 states so far.Baghel said the Central government had earlier agreed to take 60 lakh tonnes of rice from Chhattisgarh in the central pool for the Kharif marketing year 2020-21, but, as of now, permission has been given to deposit only 24 lakh tonnes.He asked the opposition BJP to take up the matter with the Centre.The CM said his government's new industrial policy enacted in 2019 ensured the establishment of 1,249 units in the state, while 104 MoUs signed for mega industrial projects would lead to a capital investment of ₹42,417 crore."We have set a target to establish 200 food parks and locations for 111 have been identified," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cgarh-govt-will-bear-cost-of-covid-19-vaccination-says-chief-minister-101614357621569.html

The police, who made heavy security arrangements to prevent any untoward incident, later dispersed the agitating workers.“Similar protest demonstrations were held by various opposition parties in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Krishna districts to express solidarity with us,” said J Ayodhya Ramu, president of the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the leading trade union in the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.The trade unions called for a Visakhapatnam shutdown on March 5 as part of intensifying the agitation against the steel plant privatisation. “We shall not give up our fight,” he said.Ramu pointed out that the steel plant had achieved a turnover of ₹1600 crore in the last 25 days, even after the announcement made by the Centre on the privatisation of the steel plant. “We are confident of achieving an annual turnover of ₹20,000 crore. Why should the Centre kill this golden goose?” he asked.Ignoring the continuous protests by the workers of the steel plant, the Centre has begun the exercise of disinvestment in the steel plant. “According to the information we received, the Centre has recently formed an inter-ministerial group comprising senior officials from steel, finance, industries and DIPAM (Department of Investment and Public Asset Management) to work out the modalities for disinvestment,” the trade union leader said.The committee, which also includes chairman and director (finance) of the RINL, would make an assessment of the assets and liabilities of the company, including the value of the machinery and the land and submit the details to the Centre to prepare the bid document before inviting private bidders.The outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) on Friday extended its wholehearted support to the agitating workers of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant against its privatisation.In a statement released to the media, Kailasam, official spokesman of CPI (Maoist) Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee, alleged that the Narendra Modi government was completely surrendering the nation’s sovereignty to the corporate forces led by Ambanis and Adanis.He asked the steel plant workers to take up the struggle to fight against the undemocratic decision of the Modi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/workers-block-nh-16-call-for-bandh-to-protest-privatisation-of-vizag-steel-101614345333111.html

26-02-2021||India||'Bharat Vyapar Bandh' evokes lukewarm response||The day-long 'Bharat Vyapar Bandh' called by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) evoked a lukewarm response with most shops and commercial establishments open through the day.The traders' body, however, claimed that shopkeepers supported its nationwide business shutdown call to protest against issues related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and "unethical business practices of foreign e-commerce companies".Various markets in the national capital were open on Friday during the Bandh with many saying that despite supporting the cause, they did not want to suffer another day of losses.However, CAIT in a statement said the shutdown was a "grand success" as more than 8 crore small businesses belonging to about 40,000 trade associations across the country kept their shutters down and no trading activity took place in any commercial market.Brijesh Goyal, president of Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI), said most of the markets in Delhi were open but the association extended its support to the nationwide business shutdown."Around 98 per cent markets, hotels, restaurants and industrial areas were open except in some parts of Chawri Bazaar and Karol Bagh. However, they have extended their support. We also held a protest at Kashmiri Gate around 12.30 pm," Goyal said.Although various market bodies said they support the cause for the Bandh, they could not shut down their shops or outlets due to multiple reasons.The Bandh was not enforced at Connaught Place market."We are completely in support of the cause. However, it was not practically feasible to enforce the 'Bandh' in the market this time. The traders are already reeling under the losses they incurred during the lockdown and they have heavy burden of rents. We completely support the cause and feel the demands are right," said Atul Bhargava, President, New Delhi Traders Association.Echoing similar views, Sanjeev Mehra, President, Khan Market Association, said the issue is very genuine but the traders are already suffering and did not want to add another day of losses. So they did not participate in the Bandh.However, traders across Odisha downed shutters and commercial vehicles remained off the roads in the state in solidarity with the nationwide 12-hour shutdown on Friday.The Bandh was observed for demanding simplification of the GST procedure and the e-way bill mechanism, among other issues.Around 20 lakh shops and business establishments were closed throughout the state, and there was no report of any untoward incident till afternoon.The impact of the shutdown was felt in several places, including Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Rourkela, Sambalpur, Balasore and Berhampur.On the other hand, business remained unaffected in Madhya Pradesh's business capital Indore.According to local traders, businesses had already incurred losses due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown and they didn't want to down their shutters.The nationwide shutdown impacted other parts of Madhya Pradesh barring Indore, where political reasons and pressure made the difference, CAIT district president Mohammed Peethawala said."We have been registering our opposition over the GST's anomalies since long. But we are not in support of a Bandh on this issue right now," said Ramesh Khandelwal, President of Ahilya Chambers of Commerce and Industries.Traders have suffered heavy losses due to the coronavirus outbreak since last year and they don't want to incur more damages by participating in the Bandh, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-vyapar-bandh-evokes-lukewarm-response-101614348679031.html

26-02-2021||India||Sexual harassment complaints not to brushed under carpet: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday underlined that sexual harassment complaints cannot be brushed under the carpet while hearing a retired Madhya Pradesh district judge’s plea against an inquiry against him for allegedly harassing a judicial officer.A Gender Sensitization Internal Complaint Committee (GSICC) in April 2019 did not find substance in the officer’s complaint that he had sent her lewd messages on WhatsApp but recommended disciplinary proceedings against Shambhoo Singh Raghuvanshi, the judge.The court was not inclined to entertain Raghuvanshi’s petition as it did not wish to come in the way of the inquiry. A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, noted that soon after the allegation surfaced, a discreet inquiry conducted by the Madhya Pradesh high court had recorded an adverse finding against the petitioner.The bench told R Balasubramanian, who appeared for Raghuvanshi: “You are walking on very thin ice. As matters stand now, you are convicted. During the (disciplinary) enquiry, you may have a chance to be acquitted.” The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was willing to pass a short order to this effect. But acting on the advice of the court, the petitioner’s lawyer was allowed to withdraw the petition.The GSICC, in its final report, said, “There is nothing available on the record to hold that any of the charges levelled by the complainant against the respondent are made out.” During the proceedings, the complainant moved an application for conciliation and to end the inquiry without proceeding further. However, this application was dismissed by the Committee.The petitioner wondered how despite recording a finding of “no evidence”, the Committee did a volte-face by recommending disciplinary action. This mandate was not available to the Committee under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, his petition stated.The High Court, represented by senior advocate Ravindra Srivastava, informed the top court that the disciplinary proceedings are independent of the GSICC proceedings. He added the proceedings have been initiated to probe grounds of misconduct. Even if the complainant does not wish to pursue the complaint, the High Court is at liberty to conduct these proceedings, Srivastava added.On an earlier date when the case was taken up, Srivastava read portions of the WhatsApp messages. “This atmosphere of work is not conducive for judicial functioning,” Srivastava said. Even the bench agreed, saying, “Such conduct on part of a judge with a junior officer is not acceptable.”The petitioner claimed to have an unblemished service record of 32 years and argued that when he was due for elevation to the High Court, the sexual harassment allegation was levelled against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sexual-harassment-complaints-not-to-brushed-under-carpet-sc-101614343018831.html

He has given the department-wise data. Let them go and verify the records, instead of throwing meaningless challenges,” TRS legislator and spokesman Balka Suman said.The TRS leader demanded that the Congress and the BJP leaders should first disclose how many government jobs were created in the states ruled by their parties. “The vacancies filled in Telangana are much more than in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh,” he said.Suman called upon the graduates to defeat the Congress and the BJP candidates in the MLC elections as the parties were misleading the people by making false allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-trs-spar-over-creation-of-govt-jobs-in-telangana-in-last-six-years-101614341487127.html

The couple also complained to the court that they were facing threats.” He added people did not have faith in the police that they will conduct a fair and neutral investigation. “Hence, we want a court-monitored CBI investigation.”Reddy accused police of trying to shield the TRS leaders allegedly involved in the murders. He added a larger conspiracy behind the murders needs to be exposed while wondering why chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao has not spoken over the matter.TRS did not immediately respond to the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-cong-seeks-court-monitored-cbi-probe-into-lawyer-couple-s-murders-101614341818685.html

My struggle is not against any person, but it is dedicated to the ideology of the Congress. I am ready to suffer any political damage for that,” he wrote. “Many big politicians say Nathuram Godse was the first terrorist of India, but why they are silent over the induction of admirer of Godse into the Congress.”Yadav questioned will the Congress accept lawmaker Pragya Thakur, who called Godse a patriot and prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say he would not forgive her, if she joins the party.Also Read | Juvenile convict to be let off with fine in 22-year-old murder caseBabulal Chaurasiya was inducted into the Congress in the presence of former chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday.“During his tenure...

He clearly said he was misguided by Hindu Mahasabha and he believes in the Gandhian ideology and had nothing to do with Godse and RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh].”State minister Vishwas Sarang said the Congress is facing an existential crisis. “The party leaders are fighting with each other for the posts.

This will be possible as the government has decided to unbundle certain services and make them chargeable on an opt-in basis, as per the feedback received from passengers.According to a circular issued by the aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on Friday, “It is felt at many times that these services provided by the airlines may not be required by the passengers while travelling. Considering the fact that unbundling of services and charges thereto has the potential to make basic fare more affordable and provide consumers an option of paying for the services which he/ she wishes to avail, it has been decided by the government to allow check- in baggage charges separately.” Also Read | Bengaluru airport installs disabled aircraft recovery kitDGCA director general Arun Kumar said, “The aim is to bring in this unbundling rule, and is issued with immediate effect.”Elaborating on this rule, DGCA said, “As part of airline baggage policy, scheduled airlines will be allowed to offer free baggage allowance as well as zero baggage/ no check-in baggage fares”. This will be subject to the condition that the passengers booking tickets under such fare scheme are made aware of the charges that shall be applicable if they turned up with baggage check-in at the airline counter. These applicable charges will be reasonable, prominently displayed to the passenger at the time of booking of ticket and also to be printed on the ticket.” The government has also allowed services like seat preference, meal/ snack (except water), sports equipment, musical instrument carriage, free for a special declaration of valuable baggage, to be charged separately by the airlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flyers-to-soon-get-concession-on-fares-for-travelling-without-check-in-baggage-101614336478458.html
26-02-2021||India||The importance of caste census and its political implications||There have been growing demands for a caste census with the general census in 2022 since Justice G Rohini-led commission submitted a draft proposal recommending a sub-categorisation of the reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC). The OBC reservation has always been a touchy political issue and demands for giving the quota benefits to the “real” deprived among them have gained traction primarily as they are seen as a new vote bank. A low-down on the debate:Sub-categorisation of OBC reservationIt has been felt for years that only a few affluent communities, around 100, among the more than 2,633 on the central list of OBCs have gained most from the 27% OBC reservation. The reservation was implemented on the basis of the 1931 caste census, which found 52% of Indians were OBC and did not fall in the category of scheduled castes or tribes. The government adopted the Mandal Commission recommendation to provide the 27% reservation. In 2008, the OBC reservation was extended to admissions to institutes of higher education.There have been demands for creating categories within OBCs to ensure equitable distribution of the quota benefit to all. Some states such as Bihar have experimented with the sub-categorisation and carved the reservation for extremely backward classes within the OBC reservation. In October 2017, the Centre constituted the Rohini commission to examine the sub-categorisation and submit a report within 12 weeks. Since then, the commission has been given 10 extensions.What has the Rohini Commission recommended?Around 2,633 castes are covered under the OBC reservation. The states have the flexibility to add castes to the central list depending on local deprivation levels determined by local OBC commissions. In February 2021, the Rohini commission proposed to divide the 27% reservation for the castes on the Central list into four sub-categories.In 2018, the commission analysed the data of 13,00,00 central jobs and admissions to central higher education institutions under the OBC quota over the preceding five years. It found that 97% of all jobs and educational seats have gone to just 25% of all sub-castes classified. And 24.95% of these jobs and seats went to just 10 OBC communities. The commission also said that 983 OBC communities, one-third of the total, had almost had zero representation in jobs and admissions in educational institutions.Response to Rohini Commission draftChief ministers including Nitish Kumar of Bihar and Jagan Mohan Reddy of Andhra Pradesh have welcomed the idea. Kumar has been the original proponent of the sub-categorisation and has provided 18% of the OBC quota in Bihar to 113 extremely backward castes, who constitute about 30% of the state’s population. The Congress and Samajwadi Party have also welcomed the sub-categorisation but said they would provide a detailed response when the commission’s draft is made public. They have underlined the idea should be taken forward after a fresh caste census.The caste census demandExperts believe the idea of sub-categorisation would be a meaningless exercise without the caste census that could help the government understand the exact deprivation levels. They also say it would perpetuate the historical injustice as those deprived among OBCs can be left out because the present reservation is based on the 1931 caste census when India’s population was 270 million. The 1931 caste census included present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh also.India’s population has since increased three-fold to 1.21 billion in 2011. Experts believe the economic status of the dominant OBC castes have improved in the past 80 years and certain castes have not benefitted as much. So, they want a new caste census that also measures the economic and social well-being of all castes. Amid growing political pressure, then Union home minister Rajnath Singh in August 2018 announced that in census 2021, data of OBCs will also be collected. However, the government has been silent on the issue since then.2011 caste census statusThe Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government decided to conduct independent India’s first caste census in 2010 along with the socio-economic census to determine the deprivation levels. OBC leaders such as Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav, and Nitish Kumar supported the decision.While the socio-economic census details were publicly shared. The only information provided about the caste census was there were 46,00,00 castes, sub-castes, and gotras. The Registrar General of India, mandated to conduct the census, found a defect in caste data related to every fourth household – 80 million out of the total 330 million. About 67 million errors were rectified while another 14 million were pending.A committee headed by then Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panigariya was set up in July 2015 for sorting the vast database. The committee gave its initial report in 2017 before Panigariya left but it has not been made public. He had earlier told HT that formatting the data into a cohesive document was difficult as no thought was given on how the data could be used before the enumeration started. “There were no clear fields in the enumeration charts,” he had said.Experts believe that sharing the data could create more divide in the society and demands for reducing quota for certain castes and increasing for others. There is also fear that a repeat of the 1911 caste census can happen when the so-called upper castes were declared a social minority.Political implicationsThe 1931 census was conducted to identify the ways through which colonial power could strengthen control. The data was used to create a separate vote-bank in the 1980s by leaders, who emerged from Jai Prakash Narayan’s anti-corruption movement and led to the creation of Janata Dal. Something similar is being attempted now through the sub-categorisation of the OBC quota. Political parties know that the new caste census can help them to create a new vote-bank of socially and economically deprived sections among the OBCs. Nitish Kumar has been able to carve such a vote-bank for his party, the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar. Many believe that in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has done well politically as it was able to bring the upper castes and socially deprived OBCs together. In Madhya Pradesh, a similar experiment has worked in Vindhya and Mahakoshal regions of the state, turning them into a BJP bastion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/importance-of-caste-census-and-its-political-implications-101614336418488.html
26-02-2021||India||India-Pak ceasefire agreement rekindles hope for peace among border residents||The announcement by India and Pakistan to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and other sectors has rekindled hope for a peaceful future among border residents in Jammu and Kashmir who have been living under constant fear of firing and shelling."We are joyous over the news of a fresh agreement between the two countries to observe complete ceasefire along the borderline. It has rekindled hope among us," Kalal-resident Mohmmad Isaaq said.Isaaq hoped that Pakistan would keep its promise of complete observance of the ceasefire agreement."We hope Pakistan keeps the promise of not firing on us. We do not feel that they will religiously observe ceasefire. They have made such promises in the past as well, only to violate them," he said.For the past few years, Pakistan has engaged in shelling and firing along the LoC and the International Border (IB) resulting in casualties, damage to houses, schools, health centres and religious places."We have suffered a lot to due Pakistani firing and shelling.... Education of kids was affected. Houses were damaged. There were casualties. The fresh agreement of maintaining complete ceasefire is a happy news for us. Hope it stays," Sarpanch Bhawani in Rajouri district Sunil Kumar said.Subash Chander, a Panch, said although they are very happy over the news, but it is difficult to trust Pakistan.Similar apprehension was raised by Kerni-resudent Mohmmad Ashraf who welcomed the fresh agreement but raised question over the intention of Pakistan.Kiran Kumar, a Kathua District Development Council (DDC) member, says that it is a happy news for border residents. "We thank the central government for this decision. We want Pakistan to behave as a good neighbour by ensuring zero firing from their side. Farmers will fearlessly cultivate their lands on border. Life will be better," he said.India and Pakistan on Thursday announced that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.A joint statement issued in Islamabad and New Delhi said the Director Generals of Military Operations of the two countries held discussions over the established mechanism of hotline contact and reviewed the situation along the LoC and all other sectors in a "free, frank and cordial" atmosphere.India and Pakistan signed a ceasefire agreement in 2003, but it has hardly been followed in letter and spirit over past several years with more violations than observance of the pact.In written response to a question in Lok Sabha earlier this month, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said a total of 10,752 cases of ceasefire violations have taken place along India's border with Pakistan in the last three years, in which 72 security personnel and 70 civilians were killed.He said 364 security personnel and 341 civilians were injured in cross-border firings along the International Border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018, 2019 and 2020.India shares a 3,323-km border with Pakistan, of which 221 km of the IB and 740 km of the LoC fall in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiapak-ceasefire-agreement-rekindles-hope-for-peace-among-border-residents-101614335305209.html

26-02-2021||India||Maoist violence on the decline in Chhattisgarh||There has been a significant decline in gunbattles between security forces and Maoists in Left-wing insurgency-hit Chhattisgarh over the last few years, according to the state police data. The number of gunbattles came down to 84 last year compared to 121 in 2019, 166 in 2018, 198 in 2017, and 211 in 2016 even as officials cautioned against reading too much into the data.Multiple officials said the decrease could also be because of less engagement of security forces in core areas with Maoists and defensive counter-insurgency strategy. “...tactically Maoists are also not engaging the police until they are in a very dominant position. There was hardly any engagement between the Maoists and the forces in 2019...,” said an official on condition of anonymity.A second official said the Maoists adopted a wait-and-watch strategy to understand the new government that was voted to power in the state in 2018. “Many Maoist leaders were of the opinion that a soft pro-tribal government has come in the state and they should not do anything to annoy it....but the killing of Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker Bhima Mandavi [in 2019] led to change in the stance,” said the official posted in Maoist-hit Bastar region.A third officer said the Maoists also face a fund crunch because of the 2016 demonetisation of high-value currency notes and the Covid-19 pandemic. “....[They] thus want road construction and other activities to continue in lieu of levy...there is marked decrease in arson. Maoists are mainly depending on low-intensity conflict....biding time to consolidate themselves.”A decrease in infrastructure projects in South Bastar and more focus of the government on the social sector has also led to a marked decrease in Maoist funds.Also Read | Allegations cloud alleged suicide of surrendered woman ‘Maoist’Intelligence officials believe key Maoist leader Ramanna’s death due to illness has also left a vacuum in their top leadership. “Connectivity of senior leadership with the middle rung has become a major issue due to the strategic locations of security forces’ camps...[this has resulted] in less execution of big ambushes and brought down the violence graph. ...the opening of around 10 new camps at the strategic locations has also helped the government in reducing Maoist violence,” said a fourth official.The official added the Maoists seem confused as dedicated and disciplined people in their ranks have remarkably decreased. He added Maoists have killed many of their own on suspicion of being police informers. “Many middle-level cadres are surrendering due to fatigue and understanding of the misdirected fight.”In 2020, 215 Maoists surrendered compared to 315 in 2019, 465 in 2018, and 366 in 2017. “If surrenders decreased, it clearly suggests that Maoists have increased their hold in the core area,” said a fifth official.Jan Militia of the Maoists is also replacing their main force in many areas. “Jan Militia lacks planning experience and tactics...the militia is relying more on small...attacks.”A sixth official acknowledged they have not been very aggressive in the last two years and the Maoists have focussed on recruitment during this time.“If troops are deployed as planned, it will lead to a marked decrease in Maoist violence...”There has also been a decrease in civilian killing in 2019 (47) and 2020 (36). But over two months of 2021, 12 civilians have been killed. “...Everyone knows in the state that senior officers on the field are reluctant to send forces for anti-Naxal operations because they are afraid of political fallout.”Only 28 Maoist were killed in 2020 compared to 79 in 2019. “This shows that the Maoist themselves are not engaging with security forces. This could be for two reasons – forces are not entering their areas and lack of planning among the Maoists due to the pandemic.”Inspector general (Bastar range) Sunderaj P said they have improved the intelligence network and the public support for the Maoists has also gone down. He rejected the suggestion that they have been defensive and added police have raided over 140 hideouts and recovered arms and ammunition.“In 2020, we opened 14 new operational base camps in Bastar range...that have opened up few critical roads along... We are strongly marching forward in our mission to bring an end to the Left-wing insurgency...”Intelligence officials cited interrogation of surrendered Maoists and said they are more focused on the newly formed Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh zone. This is another reason for the decline in violence, they added.“Violence has gone down but still an area the size of a country like Israel remains under Maoist dominance in Chhattisgarh. Bastar is bigger than Kerala in size and around half of Bastar is still under direct Maoist control or they have significant presence there. Of course security forces have made some progress but we are hearing unconfirmed reports that Maoists have banned education for children above the age of 10 and many of them have now started working for Maoists,” said Shubhranshu Chaudhary, a peace activist working in Bastar region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-violence-on-the-decline-in-chhattisgarh-101614334438377.html
26-02-2021||India||India’s cyber crime hub Jamtara scripting new story with public library mission||Ajharuddin Ansari, 25, a daily-wage labourer, spends at least four hours daily in the panchayat’s public library, built by district administration, to prepare for competitive examinations to government services. Ansari, who lost his mother in 2005 and father in 2015, pays for the education of his two sisters with his income from the construction site. He counts the newly-built library as a blessing for him and his two sisters.“We are not economically sound enough to buy books for competitive examinations or pay for tuition of my sisters. The library is meeting all our learning needs. Now, I dream to crack examinations for government services,” said Ansari, a physics graduate.Ansari is not alone, hundreds of students, mostly from the weaker section, are benefitting from the public library movement launched by the administration in Jamtara, a Jharkhand district considered to be the Indian equivalent of the Romanian town Ramnicu Valcea, which was considered the global hotbed for cybercriminals in 1990s.Scale of phishing activities in the district could be assumed from the fact that more than 150 cyber fraudsters were arrested in 2020, while more than 90 cyber criminals are languishing in Jamtara jails, officials said. Police of more than 20 states have visited the district in connection with online fraud cases.In a bid to shed the negative image of the district, the administration conceptualized the idea of setting up a public library in each panchayat of the district, which could illuminate the path shown by legendary educationist and social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in the district in the 19th century.Vidyasagar, who brought a revolution in the education system of Bengal, came to Karmatar, a sleepy hamlet in Jamtara, in early 1873 to recuperate from poor health and ended up spending more than 18 years in the village.Jamtara deputy commissioner (DC) Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtaz said 88 libraries have been built so far and all are functional in 88 panchayats. The DC said all the 118 panchayats of the district would have a library in the next fortnight.“We wanted to change the negative image of the district and rehabilitate the youths involved in negative activities. Then, the concept of setting up public libraries came to our mind. We started working on it and it soon turned out to be a big success,” Mumtaz said.Funds and infrastructure were major challenges first. “We put in funds through convergence of various schemes. Besides, funds were also managed through contribution, donation, crowdsourcing and corporate social responsibility,” he said.Thereafter, abandoned buildings or community halls were identified, renovated and converted into libraries in each panchayat. Geo-tagging of all the libraries was done for identification and contact numbers of librarians were available on the website, he said.The libraries are getting a huge response from students. “There are 100 books in the library provided by the administration, and around 50 students from the village are preparing for exams,” said Ansari, a resident of Jiyajori village in the district. He said many youths, who were earlier engaged in phishing activities, were now joining the library to prepare for competitive examinations.Also Read: 10th century Buddha Vihar discovered in Jharkhand’s HazaribagBiswajit Gorai, 21, a resident of Mejhia panchayat of the district, said life was not the same when there was no library in and around his village. “A new library was built in November last year, which has changed the lives of the students. We, the senior students, are preparing for the competitive examinations in group, while junior students are preparing for school examinations in the library.”He said most of the residents in the village are poor. “They do not have money to buy books. However, the library has sorted out that problem. Now, the village has got a proper educational environment,” he said.Riya Gorai, an intermediate student of the same village, said, “My parents do not have enough money to get me tuition.

It was unclear what arrangements were being made for the funeral rites of the people who perished, he added.Giving news that the boat had been found, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday two Indian coast guard ships were dispatched to search for the boat following urgent calls for help.The United Nations refugee agency had raised the alarm earlier this week over the missing boat, which had left Cox's Bazar on Feb. 11.Of the 90 people that had set out on the voyage, eight were found dead, and one was missing, Srivasta said. Talks were underway with Bangladesh for the safe return of the 81 survivors, he added."Bangladesh is respectful of its international obligations under the UNCLOS (The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea)," Bangladesh's foreign ministry said in a statement.On earlier occasions when other littoral countries of the region repeatedly denied access to Rohingya adrift at sea, it was the Bangladesh that came to the rescue, the ministry added.More than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are living in crowded camps in Bangladesh, including tens of thousands who fled after Myanmar's military conducted a deadly crackdown in 2017.Human traffickers often lure Rohingya refugees, promising them work in Southeast Asian nations.The Bangladesh statement said the boat had been traced approximately 1,700 km (1,056 miles) away from Bangladesh and 147 km (91 miles) from India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands."Other states, particularly those on whose territorial water the vessel has been found, bear the primary responsibility and they should fulfil their obligation under international law and burden-sharing principle," the ministry said.India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them. Nor does it have a domestic law protecting refugees, though it currently hosts more than 200,000, including some Rohingya.While India diplomats sought ways to resolve the humanitarian crisis in the Andaman Sea, Indian President Ram Nath Kovind was set to visit islands there during coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-coast-guard-rescues-81-rohingya-refugees-adrift-at-sea-8-died-101614331929547.html

Never has this been more pronounced than the last few years… And we aren’t alone: every institution is experiencing a significant trust deficit,” he said to analysts, as reported by PTI.Centre announces rules for OTT, digital mediaTwitter ran into trouble in India following Republic Day violence than unfolded in the national Capital when farmers took out a tractor rally protesting three agriculture laws. The government flagged several Twitter accounts tweeting with hashtags 'farmer genocide', asking the platform to take action against them. Twitter took a series of staggered action but some accounts were restored after being briefly suspended, and Twitter defended its action citing its policy of freedom of expression.The new guidelines, released by the IT ministry, require social media intermediaries to appoint a resident grievance officer, who shall register complaints in 24 hours, and file monthly compliance reports. User grievances have to be resolved within 15 days.The new rules take effect immediately, though significant social-media providers (based on the number of users) will get three months before they need to start complying.CEO Dorsey on Friday said Twitter intends to make its content moderation practices more transparent, give people more control to moderate their interactions, enable a marketplace approach to relevance algorithms, and fund an open-source social media standard.Focus on metrics like transparency, accountability, reliability and choice will have a huge impact, he said.As part of its series of reform measures, the microblogging platform is planning to introduce a way for users to automatically block and mute abusive accounts.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-people-don-t-trust-us-jack-dorsey-after-twitter-s-face-off-with-govt-101614329249008.html

It provides a framework for the decentralisation of democracy. It strengthens the democracy at the grass-root level through which citizens get an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the local self-government of their area," the speaker said."There are several provisions in our Constitution providing optimal opportunities for the development of all the areas in the country. North East India is quite distinct from the geographical and socio-cultural point of view, therefore keeping it in view; a special provision for three Autonomous District Council for these States has been made in the Sixth Schedule of our Constitution," Birla said.The prime objective of setting up these Councils is to protect the rights of the tribal communities of the North East, provide them equal rights in the decision-making process and to ensure that their administration is carried out in accordance with their traditions and conventions, he said."Mahatma Gandhi believed that the soul of India lives in villages. He believed in rural self-government and the development of the nation (Rashtrodaya) through the development of the villages (Gramodaya). He believed that every village should be self-reliant. The Government is formulating policies and schemes to make this very self-reliance a nationwide phenomenon. But, a self-reliant India can only be possible when we are Vocal for Local," he said.Highlighting the digital penetration in governance, he said that e-Panchyat has been introduced which has brought revolutionary changes in the working of local self-government.It is our responsibility to make a collective effort to make democracy strong, transparent and accountable, he added.Chief Minister of Meghalaya Conrad Sangma, Speaker of Meghalaya Legislative Assembly Metbah Lyngdoh, Union Minister of State, Ministry of Food Processing & Industries, Rameshwar Teli and a range of MPs from across the North Eastern region also took part in the event.The programme was organised by Parliamentary Research and Training Institute for Democracies (PRIDE), of the Lok Sabha Secretariat.The theme of the programme was 'Panchayati Raj System/Autonomous District Council- Strengthening Decentralised democracy'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-self-government-symbol-of-democracy-development-says-lok-sabha-speaker-101614330117789.html

Accused Chintamani Patel alias Chintu, 20, who is a friend of the woman’s son, was arrested on Thursday.The incident took place on Wednesday night in a village under Basna police station area of the district.Station House Officer (SHO), Basna, Lekhram Thakur said that the victim was rushed to a nearby hospital where she died on Thursday.“Chintu and the victim’s son were friends and were from the same village. On Wednesday night, Chintu landed at his friend’s house to pick him up to watch his harvester, which was parked in a nearby field. The victim told the accused that his son was not at home. The woman then accompanied the accused as it was late and he was going alone,” said Thakur.While returning from the field, Chintu tried to molest the woman and she fought back.“The accused hit her with a stone on the head. Some villagers rushed to the spot hearing the alarm and found that the victim was on the ground. The woman narrated what happened to a bunch of villagers before she collapsed. Chintu fled from the spot,” the SHO added.Police said that she was rushed to a nearby hospital where she died during treatment.“On the basis of the statement by the victim, the police arrested the accused on Thursday,” Thakur said.Earlier this month, a 15-year-old girl was raped and bludgeoned to death before she was dumped in a forest in Korba district. The girl’s father and her four-year-old niece were also killed by the accused. Six people were arrested by Korba police in this connection.On February 2, a 16-year-old girl was raped by nine persons in the tribal dominated Jashpur district.On Wednesday, the opposition BJP attacked the Congress government over the alleged rise in crimes against women in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-beaten-to-death-by-son-s-friend-20-for-resisting-molestation-cops-101614330080706.html
26-02-2021||India||Govt has a clear vision for India’s financial sector’: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said his government has a clear vision regarding the financial sector in this country and that there are “no ifs and buts” as he reaffirmed its stance on strengthening the public sector. “To strengthen the public sector, equity capital infusion is being stressed on. A new ARC structure is also being made to take care of NPAs (non-performing assets),” PM Modi said while addressing a webinar on budget proposals.PM Modi insisted that not every decision taken by the government has bad intentions, adding that the country's financial and banking sector had been weakened due to aggressive lending in the past, which was brought in control by his government. “The country's financial and banking sector was weakened in the name of aggressive lending about 10 years ago,” he said.PM Modi stressed the steps taken to do away with non-transparent trading culture, adding that insolvency and bankruptcy codes brought by his government helped foster trust and belief for lenders and borrowers. Reinforcing his previous stance on promoting the private sector, he said, “Our endeavour is to promote private sector business but public sector banks and insurance sector have an important role in the country”.He talked at length about the recent privatisation bids for two public sector banks, raising the foreign direct investment ceiling in the insurance sector, and the Initial Public Offering of LIC. “There is still great scope for the banking and insurance sectors in our economy. Keeping this in mind, we have taken many steps in this budget -- be it our decision to privatise two PSBs, raising FDI limit to 74% in insurance or our decision to bring LIC IPO,” he said.PM Modi also outlined the role sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and insurance companies are expected to play in the country’s future and said that the government has made asset creation a priority in this year’s budget. “Sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies are being encouraged to get involved in infrastructure projects,” he said.He reinstated his call for an Aatmanirbhar Bharat or self-reliant India. “Our start-ups and MSMEs would be the identity of Aatmanirbhar Bharat that is why special schemes were formulated for MSMEs during the time of Covid pandemic. Under these schemes, around 90 lakh enterprises have been given credit worth ₹2.4 trillion,” the PM said.The Prime Minister praised the role played by fintech in making financial services accessible during the pandemic last year and predicted that the sector “is likely to grow to ₹6 lakh crore”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-has-a-clear-vision-for-india-s-financial-sector-pm-modi-101614329962341.html

The move comes as an effort to make flying more affordable and accessible to passengers.The services that will now be chargeable on the opt-in basis include preferential seating, meal or snacks or drinking charges, sports equipment charges, musical instrument carriage charge for using airline lounges.

The AAP won 27 out of the 120 seats in Surat’s municipal corporation in the recently held polls in its first outing. The BJP secured 93 seats and the Congress and other parties failed to win any.Kejriwal held a roadshow in the city to thank voters after making inroads in the recently-held civic polls. Speaking during the rally, Kejriwal said he has been hearing the statements made by the opposition, including the BJP and Congress, after the AAP's success in the civic polls. "They are perturbed, a little scared. We have to understand that they're not scared of you or AAP. They are scared of people who voted for you," the AAP convenor told newly-elected corporators in Surat.Attacking the BJP, Kejriwal also said it keeps other parties under control in its bastion state Gujarat. "Why has the BJP been governing here for the last 25 years? It's not as if they are doing great. There are a lot of issues. Different parties come to power in states across the country but only one party is governing here," he said. "It is because they have kept other parties under control. There's no one to tell them anything, they are doing whatever they want," Kejriwal added. "For the first time when there came someone to look them in the eye -- you, people gave you respect," he also said while addressing the corporators.As the party emerged as the second largest in Gujarat, the BJP seems to be unfazed as it said AAP’s gains should worry the Congress more. “The BJP’s hold in Surat continues. there is no dent in the party’s support base. The AAP has moved into the space vacated by Congress. The leadership crisis in the Congress is forcing it out as the principal opposition,” it had said earlier.The AAP, which did not win any seats in its first electoral foray in Gujarat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, chose to fight the elections at the grassroots level this time before graduating to the 2022 state polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-perturbed-and-scared-after-aap-s-poll-win-kejriwal-in-gujarat-s-surat-101614328829820.html

We need to stand up for our business and that doesn't mean just big business, it means MSMEs,” Jaishankar said, according to news agency ANI.The minister asserted that it is the government’s responsibility to support domestic businesses and that India has so far not done enough in this regard. “People today expect the government to bat for them. It's not just the business of Indian diplomacy to do business, it's the business of the government to support businesses. Every government in the world does that, we in India haven't done that enough and I think that is changing,” he was quoted as saying by ANI. Jaishankar was addressing the fifth Asia Economic Dialogue (AED) 2021, the theme for which this year is 'Post Covid-19 Global Trade and Finance Dynamics'. The conference saw international participation from foreign ministers of a number of countries, senior bureaucrats, industry leaders and global financial experts, according to ANI. In a separate virtual event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke about the schemes meant to uplift small businesses in the country. “Self-reliant India will be made of our MSMEs, will be made of our startups. That is why special schemes were formulated for MSMEs during the Covid-19 pandemic under which around 90 lakh enterprises have been given credit worth ₹2.4 trillion,” he said while addressing a webinar on aspects relating to financial services in this year’s budget, presented by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month. “Self-reliant India will not be made up of just big industries or big cities. In a self-reliant India village, small entrepreneurs in small towns will be made up of the hard work of ordinary Indians. It will be made up of farmers, units making agricultural products better,” Modi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-stand-up-for-msmes-people-expect-govt-to-bat-for-them-jaishankar-101614327652648.html

The petition had questioned the assumption that the tigress was a man-eater. Dogra, in her petition, also pointed out that the forest officials violated the Supreme Court order of September 11, 2018, restraining any kind of celebration over the death of the tigress. Also Read | Changes in tiger habitat disrupting evolutionary processes, says studyOn Friday, the officials who were issued the notice filed a response claiming that no ground for contempt was made out. They said that the order to shoot the tigress was confirmed by the top court’s September 2018 order. Further, it was pointed out that the celebration was held by villagers and did not involve forest officials. Dogra, in her petition, pointed out that within days after the killing, the villagers arranged a felicitation function on November 14, 2018 and presented a silver statue of the tigress along with a cash reward to the shooter involved in the killing. The bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, and comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “If villagers believe that they will not be attacked again and decide to celebrate, how can the forest officials ensure that they don’t celebrate?”Further, the state officials pointed out that the order to kill the tigress was confirmed by the Supreme Court.The bench took these statements on record and said, “We can’t review our earlier decision and say she was not a man-eater. Also, they are stating that villagers and not they had celebrated... We cannot interfere in this case.”Dogra then sought permission to withdraw the petition and it was granted.On September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court, while permitting Avni (T-1) to be shot down, had said, “The efforts to tranquilise and capture T-1 tigress will be continued and if unsuccessful, it shall be eliminated by shooting to avoid any further loss of human life. The chief conservator of forests, Yavatmal, is authorised to carry out the above order. He shall not declare any prize or any similar incentive for the responsible person.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-contempt-plea-says-tigress-avni-killed-in-accordance-with-court-order-101614325738073.html

The green Scorpio with around 20 gelatin sticks was found abandoned on Carmichael Road in Mumbai’s posh Pedder Road area late on Thursday. The SUV had a wrong number plate and was found about 600 metres away from Ambani’s house on Altamount Road."A letter was also found in the car with the explosives near Antilia. The handwritten letter was in broken English with grammatical mistakes and was addressed to Mukesh and Neeta Ambani. It is basically a threat letter calling the planted explosives a 'trailer' and a warning to return with more preparations to assassinate the whole family later," ANI quoted the source as saying.Mumbai Police deployed its personnel outside Ambani's house after the explosives were found in the area on Thursday. The police also called in the bomb squad after the police control room was informed about the vehicle.Also watch: Explosives found in car near Mukesh Ambani’s house, security increased“Two explosive detector Labrador dogs of BDDS - Oscar and Moti - detected suspicious explosives and alerted their handlers. The bomb squad personnel were then called in who scanned the articles found in the vehicle and identified them to be gelatin. The same was taken out safely and taken to a safe place following standard procedures. In all 20 gelatin sticks were found,” a police officer said on Thursday.Officials said that the person, who parked the car at the spot at around 1am on Thursday, has been captured on the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera of a nearby general store. The police will enhance the quality of the CCTV footage to identify the suspect, the second officer said. He said the number plate may have been of a car that belongs to Ambani’s security detail. HT could not independently verify this.Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh released a statement on Thursday, saying the Mumbai Police’s crime branch will investigate the case. “It has been taken very seriously and the police will unearth the plot and nab the people behind it,” minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai said. "Since the investigation is underway, it would not be appropriate to speak more on it. If need be, there will be additional security cover given to the Ambani family," Desai added.Mumbai Police later filed a first information report or an FIR in connection with the seizure of the vehicle.(With agency inputs))||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-a-trailer-letter-in-car-carrying-explosives-near-mukesh-ambani-s-house-101614324018118.html

26-02-2021||India||Plea seeking contempt action against Maharashtra officials over killing of tigress Avni withdrawn||A petition filed by a wildlife enthusiast seeking contempt of court proceedings against officials of the Maharashtra government over the manner in which a tigress, Avni, was in 2018 was withdrawn from the Supreme Court on Friday.The three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde found no ground to proceed ahead with the matter after the state government officials, who were issued notices earlier this month, told the Supreme Court that no contempt was made out as the man-eater tigress Avni killing was approved and confirmed by the top court. The tigress was killed by a team of state forest officials in November 2018.The contempt petition filed by Sangeeta Dogra claimed that the top court had in September 2018 directed that there will be no celebration following the killing of the tigress. She presented the top court with pictures showing how the shooter who killed Avni was felicitated at a function, handed a silver statue of the tigress and villagers celebrated the moment.The state officials in their reply told the Court that the celebration was carried out by villagers in which forest officials were not involved.The bench, also comprising justice AS Bopanna and justice V Ramasubramanian, said, "If villagers believe that they will not be attacked again and decide to celebrate, how can the forest officials ensure that they don't celebrate."The state officials also pointed out that the orders to kill the tigress were confirmed by the top court. The bench took these statements on record and said, "We can't review our earlier decision and say she was not a man-eater. Also, they are stating that villagers and not they had celebrated... We cannot interfere in this case."Dogra sought permission to withdraw the petition and the same was granted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-seeking-contempt-action-against-maharashtra-officials-over-killing-of-tigress-avni-withdrawn-101614321587820.html
26-02-2021||India||Farmers’ protest completes 3 months, Kisan Cong to gherao Tomar's house today||The Kisan Congress will surround Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar's house on Friday, the day farmers’ protest against the Centre’ three agricultural laws completes three months. The activists of the grand old party’s unit had planned to assemble at the AICC headquarters at 11:30am in Delhi before proceeding to Union minister Tomar’s office, the Congress said in a statement.The move comes in the backdrop of the agitation launched by farmers at several borders of the national capital to demand the repeal of farm legislation enacted by Parliament in September last year. The protesters have been camping at various Delhi borders since November 26. While the farmers want a complete roll-back of three farm laws—Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020— the government has ruled out agreeing to the demand and has offered to make amendments to the legislation. Responding to Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait’s call for another tractor rally in the Capital, the agriculture minister had earlier this week said the government is ready to discuss the demands of the farmers and is committed to the welfare of the farmers.The tractor rally proposed by farmers on January 26 took a violent turn after clashes broke out between the police and protesters. Several arrests have been made in this regard and following the violence, security was also heightened at the borders.During a Kisan mahapanchayat in Rajasthan’s Sikar, Tikait had said if the farm laws aren't repealed, protesting farmers will gherao Parliament. "This time the call will be for Parliament gherao. We will announce it and then march towards Delhi. This time 40 lakh tractors will be there instead of four lakh tractors," he said on Tuesday.The farmers have also extended support to ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by transport and trade unions against the spike in fuel prices and to demand the scrapping of new e-way bill laws. During the nationwide strike, the traders’ body has said that all commercial markets across the country will remain shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-completes-3-months-kisan-cong-to-gherao-tomar-s-house-today-101614317356596.html
26-02-2021||India||India beats China at its own game in Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy battle||India’s huge capacity to make coronavirus vaccines is helping the country take on China in the battle to gain political influence across the developing world.Competition among poorer nations to get cheap or free vaccines to fight the pandemic had given China a golden chance to strengthen ties in emerging markets it has been courting for years. And initially Beijing seemed in a strong position. It suppressed the domestic spread of Covid-19 last year and accelerated the production of shots.At the same time, India was struggling to contain one of the world’s worst outbreaks of the virus, with nearly 100,000 cases a day, while a nationwide lockdown sent its economy into recession for the first time in 25 years.But Chinese pharmaceutical companies have been reticent in sharing details of their pivotal vaccine trials crucial for building public trust around the world, and new domestic outbreaks reinforced the urgency of inoculating China’s own 1.4 billion population, a task that could take years. Meanwhile, India sent millions of doses to neighboring Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, allowing them to begin vaccinations earlier than if they had waited for Chinese doses.“Because of their gift, Sri Lanka has been able to start vaccination immediately,” said Eran Wickramaratne, a Sri Lankan opposition lawmaker who received one of the Indian shots. “Most Sri Lankans would be thankful for this.”So far, New Delhi has managed to ship nearly 6.8 million free vaccines around the world. China has pledged around 3.9 million, according to publicly available information compiled by Bloomberg, some of which have yet to arrive.Beijing and New Delhi have long competed for influence in Asia, and tensions between the two have risen since the pandemic struck, including their most violent border clash in decades. India has banned hundreds of Chinese apps, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, sought to attract investors away from China and boosted security ties with Japan, Australia and the U.S.The rapid growth of China’s economy -- now roughly five times the size of India’s -- has allowed Beijing to forge ties with poorer countries by loaning tens of billions under its Belt and Road Initiative.But Covid has given India a diplomatic opportunity to pursue its aspirations of becoming a global power. Its pharmaceutical industry, especially the Serum Institute of India, had already made the South Asian nation the main supplier of essential medicines to the developing world. Now it’s allowing India to push back against China’s growing influence.A case in point is Myanmar, which has been rocked by a military coup and shares borders with both China and India. Beijing promised to send around 300,000 doses but has yet to deliver anything, while New Delhi quickly delivered 1.7 million shots.Indian VaccinesNew Delhi recognized early on that Indian production capacity would be crucial to beating the pandemic, said Ashok Malik, a policy adviser to the Ministry of External Affairs. Last year, when Indian manufacturers were exporting the anti-malaria drug Hydroxychloroquine -- hyped by then President Donald Trump -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi was already talking to world leaders about providing vaccines, he said.Not that India doesn’t need doses itself. It too has more than a billion people to protect, and while China swiftly suppressed Covid-19, India was unable to prevent the virus from spreading rapidly.New Delhi says it’s prioritizing its own population. But India’s ability to manufacture vaccines was always going to outstrip the nation’s ability to inoculate all of its own citizens. And the country’s leaders can now deploy those millions of surplus vaccines to win friends and influence abroad..“In Bangladesh, the process of vaccination has started and it’s going very well, at least in the cities,” said Meghna Guhathakurta, who is set to get the Indian dose in Dhaka this month. She said her relatives in the Indian city of Kolkata “haven’t been contacted and don’t know when they will get vaccinated.”Even as the Covid death toll in India passed 156,000, compared to less than 5,000 official deaths in China, New Delhi promised it wouldn’t engage in vaccine nationalism and block exports.Its domestic vaccine producers were free to sell to richer nations, but the government promised to buy supplies for smaller countries, as well as its own citizens. Officials organized trips for foreign ambassadors to visit pharmaceutical hubs in Pune and Hyderabad, and assured neighbors in South Asia, the Indian Ocean and even distant Dominica and Barbados they’d get affordable vaccines and would receive initial shipments for free.Since then, India has exported a total of more than 33 million shots -- three times as many doses as it has administered domestically, where the slow pace of vaccinations has prompted criticism and the new option for some of securing jabs at private clinics.“India, with all its problems, has been true to its word,” Malik said.India’s vaccine diplomacy has helped soothe some prickly relationships with neighbors in South Asia, “where it has been fighting an increasingly sharp diplomatic battle with China,” said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong, who has edited books on health challenges and foreign policy. New Delhi is “pushing back.”Even on China’s borders, Indian shots are showing up. Mongolia’s prime minister received one of 150,000 free doses delivered by India. On the other hand, Indonesia’s Joko Widodo, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the president of Seychelles have taken Chinese vaccines.India’s vaccine industry -- which is delivering shipments to both developing and developed economies -- has even helped ties with some industrialized nations suffering hold ups in deliveries of western doses. Canada, whose prime minister irked Modi’s administration by expressing support for protesting Indian farmers, asked the Serum Institute to expedite shipments.Both the Indian-produced shots and the Chinese ones have been criticized for being potentially less effective than the vaccines of Pfizer Inc. and Moderna.India is currently shipping Covishield, a locally-produced Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and exporting Bharat Biotech International Ltd.’s home-grown Covaxin shots for clinical trials. Demand for Indian shots is expected to jump once Covaxin wins regulatory approvals, and Hyderabad-based Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories begins shipping the Russian vaccine Sputnik V. China’s Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd., Sinovac Biotech Ltd., CanSino Biologics Inc. and Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co. Ltd. have exported doses to countries including the UAE, Morocco, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and Brazil for clinical trials, and Beijing has promised to provide vaccine aid to more than a dozen other countries.For developing nations hammered by the pandemic, being able to begin inoculations for high risk groups with cheap and plentiful shots that have a 60% or 70% efficacy rate in trials is better that having small amounts of a more expensive vaccine that may not be available for months.“People were a bit wary of the vaccines, as they came from India. Now the mistrust is largely gone,” said Rashidul Mannan, after getting a dose of the Indian vaccine at a booth in Dhaka. “I think people will look more positively to India now than before.”Developing nations will also have access to millions of shots from the Covax initiative, a program led by the World Health Organization designed to acquire doses for poorer countries. Covax aims to deliver nearly 150 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and 2 billion by the end of the year.Still, with western pharmaceutical firms largely focusing on rich nations struggling to contain their own outbreaks, many poorer countries will rely for at least part of their inoculation program on donations and purchases from China and India.For China, free vaccines could help soften some of the ill will it’s generated through recent geopolitical spats, such as its territorial claims in the South China Sea.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s pledge to donate 500,000 doses to the Philippines was scrutinized in a congressional inquiry in the Southeast Asian nation. The country’s vaccine procurement chief Carlito Galvez told lawmakers that Manila should “set aside” differences with Beijing on competing maritime claims, prompting shocked responses from an opposition lawmaker. Galvez later told the Senate: “We will not compromise our stake.”One place where China’s influence still dominates is India’s arch-rival Pakistan, recipient of some $70 billion of Chinese financing for infrastructure. Like Brazil, Pakistan gave China’s vaccine makers the chance to carry out clinical trials they had been unable to complete at home when the number of domestic cases subsided. Pakistan’s health chief Faisal Sultan called it “banking on an old relationship.”“We lent a hand on the science part, making sure that we would have credible data for its efficacy,” Sultan said in an interview.China is also having success in Africa and Latin America -- major investment regions for Beijing. By early February, Beijing had sent vaccine aid to more than a dozen countries including Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea.In the end, the competition between China and India to provide vaccines, especially to nations where their strategic interests overlap, are likely to help not only those nations but the rest of the world.“China is facing formidable competition” in its vaccine diplomacy, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “For countries on the receiving end, that’s a good thing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-beats-china-at-its-own-game-in-covid-19-vaccine-diplomacy-battle-101614317737720.html

The MEA statement said that foreign minister Jaishankar highlighted that India and China had "always agreed that maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas was essential basis for development of bilateral relations"."A prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side. It was, therefore, necessary that the two sides should work towards early resolution of remaining issues. It was necessary to disengage at all friction points in order to contemplate de-escalation of forces in this sector. That alone will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquility and provide conditions for progress of our bilateral relationship," it said.Also read | Border dispute objective reality, should be put at right position in ties: China"EAM referred to the meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister in September 2020 in Moscow where Indian side had expressed its concern on provocative behavior and unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter status quo. He noted that the bilateral relations have been impacted severely over last year. EAM said that Boundary Question may take time to resolve but disturbance of peace and tranquility including by violence, will inevitably have a damaging impact on the relationship," MEA said in a statement.The 75-minute call between Jaishankar and Wang came after India and China pulled back frontline troops from strategic heights around Pangong Lake along with armoured vehicles and artillery and also after meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) event in Moscow on September 10 last year. Jaishankar had in a tweet mentioned that had "discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement" with Wang.Also read | 'No bearing on LAC situation': Army officials on LoC ceasefireThe MEA statement also mentioned the meeting between Jaishankar and Wang in Moscow last year. "Both Ministers had agreed that the situation in the border areas was not in the interest of either side and decided that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage and ease tensions. EAM noted that the two sides had maintained continuous communication since then through both the diplomatic and military channels. This had led to progress as both sides had successfully disengaged in the Pangong Tso Lake area earlier this month," it said.The “Moscow Agreement” was a five-point agreement that the two sides had concluded during the meeting of the foreign ministers in the Russian capital. A joint statement issued after that meeting had said the two sides would be guided by the consensus of the leaders of India and China, including not allowing differences to become disputes.Jaishankar, the statement, said emphasised that India and China should now quickly resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. "EAM said that once disengagement is completed at all friction points, then the two sides could also look at broader de-escalation of troops in the area and work towards restoration of peace and tranquility," it added.The two sides had on February 20 held the 10th round of talks between senior military commanders within 48 hours of the completion of the disengagement at Pangong Lake. At the meeting held on the Chinese side of the LAC, the military commanders had focused on disengagement at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains though there were no immediate signs of a breakthrough.The statement said that Wang, on his part, expressed satisfaction at the progress made so far. "It was an important step forward for restoration of peace and tranquility in border areas. He felt that both sides should make efforts to consolidate outcomes. It was also necessary to sincerely implement the common understanding reached at various levels.

26-02-2021||India||Binge-watching Netflix? Scrolling Twitter? Check new rules for online platforms||The Union ministry of information and broadcasting on Thursday notified a set of rules to monitor the content on digital media, over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms amid “growing concerns around lack of transparency, accountability and rights of users.”The ministry asserted that the proposed framework is progressive, liberal and contemporaneous and the rules focus more on in-house and self-regulation mechanisms. “A robust grievance redressal mechanism has been provided while upholding journalistic and creative freedom,” it added.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 has been framed in exercise of powers under section 87 (2) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and in supersession of the earlier Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011, the Centre said in a statement.The guidelines have been framed keeping in mind the difference between viewership in a theatre and television as compared to watching it on the internet, the ministry said.Here’s a look at the new set of guidelines digital media, OTT platforms need to follow:*The rules establish a “soft-touch self-regulatory architecture” and a Code of Ethics and three-tier grievance redressal mechanism for news publishers and OTT platforms and digital media.*The OTT platforms, named as the publishers of online curated content in the rules, would self-classify the content into five age-based categories- U (Universal), U/A 7+, U/A 13+, U/A 16+, and A (Adult).*Platforms would be required to implement parental locks for content classified as U/A 13+ or higher, and reliable age verification mechanisms for content classified as “A”. The publisher of online curated content shall prominently display the classification rating specific to each content or programme together with a content descriptor informing the user about the nature of the content, and advising on viewer description (if applicable) at the beginning of every programme.*Publishers of news on digital media would be required to observe ‘Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India’ and the ‘Programme Code under the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act’ thereby providing a level playing field between the offline (Print, TV) and digital media.*A three-level grievance redressal mechanism has been established under the rules with different levels of self-regulation—Level-I: Self-regulation by the publishers; Level-II: Self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the publishers; Level-III: Oversight mechanism.Here are the guidelines related to social media:*Due diligence must be followed by intermediaries. In case of violation by the intermediary, safe harbour provisions will not apply to them.*According to new rules, intermediaries need to appoint a grievance officer to deal with complaints and share the name and contact details of the officer. The officer will acknowledge the complaint within 24 hours and resolve it within 15 from its receipt. The aim is to empower the users by mandating the intermediaries, including social media intermediaries, to establish a grievance redressal mechanism for receiving resolving complaints from the users or victims.*Ensuring online safety and dignity of users, especially women users: Intermediaries shall remove or disable access within 24 hours of receipt of complaints of contents that expose the private areas of individuals, show such individuals in full or partial nudity or in a sexual act or is in the nature of impersonation including morphed images etc. Such a complaint can be filed either by the individual or by any other person on his/her behalf.*Removal of unlawful information: An intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge in the form of an order by a court or being notified by the appropriate government or its agencies through an authorised officer should not host or publish any information which is prohibited under any law in relation to the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, public order, friendly relations with foreign countries etc.*The Rules will come in effect from the date of their publication in the gazette, except for the additional due diligence for significant social media intermediaries, which shall come in effect three months after publication.*Two categories of social media intermediaries: According to the ministry, to encourage innovations and enable the growth of new social media intermediaries without subjecting smaller platforms to significant compliance requirement, the rules make a distinction between social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries. This distinction is based on the number of users on the social media platform. The government is empowered to notify the threshold of the user base that will distinguish between social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries. The rules require significant social media intermediaries to follow certain additional due diligence.What additional due diligence needs to be followed by social media intermediary?-Appoint a chief compliance officer who shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act and Rules. Such a person should be a resident of India.-Appoint a nodal contact person for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies.-Appoint a resident grievance officer who shall perform the functions mentioned under the grievance redressal mechanism.-Publish a monthly compliance report mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken as well as details of contents removed proactively by the significant social media intermediary.-Significant social media intermediaries providing services primarily in the nature of messaging shall enable identification of the first originator of the information that is required only for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of an offence related to sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order or of incitement to an offence relating to the above or in relation with rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years. The intermediary shall not be required to disclose the contents of any message or any other information to the first originator.-Significant social media intermediary shall have a physical contact address in India published on its website or mobile app or both.-Voluntary user verification mechanism: Users who wish to verify their accounts voluntarily shall be provided with an appropriate mechanism to verify their accounts and provided with a demonstrable and visible mark of verification.-Giving users an opportunity to be heard: In cases where significant social media intermediaries remove or disable access to any information on their own accord, then a prior intimation for the same shall be communicated to the user who has shared that information with a notice explaining the grounds and reasons for such action. Users must be provided an adequate and reasonable opportunity to dispute the action taken by the intermediary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bingewatching-netflix-scrolling-twitter-check-new-rules-for-online-platforms-101614312276010.html

26-02-2021||India||Are you willing to create more courts for cheque bounce cases: SC asks Centre||The Supreme Court on Thursday contemplated guidelines to streamline disposal of cheque bounce cases clogging the judicial docket and sought Centre’s response on establishing additional courts with judicial officers to exclusively try these cases.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde remarked, “Tell us whether the Union of India is willing to create additional courts for Section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act cases (commonly referred to as cheque bounce cases) using power under Article 247.” This power provided under the Constitution allows Parliament to create additional courts for better administration of laws.The observation came in a suo moto case pending since March 2020 where the Court is considering guidelines to be issued for expeditious disposal of cheque bounce cases punishable under Section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act. A preliminary report prepared by Court-appointed amici curiae, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and advocate K Parameshwar, in October 2020 highlighted the urgent directions needed in this regard, one of them being creation of separate exclusive courts.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Vikramjeet Banerjee, representing Centre, sought time to take instructions in this regard. According to him, on creation of exclusive courts under Article 247, the Centre would require some time. However, on the other suggestions given by the amici curiae in their report, the Centre can give its inputs by the next date of hearing. The Court fixed the matter for hearing on March 3.The extent of the problem could be gauged by its sheer numbers. The total criminal cases pending in the country as on January 1, 2020 were over 2.31 crore (over 20 million) of which cheque bounce cases were over 35.16 lakh (over 3.5 million), occupying almost 15% of the total criminal case pendency.The Court was keen to consider establishing special courts and asked Luthra whether Article 247 was a power coupled with duty where Union was required to have a judicial impact assessment while enacting a law. “Whether there are additional courts or not, we will have to streamline the procedure,” observed the bench, also comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhatt.The amici curiae report threw light on the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the manner in which Section 138 cases are heard and tried by courts. “Unless the idea of exclusive courts is backed by a comprehensive plan from the Union to fund setting up of exclusive courts and an action plan is worked out to appoint Magistrates (for trial) and judges (for hearing appeals) for such courts, diverting existing resources would burden the system.”Some states have established exclusive courts but they lack uniform and reasonable standards. For instance, West Bengal has one exclusive court to try Section 138 NI Act offences across the state. In Maharashtra, Pune district where more than 50,000 cheque bounce cases are pending, there is no exclusive court, while Amravati district with a pendency of 10,966 cases has five such courts. Similar is the case for Madhya Pradesh with Indore having no exclusive court despite pendency of over 54,000 cases while Bhopal having five such courts despite pendency being below 20,000.The Negotiable Instruments Act prescribes a six-month deadline for trial to complete but an analysis in the report showed that on an average, a case under Section 138 NI Act remained for three years and eight months in the judicial system. This backlog was on account of two reasons – increase in institution of cheque bounce complaints and the failure to serve summons on the accused, who are often beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the court where the case gets instituted.Luthra submitted an additional note to the Court stressing on the need for electronic service of summons. “Nowadays everything is linked with Aadhaar. There is no reason why electronic service of summons should not be done,” Luthra said. He also talked of summary trial of cheque bounce cases, compulsory mediation at the pre-trial stage, and attachment of property of the accused to the extent of the amount presented in the cheque.Also Read: Supreme Court to hear contempt plea on tigress Avni killing todayThe bench asked Luthra to submit an additional note on creation of additional courts and the interplay of various provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) with NI Act, seen as a factor impeding trial of cheque bounce cases. One such instance given in the report was about Section 220 CrPC allowing joint trial of offences arising from the same offence while Section 219 CrPC restricting such joint hearing up to three cases only.Reform in this direction would require judicial and legislative interventions, argued Luthra as he agreed to present an additional note in this regard before the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-you-willing-to-create-more-courts-for-cheque-bounce-cases-sc-asks-centre-101614313704618.html

The petition claimed that Maharashtra government officials violated the SC order to declare no reward for killing the man-eater tigress Avni. A three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde will take up the petition on Friday. Maharashtra government officials are expected to appear in person through videoconferencing. The court had issued contempt notices to principal secretary, Maharashtra, Vikas Kharge, principal chief conservator forests (Nagpur), deputy conservator of forests, Pandharkawada district, and member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority.Raising questions over the procedure followed in shooting down the tigress, Dogra pointed out that the big cat’s post-mortem report revealed that she was not a man-eater.Also Read | Juvenile convict to be let off with fine in 22-years old murder caseDogra stated in her petition that on September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court while permitting Avni (T-1) to be shot down, had said, “The efforts to tranquillise and capture T-1 tigress will be continued and if unsuccessful, it shall be eliminated by shooting to avoid any further loss of human life. The chief conservator of forests, Yavatmal, is authorised to carry out the above order. He shall not declare any prize or any similar incentive for the responsible person.”Despite the clear instruction by the court, Dogra pointed out that within days after the killing, the villagers arranged a felicitation function on November 14, 2018, and presented a silver statue of tigress along with a cash reward to the shooter involved in the killing.“First, we need to examine your plea that the dead tigress was not a man-eater. Second, they (contemnors) flouted our order that they shall not celebrate or reward anyone for killing the tigress. We will issue notice as our order is clearly violated,” said the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, on the previous date of hearing.Dogra claimed that the post-mortem report did not indicate presence of nail, hair or teeth of human beings in the stomach. According to her, if the dead tigress was a man-eater, the presence of hair, nail of humans will remain for about six months. The bench asked Dogra to submit proof to this effect and adjourned the matter after two weeks.The tigress had allegedly killed at least 13 villagers in Maharashtra’s Pandharkawda and Ralegoan regions of Yavatmal district for over one-and-a-half years. The six-year-old tigress was shot dead after a massive hunt, and her two cubs relocated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-contempt-plea-on-tigress-avni-killing-today-101614312236845.html

26-02-2021||India||Nirav Modi’s extradition: CBI, ED submitted over 40,000 docs to prove conspiracy||The UK court, which cleared diamantaire Nirav Modi’s extradition to India on Thursday, praised the evidence the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) presented before it while dismissing claims that he would not get a fair trial.The evidence was submitted in form of over 40,000 documents to prove the conspiracy between Modi, his dummy firms, and Punjab National Bank officials in connection with the fraud and money laundering case.“...CBI submitted voluminous oral and documentary evidence to substantiate the charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust, criminal misconduct by public servants, destruction of evidence, and criminal intimidation of evidence,” CBI spokesman R C Joshi said in a statement on Thursday.He added the judgement is a reminder that fugitives, who have eluded the law after commission of large value frauds, cannot consider themselves above the process merely because they have changed jurisdictions. “The judgement also vindicates the painstaking investigation by CBI, especially since Nirav Modi had raised various issues with regard to the admissibility of evidence, the fairness of the investigation, trial, prison conditions, availability of health facilities in India and extraneous consideration, with a view to divert attention from his own acts.”Also Read | Nirav Modi’s extradition to India cleared: What nextModi’s lawyer, Clare Montgomery, who represented former liquor baron Vijay Mallya as well in his extradition case, raised the dual criminality clause during the trial, which means that a country seeking extradition has to show the evidence it is relying on is admissible in the UK too.The court accepted the evidence provided and also questioned the legitimacy of Modi’s business. The investigators provided transcriptions of audio conversations showing Modi threatening to kill a witness if he did not follow his instructions.The government offered a sovereign assurance about the facilities at Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail, where Modi will be kept if extradited, and presented a video of the prison. The court observed that Modi will have better space in the Indian jail than where he is now – the Wandsworth prison near London.Nirav Modi fled India in January 2018 before the CBI registered its first case against him. An Interpol red notice was issued against him in June 2018. The first extradition request to the UK was sent in August that year. Modi, who was arrested in March 2019, filed seven pleas seeking bail and contested India’s extradition request calling it a political witch-hunt. He claimed that if extradited, his rights will be violated. A CBI officer associated with the probe said Modi made every effort to avoid jail. “He was so desperate that he even told the court he was ready to wear electronic ankle monitors. He once even offered to pay 4 million pounds as security for bail. We produced strong evidence showing how he has destroyed evidence and intimidated the witnesses in the past, which was accepted by the court and his bail was rejected every single time.”An ED officer said this was the longest extradition trial India has fought as the accused remained in jail for two years.Joint directors of CBI and ED, Anurag and Satyabrata Kumar, monitored the proceedings on daily basis in association with Crown Prosecution Service and visited London to assist the prosecutors.Praveen Sinha, who is now CBI’s interim director, also visited London to coordinate the trial as Modi hired a battery of lawyers in India and the UK to defend himself.India last year secured extradition of Mallya. But his extradition has been held up due to secret legal proceedings, according to the British government. Mallya is learnt to have applied for asylum in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-ed-submitted-40-000-documents-for-nirav-modi-s-extradition-101614311036750.html
26-02-2021||India||IAF strengthened capabilities after Balakot, deployed new acquisitions in Ladakh||The Indian Air Force has strengthened its offensive capabilities significantly since the bombing of Jaish-e-Mohammed targets in Pakistan’s Balakot exactly two years ago, and the months-long border standoff with China saw IAF flex its muscle in the Ladakh theatre where it deployed cutting-edge weaponry inducted after the unprecedented, peace time cross-border strikes on February 26, 2019. IAF’s Mirage-2000s struck targets in Balakot in response to the Pakistan-backed Pulwama suicide attack in Kashmir in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force troopers were killed on February 14. Front-line platforms, inducted over the last two years, form a critical part of IAF’s force projection in eastern Ladakh, and have demonstrated its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the sensitive theatre, said people familiar with the developments. Also Read | Armies of India, Pakistan agree to ceasefire along LoC from Feb 24 midnightThe platforms inducted after the Balakot raid include Rafale fighter jets, missiles, smart air-to-ground weapons, AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters. To be sure, these acquisitions were planned years before the Balakot strikes but were inducted during the last two years. Referring to some of the new acquisitions, experts said the IAF’s fighter, helicopter and transport fleets played a crucial during the standoff that began last May. A disengagement process underway in the sector has raised hopes for the resolution of the border row, but de-escalation of the conflict is still a long way off. IAF’s fighter fleet - reinforced with new Rafale jets - and the Apache attack helicopters sent a strong message to the Chinese, while Indian transport aircraft played a crucial role in the swift mobilisation of troops and equipment to forward areas, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. He made a special mention of the capability brought to the table by the Rafale jets armed with ultra-modern armament like the Meteor beyond-visual-range missiles and Hammer air-to-ground munition, capabilities that were not available during Balakot. The need for Rafale jets with its superior weapons was felt during the dogfight with the Pakistan Air Force on February 27, a day after the Balakot raid. A professional force learns from every engagement and the Balakot strike was no different, said Bahadur. “While ‘Balakot’ was only a strike mission, the long-drawn-out faceoff with China brought to fore the massive airlift capability of the IAF. The investment of planners more than a decade back proved its worth as the Indian Army inducted almost three divisions into Ladakh, along with heavy armour, using the transport fleet of the IAF,” said Bahadur. The air force’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft were used to move soldiers, tanks and infantry combat vehicles to the Ladakh sector, while C-130J Super Hercules aircraft undertook sorties to the advanced landing ground in the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie sector to support the military’s deployments. The deployment of the Apache attack helicopters made it clear that Chinese mechanised formations would face a formidable foe, he said. Armed with fire-and-forget Hellfire missiles, an Apache can track up to 128 targets a minute and prioritise threats. The missiles equip the gunships with anti-armour capabilities. The induction of the Chinook multi-mission helicopters enhanced the IAF’s capabilities to transport troops and artillery to forward areas. “Some capability gaps still remain, especially of combat enablers like AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) and flight refuelling aircraft -- deficiencies that the government must look into urgently,” Bahadur added. If the Balakot air strikes showed there was scope to use fighter jets for taking out targets in Pakistan below the threshold of conventional war, India’s firm actions in Ladakh have made it clear to the Chinese that the salami-slicing tactics in their playbook will not work against India, the people cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-strengthened-capabilities-after-balakot-deployed-new-acquisitions-in-ladakh-101614310076669.html
26-02-2021||India||Early onset of summer in NW India despite La Nina’s cooling effect?||Summer seems to have arrived in many parts of northwest India. The maximum temperatures have started nearing and, in some cases, breaching the 35 degree C (°C)mark, 6 to 7 degrees higher than normal.On Thursday, Delhi recorded 33.2°C, 8 degrees above normal; Narnaul recorded 34.5°C, 8 degrees above normal; Hisar 32.3°C, 6 degrees above normal; Churu 35.3°C, 6 degrees above normal; Narnaul 34.5°C, 8 degrees above normal; Ambala 31.1°C, 7 degrees above normal and Bikaner 34.6°C, 6 degrees above normal. According to the Thursday bulletin of India Meteorological Department (IMD), above normal temperatures will prevail across the country for the next 2-3 days.On Wednesday, Phalodi, for example, recorded 35.8 degree C (°C), 6.8 degrees above normal; Bikaner 34.2°C, 7.2 degrees above normal; Churu 35.6°C, 7.6 degrees above normal; Pilani 34.5°C, 8.5 degrees above normal; Narnaul 34.5°C, 9.5 degrees above normal; Delhi recorded 32.5°C, 7.5 degrees above normal. Also Read | Delhi’s temperature to rise further, air quality continues to remain poorAccording to an IMD statement, higher temperatures over the north-western plains is mainly attributed to absence of any weather system, and prevalence of south-westerly surface winds which is causing advection of heat from West Rajasthan towards the region.Interestingly, earlier meteorologists had projected that winter conditions could be prolonged this year because of La Nina, a global weather phenomenon. El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, while La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters. “La Nina conditions are still moderate. But I think temperatures have gone up in northwest India due to south-westerly winds. Northerly winds bring cool air. The maximum temperatures can drop again marginally and temporarily when the wind direction changes,” said DS Pai, senior climate scientist at IMD, Pune.“Yes, there seems to be early onset of summer this year. The La Nina’s cooling effect has started diminishing. We have seen 30°C+ temperatures in the last week of February in the past also but this time the average maximum temperature is definitely higher. Normally, there are six Western Disturbances in January and February but this time, there was one Western Disturbance which affected between January 3 and 6 and another around February 4 which also impacted the northern plains. The impact of the rest of the WDs has been limited to upper reaches of Western Himalayas. There are clear skies and low wind speed which is leading to rapid heating in the day,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“We are almost in summer. IMD considers March, April and May to be pre-monsoon season. The reason we are seeing a sudden shift to hot weather is because there is no weather system bringing rain. There is rain and snowfall only in the Western Himalayas. The wind direction is variable but mostly easterly. Whenever there is abundant sunshine there will be heating. We are preparing to issue our outlook for summer season next week,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-onset-of-summer-in-nw-india-despite-la-nina-s-cooling-effect-101614310016479.html
26-02-2021||India||Transport, trade unions call for ‘Bharat Bandh’; farmers' unions to join||The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has called for a nationwide strike on Friday to protest against the spike in fuel prices and the new e-way bill. They have also demanded a review of the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The traders’ body has said that all commercial markets across the country will remain shut following their ‘Bharat Bandh’ call.The All India Transporters Welfare Association (AITWA) has extended support to the nationwide strike and has said that it will hold a road blockade. Farm unions protesting against the Centre's agricultural laws will also participate in the strike peacefully, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) said in a statement.Apart from agitating against the rising fuel price, transporters have demanded the scrapping of e-way bill laws. It is the permit that they are required to carry while moving goods from one place to another. Following a recent amendment in the GST laws, the validity of the bill has narrowed and increased to 200km per day from 100km earlier. Penalties for a truck carrying a consignment with an expired e-way bill, or with an erroneous e-way bill amount to 200% of the tax value, or 100% of the invoice value under Section 129 of CGST act, 2017.The participants will stage sit-in demonstrations in more than 1,500 towns and cities across states. Several services across the country are likely to be affected as more than 40,000 traders' associations are taking part in the bandh. Private transport facilities may also be hit as the AITWA has asked all transport companies to park their vehicles between 6am and 8pm as a mark of protest. Booking and movement of bill-oriented goods will also be hit. Also, as a symbol of protest, no traders will log in to the GST portal.Chartered accountants and tax advocates’ associations have also backed the strike. Women entrepreneurs, small industries, hawkers, among others, will also join the bandh, CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal has said. Essential services like medical shops, milk, vegetable shops, etc are, however, expected to remain unaffected. Banks are also likely to operate without any disruptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transport-trade-unions-call-for-bharat-bandh-farmers-unions-to-join-101614307042309.html

26-02-2021||India||Juvenile convict to be let off with fine in 22-years old murder case||Sentenced to life for murder 22 years ago, a man will now be set free by a local juvenile court in Madhya Pradesh on payment of fine after the Supreme Court concluded that the convict was a juvenile at the time of commission of the crime.For all these years, the accused made no whisper about his juvenility before the trial court or the Madhya Pradesh high court, which returned consistent findings of guilt against the man, holding that he along with his father Devi Lal and brother Gokul killed one Ganeshram due to enmity. In May 1999, the trial court at Neemach, MP, sentenced the three accused to life imprisonment for murder and under various provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Following this, the Madhya Pradesh high court in September 2006 upheld this ruling.The trio appealed in the Supreme Court in 2007 but the plea of juvenility of one of the accused was raised for the first time a decade later in 2017. The top court in October 2018, directed the sessions Judge, Neemuch to hold an inquiry into this aspect. Based on the inquiry, the accused was found to be aged 16 years and 11 months on the date of the incident, i.e. July 19, 1998.The question before the Supreme Court was whether the accused should be tried as a juvenile as under the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 as it then prevailed when the crime was committed as those under 16 years were termed juvenile under the act. The accused did not fall in this category as he exceeded the age limit. In the year 2000, this bar was lifted to 18 years.Section 20 of the modified act provided, “all proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any court in any area on the date on which this act comes into force in that area, shall be continued in that court as if this act had not been passed and if the court finds that the juvenile has committed an offence, it shall record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect of the juvenile, forward the juvenile to the board which shall pass orders in respect of that juvenile in accordance with the provisions of this act.”Also Read: UK Court terms Markandey Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi trial unreliableFollowing this law, the bench of justices UU Lalit, Indira Banerjee and KM Joseph held, “Even while holding the appellant to be juvenile in terms of the 2000 act and guilty of the offence with which he was charged, we set aside the sentence of life imprisonment imposed upon him and remit the matter to the jurisdictional Juvenile Justice Board for determining appropriate quantum of fine that should be levied on appellant.”As regards the other two accused, the Supreme Court upheld the life sentence confirmed by the high court. Since they were released on bail by the top court in April 2009, the bench directed them to surrender before the concerned police station within two weeks and undergo the sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/juvenile-convict-to-be-let-off-with-fine-in-22-years-old-murder-case-101614306433059.html
26-02-2021||India||Nirav Modi's extradition to India cleared: What next||The minister of external affairs (MEA) has said the Indian government will liaise with authorities in the United Kingdom for the early extradition of Nirav Modi after a British court ordered the jailed diamond merchant's extradition to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering. The UK court had ordered Modi to be extradited to India to stand trial after dismissing arguments of his "mental health concerns," saying they are not unusual in a man in his circumstances."Now since the Magistrates' Court has recommended Nirav Modi's extradition to the UK Home Secretary, the government of India would liaise with UK authorities for his early extradition to India," Anurag Srivastava, MEA spokesperson, said on Thursday according to news agency ANI.Also read | Refurbished cell at Arthur Road jail awaits high-profile inmate like Nirav ModiThe district judge at the Westminster Magistrates' Court Samuel Goozee said that there is no evidence to suggest he would not receive a fair trial in India. Nirav Modi, who is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated $2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case, lost his nearly two-year-long legal battle against extradition on all grounds as Goozee also said that there are no human rights concerns that the medical needs of the 49-year-old would not be addressed as per several Indian government assurances.Also watch | 'Nirav Modi can be extradited to India': What UK Judge said & what happens nextThe UK court's ruling comes after a nearly two-year-long legal battle for Modi's extradition, who is wanted for money laundering in the PNB scam. Under the UK Extradition Act, 2003, the judge will now send his findings to the UK secretary of state for home affairs, Priti Patel. The UK cabinet minister is authorised to order extradition under the India-UK extradition treaty and has two months within which to make that decision. The home secretary's order rarely goes against the court’s conclusions, as she has to consider only some very narrow bars to extradition which are unlikely to apply in this case, including the possible imposition of a death penalty.Also read | ‘Personal agenda’: UK court on Markandey Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi trialModi has up to 14 days to approach the high court and seek leave to appeal after Patel has made her decision known.

For now, he will remain on remand at Wandsworth Prison until the home secretary decides to sign off on the extradition order.Modi was arrested on an extradition warrant on March 19, 2019, and has appeared via videolink from Wandsworth Prison for a series of court hearings in the extradition case. His multiple attempts at seeking bail have been repeatedly turned down, both at the magistrates’ and high court level, as he was deemed a flight risk.Modi also faces charges of money laundering, destruction of evidence and witness intimidation apart from those relating to defrauding PNB through the use of fraudulent loan agreements to the tune of $2 billion.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-s-extradition-to-india-cleared-what-next-101614305934685.html

Discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement,” Jaishankar tweeted, without giving details.There was no official word on the contact from the Chinese side.The “Moscow Agreement” that Jaishankar referred to was a five-point agreement that the two sides had concluded during the meeting of the foreign ministers in the Russian capital. A joint statement issued after that meeting had said the two sides would be guided by the consensus of the leaders of India and China, including not allowing differences to become disputes.Jaishankar and Wang had also agreed that border troops would “continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions”, and that the two sides would abide by all existing agreements and protocols on border management and “avoid any action that could escalate matters”.The two sides further agreed to continue dialogue through the Special Representatives’ mechanism and through meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. Once the situation eases, the two sides would work on new confidence-building measures for enhancing peace and tranquillity in border areas.Asked about the situation on the LAC at a regular news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Both sides view the smooth and successful completion of disengagement in the north and south bank [of Pangong Lake] as a significant first step as this forms a basis for resolution of remaining issues so as to achieve the eventual goal of complete disengagement in all friction areas.”“The two sides have agreed to work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues,” he said.Within 48 hours of the completion of the disengagement at Pangong Lake, the 10th round of talks between senior military commanders of the two sides was held on February 20. Srivastava said the two sides had “candid and in-depth exchange of views on the remaining issues along the LAC in the western sector” at this meeting.The meeting of the military commanders had focused on disengagement at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains though there were no immediate signs of a breakthrough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/s-jaishankar-china-counterpart-review-disengagement-at-lac-101614304642713.html

RAX is an ultra-secure fixed-line network.“The monkey has been killed,” he said in Hindi. “Bandar mara gaya.”The message meant that the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist training camp at Balakot in hinterland Pakistan had been taken down by Indian fighter jets in a daring pre-dawn operation across the border.Dhanoa made similar calls to then Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Secretary (Research and Analysis Wing) Anil Dhasmana.NSA Doval, in turn, informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Also Watch | 'Big mistake': PM Modi's stern warning to terror outfitsThe Indian response to the February 14, 2019 Pulwama suicide attack engineered by JeM, in which 40 CRPF troopers were killed was complete. Now two years later, more granular details of the operation, including its name, and the failure of one missile with optical guidance have emerged.Top officials and functionaries involved in Balakot strike told HT that the code name Bandar was deliberately chosen in order to confuse Pakistani intelligence, which, the Indian side hoped, would think the reference was to the JeM HQ at Bhawalpur with the terror group’s ailing chief Masood Azhar living securely within the compound.Also Read | NSA Doval led secret back-channels talks with Pak for months before DGMO pactAhead of the strike, and in keeping with this deception, a posse of Indian fighters was scrambled in the Rajasthan sector to force the Pakistan Air Force to move all its assets to intercept the Indians over the skies of Bhawalpur. As a result, when IAF’s upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters released their Spice 2000 penetrator bombs which are packed with 90 kg explosives, the closest Pakistani aircraft was 150 kilometres away. IAF deliberately chose February 26 as D-day; it was the last quarter of the full moon; and the fighters successfully evaded Pakistani radars flying below the Pir Panjal ranges. According to the officials, all five bombs struck home at 330 am IST or 300 am Pakistani time.The sixth bomb carrying optical guidance making did not fire due to a software snag. The only place left untouched in Balakot was the mosque, which had already started preparation of the Fajr namaz.After the strike was completed, a cabinet meeting was summoned by PM Narendra Modi with all senior ministers, top PMO officials, Cabinet Secretary, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Secretary (RAW), Director Intelligence Bureau and then Air Chief present. It was at this meeting that PM Modi openly thanked Indian intelligence, particularly RAW for its actionable intelligence and the intrepid IAF chief for a daring operation. A beaming Finance Minister Arun Jaitley patted both the leaders on their backs and Doval shook hands with Dhanoa and Dhasmana.However, national security planners were concerned about the last missile not being fired as the job of optical guidance was to get proof of the strike and counter any Pakistani or western propaganda about the strike. Sure enough, the Pakistani propaganda machine swung into action immediately by showing images of high explosive ordnance in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to suggest that the strike had failed. The officials said IAF deliberately chose penetrator bombs so that there was minimal collateral damage; they added that images from within the Balakot camp showed at least 300 jihadists present a day before the strike. According to the officials, much of the actionable intelligence for IAF was routed through then RAW deputy chief Samant Goel (now the chief of the agency), and at least some of it came from a source within the camp.It is still not clear whether the Indian mole inside the Balakot camp survived the Indian missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bandar-mara-gaya-the-3-45am-phone-call-in-delhi-after-air-strike-in-balakot-101614301091538.html
26-02-2021||India||Fresh plea seeks legalisation of same-sex unions||Three gay men and a lesbian woman filed a petition on Thursday urging the Delhi high court to declare a marriage between any two persons, irrespective of their sex, legal under the 1954 Special Marriage Act.The plea asked the court to declare that SMA applied regardless of sex to any two persons who wish to marry, by reading down gender or sexuality-based restrictions in the act. This is the third petition in the HC seeking legalisation of same-sex unions. “We pray that this hon’ble court recognize us, and other members of the LGBTQ+ community, as people, and uphold non-discriminatory access to the act,” the plea read.A bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal – who are hearing the other petitions — sought the Centre’s response and posted the matter for further hearing on April 20.The first petitioner, lawyer Udit Sood, did not return to the country after higher studies, seeing the liberty given to the couples abroad. The second petitioner, Saattvic, lives in Vancouver and said he was forced to relocate to stay with his partner.The third petitioner, Lakshmi Manoharan, is a scientist in California. She said she experienced frustration and helplessness about being unable to care for her aging parents.The fourth petitioner, Gagandeep Paul, is considering moving to Canada so that he and his partner may marry. The plea was filed by advocates Megha Mishra and Tahira from law firm Karanjawala and company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-plea-seeks-legalisation-of-same-sex-unions-101614302399453.html
26-02-2021||India||Centre opposes petitions for same-sex marriage||The Centre told the Delhi high court on Thursday that a marriage in India can be recognised only if it is between a “biological man” and a “biological woman” capable of producing children, strongly opposing the validation of same-sex marital unions.The government said any interference by a court in the marital statute based on personal laws will create “havoc” in society and will run afoul of the intent of Parliament in framing the laws. It said a fundamental right cannot be an “untrammelled right” and can’t override other constitutional principles.In an affidavit filed before a bench comprising justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal, the government opposed pleas seeking legalisation of same-sex marriages and said the laws mandate that “marriage is a bond between a biological man and a biological woman”.The institution of marriage has a sanctity attached to it and in major parts of the country it is regarded as a “sacrament”, the government argued. It said that in India, despite statutory recognition of the relationship of marriage between a biological man and a biological woman, marriage depends on age-old customs, rituals, practices, cultural ethos and societal values.In a plea filed before the court, Abhijit Iyer Mitra, Gopi Shankar, Giti Thadani and G Oorvasi noted that a marriage between people of the same gender wasn’t still possible despite the Supreme Court decriminalising consensual homosexual acts in 2018 and sought a declaration recognising such unions under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA).Through counsel Raghav Awasthi, the petition contended that the HMA does not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual marriages if one were to go by how it is worded. The act very clearly states that marriage can be solemnised between “any two Hindus,” the petition argued.The second petition was filed by two mental health professionals — Kavita Arora, 47, and Ankita Khanna, 36 — seeking legal recognition of their marriages under two different civil laws, the Special Marriage Act and the Foreign Marriage Act.The third plea was filed by two men — Vaibhav Jain, an Indian citizen, and Parag Vijay Mehta, an overseas citizen of India — who got married in the United States, where same-sex marriage is legal, in 2017. They also sought the same relief as Arora and Khanna, stating that an Indian consulate had refused to register their union this year under the FMA.The government said Western ideas cannot be imported to the Indian context, citing the Indian constitutional law and jurisprudence. It said that seeking the registration of such marriages has more ramifications than simple legal recognition, including family issues and “public significance”.“Family issues are far beyond mere recognition and registration of marriage between persons belonging to the same gender. Living together as partners and having sexual relationship by same-sex individuals {which is decriminalised now] is not comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children which necessarily presuppose a biological man as a ‘husband’, a biological woman as a ‘wife’ and the children born out of the union between the two,” the Centre told the high court.Expressing disappointment, Mitra said: “The government’s position is curious given the Act itself wiped out several recorded Hindu traditions that existed prior to codification. Whoever drafted the response also seems clueless about the 60-odd genders recognised in Hindu historical texts not to mention it has failed to provide any textual basis prohibiting the marriage of these 60-odd genders.”“The progeny argument is particularly ridiculous because it implies any marriage shorn of biological offspring is not a marriage. In short this is a shoddy and poorly drafted response,” he added.In its affidavit, the Centre said the “celebration of a marriage gives rise to not just legal but moral and social obligations, particularly the reciprocal duty of support placed upon spouses and their joint responsibility for supporting and raising children born of the marriage and to ensure their proper mental and psychological growth in the most natural way possible”.“Relationship in marriage has more than personal significance at least in part because human beings are social beings whose humanity is expressed through their relationships with other. Entering into marriage therefore is to enter into a relationship that has public significance as well.”“The institution of marriage and family are important social institutions that provide for the security, support and companionship of members of our society and bear an important role in the rearing of child and their mental and psychological upbringing,” the affidavit read.It said the concept of marriage cannot be relegated to merely a concept within the domain of privacy of an individual. The government said that considering the larger statutory framework, it is clear that “there exists a legitimate state interest in limiting the legal recognition of marriage to persons of opposite sexes only”.“In same sex marriage, it is neither possible nor feasible to term one a husband and the other one a wife... Resultantly the statutory scheme of many statutory enactments will become otiose,” it asserted.Advocate Raghav Awasthi, who represented one of the petitioners, said: “With utmost respect, one is unable to bring oneself to agree with the point of view that has been put forth in the counter affidavit. Not only does the Hindu Marriage Act per se does not mention biological ‘sex’ or ‘gender’, Hindu religious texts are also rife with references to non-binary individuals and their conjugal rights.“That marriage and/or sexual companionship must exist between heterosexual persons is an Abrahamic conception and has little to do with Hinduism. If our religion is to survive and thrive in the 21st century, we must not reduce ourselves to a pale imitation of the Abrahamic religious traditions and should reclaim our ancient tradition of tolerance as well as celebration of sexual diversity,” he said.On Thursday, the court allowed the Delhi government to be impleaded as a party to the case and posted the matter for further hearing on April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-opposes-petitions-for-same-sex-marriage-101614301498359.html

26-02-2021||India||US welcomes India-Pakistan joint statement on ceasefire||The United States has welcomed the joint statement of India and Pakistan to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control and other sectors, saying it is a positive step towards greater peace and stability in South Asia.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also said at her daily news conference on Thursday that the Biden administration remains closely engaged with a range of leaders and officials in the region, including those in Pakistan."The United States welcomes the joint statement between India and Pakistan that the two countries have agreed to maintain strict observance of a ceasefire along the Line of Control starting on February 25th," Psaki said."This is a positive step towards greater peace and stability in South Asia which is in our shared interest and we encourage both countries to keep building upon this progress," she said when asked about the joint statement that announced India and Pakistan have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.Asked if Islamabad is doing enough in the fight against terrorism, she said, "But in terms of an assessment of that I would point you to the State Department or the Intelligence Department."At a separate news conference, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the administration had called on the parties to reduce tensions along the LoC by returning to the 2003 ceasefire agreement."We have been very clear that we condemn the terrorists who seek to infiltrate across the Line of Control," he said."When it comes to the US' role, we continue to support direct dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and other issues of concern, and we certainly welcome the arrangement that was announced that will go into effect I should say on February 25," Price said.He said Pakistan is an important partner with whom the US shares many interests."We, have been clearer in terms of this issue. Obviously, Pakistan has an important role to play when it comes to Afghanistan and what takes place across its other border. So clearly, we will be paying close attention, and we urge the Pakistanis to play a constructive role in all of these areas of mutual interests including in Afghanistan, including with Kashmir including with our other shared interest," Price said.The joint statement issued in Islamabad and New Delhi said the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) of the two countries held discussions over the established mechanism of hotline contact and reviewed the situation along the LoC and all other sectors in a "free, frank and cordial" atmosphere."In the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders, the two DGMOs agreed to address each other's core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence."Both sides agreed for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control and all other sectors with effect from midnight of February 24/25," the joint statement said.The two sides also reiterated that existing mechanisms of hotline contact and border flag meetings will be utilised to resolve any unforeseen situation or misunderstanding, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-welcomes-india-pakistan-joint-statement-on-ceasefire-101614297986470.html
26-02-2021||India||FIR registered after vehicle with explosives found near Mukesh Ambani's house||An FIR has been registered in connection with the seizure of a vehicle, which had explosive material inside it, from near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence in South Mumbai, police said on Friday.The vehicle with gelatin sticks and apparently a fake number plate was found parked on Thursday on Carmichael Road near 'Antilia', the multi-storey residence of Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries.The FIR has been registered at the Gamdevi Police Station against unidentified persons, a Mumbai Police spokesperson said.Police have registered the case under Indian Penal Code sections 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 465 (punishment for forgery), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal), 506(2) (criminal intimidation, if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy), the spokesperson said.Section four of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, (punishment for attempt to cause explosion, or for making or keeping explosive with intent to endanger life or property) has also been included in the FIR, the official said, adding that the vehicle has been seized.The registration number on the vehicle's number plate was the same as that of an SUV in Ambani's security detail, police had said.A letter was also found inside the car, the spokesperson said, without revealing its contents.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had tweeted, "Twenty gelatin explosives sticks were found in a Scorpio van in the vicinity of industrialist Mukesh Ambani''s residence in Mumbai. The Mumbai Crime Branch police is investigating the matter and the findings will be out soon."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-registered-after-vehicle-with-explosives-found-near-mukesh-ambani-s-house-101614297642901.html
26-02-2021||India||India, Pakistan agree on ceasefire along LoC||The Indian and Pakistani armies announced on Thursday that they had begun strictly adhering to a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24 – the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between senior security officials of the two countries.A joint statement issued by the two armies said the move followed a discussion between India’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha, and his Pakistani counterpart, Maj Gen Nauman Zakaria, over their established telephone hotline. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the DGMOs spoke on February 22.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s key adviser on security affairs, Moeed Yusuf, said in an audio statement issued to journalists in Islamabad that the agreement on the ceasefire was the outcome of “behind-the-scenes” contacts and “more roads will open” in the future. Yusuf didn’t elaborate on the nature of these contacts.The move comes at a time when the Indian military is largely focused on the standoff with China in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which emerged in the open in May last year, though there has been no let-up in counterterrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir.During their discussion on the hotline, the two DGMOs “reviewed the situation along the Line of Control and all other sectors in a free, frank and cordial atmosphere”, the joint statement said.India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire on the LoC in November 2003. Though the truce largely held over the years, it came under strain after bilateral ties hit a low following the Pulwama suicide attack in February 2019 and India’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019, and troops from the two sides regularly traded fire.The DGMOs also “agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence” in the interest of “achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders”. The two sides added that existing mechanisms of hotline contact and border flag meetings will be used to “resolve any unforeseen situation or misunderstanding”.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a regular news briefing that the ceasefire agreement didn’t amount to a change of India’s position on key issues related to Pakistan. He didn’t respond to questions on back-channel contacts or the possibility of talks. “India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan. We have always maintained that we are committed to addressing issues, if any, in a peaceful and bilateral manner,” he said.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the established convention of weekly contacts between officials of the Directorate General of Military Operations of the two countries had continued in recent months despite periodic flare-ups along the LoC. The DGMOs speak on the hotline when there is a specific request from either side, the people added.The people said that while the Indian side had agreed to the ceasefire, there was no question of lowering the guard when it came to operations to counter infiltration along the LoC or terrorism within Jammu and Kashmir. There will also be no reduction of forces along the LoC and troops will remain prepared to deal with all contingencies, the people said.“The main idea is to have peace along the LoC so that the local population doesn’t suffer,” said one of the people cited above.The people expressed cautious optimism about the development but said the cross-border infiltration of terrorists and attacks by Pakistan-based terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba continued to be key concerns.Moeed Yusuf, who holds the post of special assistant to the Pakistan premier on national security and strategic policy planning, said in his audio statement that the ceasefire agreement was a positive development that should be welcomed.“So when people ask what is the [Pakistan] government’s policy and what is it doing on Kashmir, and nothing is happening, they should realise that such things are done behind the scenes. Lots of effort is being made,” Yusuf said, speaking in Urdu.“This is our success and the success of diplomacy and, God willing, more roads will open in the future,” he said.Yusuf contended that the joint statement was a “victory for Pakistan” as India was not agreeing to a ceasefire. Pakistan, he said, was “repeatedly saying that we want peace and we want that there should be a ceasefire at the LoC” so that innocent civilians aren’t killed.“Today’s development is very solid and positive and it should be welcomed and it is the success of our policy that is being seen in this development,” Yusuf said. He added: “The problem of Kashmir that we want to resolve, and the way we want to resolve it, it will happen.”People familiar with developments in Islamabad said Yusuf has been playing a key role in efforts to foster a rapprochement with India and his work has the backing of the powerful military, including Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.Data accessed by HT shows that 2018 witnessed 1,629 ceasefire violations by Pakistan, 3,168 the following year and a high of 4,645 in 2020. This year the figure stands at 591, as of February 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pakistan-agree-on-ceasefire-along-loc-101614297442498.html
26-02-2021||India||Centre announces rules for OTT, digital media||The Centre on Thursday notified rules that will govern online content, which includes allowing users to dispute action taken against them by social media intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter, and setting up a three-tier self-regulatory framework for so-called over the top (OTT) platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hotstar, and online news media entities.HT reported details of the rules governing OTTs and intermediaries on Wednesday, and the rules governing online news media on Thursday.“The rules establish a soft-touch. self-regulatory architecture and a Code of Ethics and a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism for news publishers and OTT Platforms and digital media,” minister for electronics and information technology (MeitY) Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a Thursday briefing.Prasad added that social media intermediaries are welcome to do business in India, and while the government welcomes dissent, abuse of social media has to be curbed.His colleague, minister of information and broadcasting (I&B) Prakash Javadekar, said a free press symbolises the spirit of democracy, but no one should be allowed to spread fake news. He added that while legacy media was governed by Press Council of India rules, there has been no such regulation for online media, stressing the need for a level playing field.The government said the moves would create a level playing field for traditional and new media. MeitY and the ministry of I&B have been working to come up with a comprehensive framework to regulate content on OTTs and social media intermediaries. OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime have come under fire for airing content that some claimed “hurt religious sentiments” . Social media companies such as WhatsApp and Twitter, meanwhile, have sparred with the state over an update in usage policy in the case of the former, and non-compliance with take down orders in the case of the latter.The government said the rules would create a level playing field for traditional and new media.The policy — notified on Thursday evening — also includes bringing digital news publishers under the ambit of Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, which empowers the government to order the blocking of access to content that is considered a threat to public order. An authorised officer from the I&B ministry who will head an interministerial committee at the apex of the self-regulatory system can also issue this order under emergency circumstances where the companies will not be given a chance to offer an explanation. The committee will have to meet within 48 hours to ratify the emergency block.The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), whose members include Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hotstar, Facebook and Twitter, welcomed the announcement of the framework.“IAMAI has welcomed the much awaited Intermediary Guidelines 2021. The guidelines, focused primarily on consumer complaints, will help users of online content and social media resolve their complaints in a process oriented manner,” the association said in a statement.A Facebook spokesperson said: “We have always been clear as a company that we welcome regulations that set guidelines for addressing today’s toughest challenges on the Internet. Facebook is committed to people’s ability to freely and safely express themselves on our platforms.”The spokesperson added: “The details of rules like these matter and we will carefully study the new rules that were just published. We acknowledge and appreciate the recognition from the Minister on the positive contributions of social media to the country. Facebook is an ally for India and the agenda of user safety and security is a critical one for our platforms. We will continue to work to ensure that our platforms play an enabling role in fuelling the exciting digital transformation of India.”When asked about the absence of consultation with digital news media entities, Javadekar said no list of such entities existed.Prasad stressed that the platforms cannot follow double standards when it comes to different countries. “There can’t be a double standard for Capitol Hill and Red Fort violence,” he said.In a statement, the ministry of information and broadcasting said that it held consultations in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai over the past one-and-a- half years wherein OTT operators had been urged to develop a “self-regulatory mechanism”.“The government also studied the regulatory models followed in other countries, including Singapore, Australia, EU and UK and has gathered that most of them either have an institutional mechanism to regulate digital content or are in the process of setting-up one,” it added.The rules seek to empower users by mandating the intermediaries, including social media ones, to establish a grievance redressal mechanism. A Grievance Officer shall acknowledge the complaint within 24 hours and resolve it within fifteen days.“The rules will come in effect from the date of their publication in the gazette except for the additional due diligence for significant social media intermediaries, which shall come in effect three months after publication of these rules,” the government said.HT on Wednesday reported that social media companies need to appoint officers who will be responsible for complying with content moderation orders, and both they and streaming service providers will be brought under a three-tier regulatory framework, according to the proposed new rules that will cover media companies such as Facebook and OTTs such as Netflix. In addition, shows on these platforms will have to carry ratings such as U(universal) or (Adult) —something they are not required to do currently.Countries including India have felt the need to regulate social media companies, which, under the current rules, are not responsible for content, unlike traditional media entities; demands have been made to regulate content on OTT platforms, with some shows on these, such as Amazon Prime’s Tandav, running into trouble for offending religious sentiments.In the document, titled Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics code) Rules, 2021, the government cited powers provided to it under section 87 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This section allows the government to make rules to carry out the provisions of the law by notification in the Official Gazette and in the Electronic Gazette.Political parties were divided over the new policy. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate welcomed provisions against paedophilia and child pornography, but added: “Ravi Shankar Prasad has presided over the death of Indian telecom, is now presiding over the death of freedom of speech and expression and he needs to be reminded that this country takes its roots back to Mahatma Gandhi, who fought non-violently, who fought for the freedom of speech and expression and eventually did win, so anything that has been done in the garb of curbing the freedom of speech and expression must and shall not be tolerated.”CPI(M) politburo member Nilotpal Basu said, “Social media has been misused to the hilt by the BJP and its IT cell. International studies show India is home to maximum fake news and distorted content.

26-02-2021||India||Behind India-Pak breakthrough, months of secret back channel talks led by Doval||The joint statement issued by India and Pakistan on Thursday on the ceasefire agreement between their top military commanders may have surprised many but it comes months after National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and his counterpart in Islamabad initiated back-channel conversations to ensure peace along the tense border, people aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.NSA Doval and Moeed W Yusuf, Prime Minister Imran Khan’s special assistant on National Security Division and Strategic Policy Planning, have been in touch directly and via interlocutors from the intelligence community, one of these people confirmed.The joint statement is the first outcome of these conversations that included at least one face-to-face meeting in a third country, the person cited above said, without naming the location. He added that only a small group of top government leaders including the Prime Minister, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar were aware of the details of the talks.ALSO WATCH | India-Pakistan ceasefire: The Ajit Doval factor & Islamabad’s reaction﻿Late on Thursday evening, however, Yusuf tried to distance himself from the talks in a series of tweets. “No such talks have taken place between me and Mr. Doval...The welcome development on the LoC is a result of discussions through the established channel of DGMOs,” he said.Thursday’s joint statement, issued in New Delhi by the defence ministry, said the director generals of military operations (DGMO) of the two armies had agreed to “strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control” from Wednesday midnight.The two top commanders also “agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns which have a propensity to disturb the peace and lead to violence”.To be sure, this is not the first time that the two top army officers have agreed to hold peace along the border. They signed off on a similar pact in 2018 when they pledged to strictly adhere to the terms of the ceasefire understanding of 2003 in letter and spirit. That wasn’t to be, though. Officials said Thursday’s joint statement could be the first of the many steps that the two countries take over the next few months to normalise relations, one step at a time.National security planners said there were five developments over the last month or so that indicated a nuanced shift.The first sign that the back-channel conversations were on track came earlier this month. Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, in a departure from his strident pitch against India after the Balakot air strike in 2019, on February 2 spoke of Islamabad’s commitment to what he called the ideal of mutual respect and peaceful co-existence and said: “it is time to extend a hand of peace in all directions”.The second was the toned-down statements that emerged from Islamabad three days later, on February 5, which is observed by the Pakistani establishment as Kashmir Solidarity Day. “I found it unusual,” said a counter-terror official who wasn’t in the loop on the secret talks and who asked not to be named.The third was a decline in the ceasefire violations along the border in Jammu and Kashmir in recent weeks.A top government functionary said Gen Bajwa’s much-publicised peace proposal, a decline in ceasefire violations and Pakistan’s toned-down rhetoric were clearly linked to the quiet conversations taking place.The fourth sign of a possible thaw in the relations was Pakistan steering clear of the Kashmir issue at last week’s South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (Saarc) meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19 pandemic.Dr Faisal Sultan, special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Health restricted himself to the issue at hand, a sharp contrast to Pakistan’s previous attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the Saarc meeting held in March last year.The fifth indicator, an official said, was New Delhi’s gesture of allowing Imran Khan’s special aircraft to use Indian airspace en route to Sri Lanka on Tuesday. PM Khan’s Pakistan Air Force jet flew along India’s coastline and over the Lakshadweep archipelago before landing in Colombo.India’s decision to allow the special flight to use its airspace was in marked contrast to Pakistan’s action in 2019, when Islamabad denied permission for the use of Pakistani airspace by three Indian VVIP flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behind-india-pak-breakthrough-months-of-secret-back-channel-talks-led-by-doval-101614296272990.html

Despite having been a former Supreme Court judge in India until his retirement in 2011, his evidence was in my assessment less than objective and reliable. His evidence in Court appeared tinged with resentment towards former senior judicial colleagues. It had hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda.”The Judge further said that he found Katju’s “evidence and behaviour in engaging the media the day before giving evidence to be questionable”.In his testimony, Katju said in the court that India was in a poor economic condition, that Nirav Modi was a scapegoat being blamed for causing a financial crisis in India. He added that the Indian Supreme Court had become subservient to the Indian government.The former Supreme Court judge could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-court-terms-markandey-katju-s-testimony-in-nirav-modi-trial-unreliable-101614296082121.html

It has also noted that Google has recently agreed to better compensate and pay publishers in France, the European Union and Australia.”HT reached out to Google but did not receive a response.On Thursday, the two houses of Australia’s parliament passed the “News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code” that requires companies such as Google and Facebook, whose primary source of revenue is advertising, to pay local publishers for content.INS added that advertising has been the financial backbone of the news industry but that “newspaper publishers are seeing their share of the advertising pie shrinking in the digital space, even as Google is taking a giant share, leaving publishers with a small share”.Raising an issue that has been a sticking point with traditional media companies around the world, the INS statement referred to Google’s role as a search engine, an ad-tech company, and also an analytics firm. It said publishers face an opaque advertising system, as they are unable to get details of Google’s advertising value chain. It has insisted that Google increase the publisher share of advertising revenue to 85%, and also ensure transparency in revenue reports provided by it. Alphabet’s Google last year said it would pay some media groups in Australia, Brazil and Germany for high-quality content. The tech giant has for years tried to fend off such demands worldwide in return for using their content, with European media groups among its fiercest critics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pay-for-news-indian-newspaper-society-in-a-letter-to-google-101614293033038.html
26-02-2021||India||Car with explosives found near Mukesh Ambani’s residence||There was high drama in south Mumbai on Thursday evening after an abandoned SUV with explosives was found parked on Carmichael Road in the tony Pedder Road area. Police said the vehicle — a green Scorpio with a wrong number plate had around 20 Gelatin sticks in it — was about 600 metres away from the house of Reliance Industries Limited chairman Mukesh Ambani on Altamount Road.There are several other prominent spots in the vicinity, including Jaslok Hospital, the Russian Centre, and multiple apartment buildings. Police clarified that the material found was not an assembled explosive device. “A suspicious vehicle was found on Carmichael Road today evening under limits of Gamdevi Police Station. Police was alerted. Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) team and other Police teams reached the spot immediately, examined the vehicle and found some explosive material Gelatin inside. It is not an assembled explosive device. Further investigation is going on,” Mumbai police spokesperson, deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu said.A second police officer who asked not to be named said the car was suspiciously abandoned on Carmichael Road since the previous night . After the police control room was informed on Thursday, cops called in the bomb squad. “Two explosive detector Labrador dogs of BDDS - Oscar and Moti - detected suspicious explosives and alerted their handlers. The bomb squad personnel were then called in who scanned the articles found in the vehicle and identified it to be gelatin. The same was taken out safely and taken to a safe place following standard procedures. In all 20 gelatin sticks were found,” said a third officer.The person who parked the car at the spot at around 1 am on Thursday has been captured in the CCTV of a nearby general store. The police will enhance the quality of the CCTV footage to identify the suspect, the second officer said. He said the number plate may have been of a car that belongs to Ambani’s security detail. HT could not independently verify this.Home minister Anil Deshmukh released a statement on Thursday, saying a car with gelatin sticks was found near Mukesh Ambani’s house, and that the Mumbai crime branch will investigate the case. “It has been taken very seriously and the police will unearth the plot and nab the people behind it. Since the investigation is underway, it would not be appropriate to speak more on it. If need be, there will be additional security cover given to the Ambani family,” minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai said.With inputs from Surendra Gangan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/car-with-explosives-found-near-mukesh-ambani-s-residence-101614291972779.html
26-02-2021||India||BJP has stopped entry of illegal immigrants, says Amit Shah in Assam||Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday slammed the Congress, its ally All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and newly formed regional parties and asserted that only the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its partner Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) can ensure peace and development in an Assam that’s free of illegal migrants.“There was a time when Assam was known for agitations and violence. The biggest contribution of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre is to establish peace in Assam, ensure development, give corruption-free administration, rid the state of agitations and put the brakes on the entry of illegal immigrants,” Shah said at a rally in Batadrava Than, the birthplace of 15th-16th century Vaishnavite saint-scholar and social reformer Srimanta Sankardev.Launching an ₹188 crore project for the development of Batadrava Than, Shah slammed the Congress for not doing anything for Sankardev’s birthplace.Without naming them, Shah also targeted the new regional parties in the state. “Congress is seen only when election comes. At other times they indulge in merriment in Delhi. They are doing the same thing this time.”“Congress was responsible for firing at those who took part in the Assam Agitation (to oust illegal immigrants). Now in order to bring Congress to power and cut BJP’s vote share, organizations that were part of that agitation have now come out with different names,” he added.Shah’s remarks were aimed at the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), formed last year by the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), two prominent student bodies at the forefront of the Assam Agitation of 1979-85 that ended with signing of the Assam Accord in 1985.He also indicated Raijor Dal, a new party formed by Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), a farmers’ rights body. The three organizations — AASU, AJYCP and KMSS — had spearheaded the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in December 2019. AJP and Raijor Dal are contesting the state polls together.“Everyone knows they (those parties) won’t win... The people of the state know that only a BJP and Asom Gana Parishad government can ensure a developed, peaceful and illegal immigrant-free Assam,” said Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-has-stopped-entry-of-illegal-immigrants-says-amit-shah-in-assam-101614290858496.html
26-02-2021||India||Farm unions, traders to join Bharat Bandh today||Several farm organisations protesting the new farm laws decided on Thursday to extend support to the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call given by transport and trade unions on February 26.Issuing a statement, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) — the umbrella body which has called for the strike — said that all commercial markets across the country will remain closed on February 26 against rising fuel prices, the new e-way bill and the goods and services tax (GST). Around 40,000 trade associations have extended their support to the call for the bandh.“We highly regret such a dismal attitude and picture of the GST which has compelled the trade union leaders attending the conference to call for a Bharat Trade Bandh,” the statement read.Extending support to the call, the SKM appealed to all farmers to join the bandh peacefully. Farm leader Dr Darshan Pal said farmers’ bodies support the traders facing hardships due to GST and rising fuel prices.In a separate statement, the All India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA), which is the apex body of the organised road transportation companies, also extended support to the CAIT’s call, saying transporters “should not be subjected to various penalties issued by the government for any time-based compliance target of transit”.“The nature of the movement is to reject booking and movement of all e-way bill oriented goods for one day,” said AITWA president Mahendra Arya.As per the e-way laws, truckers must carry the bill to transport goods from one place to another after online sale of the goods is shown on the GST portal. They have also demanded reduction in fuel prices, saying it was making the transport business inviable.Calling the GST one of the “most complex taxation systems”, which has resulted in “misery to traders”, the CAIT said: “The GST needs to be simplified to the extent that even a small trader operating his from remote area/s should also be able to comply with GST without any external help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-traders-to-join-bharat-bandh-today-101614289729676.html
26-02-2021||India||Officials targeted in new phishing bid via govt IDs||A new phishing email using compromised government accounts targeted groups of officials this week, attempting to lure them into sharing their passwords on a page that mirrored the government’s official mail server sign-on website, an attack that could let the attackers gain access to sensitive credentials and files.The attack, which took place on Monday, prompted the government’s IT departments to send out an alert the following day to large groups of officials, according to emails seen by HT. The incident is the latest in a series of such cyber attacks that leverage compromised @gov.in or @nic.in email addresses issued by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), which may be more successful in luring the targets into sharing sensitive information.“There has been another phishing attempt using the same MO [modus operandi] but this time it also provided the link to a fake email log-in page. Many officials fell for it as it mirrored the same log-in page and clicked on the link in the phishing email and tried logging in to their government email accounts. The link to that page is still live. Several ministries and departments were alerted about the phishing attack on Tuesday,” an official said, asking not to be named.An alert issued by one of the IT departments of the government said that phishing attack “...entices email users to authorize email ID for kavach by clicking on a web-link... When email user clicks on the web-link to verify his/her email ID, a login page similar to www.email.gov.in opens. This is to inform that the login page is malicious/phishing in nature”.Altogether, HT is aware of five NIC domain addresses – four with @gov.in suffixes and the fifth an @nic.in one – that have been used to launch cyber attacks. HT is not disclosing these addresses in order to protect any investigations there may be.“It is being observed that you did not AUTH your account til deadline of KAVACH, its intimated to you that please AUTH your account now otherwise your account will be locked permanently,” the latest phishing mail said.In response to queries from HT on these attacks, an NIC official said: “In phishing attacks End User awareness is a very critical component and NIC is focusing on this through routine advisories and workshops. In addition to this, based on the evolving threat landscape, security posture of the Government email setup and networks are continuously reviewed and steps are taken to mitigate emerging cyber-attacks.”The NIC, on February 19, had said phishing attempts are among common email-based threat vectors to target users of any email service. Such phishing attacks intend to harvest user details/credentials.According to cybersecurity experts, the address mentioned in the latest phishing email is a redirection page. “The attack is phishing with the intent of credential harvesting. Once these credentials are stolen, more such attacks will continue from these stolen identities. There is no malware in the link but redirection, which is bad and not transparent,” said a security researcher at Sequretek, a cybersecurity firm. This person requested not to be identified.The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-IN), which investigates incidents of cyber breaches, did not respond to requests for a comment.On February 21, HT also reported that the devices of multiple former defence personnel may have been compromised in a phishing attack launched through similar attacks carried out by government domain email addresses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-targeted-in-new-phishing-bid-via-govt-ids-101614282608264.html
26-02-2021||India||Tandav controversy: Amazon Prime executive’s bail plea rejected by Allahabad HC||The Allahabad high court on Thursday rejected anticipatory bail to a top Amazon Prime Video executive in a case against web series Tandav, saying that the Hindi film industry’s tendency of insulting Hindu gods could have disastrous consequences for India.A single-judge bench of justice Siddharth rejected the application of Amazon Prime Video’s Aparna Purohit in connection with the ongoing investigation against Tandav for allegedly outraging religious feelings and showing Hindu gods in poor light. The court held that Purohit was granted protection from arrest on February 11, but failed to cooperate with the investigation.Tandav is facing at least 10 FIRs for hurting religious sentiments, intending to disturb caste and communal amity – charges punishable under Sections 153A and 295 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) with a maximum jail term of three years.“Western filmmakers have refrained from ridiculing Lord Jesus or the Prophet but Hindi filmmakers have done this repeatedly and are still doing this most unabashedly with the Hindu Gods and Goddesses,” the court observed. “This tendency on the part of the Hindi film industry is growing and if not curbed in time, it may have disastrous consequences for the Indian social, religious and communal order. There appears to be a design behind such acts on the part of the people who just give a disclaimer in all the films and depict things in the movies which are really religiously, socially and communally offensive in nature,” the court added.The judge further observed that the young generation has started believing what is shown in movies. “It destroys the basic concept of the survival of this country having tremendous diversity of all kinds as a united nation. Film industry in south has not indulged in such acts like the Hindi film industry,” the court said.The political thriller starring Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Ayyub, started streaming earlier this year but quickly ran into controversy. On January 19, an FIR was lodged in Greater Noida that alleged the series depicted Uttar Pradesh and its police in poor light and deliberately denigrated Hindu deities. The complaint further alleged the Prime Minister was depicted in the series as opposing democratic norms and comments were used to disturb caste and communal amity. The show’s creators and actors said they didn’t intend to hurt any sentiments and that the depictions were fictional.The makers, producers and actors of the show approached the Supreme Court but were denied relief on January 27, with the court holding that freedom to speech was not an absolute right and that no actor could hide behind a script and a role to escape culpability under the law. On February 4, the Allahabad high court granted interim protection from arrest to Purohit.But on Thursday, justice Siddharth came down heavily on the streaming platform and the show’s creators. “Whenever such crimes are committed by some citizens of the country, forces inimical to the interest of this country become active and they make it an issue and raise it before different national and international forums alleging that the Indian citizens have become intolerant and India has become an unsafe place to live,” the judge said in his order.The state government argued in court the filing of 10 FIRs across the country showed that a number of persons felt that the web series was offensive. “It is not a stray case...” added the government’s counsel. Purohit’s lawyers said the series was a work of fiction and there was no intention to outrage religious feelings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-controversy-amazon-prime-executive-s-bail-plea-rejected-by-allahabad-hc-101614280865441.html

26-02-2021||India||CM Yediyurappa, the recalcitrant conformist, turns 78||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa turns 78-years-old on Friday but there is little to suggest that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has any alternative to letting the Lingayat leader continue in the lead role despite the BJP’s thumb rule against letting those above 75 hold public office.Few other leaders in Karnataka--or India--can claim to have encountered the challenges that Yediyurappa has endured throughout his four-decade-old political career, which is only likely to get more intense in the days ahead, analysts and party leaders said.The chief minister, despite the threat to his own chair, has taken it upon himself to bring the BJP back to power with an absolute majority in 2023 assembly elections that would cement his legacy and open the doors wider for him to placate his second son (B Y Vijayendra) and other loyalists to retain some control over the party.“As of now all indications point toward the possibility that he will remain the face of the next elections,” said a person aware of the developments, requesting not to be named.A Bengaluru-based political analyst said that Yediyurappa's supporters may want to go in for low-key birthday celebrations even though detractors may post as many ads as possible to remind everyone of his age.“The BJP is looking for a replacement but have not yet found any. Yediyurappa's continuation is linked to being a Lingayat leader but there are desperate efforts to separate the two,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University said.Narayana refers to the economic term, derived demand to make his point on Karnataka politics. “This is a derived situation where what you see as the future of the BJP depends on how you see the Congress,” he said.The BJP has tried to develop a second rung of leadership but with little success so far and “para-dropping” of leaders by high command is unlikely to sit well with the polity in Karnataka, analysts said.Moreover, BJP's problem in Karnataka is its inability to take power on its own, leaving it at the mercy of borrowed strength.In 2008, the BJP had to seek the support of independents and later resort to engineering defections for power. The same strategy was used in 2019 to topple the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government.The turncoats have since been besotted by Yediyurappa who has gone out of his way to keep his promise of inducting them into the cabinet even if at the threat of his antagonising his own core-party workers and legislators.The turncoats have no real connection with the BJP or its core ideology and have shown inclinations to keep all their support groups happy as against targeting any particular community.While dissent and disgruntlement have a deep impact on the government, analysts said that Yediyurappa is one of the few politicians tactful enough “to make his opponents and detractors do what he wants them to do”.One analyst, on condition of anonymity, said that Yediyurappa is reviving reservation-based politics as against the BJPs plans to further penetrate its Hindutva-backed politics.“Reservation and Hindutva do not go hand-in-hand,” the analyst said.Yediyurappa has rarely identified with Hindutva politics and is better known for his reservation-based and coalition building abilities that gets support from other stalwarts like H.D Deve Gowda and Siddaramaiah, who both share cordial and functional relations with the 78-year-old.Nor does Yediyurappa fit in well with BJPs plans for the rest of the southern states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala where the saffron outfit has little or no presence on its own.The likes of Basanagouda Ramangouda Patil (Yatnal) have tried to push a firebrand image but this was diluted as soon as the former got sucked into the reservation demands of the Panchamasalis, a subsect of the dominant and politically influential Lingayats. Bracketing Yediyurappa to his sub-sect is a move that will be resisted by the Lingayat community, analysts said, which threatens the combined bargaining power of one of the biggest and politically influential communities in the state.The juggernaut of various caste-groups demanding better reservation opportunities is also likely to work in favour of Yediyurappa who has an option to reorganize the structure and not to be seen as favouring any one community.The BJP may also gain from moving some communities one step higher as it would free up opportunities for Brahmins in their existing reservation and play into the party's "upper-caste" political narrative.The internal bickering within his party and government, analysts said, could pose as a bigger irritant to the chief minister and his uncertain tenure at the top chair.Yediyurappa, possibly the oldest person to be chief minister in Karnataka, is one of just a handful of politicians who can ensure victory beyond his own constituency as against legislators and leaders who have strongholds limited to assembly constituencies at best.Yediyurappa has also delivered an unprecedented 25 out of the 29 Lok Sabha seats in 2019--an achievement that is unlikely to be repeated.But Yediyurappa's overt expression of helplessness and reluctance to fight the centre over reduction of revenues to the state, devolution of taxes or even getting adequate flood relief has forced him on the back foot. He has limited options to make a splash in the upcoming state budget as funds continue to dry up and may not be able to provide any big-bang schemes to deflect public and political gaze away from the non-performance of his two-year-old government.For now, it’s just another birthday. Whether it will be a happy one is still to be seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-yediyurappa-the-recalcitrant-conformist-turns-78-on-friday-101614277123757.html

26-02-2021||Today's||Hooked on a feelin’: With Love by Simran Mangharam||There is a difference between the heartbreak experienced at the end of a committed relationship and one from unrequited love. Though the initial emotional shock of being rejected is powerful in both cases, some people take much longer to recover from the heartbreak when the feelings were one-sided. The questions around what went wrong and why often go unanswered. One of my clients was so keen to know why her feelings and attraction were not reciprocated by this man she was in love with, that she wanted me to call him. Her intellectual argument was that my intervention would provide her with feedback so that she doesn’t make the same mistake again. I gracefully declined.With no clear insight into why your feelings were not reciprocated, the only tangible reasons seem to stem from blaming yourself. “I should not have pushed to meet that often”. “Perhaps I intimidated him”. “Maybe she thinks I am desperate”. The hurt and pain is quickly followed by self-flagellation. It’s a lot for anyone to deal with. The fact that matters of the heart are to do with feelings and emotions, which can be irrational, rarely crosses our mind. How many of us are great at decoding why we feel what we feel? Or why our emotional reactions sometimes surprise us. In a world where search engines provide you information at your fingertips in seconds, the discomfort of the unknown is so pervasive that it has almost become an obsession.If we spend time looking back at our own lives, I can guarantee that most of us would have not reciprocated someone’s romantic feelings or crushes on us at some point. In our heads, we would have left it at “I just don’t feel the same way” or may go further to rationalise that “I am not attracted to him/her”. To be honest, it does not go beyond that for someone who is not reciprocating your feelings either. Not because they are flippant and don’t respect your feelings. Rather, it is really the truth. But because it’s so simple and your feelings so powerful, this answer does not satisfy you.Another common occurrence of unrequited love is that we actually have feelings for the person “we think” that individual is. My friend Seema was crazy about this man she met at a conference. They had long chats on the phone, went out on a few dates and she fell in love with him. He did not feel the same way. It took her a long time to get over this. A few years later she happened to work with him on a project, only to realise he was a completely different person than she had made him out to be. She admitted that perhaps she was in love with the image she had created of him – which was so different from who he really was.Finally, there are those who never let the other person know that they are in love with them. Most often it’s when you develop feelings for a friend. You worry that if you share your feelings, you might end up losing the friendship as well. But I urge you to rethink this. The only person who is suffering in this approach is you. Isn’t it better to tell them? And if the feeling is not reciprocated at least you can move on and make space for someone else in your life.The emotional turmoil of unrequited love is real, but we can put it behind us fairly quickly. We prolong the pain by indulging in self-blame or continuing to pine for that person. This can become a habit and I suggest you don’t get into that trap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/hooked-on-a-feelin-with-love-by-simran-mangharam-101614356279773.html
26-02-2021||Today's||The BJP’s ruthless expansion drive||Long before Puducherry, there was Goa. In 1994, riding on the Ram Janmabhoomi wave, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won four seats for the first time in the 40-member Goa assembly. It caused a ripple in Goa’s turbulent political waters, prompting the late Pramod Mahajan, then the party’s chief strategist for Goa, to boast that the BJP would form a government in Panaji within 10 years. Mahajan was spot on — aided by Goa’s infamous tradition of brazen defections, a BJP government led by Manohar Parrikar was formed in 2002. By 2012, Parrikar headed the first BJP-majority government in the state.What transpired in the erstwhile Portuguese colony on the west coast is now sought to be replicated on the south-east coast in the tranquil one-time French outpost of Puducherry. Where the smooth-talking Mahajan was a key BJP tactician in the 1990s, that role has now been taken over by the hard-nosed Amit Shah. Where the BJP was then emerging as a national player, it is now the dominant party at the Centre, possessing resources to topple any opposition state government it possibly can.Why Puducherry, when assembly elections are a few months away and the BJP, it seems, has little at stake in a region traditionally dominated by the Congress and local parties? First, to borrow the words of the Union home minister, “chronology samajhiye” (understand the chronology). The V Narayanasamy-led Congress government was elected in Puducherry in May 2016. Almost immediately, Kiran Bedi, the pugnacious Indian Police Service officer who had lost out as the BJP’s Delhi chief ministerial face, was sent as Lieutenant- Governor (L-G). For five years, there was a constant and bruising face-off between the chief minister and L-G that only undermined an elected government. Bedi was recalled last week after it became apparent that she had antagonised almost the entire political class. She was replaced by the former Tamil Nadu BJP president, Tamilisai Soundararajan, to assuage local concerns.Simultaneously, the BJP fast-forwarded a plan to engineer defections from the ruling Congress-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam alliance and ensured that, with the help of three nominated legislators and a compliant Speaker, the Narayanasamy government was reduced to a minority. Incidentally, at least four of the six defecting legislators have either income-tax queries or links to the lucrative real estate sector. Moreover, by toppling a Congress government in Puducherry, the BJP has sent a message to neighbouring Tamil Nadu, where it is contesting the assembly elections with the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, that the Congress is a greatly diminished force, and the party can be vanquished at any time.In a sense, Puducherry is now part of a pattern of Machiavellian intrigue that has been repeated from Arunachal and Manipur to Goa, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh where a ruthlessly expansionist BJP seeks to consolidate its ascendancy by wangling either wholesale or retail defections. That the Congress leadership appears to have been taken by surprise, yet again, reveals how the original party of realpolitik is floundering to counter the BJP’s vaulting ambitions. The “new” BJP under Narendra Modi-Amit Shah is a bit like the “old” Congress in the Indira Gandhi era — ethically compromised, but politically uncompromising in its actions.The truth is no state government run by a non-BJP force is safe. India’s non-BJP governments can now be bracketed into three categories. The Congress-led governments, of which only three are left in the country, are squarely on the BJP’s radar. A bid to capture Rajasthan failed last year, but the Modi-Shah model doesn’t delve into failure for long: More attempts at divide-and-rule on Jaipur’s uneasy turf cannot be ruled out.The second category includes regional party-ruled states that have made their peace with the Centre by striking friendly patron-client relationships. Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha fall into this category — these are states where “deal-making” with the Centre is part of a survival toolkit. In all these states, ruling parties are essentially one-man shows, making it easier for the BJP to bide its time before swooping to conquer in due course.The third category comprises states ruled by an alliance of non-BJP forces, such as Maharashtra and Jharkhand. Of these, Maharashtra remains the big prize. That the three-party coalition government in Mumbai is headed by an ex-staunch Hindutva ally makes the battle to recapture the state for the BJP a prestige fight, one that could see more dramatic twists and turns in the months ahead.This leaves just two states — Bengal and Kerala — that are determinedly holding out in the face of the BJP juggernaut and both go to polls in April-May. In Kerala, the BJP is resolutely widening its voter base, even while remaining a fair distance away from conquering it. In Bengal, on the other hand, the gloves are off. Should Didi’s Kolkata fortress fall to the sustained BJP assault, we could be pretty close to an “opposition-mukt” Bharat with serious implications for the future of an increasingly strained multi-party democracy.Post-script: Another illustration of the BJP’s unwavering commitment to spreading its sphere of influence is provided by the choice of 88-year-old “Metro man” E Sreedharan as its star catch in Kerala. His induction may be symbolic but confirms that even margdarshak mandal retirement rules are selectively applied in the BJP’s cold-blooded powerplay.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and author The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-bjp-s-ruthless-expansion-drive-101614263097345.html
26-02-2021||Today's||A gender equality framework for India’s sciences and tech disciplines||Gender equality is a human right, and according to the United Nations (UN), is essential to both ensuring sustainable development and maintaining peace around the world. Diversity is essential to delivering excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Encouraging greater diversity allows scientific organisations to derive an “innovation dividend” that leads to smarter, more creative teams, hence opening the door to new discoveries.The latest All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report suggests that India’s gender gap has narrowed in comparison with the past few years. Female students now constitute almost half (48.6%) of the total enrolment in higher education. The Government of India’s initiatives for gender advancement and equality in academic and research institutions are helping women succeed in STEM fields. Despite facing challenges, women in India are moving up the academic and administrative ladder by breaking down both systemic and structural barriers to excel in STEM.However, women constitute only 14% of the 280,000 personnel in STEM in India’s research development institutions (UN data). In addition, although women’s participation in the workforce is higher at entry-level, it gradually decreases at higher research, academics and administration levels.Greater gender equality in STEM is crucial, and in the larger interest of scientific progress and society. Currently, India is looking at a paradoxical situation where women are studying STEM subjects but there are not as many women in STEM careers. In order to level the playing field, there is a need for policies and frameworks that promote the representation and advancement of women in science careers. These have been successfully designed and implemented in countries such as the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Canada. A framework supporting and transforming gender equality in STEM education and research can act as a guiding light, and can foster accelerated gains in representation of women in crucial STEM fields.A gender equality framework recognises the advancement of gender equality as key to removing structural barriers, including social, cultural and economic barriers that prevent women from achieving their full potential. By enabling STEM institutions to conduct a thorough self-assessment, the framework can help identify barriers and norms that are unique to an institution, department or discipline and introduce actions to address them.Equal representation alone will not guarantee achieving gender equality. A framework can set gender equality benchmarks by collecting qualitative data to determine if barriers exist and what actions could be introduced to tackle them. These qualitative criteria can range from promotion of inclusive practices in the workplace to increase retention of women in STEM careers to creating support structures for career progression for women scientists.Besides helping institutions improve gender equality, such a framework can also assist institutions in meeting requirements and expectations of national and international funders and research councils.The UK has pioneered the Athena SWAN Gender Equality Charter and the Accreditation System which started in 2005. Recognising the evidence-based approach to research, intervention and demonstrable effects of the framework, many countries have joined the Athena SWAN collaborative international network, including United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland. With the launch of Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions (GATI), India too has joined the list. While learning from and the success of Athena SWAN, it is focused on the Indian context and realities. The Department of Science and Technology has undertaken the programme in partnership with the British Council. Key elements of the project include capacity-building through training and supporting participating institutions in self-assessment through collaboration with Athena Swan-awarded UK institutions in their gender equality journey.Gender Equality frameworks such as GATI will bring about a shift in approach in technical institutions and will also inspire senior leaders to take every possible action to attract, hire, retain and promote more women in India’s STEM fields. While India has been making strides in this space in terms of a more equitable enrolment ratio, a gender equality framework for higher education institutions will translate into India achieving a substantial milestone. This will not only be consistent with the ambitious goals of NEP 2020 but also be crucial in aligning to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5.Barbara Wickham is director-India, British CouncilThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-gender-equality-framework-for-india-s-sciences-and-tech-disciplines-101614262496163.html
26-02-2021||Editorials||Keep an eye on global commodity inflation||India’s benchmark inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), stayed above the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India’s tolerance zone continuously between April and November 2020. This inflationary phase was driven by a spike in food prices, and it has ended with a collapse of the same from December. While food is an important driver of India’s retail inflation, it is not the only source. Overall prices, both for consumers and producers, also depend on the price of non-food commodities, including crude petroleum.Recent movement in global commodity prices suggests that we could be heading for a long-term rally after a benign run, followed by a collapse during the pandemic. When read with the fact that core inflation, the non-food non-fuel component of retail inflation, has not come down in recent months — it was at 5.75% in January — this is a cause for concern in India. That both the Centre and the states have not reduced duties on petrol-diesel, despite crude prices strengthening, is likely to generate additional tailwinds for inflation in India. Another inflationary tailwind in the medium-term will arise from the fact that the period of Goods and Services Tax compensation cess will have to be extended to compensate for the promised revenue shortfall to states when the tax was rolled out. Additional indirect taxes are bound to have an inflationary impact.With systemic domestic tail wind to inflation in the medium-term, India will do well to remain vigilant against any signs of a global commodity price rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/keep-an-eye-on-global-commodity-inflation-101614262330034.html
