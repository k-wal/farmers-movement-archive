19-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees 823 new Covid-19 cases, highest since Dec 3||The city on Friday reported 823 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in the city since December 3, when Mumbai reported 878 new cases. Mumbai also reported five deaths, taking the toll to 11,437. Mumbai’s doubling rate is 393 days, and its growth rate of Covid-19 cases is 0.18%. As Mumbai reported over 700 new cases for second day in a row on Thursday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced tight measures to check the spurt, including stricter containment zone rules and quarantine norms. Clean-up marshals began night patrolling of the city from Thursday to ensure people wear face masks at public places. From this weekend, ward-level teams will begin surprise inspections of marriage halls, restaurants and cinema halls to ensure social distancing, and that the organisers and management, apart from visitors, are wearing masks. Criminal action will be taken against those flouting rules. On Thursday, Mumbai reported 736 new cases and 721 on Wednesday. In the past two days, Mumbai’s doubling rate has dropped to 417 days on Thursday, from 445 days on Tuesday, and 455 days on Monday. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, in a statement on Thursday, said, “Although the spread of Covid-19 in Mumbai is under control, there has been a surge in the number of cases in the past few days. Hence all BMC machineries need to be extra vigilant. As public life returns to normalcy, it becomes all the more important for citizens to follow all Covid-19 prevention norms. It is also pertinent to take stringent action against offenders to limit the spread of the virus.” The BMC has now reverted to its earlier decision of sealing entire buildings if more than five Covid-19 patients are detected. Police cases will be filed against high-risk contacts of patients found violating home quarantine, which can result in up to six months of imprisonment, or fine, or both. All persons who are to be home quarantined are being hand-stamped for identification. The number of clean-up marshals patrolling the city will be doubled to 4,800 from the present 2,400 in the coming week. The Mumbai Police are now authorised to act as marshals and fine those not wearing face masks in public places. Not more than 50 people are allowed at weddings and religious places at a time, and restaurants, malls and cinema theatres can function at 50% of their occupancy capacity. All assistant commissions (ward officers) will submit daily reports on action and fine to the deputy municipal commissioners of each zone, who in turn will report to the municipal commissioner daily. Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner incharge of zone 7, north Mumbai, said, “We are in touch with doctors and hospital staff to find cases and understand which areas are more affected and the source of infection in positive patients. The ward officers will chalk out area-specific measures.” Bharat Marathe, deputy municipal commissioner of zone 5, said, “Ward-level teams will conduct surprise inspections at restaurants, and marriage halls to ensure social distancing rules are followed, organisers and caterers and servers are wearing masks, and following Covid-19 hygiene. The target is upto five marriage halls per day.” In slums and densely populated areas, mobile vans are conducting tests. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G/North ward, which covers densely populated areas of Dharavi, Mahim, said, “In slums like Dharavi, and high-risk areas such as Mahim and Dadar, mobile vans have started doing rounds. Fifteen high-risk contacts of every positive patient are being traced.” At railway terminus, such as Dadar, passengers from Gujarat and other states are being screened before being allowed to leave the station premises. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Friday conducted a surprise inspection of SevenHills hospital to review preparatory work, and also inspected a hotel where international travellers are being quarantined. “A floor of the hotel has been cordoned off to quarantine passengers. Separate staff has been appointed to cater to these people. This staff will not interact with the rest of the visitors. Covid-19 testing of this staff is being done from time to time,” she said, adding, she will no longer attend any ceremonies, functions, and will not accept invitations for weddings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-823-new-covid-19-cases-highest-since-dec-3-101613759160694.html

19-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn finalises firm to run 40 electric buses||The public transport in the city will soon go eco-friendly with the UT administration finally hiring the services of a private firm for running the electric buses.After a long tendering process, marred by several setbacks including financial difficulties due to the pandemic, the administration has awarded the contract of running 40 electric buses to Ashok Leyland.The Indian multinational company was one of the three firms to come forward to run the electric buses in the city.The UT in June 2019 had decided to procure electric buses on a gross cost-contract model, under which the successful bidder procures, operates and maintains the buses. All revenue is collected for the administration, and the company is paid on a per kilometre cost basis. The medium-sized (9-metre) battery-operated buses are to be equipped with air-conditioners and will be used on local city routes.The administration had to defer the project for a while on account of financial constraints due to the pandemic. But the project was revived in September last year, after the Centre had sanctioned 80 electric buses for the UT under the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme.After getting approval from the Centre, the UT administration had started the process for procurement of the buses. Under the scheme, the Centre will provide ₹50-lakh subsidy for each bus to the seller. The buses will be hired for ten years, and the CTU will get ticket sales through the company, which will also maintain the vehicles.The UT will now start the process for procuring 40 more buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-finalises-firm-to-run-40-electric-buses-101613758500100.html
19-02-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala MC House meeting on February 23||High drama was witnessed at the first House meeting chaired by the Ambala mayor on Thursday where only eight out of the 20 councillors, all from the Haryana Janchetna Party (HJP), turned up in the absence of commissioner Parth Gupta and civic body officials.Secretary Jarnail Singh has now called for a House meeting on February 23.The eight members had protested outside the office of MC chief and raised slogans against local MLA Aseem Goel for “interfering in the corporation’s functioning”, while Gupta said, “It was not our meeting.”Among the absentees were eight councillors of the BJP and two each from the Congress and the Haryana Democratic Front. The members who attended the meeting put forward proposals and called for an action against those who remained absent, besides discussing issues such as cleanliness, state of community centres, and no dues certificate. Mayor Shakti Rani Sharma belongs to the HJP and is the wife of political stalwart and former MLA Venod Sharma. Interacting with media after the meeting, the mayor had said, “I wrote many letters to the commissioner to call for a meeting, but when he didn’t, I used my powers under the rules and called for it with a majority of 1/4th of the House.”However, MLA Gupta said that “being unbiased” and taking into consideration the objection raised by eight other members (from the BJP), he had requested to reschedule the meeting. “I received the mayor’s letter on February 15 and there has to be a five-day gap before the meeting. Eight members had met me earlier and told me that neither had they received any letter nor were consulted. Moreover, the notice for the meeting has to be issued by the secretary of the MC, who has called the first meeting on February 23,” he added. Meanwhile, eight councillors from the BJP handed over a memorandum to city magistrate Aanchal Bhaskar in the name of DC Ashok Kumar Sharma, stating that “the meeting was called illegally to spread chaos” and there should be an action against the mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-mc-house-meeting-on-february-23-101613758439818.html

19-02-2021||Mumbai||NCP leader Sule demands SIT inquiry against Navi Mumbai MLA||The Nationalist Congress Party Member of Parliament, Supriya Sule, has demanded an SIT inquiry against BJP MLA Ganesh Naik following his statement at a public meeting that ‘international dons’ know him. She said that she will take up the issue with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and also raise it in the next Parliament session.Naik, once a close associate of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, had quit the NCP to join BJP along with his sons, former MP Sanjeev Naik and former MLA Sandeep Naik. He had also taken most of the NCP corporators with him to BJP.With NMMC elections expected in April, Naik had, in a public meeting in Turbhe recently, alleged ‘goondagiri’ by the opposition and declared that not just the local goons but also the ‘international dons’ knew who he was. He had also stated that he was the principal of the school where the goondas studied. The statement had generated a lot of controversy, following which Naik had stated that his statement had been misconstrued.Taking him on at a party workers’ meet in Vashi on Friday, Sule said, “If an MLA states in public that international dons know him, then it is terrifying. It is a matter of national security and very worrying for us all, especially women to have an elected representative say this.”Sule asked the workers to pass a resolution demanding an SIT inquiry against Naik. She said, “We will send it to state home minister Anil Deshmukh to take it up with Union Home Minister, Amit Shah, at his level. I will also take it up with Shah as the BJP under Narendra Modi had declared when it came to power that it will get these international dons. I assure you that I shall also raise the issue in the next session of Parliament in April.”Expressing confidence of winning the NMMC elections, Sule said, “The MVA will have its mayor in Navi Mumbai.”While Ganesh Naik was not available for comment, Navi Mumbai BJP president, Ramchandra Gharat, said, “These are politically-motivated statements. There is absolutely no connection between Ganesh Naik and the dons. Everyone knows that Naik was a minister and so it is natural for people to know him. His statement is being blown out of proportion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-leader-sule-demands-sit-inquiry-against-navi-mumbai-mla-101613758199930.html

Cabinet minister and president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Nagaland state unit Temjen Imna Along said the state Assembly has created history by playing the National Anthem for the first time before Governor RN Ravi’s inaugural address.Assembly commissioner and secretary Dr PJ Antony confirmed this, saying that playing the National Anthem was never the convention in the Nagaland Assembly for unknown reasons. But, he added there is not much to read between the lines because when the National Anthem was included as part of the Governor’s address in the house this time and the move was well-received by all the members.Also read: Mumbai, Nagpur, Amravati - New restrictions as Covid-19 surge continuesWhile a retired commissioner and secretary of the Assembly also said it was not the norm to have the National Anthem played in the house during his time, a former aide of two former chief ministers and an ex-governor, Sebastian Zumvu felt differently.He said it was a normal practice to have the National Anthem played not only in the Assembly hall but also at various public events wherever the Governor, as the constitutional head of the state, went.A former speaker of the Assembly, Neiba Ndang, whom the Hindustan Times reached out to, responded that this was not the practice during his tenure.“But nothing is wrong if they start playing the National Anthem as part of the Governor’s address in the Assembly. It was just not in practice during my time,” he stated.Another former speaker Chotisuh Sazo also said it was not the tradition before but some Governors insisted the National Anthem was played wherever they went, however, it was not mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/national-anthem-played-for-first-time-in-nagaland-assembly-minister-101613757149454.html

19-02-2021||Mumbai||Presumptions under Pocso Act can only be rebutted at trial: Bombay HC||Once prima facie case is established, the presumptions under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, can only be rebutted by leading evidence during the trial, said the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC), while dismissing the petition filed by a Nagpur resident booked for sexually assaulting her six-year-old nephew.The woman was booked by Shanti Nagar police station in October 2017, under relevant sections of the Pocso Act, for allegedly inappropriately touching the child and making him touch her.She had moved the HC, claiming that she had been booked in a false case, and the offence was registered based on a complaint lodged by the disgruntled father of the child. She claimed that he had tutored the child to level false allegations against her.The division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote, however, dismissed her petition after noticing that the child was independently examined by the child welfare committee, a judicial magistrate and the investigation officer, and the minor was consistent in his allegations regarding the abuse at the hands of his maternal aunt.“The allegations of sexual abuse being clear and specific, we do not feel that this is a case which merits interference. This is clearly a matter which will have to undergo the tribulations of a trial,” said the bench.The bench added that it cannot be doubted that offences of such a nature, as alleged against the woman, might not be disclosed for multiple reasons. “However, once such allegation has been made, the same has to be tested on the anvil of evidence to be led at the trial, unless the allegation is absurd to its core,” the court said.“In our considered opinion, the nature of allegations of sexual abuse, as has been made in the present matter, and the fact that those have been independently verified by three different agencies, leaves no room to exercise of any discretion in favour of the petitioner,” the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/presumptions-under-pocso-act-can-only-be-rebutted-at-trial-bombay-hc-101613755379383.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to interfere with tender process for Maharashtra’s mid-day meal scheme||Reluctant to delay the provision of nutritious meals for children belonging to disadvantaged and economically weaker sections of society, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has refused to interfere with the state government’s decision to centralise the tendering process.HC rejected a petition filed by a women’s cooperative challenging the government’s decision to conduct the tendering for mid-day meals centrally and not district-wise. The cooperative, which had participated in the district-wise tendering process in the past, alleged that the centralised tendering process was aimed at benefiting contractors close to the government, and hence, the process should be stalled.In January, the government had issued a tender notice inviting bids to provide mid-day meals in the form of food grains to eligible school children in 7,549 schools across 19 districts at ₹245 crore.A division bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant Kulkarni, while hearing a petition filed by Indira Mahila Sahakari Gruh Udyog and Jivanavashyak Vastu Purvatha Bhandar Ltd, was informed by advocate PD Bachate, who represented the petitioners, that the women’s cooperative had participated in district-level tenders since 2011 and was aggrieved at the decision of the government to have the process centralised.In light of the Covid-19 lockdown, the Supreme Court (SC) in March 2020 had directed the states to continue the mid-day meal scheme. In the light of the SC’s directions, the Central government had issued orders to states in July and August 2020 asking them to supply food grain and pulses to eligible students instead of cooked meals.Bachate submitted that the conditions stipulated in the centralised tendering process made it clear that there was an attempt to bypass small contractors like the women’s cooperatives and benefit only the bigger contractors who were close to the government.Special counsel for the state, RN Dhorde, however, informed the court that as the implementation of the SC and Central government order had been delayed, the said food grains and pulses were to be supplied within 20 working days of the supply order being issued. He further added that the centralised process was intended to save time, and hence it should be allowed. He further submitted that in the future, the previous system of having district-wise tenders would be resorted to.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that as the scheme was intended to benefit children belonging to the disadvantaged sections of society and those from economically poor families, it was not inclined to interfere. “Stalling further process pursuant to the tender would in a way be depriving the children… of the benefit of food security allowance in the form of food grains,” said the court.

19-02-2021||Kolkata||PM Modi, Shah focus on Bengal’s glorious past on election eve||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday focused on West Bengal’s rich heritage and some of its lost glory in back-to-back addresses to people in the poll-bound state.PM Modi, while virtually addressing the convocation ceremony of Visva Bharati, the state’s only Central university of which the Prime Minister is the chancellor, said its founder Rabindranath Tagore’s vision on education has contributed to the Centre’s new education policy.Shah, who was in Bengal on a two-day political tour, attended a cultural event held at Kolkata’s National Library as part of the programmes on freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, and paid rich tribute to Bengal’s martyrs and talked of sacrifices Bose made.In the eastern state where elections are to be held in March-April, their speeches sought to counter chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s constant efforts to brand the BJP’s central leaders and those visiting Bengal from the Hindi belt as “outsiders” who are “ignorant of Bengal’s culture and history.”Some of the statements the BJP leaders made seemed to have underlying messages.During his long speech, the prime minister talked of Shivaji, whose birth anniversary was celebrated during the day, and recited in Bengali a few lines from a poem Tagore wrote on the Maratha icon.“These lines draw inspiration from Shivaji and talk of fighting for one India. We must live the message Tagore sent. You are not part of a university but part of a living heritage. Tagore could have named this institution a global university but he chose to call it Visva Bharati. He wanted the students to see the world as Indians and uphold the nation’s heritage. This is what the nation expects of you,” said Modi.Also read: Toolkit case - Greta Thunberg extends support to jailed activist Disha Ravi“Knowledge, opinions and visions are not static. They are dynamic. There is scope for course correction. Knowledge and power come with responsibility. People in power have to maintain restraint. The same applies to people with knowledge. Your knowledge is not yours alone. It is an asset to the society and the nation,” Modi said.“It is all about mindset. It all depends on whether you want to be part of the problem or part of the solution. One has to rise above self-interest and put the nation first... As the prime minister, I am not worried as long as you have the zeal to take the risk,” PM Modi told the students and asked them to prepare a vision document for the nation’s 75th year of Independence. He also asked them to help local artisans and make villages around the Santiniketan campus in Bengal’s Birbhum district self-reliant.Talking of a survey British major general Thomas Monroe conducted in 1820, Modi said, “The survey found villages in India having more than one school and temples linked to education before the British education system was thrust on us. Another survey showed Bihar and Bengal having more than one lakh village schools in 1830. This shows where we used to be.”“Tagore wanted the education system to be free. Today, the nation’s new education policy gives you the freedom to choose your subjects, show your skills and develop entrepreneurship. It also focuses on gender equality in education... This will lead to Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India). The recent Union budget has sanctioned ₹50,000 crore for research. Bengal led India in the pursuit of knowledge. The world is watching you,” Modi said, addressing the students.At the Kolkata event, Shah patiently watched a 'song and dance' programme on India’s freedom fighters. He later said, “Subhas Bose is remembered by millions despite the efforts made to make people forget him. The Centre has formed a committee to pay homage to him on his 125th birth anniversary not only in India but abroad as well. He topped the Indian civil service, something today’s youths aspire for, but quit the job to serve India. He sent a message. He became the president of the Congress party twice and on one of these occasions, he went against the wishes of Bapuji (Gandhi). We may not die for the nation like the freedom fighters but we can live for it,” said Shah.The Trinamool Congress was quick to react with party Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy alleging that Modi and Shah both fall short of the secular idealism that Tagore and Bose stood for.“They build the Ram temple and differentiate between high-caste and low-caste Hindus. They are mentally and ideologically unfit to talk about such icons. The later stanzas of Jana Gana Mana, our national anthem, or Tagore’s poem 'Bharattirtha' focuses on a universal society where caste and creed do not exist. Similarly, Bose made the Azad Hind Fauz or the Indian National Army an ideal vehicle for secularism where general Shah Nawaz Khan was the second in command,” said Roy.CPI(M)’s Sujan Chakraborty, leader of the Left parties in the state assembly, said, “Do Modi and Shah live the spirit of universal brotherhood that Tagore and Bose uphold? The BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh represent an entirely different ideology. Tagore believed in freedom of thought and speech while Bose believed in a classless society.”Veteran columnist and political commentator Suvashsis Maitra said, “It is fine if the BJP’s top leaders speak on Bengal’s rich heritage but some specific things need to be done.”“Why doesn’t the Centre declare its stand on the report of the Justice Manoj Mukherjee Commission that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had set up to probe Bose’s mysterious disappearance? The commission said he did not die in the plane crash. The Centre should also declare what happened to the research on the Indian National Army that historian Pratul Chandra Gupta was asked to carry out by the Centre in 1956. The manuscript disappeared," said Maitra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/pm-modi-shah-focus-on-bengal-s-glorious-past-on-election-eve-101613754222635.html

This means the UPSC will not hold any interviews till March 8.The UPSC had postponed the interviews and meeting of the selection committee in wake of the February 11 order of the HC directing the UPSC “to positively file its response” to an application filed by petitioner Surender Singh Dahiya, additional director, agriculture department, seeking stay of interviews the UPSC had decided to hold on February 15.On February 12, GS Rawat, under secretary, UPSC, had sent a letter to the Haryana chief secretary and referring to the court order in question, stated: “In view of the above order, the selection committee meeting scheduled for February 15 has been postponed.”At the heart of the petitioner’s application was the contention that no selection had been completed till December 31, 2020, thereby in view of Regulation 5 of the Indian Administrative Service (Appointment by Selection) Regulations, 1997, the entire process of recruitment through this source will be deemed to have lapsed.In his February 14 affidavit that the court did not accept, Rawat had referred to the key contention of the petitioner and said: “...a short reply affidavit is being filed as the time was short to file a detailed reply.”The UPSC, pleading for more time to file a detailed reply at a later stage, had stated that in view of December 28, 2020 court order (of another bench), the UPSC had convened the February 15 meeting of the selection committee to select shortlisted non-SCS officers to IAS of Haryana cadre “so as to avoid any disobedience or violation” of the court order.“It is further submitted that in the meantime, the commission received the February 11 orders...Keeping it in view, the meeting scheduled for February 15 has been deferred. It is humbly submitted that further action in the matter will be initiated as per direction of the HC in the instant case of the petitioner,” UPSC submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fate-of-25-haryana-s-non-scs-officers-selection-to-ias-hangs-in-balance-101613751658397.html

The ruling BJP in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) wants to pass resolutions through majority voting and hence, requires attendance of all its party members.These absent members have been asked to submit their reply to member of Parliament (MP) Girish Bapat, city unit president Jagdish Mulik and leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar.Bidkar said, “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, PMC has not been able to hold general body meetings. Almost 300 proposals are pending. The BJP has 100 members, but with some of them remaining absent, it becomes a problem during voting. If all party members are present, the ruling party can approve city’s development proposals through voting.”“We want to ensure that all our elected members remain present for the general body meetings. Recently, a two-day residential workshop had been organised at Rambhau Mahalgi Prabodhini in Mumbai for them where instructions had been given to the elected members that they should attend meetings and put the party’s views in the meetings,” Bidkar added.Officials aware of the developments said that among the 27 members, many are senior members who had been appointed to various committees. These members have been given instructions to remain present for the general body meetings as the party would need to call vote on some topics, however, despite that they were absent for the online general body meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-issues-notices-to-27-corporators-for-not-attending-gb-meetings-101613750758234.html
19-02-2021||Other||Rapid Antigen Tests accounts for 18% of Covid tests conducted in Pune city||PUNE As per the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), out of close to 10.98 lakh Covid tests conducted in the city, 1.98 lakh tests were conducted through Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT), which is 18 per cent of the total tests.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant medical officer of health, said, “Out of the 10.89 lakh Covid tests conducted in the city, 1.98 lakh tests were conducted through RAT. We focus more on RT-PCR tests and do keep a follow up on symptomatic negative RAT tests.”“We have kept a lower target for RAT and aim for more RT-PCR tests,” he added.According to a reply given to a Lok Sabha member’s question, the central health ministry has listed out the proportion of RT-PCR and RAT tests conducted by states/Union territories in their overall testing.According to that reply, in Maharashtra, almost 40 per cent of the Covid tests conducted, from March 2020 until February 9, 2021, were done through RAT and 60 per cent was through RT-PCR testing.The local authorities continue to ignore the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) advisory to follow up on symptomatic negative RAT’s which RT-PCR tests, which is considered the gold standard for detection of the virus.According to the reply, out of the 1.45 crore tests done as of February 9, 2021, 40 per cent of tests in the state are done through RAT and the rest through RT-PCR. Despite a higher dependency on RAT which provides faster results and is useful especially before surgeries like pregnancy or emergency, the ICMR considers RT-PCR to be the gold standard for detection of the infection.As of February 18, the state overall positivity rate stands at 13.4 per cent as out of 1.55 crores, 20.81 lakh have tested positive for the infection, as per the state health department.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said, “I think at 40 per cent RAT tests is a good enough number. However, we conduct RT-PCR tests of those symptomatic who come negative in a RAT test. It may be said that it is not strictly followed in all cases, but we do insist district authorities to follow the norms as much as possible and keep pushing them for better implementation.”With 40 per cent RAT dependency, the state still fares much better than other major states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi which have more RAT tests than RT-PCR tests. RAT tests have often been criticised by experts to give false negatives.Some of the states that fare well in terms of more accurate testing strategy are Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan that do have close to 100 per cent use of RT-PCR in their testing mix.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rapid-antigen-tests-accounts-for-18-of-covid-tests-conducted-in-pune-city-101613750698175.html
19-02-2021||Other||No samples from Amravati, Yavatmal and Satara test positive for any foreign Covid strain: state||PUNE A day after Pune’s government college, the BJ Medical college, and Sassoon General hospital claimed that the samples from Amravati, Satara and Yavatmal showed mutations which escape neutralising antibodies, the state health ministry clarified that none of the mutations were similar to those found in Britain, Brazil or South Africa. The Maharashtra government in a statement on Friday said, “Till now, BJ Medical college has tested four samples each from Amravati, Yavatmal and Satara. None of the samples showed any mutations similar to the ones being reported from Britain, Brazil or South Africa.” The samples were sent for genome sequencing in view of increasing cases being reported from these districts. The state said that although the genomic sequencing of these samples do show certain mutations, these mutations are not similar to ones being reported from other countries. On Thursday, Dr Rajesh Karyekarte, head of the department of Microbiology at B J Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said, “Our findings suggest the D614G strain, which is prevalent, was found in all the samples. The samples from Amravati, Yeotmal and Satara also showed different mutations. For example, in Amravati, we came across a mutation named E484K in all the four samples. When we inquired if all four samples belong to one family, we were informed that all four samples were taken from different locations. So the conclusion was that it was a common mutation.” Explaining the significance of the mutation, Dr Karyakarte added that the character of the strain found in Amravati is that it escapes neutralising antibodies. “In a nutshell, even if there are neutralising antibodies in the human body, the particular mutation escapes or saves itself from these antibodies,” he said. Talking about Yavatmal, he said that in the samples, they did not find any foreign strain, but a new mutation named N440K. “This particular mutation is commonly seen in Andhra Pradesh. It was also found in a case of re-infection in Delhi. This mutation too can escape the neutralising antibodies and can cause re-infection,” he added. As far as the Satara samples are concerned, Dr Karyekarte said that they came across a new mutation named V911I. “Unfortunately, we could not get significant scientific references about this mutation in any published journals,” he added. He added that all these new mutations are specific to India. “All these strains are of A2 type of coronavirus, which is common in India,” he said. Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean of B J Medical and Sassoon General Hospital said that in any major outbreaks or pandemic, following a big curve, small curves take place. “It seems all these small curves are happening due to lax behaviour such as gathering, weddings and various functions where no physical distancing is followed.” The state also said that none of the 12 samples sent from Pune showed any mutation following the genomic sequencing. The district has been reporting an alarming spike in the number of new cases. “More inquiry is going on and so more samples from Akola, Amravati and Yavatmal have been sent to Pune’s National Institute of Virology and National Centre for Cell Sciences for genomic sequencing. The report is likely to come out new week,” said the state statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-samples-from-amravati-yavatmal-and-satara-test-positive-for-any-foreign-covid-strain-state-101613750697655.html
19-02-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula plot allotment case: ED springs surprise by filing chargesheet before CBI could||The recent move of the enforcement directorate (ED) to file a prosecution complaint (a chargesheet) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in a trial court against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and 21 others in Panchkula industrial plots allotment case came as a surprise for the official circles.Reason: The CBI probing the alleged “currying of favour” by Hooda to his acquaintances in allotments is yet to submit a chargesheet for the predicate offences registered under the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act. In fact, CBI is yet to seek sanction from the state government to prosecute Hooda and others, a mandatory requirement now under the Act.ED’s chargesheet filed in a trial court on February 15 thus triggered discussions on why the agency submitted a chargesheet charging the accused for money laundering before the CBI, probing the predicate offence, could do so. ED says that every scheduled offence is a predicate offence and the occurrence of the same is a pre-requisite for initiating investigation into the offence of money laundering.The predicate offences are investigated by agencies such as police, customs, SEBI, NCB and CBI, under their respective Acts, the ED says.‘Time limit of 365 days was coming to an end’Legal experts said the answer to ED’s urgency in submitting the chargesheet lays in the 2019 amendments made in the PMLA which now provided that attachment of property involved in money laundering will remain valid during the period of investigation for 365 days.In this case, the 14 industrial plots were attached by ED in August 2019 and the attachment was confirmed by the adjudicating authority in February 2020.“Once the attachments have been confirmed by the adjudicating authority, the ED will have to submit a chargesheet in court within 365 days. Otherwise, these attachments would become invalid,” said a law expert. ED officials did not respond to a list of queries e-mailed to them.‘Money laundering a standalone crime’Secondly, an explanation inserted in 2019 for removal of doubts about Section 44 of the PMLA states “the jurisdiction of special court while dealing with the offence under this Act, during investigation, enquiry or trial under this Act, shall not be dependent upon any orders passed in respect of the scheduled offence, and the trial of both sets of offences by the same court shall not be construed as joint trial.”Experts say that the explanation was inserted to insulate the trial of money laundering offences from the outcome of the trial of the predicate offence by an agency like CBI. “The ED says money laundering is a standalone offence. The amended law means that any order passed by a court with regards to a predicate offence will not have a direct bearing on the trial of offence under money laundering law. In a nutshell it means that even if an accused is discharged by the CBI court, it will not affect his role or involvement in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime,” said an IPS officer.However, the Delhi high court in at least two cases has ruled otherwise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-plot-allotment-case-ed-springs-surprise-by-filing-chargesheet-before-cbi-could-101613749978123.html

19-02-2021||Jaipur||NHRC recommends Rajasthan to initiate action against erring police officials||citiesThe NHRC has recommended to the Rajasthan government to initiate disciplinary action against erring police officials for the delay in the registration of an FIR on the allegations that a class 5 student had died after being beaten by a teacher in his school in Kota in 2017, officials said on Friday.The rights panel has also asked the state government, through its chief secretary, to pay a relief of ₹2 lakh to the mother of the deceased child as the delay in the registration of an FIR on her complaint in a cognisable offence "amounted to violation of human rights".The National Human Rights Commission, in a statement, said it had registered the case on the basis of a complaint dated December 12, 2017, by the victim's mother that her son was "brutally beaten with a bamboo stick by a teacher, who taught environment subject, for not completing his homework".When her son came back home, he was so struck by the fear of his teacher that he found it hard to recognise his mother and brother, and was having hallucinations that the teacher would come and stab him. He was not eating anything, it said.When rushed to the emergency ward of Government Medical College Hospital, the doctor said that her son was suffering from high fever and panic attack, which was also confirmed by the psychiatrist next day. After two days, the boy died on December 3, 2017, the statement said.Allegedly, the police officials were not taking any action against the accused teacher, the right panel said.The Commission had issued notices to the Superintendent of Police, Kota and the principal secretary, department of school education, government of Rajasthan, seeking reports, and it had also directed its Director General (Investigation) to submit an enquiry report.The Superintendent of Police, Kota, Rajasthan informed that a case had been registered in the matter as per the directions of a court in Kota. The Principal Secretary Department of School Education, Rajasthan submitted its report in February 2019. The report revealed that an inquiry committee was constituted. As per the enquiry committee report, "the cause of death of the student was not due to beating". Though the case has been investigated and a final report has been submitted in the court by the police on the grounds of cause of death being brain fever and lungs disease, the non-registration of an FIR by police on cognisable reported offence, in itself is a violation of human rights, the statement said.On the findings of its Investigation Division, the Commission had issued a notice to the Rajasthan government to show cause why a monetary relief of ₹2 lakh should not be recommended to be paid to the victim's mother, the statement said.Setting aside the contention of the Rajasthan government, the NHRC has "reiterated its recommendation that the state initiate disciplinary action against the erring police officials for the delay in the registration of an FIR on the allegations".The state government had contended that there was "no delay", which the Commission did not accept and reiterated its recommended relief too, the rights panel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/nhrc-recommends-rajasthan-to-initiate-action-against-erring-police-officials-101613746968443.html

19-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi-based philanthropist develops skill centre for underprivileged youth||“I learnt the meaning of service from the Sikh guru, Guru Nanak Dev ji. Kirat Karo Naam Japo, Wand Chhako (work hard, worship God and share your gains with the poor). And this is the philosophy of my life,” says Padma Shri Vikramjit Singh Sahney. A resident of Delhi, a social worker and a philanthropist, Sahney has set up World Class Skill Centre at ITI, Jail Road to help the underprivileged find employment. “The main focus of this centre is to impart free and full time training to the youth, for various courses such as in fashion design, interior design, refrigeration repairs, solar panel installation, and various other advanced IT courses that will help them get placement in the industry. The long term goal is to empower the underprivileged youth of Delhi-NCR by letting them acquire these skills that will help them earn a livelihood,” says Sahney, chairman of the NGO Sun Foundation. Courses for personality development, digital literacy and spoken English will also be rolled out at this newly developed centre. And Sahney says that it’s the support of his family that has enabled him to accomplish all this. “My wife Daisy Sahney, and children Aman (son) and Damandeep (daughter) have been gracious in lending me their support to fulfil this dream,” says Sahney, who maintains a fine balance between his entrepreneurial duties and philanthropic endeavours. “I devote equal time to office work and social activities. Since I received the prestigious Padma Shri award in 2008, I’ve multiplied my philanthropic activities and embarked upon various programmes as I feel all the more responsible to give back to the society,” says Sahney, whose NGO has donated two AI equipped mobile corona testing buses and ambulances to the Government of Punjab and Delhi, to support the fight against Covid-19. Sahney, whose foundation has been running 50 skill centres over the past 10 years in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR, says the recently established centre was developed specifically for those underprivileged who are victims of 1984 riots, the Afghan refugees and the BPL families. He says, “Many migrant labourers and a lot of other people lost their jobs during the pandemic, and I thought that such job-oriented courses were the need of the hour. We therefore ran a massive awareness campaign in west Delhi and slums nearby the area to enrol the students for the centre, and we’ve already gathered about 200 students for the first batch.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhibased-philanthropist-develops-skill-centre-for-underprivileged-youth-101613745240094.html
19-02-2021||City||Tamil Nadu CM drops charges against CAA protestors, other groups ahead of polls||Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami on Friday announced that all cases against those who protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and for Covid- lockdown violators would be withdrawn, continuing with his announcements of withdrawing cases before April-May assembly elections.“Ten lakh cases filed during the lockdown period and 1,500 cases filed during the anti-CAA protests will be withdrawn in the public interest,” Palaniswami said. “Except for cases filed against specific serious offences, and for not allowing police personnel from discharging their duty, all other cases will be withdrawn.” A subsequent statement added that cases of violence, fraudulently getting an e-pass will continue to be investigated.Activists have welcomed the state’s decision.During the CAA protests, a case was filed against human rights activist and senior advocate of the Madras High Court Sudha Ramalingam.“After students were attacked in Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, we held a candlelight vigil. Police stationed there shook hands with me for keeping the protest peaceful,” said Ramalingam. “Months later, I came to know that an FIR was filed and I was the number one accused. It goes on to show how the entire police machinery and criminal law is being abused by the state to silence people. The chief minister and the politicians know that there is no case here and when taken to trial, it will end up in acquittals. That’s why in most cases there is no charge sheet filed. It will be kept pending. One fine day, it will be dropped and that’s nearer to the elections. It’s time we take cognisance that these were cases foisted by abusing the process of law,” she said.Also read: ‘Born and brought up in Bengal’ - Amit Shah on poll-bound state’s next CMThe ruling AIADMK government in alliance with the BJP has been in support of the CAA that allows Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Christians and Buddhists from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanisation, who have come before December 2014, to get citizenship in India.However, Palaniswami has repeatedly assured minorities in the state that they will be protected. He has met Muslim and Christian leaders-led delegation to convey that they need not fear the alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party.Palaniswami also announced on Friday that they will consider withdrawing cases filed between 2011 and 2014 against people who protested against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP). The charges range from petty offences for unlawful assembly to sedition.A request for the same was made by villagers of Idinthakarai to the chief minister on Thursday night for the withdrawal of 105 cases filed against thousands of protestors between 2011 and 2014.“We explained to him (Palaniswami) that it was a non-violent protest by the people for their lives and livelihood,” said SP Udayakumar from the People’s Movement Against Nuclear Energy. During that period, late J Jayalalithaa was the chief minister and the UPA was in power at the Centre. “There are 20 sedition cases. The pendency has affected our villagers' job prospects. They can’t avail passports to travel for their work,” said Udayakumar.The petition stated that 350 cases were registered against 2.27 lakh people. After a 2014 government order, 213 cases were closed and another 31 following a Madras High Court directive, 105 cases are still pending. “Some of the cases are now being investigated by the court. Other cases are in the FIR stage. People in that area have asked these cases to be taken back. We will consider their request under the purview of law,” Palaniswami said.A few weeks ago, Palaniswami announced the withdrawing of cases against pro-Jallikattu protestors from January 2017 except for crimes like assaulting policemen and setting fire to vehicles. Disciplinary proceedings against thousands of government teaching staff for an indefinite agitation in January 2020 were also withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tamil-nadu-cm-drops-charges-against-caa-protestors-other-groups-ahead-of-polls-101613743943413.html
19-02-2021||Pune||NIBM forest main gate lock found broken, security cabin unmanned||Pune: The 200-acre reserve forest at NIBM is in a state of neglect with the lock of main gate broken, security cabin unmanned and found open and fencing breached at various locations. Residents report of vandals entering the green belt, engage in binge drinking and bonfires. Some even use the space to dump waste. An incident of fire at the grassland portion of the forest area near EDP restaurant was reported a few days ago angering residents to demand a probe into the case as they claim that such happenings are taking place often. The gates of the forest area are located near the connecting road to Dorabjee Heritage Mall and opposite to Anand Van forest reserve in Kondhwa. A spot visit revealed that the lock of the gate near Dorabjee Heritage Mall was broken and the security cabin door unmanned and open. The cabin’s nearby area was littered with liquor bottles, plastic garbage and remains of burnt wood. “The private security guard posted here is missing since one month. There is no police patrolling and the forest department is least bothered about protecting the green space,” said Ashutosh Kumar, who is regular at the hill in the evenings. Green activist Praveen Kumar Anand said, “We have been requesting the state government to hand over this forest land to us for conservation and due care will be taken to protect and preserve the reserve forest.” Kumar, who heads Anandvan Forest Trust, an NGO that carries out plantation and other conservation works at Anand Van forest reserve, said Mohammadwadi and NIBM forests have long been neglected. “We have demanded that the 100 acres of reserve forest lying unused and abandoned behind DPS school must be transformed into urban forest. Also, 11 acres of reserve forest in Krushnagar must be immediately handed over for developing an urban forest park. Currently these areas are neglected and occupied by hooligans.” Daljeet Goraya, secretary, Ganga Kingston Society secretary, said, “The forest has to be protected, walled and put under CCTV camera surveillance.” Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests, Pune, did not respond to queries and calls on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nibm-forest-main-gate-lock-found-broken-security-cabin-unmanned-101613742536656.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||DU Waale: An app by a student to provide free study material to peers||The pandemic posed challenging times in lives of most, but many youngsters ensured that they use this as an opportunity to bring forth the best in them. One such exemplary story is of Pranav Singh, a student of BSc (Hons) at Bhaskaracharya College Of Applied Sciences, Delhi University, who used his time during the pandemic to benefit his peers by developing an app named DU Waale: Study Material of Delhi University, which can be accessed by students at the tap of a finger. With the help of this app, students can download and upload study material for free, at a time when it’s becoming difficult to visit the library or borrow books from seniors. “Colleges were closed amid the pandemic but online exams and online classes were taking place, and students did not have all the necessary study material to prepare for the exam. Moreover, many students didn’t have stable internet connection or enough broadband data to attend online classes. The libraries were closed, photocopy and book shops on campus were inaccessible because many students had to go back to their home towns. A number of students didn’t even have the money to buy books because the pandemic had hit their parents financially. I wanted to help all these students, and that inspired me to create this app, which we have launched this month,” says Singh. One of the downsides to having an online campus has been the gap between seniors and juniors and the app helps bridge that gap to some extent. “When we are on campus, it’s easy to pass on our course books and notes to the juniors, but in an online campus mode this has been a challenge. Freshers even now don’t have enough knowledge about study resources and course structure so this app will be proving very helpful for them by making it easy to understand course structures and provide all study material for free,” says Singh.The app has had more than 450 downloads already, and Singh plans to create audio books out of all the available study material, to benefit the visually impaired students. “It took me nearly three months to create this app, which is slowly finding its popularity among the campus kids. Most users are happy with it as they are able to get all books and previous years’ question papers – everything at one place, and for free! I’m working to make the app more user friendly, so that the students who aren’t tech savvy can also use it without any hesitation. I’ll try to provide material for most courses and subjects, and will also introduce some new features through which students can directly contact their seniors,” he adds.

Governor Anandiben Patel had last month administered the oath of the protem chariman to Manvendra Singh.The Samajwadi Party having 51 members in the 100-member Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council had objected to it and demanded election for the post, stressing that since the party was in majority in the house, its candidate should be made the chairman.Earlier talking reporters, Samajwadi Party MLC Sunil Singh Sajan said," Fourteen days ago, we gave a notice for the removal of the acting chairman of the UP Legislative Council. It was accepted. The notice was given 14 days ago under the rules. When the Samajwadi Party is in majority, then the acting chairman is only for administering oath to members and not for running the House."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-mlcs-stage-walkout-over-appointment-of-up-legislative-council-acting-chairman-101613739644977.html

Theatre artist Ninad Jadhav, 50, has translated this popular musical, including its 7-8 songs, into English, in an effort to shatter the language barrier for theatre lovers. He said that the English version of the musical will be on stage in a few months. Kusumagraj was the recipient of many national awards, including Jnanpith, Sahitya Akademi and Sangeet Natak Akademi.“I believe that theatre breaks language barriers. We have very few examples in the theatre where a drama is translated and performed in another language. That’s why I decided to translate “Yayati Ani Devyani”, a story connected to the Mahabharat, into English. The English version will allow theatre enthusiasts across the globe to watch, perform and enjoy. We have seen this in the case of the dramas written by Kannada writer Girish Karnad (1938-2019). His works were translated into English first and then it was adopted in other Indian languages,” said Jadhav. “Yayati Ani Devyani”, the musical play was published in 1966. The play narrates the story of King Yayati, an ancestor of the Pandavas and Kauravas, and his two wives Devyani and Sharmishtha. Through these main characters, the play unfolds the complexities of human relations. The music score was given by Hindustani classical vocalist and composer Jitendra Abhisheki. The play became a commercial success. “Performing this drama on the stage is an experiment as it will depend on the imagination of a theatre artist. The theatre director can keep the original music score and blend the translated songs into it. Also, the dialogues could be in English and the songs could be performed in Marathi in its original form, as they are popular. Based on the translated songs, maybe a new music score could be done,” he said. The translated text version of the drama will be published on February 27, the 109th birth anniversary of Vishnu Vaman Shirwadkar. “A drama is alive when it is staged. Primary readings have been going on and the audience can see the English version in the course of two months,” said Jadhav. “My effort is to let the world see the writing style of Kusumagraj. I remember there was an attempt to stage Vasant Kanetkar’s Marathi classic music play “Matsyagandha” (the story of Satyavati from the Mahabharat) in Hindi. I had given playback to one of its songs in Hindi and it was experimental theatre. There has not been any such performance in commercial theatre,” said Charudatta Aphale, a senior vocalist and kirtan (ballad) performer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/attempt-to-stage-kusumagraj-s-marathi-musical-before-english-audience-and-others-101613739296366.html

Each injured was given ₹50,000 from the Chief Minister's Relief Fund.The state government had earlier provided government jobs to the next of kin of two victims--Harpal Singh (40) and Ashok Kumar (35)-- as per the existing policy since both were the breadwinners for their families.In Ashok Kumar's case, his minor daughter Bago (11) was also killed but since one member of the family has already been given a job, Bago was not been included in the special provision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-okays-jobs-for-kin-of-minors-killed-in-maur-mandi-blast-101613737879342.html
19-02-2021||Patna||Bihar records 10.5% growth rate in 2019-20, says economic survey||Bihar recorded a 10.5% growth rate (at constant prices) in 2019-20, higher than the growth rate of the Indian economy(estimated to be around 5%), according to the Bihar Economic Survey 2020-21.Constant prices are a way of measuring economic change considering a year as base year. In this case, it is 2011-12. It gives the real Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) growth.Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, who also holds the finance portfolio, tabled the 15th Bihar Economic Survey on the floor of the Legislative Assembly on Friday, ahead of the Budget, for the first time. Later, industry minister Shahnawaz Hussain also tabled a report prepared by the Centre for Policy and Public Finance in the Legislative Council. Prasad also tabled the Bihar Settlement of Taxation Disputes (Second) Ordinance, 2020, while Parliamentary Affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary tabled the Bihar State Higher Education Council (2nd Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. Also Read | Bihar budget session to start today, Speaker appeals for cooperationAmong the three major sectors, says the Economic Survey report, the tertiary sector(the service sector including retail, financial services, hospitality, real estate, etc.) recorded a noticeable increase in its share—up from 57.3% in 2013-14 to 60.2% in 2019-20, largely due to growth in road transport and other services. The sectoral composition had started witnessing a change from 2011-12 with a shift from primary to tertiary sector.The primary sector involves all economic activities that directly use natural resources, viz. mining, forestry, fishing, etc. The secondary sector involves manufacturing and processing to add value to natural resources, viz. cotton converted into cloth. The tertiary sector helps in developing the primary and secondary sectors, viz transportation or other services.The report shows financial management in the state was within the prescribed limits of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA), 2006, with the gross fiscal deficit as a percentage of the GSDP at 2% and the revenue account in surplus during 2019-20, lower than 2.7% in 2018-19. Bihar has consistently claimed to be a revenue-surplus state since 2004-05. The revenue account remained in surplus during 2018-19 also, says the report, though borrowing by the state as a share of the GSDP witnessed a jump from 3.6% in 2018-19 to 4.8% in 2019-20. Economic experts, however, say that for a poor state like Bihar, which depends so heavily on central transfers and has low expenditure, showing revenue surplus could hurt, as it would lose revenue deficit grants that many relatively better-off states avail, as per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission. Besides, they said, it was a matter of concern for the state that it was already under the impact of economic slowdown, as was the case elsewhere in the country, even before the advent of Covid-19 pandemic, as reflected through the fall in revenue and capital expenditure in 2019-20, compared to 2018-19. While revenue expenditure dropped from ₹1,24,897 crore to ₹1,23,533 crore, the capital expenditure fell from ₹29,759 crore to ₹20,080 crore. The report, however, points to a slight increase in the state’s own tax and non-tax revenue from ₹33,539 crore in 2018-19 to ₹33,858 crore in 2019-20. According to the report, the share of revenue expenditure in the total expenditure has increased over the years from 74.4% in 2015-16 to 86% in 2019-20, while the share of expenditure in the capital account has declined from 25.6% to 14% during the same period. “Over 70% of the state revenue comes from central transfers. With Bihar maintaining revenue surplus, it is certainly disadvantageous, as it cannot avail revenue deficit grant,” said Sudhanshu Kumar, an economist at Centre for Policy and Public Finance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-records-10-5-growth-rate-in-2019-20-says-economic-survey-101613738090927.html

We all have to understand that the Union government has brought the laws that are not only anti-farmer but also against the middle class and the youth," he said, adding that his party was committed to the farmers' interest and will compel the government to withdraw the laws.He also said farmers are not begging but fighting for their rights as the biggest force in a democracy are people.A three-point resolution was passed in the “mahapanchayat”, demanding the withdrawal of the farm laws, a legislation to ensure the minimum support price (MSP) for crops and the rollback of the hike in fuel prices.It was the first major farmers' rally in Rajasthan after the recent visit of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to the state and third "kisan mahapanchayat" addressed by Pilot after similar events organised in Dausa and Bharatpur.Former ministers Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena, MLAs Hemaram Chaudhary, Brijendra Ola, Murari Meena, Rakesh Parekh, G R Khatana, Prashant Bairwa and other leaders of the party were present in the rally organised by Chaksu MLA Ved Prakash Solanki.Chaksu is a region dominated by Meena, Dalit and Jat communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/farm-laws-against-farmers-middle-class-says-sachin-pilot-101613735002112.html
19-02-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru makes way for pedestrians, pedallers: Citizens welcome first Slow Street||What if you step on a road, and instead of hearing a blaring honk see vehicles slow down for you? No, this isn’t any foreign location but Alexandra Street in Richmond Town, which has been officially announced as the first Slow Street in Bengaluru! A slow street is one that employs traffic calming measures in residential areas, and makes it safer for people to walk, cycle alongside providing space for children to be able to play. A new experience, indeed! “Earlier, I could not walk in Richmond Town owing to the vehicular traffic. During the lockdown last year I picked up cycling; it was good for a few months before cars again consumed the roads,” says Priyabrata, a cycling enthusiast adding, “Making Alexandria Street a Slow Street will help locals travel safely, and will stop instances of speeding as well. In fact, it’s important for all metro cities to encourage pedestrianisation.”The pandemic saw many take to their old love for cycling and walking, to stay fit in the new normal where #WorkFromHome has become common. And this initiative by Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) aids Bengaluru to become a safe haven for cyclists and walkers. Nihar Thakkar, a cyclist and an urban planning enthusiast, opines: “Lockdown helped push the agenda to make city roads safer for people. More cars mean more pollution, and the perils of environmental damage are apparent to people today. Earlier, it wasn’t easy to cycle or even walk on the roads due to the fear of traffic. But, incorporating simple changes around the city like pop-up bicycle lanes, banning traffic on busy streets like Church Street or even making artificial curbs for better pedestrian movement are adding to the eventual goal of sustainability.” DULT had earlier undertaken project MarkYourCycleRoute, to create bicycle districts in the city, with the aim to provide better mobility for residents. In fact, cycling and pedestrian safety has been encouraged through various measures, which includes the weekend vehicular ban on Church Street under the Clean Air Street initiative and Sustainable Mobility Accord (SuMA), wherein nine neighbourhoods were selected to implement sustainable mobility interventions over the next one year. “The Slow Street initiative is a positive and progressive step in the direction,” says Sathya Sankaran, Bicycle Mayor of Bengaluru, adding, “We’ve been encouraging cycling and pedestrian spaces since Bengaluru has many small streets. We need to slow them down so that the dedicated pathways on them can be used by other commuters, and we need to dedicate space on the streets to people, not cars... We’ve seen how the business on Church Street, post the weekend traffic ban, increased. The restaurants, pubs and book shops on the street are witnessing better customer footfall now. Even families turn up to cycle, walk or simply spend time. These initiatives prove that even with a limited bandwidth, a lot can be achieved to make our cities safe for pedestrians and cyclists.”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-makes-way-for-pedestrians-pedallers-citizens-welcome-first-slow-street-101613733293786.html

The agency, which is looking into the financial aspect of the ration scam, claimed that the trio, arrested this Wednesday, generated about ₹177 crore with their illegal activities.The ED has charged Sampat Namdeo Ghorpade, Arun Namdeo Ghorpade and Vishwas Namdeo Ghorpade under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). A special court has remanded them to ED’s custody till February 26.Also Read | ED attaches over ₹17cr Amnesty India assets in laundering caseThe ED probe stems from a First Information Report registered by the Nashik police in 2015 against the three for forgery, falsification of documents and criminal conspiracy. The case involved purported misappropriation of foodgrains in Sinnar taluka where more than 250 sacks of rice from government godowns were sold directly to rice mills in 2015.Further investigation revealed irregularities on a much larger scale and a full fledged, organised syndicate behind it, prompting the state government to invoke the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) which is generally used against organised crime syndicates of the underworld. In fact, it was the first such instance that a charge sheet was filed against the ration mafia in the state under MCOCA. The brothers allegedly bought reserved foodgrains from godowns of Food Corporation of India and distributed them to other companies floated by the other accused.“The three accused had indulged in unlawful activities as an individual singly and jointly as a gang. The three and their syndicate generated the proceeds of crime of around ₹177 crore,” an ED official said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-arrests-three-for-involvement-in-pds-scam-in-maharashtra-101613729930170.html

The government will set up engineering, medical and sports universities.”Chauhan said the government has started a grievance redressal system and taken steps to empower especially the women through 35% reservation in government jobs and 50% in panchayati raj institutions. He added the government has started working on its resolve to provide water to every farm in the next five years. “In villages, basic amenities have been provided and now the effort is to ensure street lighting and solid waste management.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-governor-addresses-house-lists-govt-s-successes-plans-101613729629674.html

Shivaji Maharaj was born on Shivneri fort in 1630.Thackeray visited the fort in the morning and paid floral tributes to Shivaji Maharaj and his mother Jijabai.Thackeray said that entire Maharashtra reveres Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a deity."Numerous kings came and disappeared.... Numerous battles were fought, several kingdoms came and vanished, but there is something special about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj," he said."Shivaji Maharaj fought several battles and established 'swaraj'.... There is no need to tell how he fought the opponents. No such battles are being fought now, and there are no swords and shields. But right now we are fighting a battle against the coronavirus and face mask is the only shield in the fight," he said."...we will strike whenever it is required, but while defending, we have to use a shield. In this battle, mask is our shield...do not forget that," Thackeray added.One cannot win a battle by just holding a sword. One needs a determined heart and the desire to win. Shivaji Maharaj continues to provide that inspiration, he said.The chief minister also attended several programmes, including the "cradle ceremony", at the fort.Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was also present there on the occasion.In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the district administration had urged people not to gather at Shivneri fort to celebrate the Maratha warrior king's birth anniversary.Thackeray also said that he considers himself fortunate and blessed as he got the opportunity to come to Shivneri for the second consecutive year to pay homage.He added that the radiance of history linked to all the forts in the state needs to be spread across the globe.The chief minister said that during the programme, someone told him that Shivaji Maharaj possessed a certain skill."Even Dada (Ajit Pawar) has that skill. I am going to learn it to find out what is going on in his mind," he said in a lighter vein.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/face-mask-only-shield-against-coronavirus-maharashtra-cm-thackeray-101613728817787.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||Kitty parties: Limited members, sanitisers, masks make entry in 2021!||Scrumptious food, outdoor gathering, large groups, and fun games — Kitty parties used to be all this and more in the pre-Covid era. But in 2021, there’s a stark difference in how kitty parties are being organised. We speak to members of kitty groups across Delhi-NCR to know more. A Gurugram-based homemaker Isha Bountra shares that she recently went to a gettogether with close friends and family. “It was organised at a close friend’s showroom where we knew it was safe and hygienic. We were conscious, but everyone was like family, so we weren’t that rigid. We knew each other’s family history, whether someone was Covid-19 positive in the past or not. It was a bit scary, but we hadn’t seen each other for long, so we met at our own risk,” she says, adding, “Jo ladies kitty groups ki member hain, unki families se aap itne touch mein nahin hote, toh aap wahan jane mein thoda conservative hote ho. Kyunki aapko nahin pata kaun kaha hai... They also have reservations about resuming meet-ups. I’m part of more kitty groups but they haven’t resumed yet. Even the ones we are planning to organise will most likely have only neighbours. Our next meet will be this month as part of the couple kitty. We haven’t been to restaurants yet... Regularity aane mein bahut time lagega abhi because of Covid 19.”Reshma Arya, who runs a boutique in the city, is part of a kitty that will be hosting its first meet since the pandemic hit. She says, “We will be meeting after a year, and couldn’t be more excited! Sabko itni boriyat ho gayi hai ghar mein iss stage pe; aur sabko pata hai ki tabiyat theek hai toh hi aana hai. Earlier, we used to have around 20 members at an event, now it will be around 12 members only. We will most likely be going to a restaurant, and are really excited as there will be a dress code and we’ll all wear matching masks! Dur dur baithke kaise games khelenge?”Sangeeta Sahni, a Gurugram resident, says her kitty members meet once a month, and their last was at the Delhi Golf Club. “After a long quarantine, we restarted our kitty parties. It was a gettogether with nice chit chat and good food,” she shares, adding, “But we don’t play games since Covid-19, to maintain safety, and we all sit at a safe distance and order separate dishes to avoid sharing food. We plan our kitties at places where sanitisation has been done really well. Life has to move on, we have to move on, but this time we need to be a little more cautious than before.” “Earlier, kitty parties meant lavish food and drinks, but now everything is being kept bare minimum,” says Saroj Gulati, a resident of sector 28 in Noida. She informs that her kitty parties have shifted to homes, and adds, “We meet to catch up and play cards, and we find our homes safer for this. Initially, we were very hesitant to meet due to the age factor of some of the group members. But, now we’ve started meeting twice a week with precautions. We ensure that the mask is worn by everyone present, and at all times. We avoid offering food or tea, but sanitiser is available in plenty!” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kitty-parties-limited-members-sanitisers-masks-make-entry-in-2021-101613728913163.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||DU tales: Cosplay mania takes over Venky’s society freshers’||If you thought that quirky fashion, so typical to Delhi University, had taken a back seat owing to the pandemic, think again! With the uncertainty concerning reopening of colleges, senior students of various societies have found a virtual route to welcome freshers and keep things exciting. Recently, Petrichor – the creative writing society of Sri Venkateswara College – took the same path. But what’s more exciting is that they chose the theme of the online freshers as: Favourite Character Cosplay. New and old members of the society dressed up as characters they admire the most from pop culture. Naman Kapoor, a student of Economics (Hons), who enjoys sharing memes, jokes and even raps, decided to showcase his creative streak with costumes, and dressed up as a joker to “entertain people”. Kapoor says, “It was always fun whenever I watched jokers do tricks in live circus. So I thought let’s spread some smiles by dressing up as this character.” Freshers didn’t limit themselves to the American or English series, and even tried vibrant costumes and makeup based on Anime. “I dressed as Akame from Japanese anime Akame Ga Kill,” says an excited Divya Goyal, a student of B Com (Hons), adding, “When I got to know about this freshers, it suddenly injected me with a new found energy! And I chose Akame because she is brave, courageous and uses her sword in a way to put the strongest people to shame. She fights for right things, and I feel we can all learn from her values. It was so much fun to dress up and talk about my favourite character when everyone was online.” Even the second and final year students participated, and were given the choice to be online with or without dressing up in the theme. But the seniors didn’t let the chance pass by! Describing Harley Quinn as her alter ego, a second-year student Tanushree Singh Balayan, says, “I thought why not be part of this... at least we’ll get something exciting to do. And I chose Quinn because although people might view her as a psychotic villain, but I see her as a passionate lover. There is a lot of depth to her character if one wants to look properly. I associate myself to her as a lover who can go to any extent to save her love and a woman nobody wants to mess with.” When asked about her inspiration behind the theme, Bhavini Malhotra, a core member of the society, says, “I felt character cosplay was an ideal theme for the freshers as it’s a fun way to introduce yourself as a newcomer and brings about enthusiastic interaction. Also, as a literary society, it was fitting! The aim was to bolster the freshers’ creativity in the current monotonous environment. I hoped we managed to spark interactions between the freshers and senior members by having them bond over common interests in light of the current pandemic. Above all, Petrichor is a family, and we wanted to find a way to make the freshers feel welcome and have a good time.”Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-tales-cosplay-mania-takes-over-venky-s-society-freshers-101613726452162.html
19-02-2021||Lucknow||No more advice, time for SP to form govt: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav on Friday challenged the Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh as said he won’t point out the flaws of the current dispensation any more. “I am not giving any advice to the government, now I will form the next government. The Samajwadi Party will do well in the forthcoming UP panchayat polls and win the 2022 UP assembly polls,” Yadav said while addressing a press conference.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state has been re-inaugurating projects already been inaugurated by the Centre. “This government is strange, it re-inaugurates already inaugurated projects, relays foundation for projects of which foundation stone has been already laid and signs Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) of already signed MoUs,” Yadav said.He also said that he will observe how the BJP’s vision of transforming the economy of Uttar Pradesh into a $1 trillion economy comes into fruition during the ongoing budget session of the state assembly. Yadav said, “The government said it will make India a $5 trillion economy and then the Uttar Pradesh government said it will make UP a $1 trillion economy. Let's see how all this gets reflected in the budget, which will be presented in UP assembly in the ongoing budget session.”Yadav also attacked the government over the ongoing protests against the farm laws. He said that his party will continue to demand farmers’ rights.During the press conference, several leaders from the Congress, Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) and BJP joined the SP. RK Chaudhary, a former minister who was a member of the BSP, and a retired officer of the Indian Police Service (IPS) Harish Kumar Yadav also joined the party in the presence of Akhilesh Yadav.

19-02-2021||Chandigarh||Rats nibble farmer’s body kept at mortuary in Sonepat||The body of a 70-year-old farmer, who had been taking part in the farmers’ protest at Delhi’s Singhu border against the Centre’s three farm laws, was allegedly gnawed at by rats at the Sonepat civil hospital’s mortuary, prompting the authorities to order a probe. The body of Rajender Saroha of Baiyanpur village in Sonepat district was kept in the mortuary for post-mortem after his death on Wednesday night. On Thursday morning, the farmer’s son, Pradeep Saroha, noticed rodent bite marks on the face and a foot. “My father had been taking part in the agitation and was on dharna at Rasoi village for four days. His health deteriorated on Wednesday and he was brought to the civil hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead after a heart attack. I found blood oozing from the face and a foot,” Pradeep said. Sonepat principal medical officer Jai Bhagwan said a team of three doctors, deputy medical superintendents Ginni Lamba, Sandeep Lathwal and senior medical officer Sushil Jain, has been formed to inquire into the matter. “The doctors will see on whose part there has been negligence. The body was handed over the family and the cremation was carried out on Thursday,” Dr Jai Bhagwan said, adding the team of doctors will submit its report in two days. Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala described the incident as shocking. In a tweet, he said a farmer’s body has been nibbled by rodents and the “BJP government acts as a mute spectator”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rats-nibble-farmer-s-body-kept-at-mortuary-in-haryana-s-sonepat-101613724348661.html
19-02-2021||Other||Slam Dunk: Defence, defence, defence... combatting the Golden Age of NBA offence||What defensive schemes are used to contain the most gifted, versatile and skilled basketball players in the world?The evolution of professional basketball in the NBA has influenced all aspects of the modern game – so far, the changes seen in player size and offensive schemes have shown how much variation exists between eras. With the explosion in NBA offence triggering a record point totals and a faster game, it brings to mind the words of the famed ex-Boston Celtics head coach Red Auerbach: “Basketball is like war in that offensive weapons are developed first, and it always takes a while for the defence to catch up.” While multiple rule changes have tilted the game decidedly in favour of very skilled offensive players, this has forced defensive schemes to adjust and evolve with time to be able to account for the increased skill- level and rule changes favouring offensive players.Due to the lack of emphasis on three-point shot attempts after the introduction of the three-point line to the NBA, early NBA defence was heavily focused on man-to-man defensive schemes. There were often instances where doing a great job and only focusing on the man you were singularly guarding resulted in your team still forcing a missed shot from the opposition. NBA rules at this time also discouraged and had penalties for defenders who “zoned” an area of the court without directly guarding a single man. What this meant was that great scoring players during this time could only be neutralised by the defence double teaming them and completely disregarding another player on their team, leaving him wide open.This defensive strategy proved to be most effective to neutralise the offensive schemes of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, which we predicated on elite players who would singularly attempt to score against multiple defenders. With the improved skill, size and athletic ability of players, the NBA changed a few rules in the mid-2000s to benefit offensive players. No longer were defences allowed to “hand check” or “body bump” offensive players, while the NBA also introduced zone defence as an allowable tactic. The increase in pace that teams played with as well as the reliance of teams on analytics and data in decision making mean that offences in the modern NBA focus largely on efficiency, with the most efficient shots usually being close to the rim or 3-point shots. As the “pace and space” increased on court, NBA teams largely turned to pick and roll plays to generate good offence for their players.To combat this, current New York Knicks and ex-Boston Celtics coach Tom Thibodeau popularised a defensive concept usually called an “ICE” in the NBA. This involved an athletic and versatile big man essentially guarding two players at once, something that Kevin Garnett was able to do with great success in leading the Boston Celtics to an NBA championship in 2008, with the help of Thibodeau’s defensive schemes. As an additional layer, teams attempted to increase the difficulty of shots at the rim by teaching players to contest shots by jumping completely vertically, a defensive technique that was brought to the forefront of action by Rob Hibbert from the Indiana Pacers in the NBA playoffs when facing the LeBron James and Dwayne Wade-led Miami Heat team. The NBA continues to evolve, with the current generation of players becoming even more skilled at learning the offensive nuances of the game such as step-back and side-step 3 point shot, or drawing contact and tricking the defence into fouling them while shooting. This puts the evolution of NBA defence all the more into the spotlight in order to maintain the yin and yang balance that leads to an exciting competition between the offence and defence in NBA basketball.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slam-dunk-defence-defence-defence-combatting-the-golden-age-of-nba-offence-101613724287753.html
19-02-2021||Bangalore||Sharing natural acts of kindness and inclusion||In the heart of Cubbon Park, in the middle of the former British Cantonment, is a seemingly incongruous structure. A sacred ashwath katte, a platform with gigantic Ficus and neem trees. Worshippers from across the city come daily, to pray to these trees. In the mornings, water and grain is kept out by volunteers to feed the birds. The grain is provided by grain merchants, old families that have lived in the city for generations. People come here in the evening to eat – meals are provided free, again based on collections from residents – acts of charity, which are also acts of worship, of gratitude to these trees. Pigeons eat grains, but other birds eat meat. The priest also feeds the kites, the Garudas, throwing pieces of meat into the air as they swoop down deftly.Across the road lies the Kanteerava Sports Stadium. This area used to be the home of the Sampangi lake, one of Bengaluru;s largest water bodies. The Vahnikula Kshatriya or Thigala community start their iconic Karaga festivities here, and the Karaga pot is traditionally made from the clay of the uppu neerina kunte in Cubbon park, close to the giant ashwath katte. The Karaga is one of Bengaluru’s oldest festivals, and hundreds of thousands of people congregate to view the procession as it makes its way across the city. But the lake is now gone, converted into a symbol of prestige – the site of major sports events for Bengaluru.All that is left is a tiny pond, surrounded by a fence. The lake once supported the livelihoods of hundreds, and fed thousands more – the grazers who grazed their cattle in the wetlands, and the people who drank the pure organic milk; the fisherfolk or Bestaru who plied their boats in the lake, and the customers who bought the fish, feeding their families; and the dhobis who washed clothes in the lake – clothes that came from miles around.The Vahnikula community still fish here, but only for local consumption. They still share, even though their share has dwindled to almost nothing. As a man fishes, a kite swoops down from the sky, with its familiar keening keeeeyuuuh call. He tosses a fish to the kite – it swoops down to eat. Adu ondu jeeva, he says – this is also a life. If I can eat, so should it.Just outside the katte, near an ant hill, a man comes by with a small bottle of milk, sweetened with sugar. He pours it out carefully, at the base of the ant hill, to feed the ants.A woman with a small child in tow circumambulates another sacred Ficus tree. She stops every few steps, and carefully places a piece of dry fruit, a banana, a lump of rock sugar, at the base of the tree. Offerings to the tree, to be consumed later by the squirrels, monkeys, dogs and other curious denizens of this urban forest.No one should go hungry. In the heart of the city. In everyday conversations, you will find simple acts of kindness and inclusion. They cleanse the heart of a city that seems to be becoming ever more fragmented and hate-filled.(Harini Nagendra is a professor of sustainability at Azim Premji University, and the author of Nature in the City: Bengaluru in the Past, Present and Future and Cities and Canopies: Trees of Indian Cities.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/sharing-natural-acts-of-kindness-and-inclusion-101613723035968.html

19-02-2021||Lucknow||‘After the boy was with us, we decided not to have our own child’||While travelling with Shabnam on a bus to attend classes in JS Hindu Post-Graduate College of Amroha in 2003, her college mate, Usman Saifi, had never thought that someday he would meet her in jail and take custody of her son (now 12 years).In 2008, Shabnam along with her lover Salim (a labourer in a sawmill in Bawankheri village of Amroha), had killed the former’s entire family in Amroha district.After graduation, Shabnam became a ‘shiksha mitra’ in a village school and Usman was inclined towards journalism.In 2008, Usman was shocked to learn that Shabnam and Salim had killed seven members of her family. Shabnam and Salim were arrested and lodged in Moradabad jail and later shifted to different jails. Now, 13 years on, Shabnam is in Rampur jail while Salim is languishing in Mathura jail. The President of India had rejected their mercy petition and Shabnam could be the first woman in Independent India to be hanged for her crime.Also Read: UP teacher who killed her family may be India's 1st woman to be hanged in 70 yrsUsman Saifi, 37, now based in Bulandshahr, recalled that after going through the news he decided to write a book on Shabnam and her involvement in such a gruesome crime. “She would travel in a bus from her village to attend college, and a few times even shared a seat with me,” he recalled explaining why he chose to write a book on her. After the incident, Usman tried to meet her in jail, but Shabnam refused.Usman came to know that she had given birth to a boy in jail in 2008 and the kalyan samiti published a notice to give the child’s custody to an appropriate couple. “I gave up the idea of the book and decided to take the child’s custody so that I could keep him away from jail life,” said Usman.The then jailor of Moradabad jail, Dr BD Pandey, said according to the Jail Manual, a child can stay in jail with the mother or father or a guardian till the age of six years. Thereafter, the child’s custody has to be given to a couple through the district Bal Kalyan Samiti, after following a set procedure of verification.“From among a few couples, we found Usman and his wife Vandana Singh (a teacher) most appropriate for the boy’s custody. He was handed over to them in 2015,” said Pandey.He recalled that Shabnam wanted to hand over the boy to a fellow prisoner who assured her of taking care of him after her release from jail. “I was not in favour of handing over the child to a woman who was a repeat offender. The samiti rejected her name on my recommendation,” added Pandey.After much persuasion, Shabnam agreed to meet Usman and his wife and the procedure of handing over the boy was completed. Usman shared that he got married to Vandana in May 2015 and the couple got custody of the boy in July 2015. Usman dubbed his wife as the real angel of the story. “We decided not to have our own child after taking custody of the boy as she feared it would divide her love and affection,” he said.The Bal Kalyan Samiti renews custody of the boy every three months and it was last renewed on January 20. The couple takes the boy to her mother in jail on the (renewal) date. “This would continue till he attains the age of 18. Thereafter, the boy would decide where he wants to stay,” said Usman.Usman said the boy gets upset before visiting his mother in jail because he doesn’t like jail. “When he came to us in 2015, he had three wishes... eat ice-cream, meet actor Salman Khan and wear office dress (coat and trousers). I fulfilled his first wish, we watched Salman Khan’s movie ‘Bajrangi Bhaijan’ and then I bought him coat and trousers,” shared Usman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-the-boy-was-with-us-we-decided-not-to-have-our-own-child-101613717974230.html
19-02-2021||Chandigarh||Allow Sikh jatha to go to Pakistan, Akal Takht urges Centre||Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Friday said that the Centre has committed a historic wrong by not permitting the Sikh jatha (group) to go to Pakistan to attend the centenary of the Nankana Sahib massacre at the birthplace of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak on February 21. He urged the Union government to reconsider its decision. In a video message released in Amritsar, Giani Harpreet Singh said, “The Nankana Sahib massacre is an important chapter in the history of Sikhs who sacrificed self to liberate the sacred historic gurdwaras from the clutches of mahants who were indulging in immoral acts under the patronage of British rulers. To mark the centenary of the massacre, the main event is being organised at Gurdwara Janam Asthan, Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, while in India the centennial functions are being organised at Godharpur village in Gurdaspur district.” “The Indian government is extremely wrong in denying the Sikh jatha permission to attend the main event in Pakistan,” he said. Cites Kumbh being held in March to counter Covid-19 argument Besides security, the government has cited the Covid-19 pandemic as the reason to deny permission. To this, he said, “The Kumbh festival is being held in March. Crores will take a dip during the festival and no restriction has been imposed. Secondly, this festival is organised every 12 years, but the centenary of Saka Nankana Sahib has come after 100 years. Denying permission to attend an event that comes after 100 years is unfortunate.” “Sikhs and Hindus from Sindh and other distant areas of Pakistan will travel to Nankana Sahib to attend the event in large numbers. They are eager to listen to Sri Harmandar Sahib’s ragi jathas (groups of traditional Gurbani singers) who were to be a part of the jatha. Besides, Pakistan’s sangat was looking forward to listen to Sikh preacher Bhai Pinderpal Singh’s address”, said the head of the highest Sikh temporal seat, who was to lead the Pakistan-bound jatha. “The government still has time to reconsider its decision. We have a day,” he said.

19-02-2021||Lucknow||UP prepares for Covid-19 vaccination of elderly population||Uttar Pradesh health department has begun planning for Covid-19 vaccination of people over 50-years of age after the drive to vaccinate front line workers gets over in the state, said an official.“We have started second dose for health workers and frontline workers are getting their first dose. Once the healthcare workers are administered the second dose and the frontline workers are given the first dose, the focus will shift upon 50-years plus aged people,” said Dr Rakesh Dubey, director general family welfare.Six states -- Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Gujarat – began giving their second doses for the first time on Monday. The vaccination drive has been hit by glitches in the CoWIN application launched for this purpose and hesitancy among recipients driven mostly by the fear of adverse reaction.Dubey said the authorities will soon get the guideline for vaccination of the elderly. He added that currently registration of people outside the two groups of healthcare workers and frontline workers was not taking place. However, it may be announced soon. “We are yet to get the information about it, but may be announced soon,” said Dr Dubey.Medical experts said that aged people with comorbidities or some other kind of illnesses should be given preference for vaccination. “People with respiratory illness, immunocompromised people, diabetes patients should be vaccinated first ideally,” said Prof Kausar Usman, HoD geriatric medicine at the King George’s Medical University in Lucknow.Also Read: WWE wrestler Rinku Singh takes a dip at Sangam, prays for success in ring“This has a simple reason, as elderly with a comorbid condition are more vulnerable to catching infection. And since Covid is under control but not finished hence they (elderly with comorbidity) need protection quickly,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, association of international doctors.In Uttar Pradesh 9.37 lakh health workers were listed for vaccination and 75% of them have been vaccinated. About 20,000 have also got their second dose and authorities hope that the mop up round planned on February 19 will take the vaccination (first dose) among healthcare workers to beyond 80%, said Dr Ajai Ghai, state immunisation officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-prepares-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-elderly-population-101613715267663.html

19-02-2021||Delhi||Parts of Delhi engulfed in dense fog, visibility at Palam dips to 50m||Dense fog was reported at the Palam weather station in Delhi early Friday morning as the visibility dipped to around 50 metres between 7am and 8am, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). In other parts of the city, including Safdarjung observatory, which is the official marker of the city, moderate fog was reported. According to the Met department, the visibility here in the morning was 200 metres. Several flyers were stranded as several departures at the Delhi airport were delayed due to the fog on Friday morning. Officials said the departure of flights between 6am and 7am was affected as the visibility dropped drastically. Even as the exact number of delays could not be verified, they said, operations are expected to normalise during the afternoon.Arrivals, however, continued normally, the officials said.Also Read | Delhi records very poor air, improvement likely over weekendMeanwhile the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city remained in the “very poor” category, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar).“The overall Delhi air quality is in the low-end of the ‘very poor’ category as forecast. Surface winds are low and forecasted to improve and change in direction to easterly. Better ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively. AQI is likely to stay in the lower end of “very poor” for the next two days and it is likely to further improve on February 20,” Safar said in its bulletin.An AQI between 0-50 is marked good, 51-100 is satisfactory, 101- 200 is moderate, 201- 300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor and 401-500 is considered severe.As per Safar, the concentration of PM10 particles stood at 188 in the “moderate” category while the concentration of PM93 particles stood at 150 in the “poor” category on Friday.According to IMD, Delhi’s temperature was recorded at 12 degrees Celsius in Palam at 5.30am on Friday.The maximum temperature would be around 28 degrees Celcius whereas the minimum around 10 degrees Celcius respectively, the regional weather department said Thursday.

19-02-2021||Bangalore||Air pollution caused 12,000 deaths, ₹12,000 crore loss in Bengaluru: Report||At least 12,000 people have died in Bengaluru as a result of air pollution and related problems and caused economic damages to the tune of Rs12,365 crore in 2020, according to the Greenpeace Southeast Asia Analysis of IQAir data.The report by Greenpeace, a global climate activist group, on Thursday titled 'Greenpeace: Cost to Economy Due to Air Pollution Analysis 2021’ said around 1.2 lakh lives were lost due to air pollution in six Indian cities and that the economic losses on account of bad air amounted to over ₹2 lakh crore.It wasn’t clear how Greenpeace arrived at these numbers or attributed specific deaths to air pollution because these numbers are not tracked by the Union or state governments.Still, beyond the numbers, the report highlights the poor state or the air in major cities in the country, and the consequences.According to the study, there were 54,000 air pollution-related deaths in Delhi, 25,000 in Mumbai, 12,000 in Bengaluru, 11,000 each in Hyderabad and Chennai and around 6,700 in Lucknow.“To show the impact of air pollution-related deaths on the economy, the approach used by Greenpeace is called “willingness-to-pay”, a lost life year or a year lived with a disability is converted to money by the amount that people are willing to pay in order to avoid this negative outcome,” according to the report.But the report does not specify who incurred these costs, experts point out.“When we choose fossil fuel over clean energy, our health is put at stake. Polluted air increases the likelihood of deaths due to cancer and stroke, a spike in asthma attacks and worsens the severity of Covid-19 symptoms,” Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India said in a statement.One of the causes of poor air is construction; another is vehicular pollution.Bengaluru has 9.4 million vehicles in an area of just around 820 square kilometres.“Air quality had improved last year due to the lockdown and our own measures but increased vehicular population, the metro (rail) and other construction, and industrial activity have impacted overall figures,” said a Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) official who asked not to be named.“Though PM10 and PM2.5 pollutants have gone up, other gaseous pollutants are under control,” the official added.PM 2.5 and 10 refer to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 and 10 microns respectively.According to KSPCB, Bengaluru’s Air Quality Index (AQI) has fell from 107.1 in 2014-15 to 88.1 in 2018-19. a reading under 100 is considered satisfactory.The flaws of measuring air quality is pointed out by a former KSPCB official itself.When Metro construction was ongoing near Victoria Hospital near the busy KR Market of Bengaluru, the KSPCB monitors indicated this rise. But when construction was completed in this location, they came to the conclusion that pollution levels had gone down even though there was no effort to monitor hundreds of other areas where metro construction was being carried out in full swing.Experts also point to the “law of averages” as air quality tends to worsen sharply during peak hours and then marginally reduce through other times. Since AQI is calculated over 24 hours, the severity of the problem is diluted.KSPCB’s 41-point action plan includes measures such as pushing for the use of LPG and bio-fuels, promoting battery operated vehicles, and effective disposal of construction debris. It claims these have helped.While the Covid-19 induced lockdown brought some reprieve to the environment, lifting restrictions has ended that.The Work From Home policy adopted by technology companies in Bengaluru has brought down traffic and usage of air conditioning and other appliances in offices to some extent, but dependence on private transport has not helped the situation.Experts also point out that there are only around 20 monitoring stations (both manual and real-time) to capture pollution data in a city that expands to over 820 square km.“In areas such as Whitefield, where most of the pollutants are, due to construction and a concentration of vehicles, the situation has not returned to pre-Covid levels but in other places such as Indiranagar and Koramangala, (the rise in) traffic has brought it (pollution) to almost the same levels,” Madhusudhan Anand. B, CTO & Co-Founder or Ambee, a Bengaluru-based startup that works to find solutions for air pollution said.“In areas that lead to highways outside the city, pollution levels are back at pre-Covid levels,” Anand added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/air-pollution-caused-12-000-deaths-rs-12-000-crore-loss-in-bengaluru-report-101613712811275.html

The rebels will have to sit with BSP MLAs, the speaker told the delegation, said Aslam Raini, rebel BSP MLA from Bhinga assembly seat.During the biennial election to Rajya Sabha in October last year, seven BSP MLAs were suspended after opposing the nomination of party’s candidate Ramji Gautam and meeting Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.

19-02-2021||Patna||Bihar budget session to start today, Speaker appeals for cooperation||The Budget session of the Bihar legislature starting Friday is likely to be stormy despite the Legislative Assembly’s Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha’s appeal at the all-party meeting for cooperation to ensure meaningful debates and discussions.The Budget session will commence with the address of governor Phagu Chouhan to the joint session of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and the Bihar Legislative Council at the central hall of the extended building of the Bihar Vidhan Sabha. On February 22, deputy chief minister Tar Kishore Prasad, who is also the finance minister, will table the Budget for the first time.Also Read | Tejashwi says Nitish trying to project caste-based census as his own idea“In a democracy, people are supreme and send us to the House to serve them. For this, all the parties need to have a positive and constructive approach and allow the House to run smoothly...

It is the second Budget session during the pandemic. The government had said an all-party panel will be formed to examine the allegations of discrepancies in testing, but that did not happen. No action has been taken on serious allegations against testing. Law and order is another big issue,” said Tejashwi Yadav soon after his return from Delhi.Congress MLC Premchandra Mishra said the party would, as always, like the House to run smoothly, but it cannot stop raising uncomfortable questions of public importance. “In a democracy, we will play the role of a constructive Opposition. If law and order has gone completely out of control, the government will have the answer,” he said.CPI(ML) leader Mehboob Alam said the government schemes for the poor were on paper only and this would be raised on the floor of the House.Janata Dal (United) spokesman Neeraj Kumar said the development the state has made over the last 15 years was there for all to see. “The road map for the next five years is also being implemented. A glimpse of that will be visible in the governor’s address. The government will answer all the questions of the Opposition,” he said.Bharatiya Janata Party spokesman Nikhil Anand said the best things would be for the Opposition to take interest in the legislative business. “The government will answer all their questions, but we hope the Opposition will play a constructive role and refrain from misleading the people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-budget-session-to-start-today-speaker-appeals-for-cooperation-101613711387579.html

19-02-2021||Bangalore||'You have to stay strong': 102-year-old freedom fighter's message to Disha Ravi||Harohalli Srinivasaiah Doreswamy was 23-years-old and had joined a new job as a school teacher when he was first arrested and imprisoned for 14 months for organizing strikes against the British government. His second visit to the prison was at the age of 57 when he took on then prime minister Indira Gandhi during the emergency.In an interview with Arun Dev, the 102-year-old draws parallels between the times he has lived through and the present state of affairs in the country. He says that a leader or a movement has always emerged whenever democracy was threatened in the country. He also has a message for 22-year-old activist Disha Ravi, who was recently arrested on charges of sedition in connection with the toolkit case – “you have to stay strong”. Edited excerpts:How do you look at the government using sedition against voices of dissent?Isn’t it clear? Those who do not support or speak up against the government are called traitors. What is even more concerning is that most of them have not been given a trial. Even the British had done the same (registered sedition cases) but when cases were filed against Gandhiji and (Bal Gangadhar) Tilak, they were produced before the court. By not producing them before the court, their (government’s) intention is to harass and create an environment of fear for the others. They want to see people silenced.How old were you when you were arrested during the freedom movement?I was 23-years-old when I was arrested. I had just got a new job as a teacher in a high school then. I started working in June but by then, the Quit India Movement has begun. I helped organise a 14-day strike at the mills across Mysore state and also blew up government record rooms and postboxes with very small time-bombs. Our intention was to disrupt the British government’s daily functioning.By December, I was arrested, and I lost my job as well.Was the jail term a difficult experience?Not at all, it was a learning experience. I had a purpose in life, to fight the British rule. I was not worried at all; in fact, it was like a university for me. The other leaders in jail used to give lectures. I learnt new languages when I was there.You lived through the Emergency also…Oh yes, there was an interesting incident from the time of Emergency. After the Emergency was announced, I wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi (then prime minister), saying she was a dictator. In the letter, I threatened to go village to village and mobilise the people against her dictatorship. Soon after that, I held the first meeting in Gandhi Bazar (in Bengaluru). I was arrested. But I was in jail only for four months.During the trial, the prosecution said that I had criticised the prime minister and that I was an enemy of the state. But that judge who was hearing my case said that I had every right to criticise the government and there is no proof to say that I am an enemy of the state. The judge then told the prosecution to ask the government under what charge should I be booked and released me.I hope our current judiciary will stand up for justice as that judge did then.What are your views on the recent arrest of 21-year-old Disha Ravi by Delhi Police?The police took a woman from Bengaluru to Delhi without informing the local magistrate… it is very harsh on their part. But she has braved it. It is very brave of her.If you could tell her anything, what would you say?You have to be strong. We are facing a dictatorial regime that is merciless, you need to stay strong.There are reports of parents telling their children not to take part in protests in the wake of the arrests of young activists. What are your views on it?You don’t worry about it. Today’s youngsters are smart and wiser. The youngsters of the country have always fought for the right causes. They know what should be done and no one can stop them.As someone who has seen the freedom struggle and emergency, what do you think of our country’s future?Nothing is permanent. There will be ups and downs. During the freedom struggle there was Gandhi, during the emergency there was JP (Jayaprakash Narayan) and then Anna Hazare also came, even though he was misguided later. If not a leader, there will be a movement that takes on what is wrong in our country.I see hope in the farmers’ protests, this has the power to unite people against this dictatorial government. The longer they stay on the streets, the stronger the resistance becomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/we-are-facing-a-dictatorial-regime-disha-has-to-stay-strong-doreswamy-101613708637584.html

Similarly, traffic is affected in areas around outer Delhi’s Singhu and Tikri borders that are also closed because of the agitation. All the six lanes of Delhi-Meerut expressway, NH-24 and NH-9 are closed at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border as the agitating farmers have occupied the roads and the routes are heavily barricaded by the police to stop the farmers from entering Delhi. As a result, traffic between Delhi and Ghaziabad has been diverted to alternate routes, causing increased volume of traffic and jams on them. Delhi Traffic Police have advised motorists travelling between Delhi and Ghaziabad to use EDM Mall, Anand Vihar, Kondli, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra and Loni borders as the alternate routes and avoid the Ghazipur border route. They can also enter Delhi through Noida.

According to the traffic police, Singhu and Tikri borders are completely closed for traffic between Delhi and Haryana. Auchandi border is kept open for traffic only from 6am to 9am and from 6pm to 9pm.

Sixteen high explosive devices with battery detonators, a pistol and live cartridges were recovered from them.The ATS booked them for illegal possession of explosives, firearms and waging war against the country.During interrogation, the two accused revealed that they visited Bangladesh a few months ago to seek Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen’s help for arranging explosives and firearms to trigger terror blasts in India, said an ATS official.

19-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi education department official’s ‘advice’ kicks off a row||Several parents’ groups in the Capital raised objections on Thursday after a video on social media purportedly showed the Delhi government’s director of education asking students at a state-run school to “fill the answer sheets with anything” if they did not know the answers, and that there would be leniency in marking as long as there was something written on paper.The official, Udit Prakash Rai, also appeared to say in the video that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) would give marks even if the students simply copied the questions down instead of attempting to answer them.HT has seen the video but could not independently verify its authenticity. It was also not clear who had recorded it.Read more: Can’t bar kids from e-classes over fees, Delhi govt warns schoolsAccording to Ashok Aggarwal, the national president of the All India Parents Association, the video showed Rai talking to Class 12 students.“I have written to the chief minister on the matter, asking him to take necessary action against the director. It is shocking that the director of education is issuing such instructions to students and asking them to write just anything or copying the questions on the answer sheet. He also said that they have spoken to CBSE on it,” Aggarwal said, adding that the video was shot on Wednesday. He did not, however, specify where the recording was made, who had made it, or how he knew about the details of the video.Despite repeated attempts, Rai did not respond to calls and messages seeking comments.A senior official from education department, requesting anonymity, explained the context of Director's conversation, “The Director’s motive was to assure the students that they should do lot of writing practice and give their best in the exams without worrying about anything. Children need to be motivated at this stage as they are going to take a public exam after a very difficult year. The fear of board exams needed to be taken out of their mind. It seems that specific parts of his conversation have been presented out of context and blown out of proportion.”Read more: Delhi government disburses ₹3.18 crore to construction workers under welfare schemesA CBSE spokesperson said the Delhi education department could “give the context to this specific video”. When asked whether the board had any discussion with the department over marking, CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi said no such discussion had taken place.In the video posted on social media, Rai appears to be telling students: “Do not leave the answer sheet blank. Answer all questions. If you don’t know the answers, copy the questions in the space allotted for answers but don’t leave it blank. Write anything you remember, or can think of, but don’t leave it blank. We have spoken to your teachers and they have said that they will mark you if something is written on the answer sheets. We have also told CBSE that if the child writes anything, they should be marked.”In another video, he appeared to issue corresponding instructions to teachers, asking them to tell students to not leave question papers blank.Aprajita Gautam, the president of the Delhi Parents’ Association, said such instructions would harm the future prospects of children.The Delhi Congress criticised the official’s comments. “What kind of education model is this? Director Udit Prakash Rai is telling children that if they don’t know anything, they should write the questions and that the students would be marked on it. [They said] we have spoken to CBSE and students will be marked. This is playing with the future of children,” it tweeted on Thursday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), too, criticised the comments. Naveen Kumar, media head of Delhi BJP, tweeted in response to the video: “This is the level of education in Delhi,”The government did not comment on the matter.To be sure, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi has been focusing on school education ever since they came to power in 2015. The pass percentage of the first batch of Class 12 students under the AAP government was 85.9% in 2016. It has improved over the years to 88.2% (2017), 90.6% (2018), 94.24% (2019) and 99% in 2020.Last year, as many as 569 students from Delhi government schools passed the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions to medical colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-education-department-official-s-advice-kicks-off-a-row-101613680417960.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||BJP councillor, local office bearer joins AAP||A BJP councillor and a district level office bearer joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday, said AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, even as he accused the BJP of corruption and cited that as a reason for office bearers in Delhi leaving the party ahead of the 2022 municipal polls.The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless”.While the AAP is in charge of the government in Delhi, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations. Later this month, five municipal wards in the city will go polls. Full elections to the three corporations will be held next year.“People in Delhi are fed up with BJP’s corruption. That is also one reason why people who want to work for the people are leaving the party and joining the AAP. They believe that the AAP has a vision and we have proved that through our work in welfare and governance,” said the AAP’s municipal affairs in charge Durgesh Pathak, at a press conference in the party’s office in central Delhi on Thursday.In the conference, Pathak announced the induction of Rekha Dixit, the councillor of Anarkali ward in east Delhi, and Shravan Dixit, who was the BJP’s district general secretary in Shahdara.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These allegations are baseless. If Mr Pathak feels that BJP councillors are corrupt, why is he welcoming them now? Few people who have failed in their duties as councillors and senior office bearers, and have learnt that they are not going to be given tickets for the next polls at any cost, are leaving the party and it is surprising that the AAP is happily welcoming them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-councillor-local-office-bearer-joins-aap-101613680375026.html
19-02-2021||Lucknow||Outrage over girls' death: Villagers don’t let officials bury Unnao victims||Angry relatives and villagers on Thursday refused to let officials bury two Dalit girls found dead in a field in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao district and demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe, as police said a preliminary autopsy found no injuries on the victims and didn’t mention sexual assault.Three Dalit girls, aged 13, 15 and 16, were found unconscious in a field in Unnao late on Wednesday. Two of them died soon after, and the third, the oldest, was in a critical condition in a Kanpur hospital.The Uttar Pradesh Police, under pressure after alleged investigation lapses and forced cremation of a Dalit gang rape victim in Hathras last October, registered a case of murder and concealment of evidence against unknown persons, and picked up six people for questioning. Two of these were male cousins of the victims, and the rest were men from a neighbouring village.Read more: Post-mortem shows no external injury, poisoning suspected: UP Police chief on Unnao shockerThe families of the girls, however, demanded a federal probe, indicating they weren’t satisfied with the initial probe and arrests by UP Police. It was also unclear why a concealment of evidence charge was included in the FIR.“We want a CBI inquiry because our girls were murdered and we are being harassed. We have no enmity with anyone in the area and police should release our two relatives,” said the mother of one of the victims.“We are sure the girls were murdered; it is common in this area,” said the mother of another girl. Local officials and the victims’ families faced off twice during the day.The first was in the morning after police erected barricades at four spots, and brought in earth movers. Hundreds of local villagers confronted officials supervising the digging of graves with JCB machines and said they won’t allow the burial of victims.Watch: Unnao shocker: Two girls found dead in field, third critical l Latest updates“Everyone believed the police were trying to cover up the incident, and came out on the street,” said Shashi Pal, a local villager.Their apprehension was perhaps based on how the UP Police cremated the Hathras victim in the middle of the night against the wishes of her family -- an act the Allahabad high court later described as “violation of human rights”.Late on Thursday, the administration called back the JCB machines, minutes after the bodies of the victims arrived in the village after autopsy.Family members threw themselves before the machine in protest and said they would not allow the burial because it violated local customs. “The burial cannot take place at night. It will happen after my sons return to the house,” said the father of one victim.Police said the post-mortem report couldn’t ascertain the cause of death, and the remains will be sent for forensic analysis. “The doctors found no external or internal injuries on the girls’ bodies. There is no mention of sexual assault in the medical examination reports,” said UP director general of police Hitesh Chandra Awasthi. “We are taking help of forensic experts and looking into all possibilities,” he said.A panel of four doctors confirmed that a substance was found in the victims’ abdomen. This unidentified substance, they said, was smelly and frothy.Watch: ‘Is this Ram Rajya’? Congress attacks PM Modi & CM Yogi over Unnao caseThe report also suggested the girls ate a meal of rice and dal around six hours before they died. “Around 80 to 100 grams of undigested food was found in abdomen. Lab test will determine if the food was poisoned,” said an official aware of developments.Family members said the girls were close friends and left together to bring fodder from a field 1.5km from their house. They bought a packet of chips from a local shop around 3.30pm. It was the last anyone saw them. Their bodies were discovered by the families around 9.30pm.A medical bulletin by the Kanpur hospital said the third girl was in a critical but stable condition. “On primary assessment, she was found in shock, a suspected case of poisoning,” the bulletin read.Authorities said chief minister Yogi Adityanath took “serious note” of the incident and sought a detailed report. He directed officials to ensure proper treatment of the teenager. Awasthi said six police teams were constituted and senior officials were supervising the probe.But the victims’ families protested at the police’s decision to interrogate relatives.A police officer said one cousin was questioned because he was among the first people to locate the body. The second cousin was allegedly unable to explain his absence during a period of four hours on Wednesday.A second police officer also pointed to an alleged contradiction in the statements of the victims’ kin. The brother being questioned said the girls’ hands were tied with a dupatta while the mother of another girl said the dupatta was fastened around their necks. The autopsy report found no injury marks on the neck, hand or legs.Throughout the day, politicians, including from the Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Bharatiya Janata Party and Bhim Army, thronged the village. Opposition leaders blamed the UP government and compared the incident to the gangrape in Hathras.“The UP government is not only crushing Dalit society, but also the honour and human rights of women,” former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted. Congress leader Alka Lamba alleged the UP government was trying to stop the media. Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad demanded that the surviving girl should be airlifted to AIIMS for better treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/outrage-over-girls-death-villagers-don-t-let-officials-bury-unnao-victims-101613679757943.html
19-02-2021||Kolkata||CM Banerjee alleges conspiracy in attack on TMC minister, BJP seeks CBI probe||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said the bomb attack on state minister Jakir Hossain was part of a “conspiracy”, accusing some people of putting “pressure” on him to switch over to another party ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.“It was a planned attack on minister Jakir Hossain. It is a conspiracy. Some people were pressuring Jakir Hossain to join them for the last few months. I don’t want to disclose anything more as investigation is on,” Banerjee told reporters after visiting the SSKM Hospital in Kolkata, where the 50-year-old is undergoing treatment.Though she did not elaborate, the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of carrying out the attack immediately after the incident in Murshidabad district on Wednesday. The BJP said that the incident could be a result of infighting in the TMC.Read more: ‘Aim was to kill him’: Mamata condemns attack on ‘popular’ leader JakirAddressing a rally in South 24-Parganas on Thursday, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation.

At least 26 others were injured in the incident. Of them, 15 were shifted to Kolkata for treatment. Banerjee has handed over the probe to three state-run agencies -- the Crime Investigation Department (CID), Special Task Force and Counter Insurgency Force.On Thursday, she announced a compensation of ₹5 lakh each for those seriously injured and ₹one lakh each for people who received minor injuries.Read more: Bomb attack on West Bengal minister Jakir Hossain part of conspiracy: Mamata Banerjee“How can the railways deny their responsibility over security lapses when the attack happened at a railway station?” she asked. “Those who were with him (Hossain) have claimed that the blast was remotely controlled.

They said the explosives were kept in a bag on the platform and it was a matter of investigation if the bomb was triggered remotely. Referring to a video of the incident, officials said some of the people accompanying the minister had alerted about the bag.“Samples have been collected from the spot for forensic analysis. While a battery was found on the railway tracks, a piece of wire was found at a distance on the platform,” said an official who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cm-banerjee-alleges-conspiracy-in-attack-on-tmc-minister-bjp-seeks-cbi-probe-101613679339238.html

19-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn’s advisory council recycling agendas since 2010||The administrator’s advisory council has been talking about the same issues for more than a decade now.The Hindustan Times examined the agendas and the minutes of meetings of several of the council’s meetings conducted since 2010 and discovered that there was no set format or uniformity for the UT administration to formulate and present the agendas. Also, issues raised in the meetings seldom got to the implementation stage.On certain occasions, several UT departments submitted detailed agendas before the meeting. On other occasions, the administration circulated a detailed agenda including issues dealt by the sub-committees. At times, however, the administration didn’t circulate any agenda among the council members before the meeting, as happened before the latest meeting held on February 10.The demand for a more structured meeting with action-taken reports on previous meetings has gone unheeded for more than a decade now.Members’ advice seldom paid heed toThe council is responsible for advising the UT administration on development issues and policy matters affecting the city. But critics say, its advice is seldom listened to or acted on; advice of the members is sought on the same issues again and again.Council members are the city’s prominent residents including current and former members of parliament, mayor, resident and business associations’ representatives, among others. In addition, all senior UT officials–(adviser, home secretary, finance secretary, deputy commissioner, etc) attend the meetings.Recycled issuesIssues related to traffic congestion, including the mass rapid transport system (MRTS), construction of an outer ring road and another route to the Chandigarh International Airport, have been deliberated upon on several occasions, but with no concrete results came out.For instance, the issue of MRTS came up for discussion the first time in 2010. Thereafter, it has been a regular feature at the council meetings. In the latest meeting too, it was part of the agenda through its sub-committee on transport.Similarly, views of the members have been repeatedly sought on “alternative route to Panchkula”.Another solution to decongest the city’s traffic, a ring road, has been featuring regularly in recent meetings. Improving public transport, particularly last mile connectivity, has been discussed and suggestions given several times in the past.Issues on industry such as conversion of leasehold property to freehold, rationalisation of charges of floor area ratio and collector rates have been brought up time and again, but not much has changed on the ground. For instance, the issue of collector rate rationalisation that came up in the latest meeting was debated over in 2014 as well.Other such recycled issues include extension of the lal dora and regularisation of construction outside it (featuring since 2010), banning of hookah bars in the city, expanding city’s parking infrastructure, shifting of the grain market from Sector 26 to Sector 39, expanding health facilities in residential areas and the Apartment Act.On a few occasions though, the administration has acted on the advice of the members and taken concrete decisions on the ground. For instance, the proposal for a “cattle village” was taken in a 2011 meeting, and after members disagreed to it, the administration took a decision to scrap the plan. Similarly, the issue of dedicated cycle tracks in the city, a regular agenda between 2010-2014, is a reality now.‘Admn should notify action taken’Sanjay Tandon, senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and a regular at the council meetings for more than a decade, said, “It is understandable that policy issues take time to finalise. But on other issues, the administration should decide on merit and stop bringing these issues up repeatedly. They should at least share what happens to recommendations of the sub-committees and members.”Charanjiv Singh, president of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said, “The advisory council is being used not to take decisions but delay them. Discussions take place on the same issues and public demands without any concrete results coming out of them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-s-advisory-council-recycling-agendas-since-2010-101613679944567.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Obscene content case: Sherlyn Chopra moves Bombay HC for pre-arrest bail||Film producer Sherlyn Chopra on Thursday filed a pre-arrest bail application before the Bombay high court (HC) in connection with a case registered against her by Mumbai Police’s cyber cell based on a complaint regarding obscene videos uploaded on internet.The application was filed after the session’s court rejected her application for similar relief on February 8. Chopra claimed she is a victim and the said videos were pirated and uploaded on free-to-view sites by someone else without her permission.After the police gave an oral assurance of not taking coercive action against her, the court posted it for hearing on February 22. A single bench of justice PD Naik while hearing the application filed by Chopra was informed by advocate Charanjeet Chanderpal that the producer apprehended arrest as she could not remain present for interrogation due to personal reasons when she was called by the police in November last year. Chanderpal said the alleged obscene content, which was found on some free-to-view sites, was created by a United Kingdom-based company in which Chopra is a director. He added that the content created by the company was a paid content but someone had pirated it and uploaded the same on the internet without her consent. Chopra was booked on November 6 under section 292 (obscene content) of the Indian Penal Code read with sections 67 and 67A (for transmitting obscene material) of the Information Technology Act, 2008 and sections 3 (prohibition of advertisements containing indecent representation of women) and 4 (Prohibition of publication containing indecent representation of women) of the Indecent Representation of Women (Protection) Act, 1986. While seeking grant of pre-arrest bail, Chanderpal assured the court that his client was willing to cooperate with investigators and produce relevant documents as and when called and added that there was no chance of tampering with the evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obscene-content-case-sherlyn-chopra-moves-bombay-hc-for-pre-arrest-bail-101613679824486.html

Police had provided Gurlal a guard due to some threat perception for a couple of years, but the security cover was withdrawn last year.Police said the accused fired 13 shots at Gurlal and he sustained seven bullets, including two at back of his head and five on stomach and chest. The incident took place barely 200 metres from a police checkpoint. He was rushed to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH), Faridkot, where doctors declared him brought dead.Gurlal, who was a close aide of Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, was appointed district Youth Congress president in 2020.A CCTV camera footage showed Gurlal picking some stuff from his car when two masked men opened fire at him from behind. Gurlal fell on the ground and the assailants fired more shots at him before fleeing the spot. Senior superintendent of police Swarndeep Singh said investigations are on and they have picked a couple of leads. “We are checking CCTV camera footage of the area to identify the accused. As per preliminary investigation, there were two shooters but there is possibility that their accomplices were around. A constable posted in Gurlal’s security was withdrawn as per procedure,” he added.A case was registered under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 302 (murder) and Arms Act against unidentified persons at Faridkot city police station. Congress MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon condemned the crime, adding that he will work to ensure that the rule of law prevailed.‘Bishnoi’ claims responsibilityHours after the murder, a Facebook profile in the name of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi owned responsibility for the killing. “We don’t want to prove anything by posting this, but we don’t want police to bother innocents. I, Bishnoi and Goldy Brar, take responsibility of killing Gurlal Pehalwan in Faridkot. We had warrned Gurlal many times that he should mind his own business and do not work against us. But everyone can’t be made to understand the words and I don’t talk much, so, I had to take this step,” he wrote. HT couldn’t independently establish whether the account actually belongs to Bishnoi. Bishnoi linked the murder with killing of his aide Gurlal Brar in October 2020, who was the former state president of Students Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU). Brar was killed outside a mall in Industrial Area, Chandigarh. Superintendent of police Bhupinder Singh Sidhu said police is investigating all the angles and they will also look into the claim made by the gangster. “This could be an attempt to mislead the investigation, so we are checking everything,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/faridkot-youth-congress-president-shot-dead-101613679703546.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Navy sailor murder case: Palghar cops rule out kidnap theory||The Palghar Police ruled out the kidnap theory in the death of Surajkumar Mithilesh Dubey, a 27-year-old leading seaman of the Indian Navy, who was found in Gholwad jungles with 90% burn injuries in early February, and later died. “We have found that Dubey had stayed at a lodge in Vellore, 60 kilometres from Chennai, and also found his name in the hotel register. He had checked out on February 1 when he was supposed to join INS Agrani in Coimbatore,” said a police officer who is part of the probing team.“In his declaration before death, Dubey had told us that he had been kidnapped from outside Chennai airport on January 30 and taken 1,500km away to Gholwad in Palghar where he was allegedly set on fire by three unidentified men. Now we are probing how he travelled from Vellore to Palghar. It is a challenge for our team to crack the case,” the officer added.Police are currently probing if Dubey had willingly came to Gholwad. While Dubey had claimed that he was kidnapped outside the airport, CCTV footage from the area does not show any such incident. The officer said that Dubey was seen roaming freely after landing in Chennai. “We are also examining Dubey’s DMAT account for share and stock transactions,” he said.Police earlier found that Dubey was in debt to the tune of ₹25 lakh and had invested heavily in shares. He had taken a personal loan of ₹8.43 lakh, borrowed ₹5.75 lakh from his colleague and had received ₹8.5 lakh from his would-be in-laws to invest in the stock market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navy-sailor-murder-case-palghar-cops-rule-out-kidnap-theory-101613679524629.html
19-02-2021||Other||Parts of Mumbai see drizzles, lightning and strong winds||Several parts of suburban Mumbai and its neighbouring areas witnessed light rainfall and strong winds on Thursday evening, as a trough intensified over western Maharashtra. Light to moderate showers were recorded in parts of Andheri, Malad and Dahisar. Strong winds were reported along the western suburbs. Neighbouring areas such as Vashi, Mansarovar and Kamothe in Navi Mumbai also witnessed moderate rainfall along with strong winds. Earlier this week, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorm and lightning, in parts of interior Maharashtra from Wednesday, owing to a cyclonic circulation over north and central Maharashtra. “The cyclonic circulation has intensified and moved westward. It now lies over south central Maharashtra and its neighbourhood at 0.9km above mean sea level. This caused the spell of rainfall and winds in several parts of Mumbai and neighbouring areas,” said Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD, adding that the weather will clear up on Friday. Meanwhile, temperatures in the city remained fairly high. The Santacruz station of IMD, which is indicative of the temperature of Mumbai and the suburbs, recorded a minimum temperature of 20.4 degrees Celsius, which was 2 degrees above normal. The Colaba station, which is representative of south Mumbai, recorded the minimum temperature of 21.5 degrees Celsius, which was a degree above normal. The maximum temperature at Santacruz was 32.7 degrees Celsius – 2 degrees above normal – and 30.8 degrees Celsius at Colaba, which was a degree above normal. The air quality dropped to the poor category from the satisfactory category early this week. An overall air quality index (AQI) of 208 was recorded on Thursday, up from Tuesday’s 98. AQI is a pollution measuring indicator and is calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in and around Mumbai. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Of the 10 locations measured, Andheri and Malad had the worst air quality with an AQI of 313 (very poor), followed by Colaba with an AQI of 297 (poor). “Mumbai’s air quality will be in the moderate category for the next two days owing to the polluted air coming from west India,” said a short-range forecast by SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/parts-of-mumbai-see-drizzles-lightning-and-strong-winds-101613679226524.html

Besides, she and her supporters were booked under Section 8B of the National Highway Act. The case has been registered on the complaint of Jagraon city SHO Gaganpreet Singh. The SHO said he was deployed at DAV College, Jagraon, to ensure a peaceful counting process.Following their defeat in the municipal council elections, the AAP leader and her supporters had left the counting centre at DAV College and staged a protest on National Highway, near Pahalwan Dhaba, leading to inconvenience for commuters. Following this, the leader and her supporters had also carried out a march in Jagraon city area in violation of the guidelines laid down by deputy commissioner and health department in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. They had also violated Section 144 of the CRPC imposed in the area in wake of elections.AAP MLA Saravjit Kaur Manuke said, “Sadly, the government is using police to muzzle voices of dissent. There was a clear violation of the election code of conduct during the counting. When we raised an objection, we were booked. But the people of Punjab are watching this blatant lawlessness and will give Congress a befitting reply in the upcoming elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-dy-oppn-leader-manuke-her-supporters-booked-for-protesting-on-counting-day-101613678744726.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena legislator seeks probe against MMRDA chief for breach of confidentiality||In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday, Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik demanded an inquiry against metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev alleging breach of confidentiality in connection with the money laundering case linked to Rahul Nanda’s security services firm, TopsGrup Security Services Limited (TGSSL) and Sarnaik.Sarnaik alleged that the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) chief shared confidential information with the media after recording his statement with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday. “A senior bureaucrat like RA Rajeev should not take a defensive stand but cooperate and provide the right information,” he wrote, adding, “Disclosing confidential information to the media after interrogation is a breach of confidentiality.” When contacted, Rajeev did not wish to comment on it. Rajeev was summoned by ED on Tuesday, following which he interacted with media. While responding to a question regarding MMRDA reportedly having given a clean chit to TopsGrup and Sarnaik, he said, “Clean chit has not been given.”On Monday, MMRDA, in a statement, had also said that the case pertains to a period between 2014 and 2017 when UPS Madan was the metropolitan commissioner. “As the metropolitan commissioner for that period has retired, the current commissioner, RA Rajeev, will be visiting the ED office on MMRDA’s behalf, though the case pertains to his predecessor’s tenure,” the statement read.Sarnaik pointed to this statement in his letter and said it was wrong to say this as the case pertains to the period of 2014-2017 and 2017-2020. “RA Rajeev has been the commissioner between 2018 and 2020, so he could also have been at fault,” Sarnaik said. He also questioned if MMRDA had undertaken an internal inquiry on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-legislator-seeks-probe-against-mmrda-chief-for-breach-of-confidentiality-101613678624394.html

Now the school has given me a bill of ₹1.35 lakh, adding complete annual charges and development fees. I can’t afford to pay this,” said the man, who asked not to be named.Several parents of students in earlier classes, which have not resumed in-person lessons, also complained of similar action.The father of a class 2 student and a class 8 student at a private school in Nirankari Colony alleged that despite him paying fees till August, the school did not allow his children to appear in the ongoing exams.“I told the school that I lost my job during the lockdown, and the fees submission was delayed. They first removed my children’s names from online classes and barred them from exams despite government orders.”The Delhi government official said private schools could only charge tuition fees from students whose offline classes have not resumed yet. “As per DoE orders, only tuition fees can be charged from such students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cant-bar-kids-from-e-classes-over-fees-delhi-govt-warns-schools-101613677002248.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt-Governor battle is all set to intensify further||The bitter tussle between Governor BS Koshyari and Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government seems to be turning into a political battle. Following Koshyari’s letter to the state legislature secretariat, directing it to hold the election to the post of Assembly speaker, CM Uddhav Thackeray, in his response, is likely to remind the governor that he has not cleared the recommendations to the legislative Council.The ruling parties feel the governor’s letter was uncalled for, while Opposition leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the governor has every right to direct the government to hold elections and even decide the date. “The cabinet will decide when to hold the election and accordingly the governor will be informed. He has reminded us that one post is vacant. We also want to remind him that the spots of 12 legislators are vacant in the upper house. Filling up these seats is also constitutionally important. We wish the announcement or the procedure to fill these vacant seats will be done before the [Budget] session. In the next cabinet, when the date of the speaker election is decided, a decision on what to reply to the governor will be taken,” said parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab.Twelve members of the legislative Council are nominated by the Governor on the recommendations of the state. The recommendations were sent to Raj Bhavan in November, but Koshyari has not taken any decision. This has become a point of friction between Raj Bhavan and the MVA government. Things worsened following Thackeray’s decision last week to deny government aircraft to Koshyari to fly to Uttarakhand.“This is perhaps happening for the first time that the governor has directed the government to hold the election of the speaker. We have forwarded the letter to the state government,” said Narhari Zirwal, deputy speaker, state Assembly. Zirwal is an NCP legislator. Governor Koshyari had sent his letter to legislature secretariat. “Any important position that is vacant should be filled without delay. The position of Assembly speaker cannot be left vacant for a long time. The MVA government also wants to fill it and discussion among senior leaders of the three parties is going on. We want both the things to happen, elections as well as appointment of 12 members in the legislative council. The budget session is starting from March 1 and they (nominees to the 12 posts) should have the right to participate and raise issues related to the field they are representing,” said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.According to the officials from the law and judiciary department, the decision over the date of the election has been taken and a proposal has been sent to Raj Bhavan for approval. “It is a formal approval as the governor works on the advice of the council of ministers. This is happening for the first time that the government has written a letter for the election, though he has not specified the timeline,” he said. The post is vacant after Nana Patole resigned from the post on February 4 and was later appointed as Maharashtra Congress chief. The election to the post of speaker is held by secret ballot leading to the possibility of cross voting from the treasury and opposition benches. Though the three ruling parties enjoy majority with their own strength and support from the smaller parties and independents, the fall in the number registered during the confidence motion, may prove embarrassing for the government. The MVA had won the confidence motion by 169 votes on November 30 in 2019. “ Have the ruling parties lost trust in their members,” asked Fadnavis. “The final decision will be taken in the next Business Advisory Committee to be held on February 25 and will depend upon the intensity of the Covid situation. Though the government has proposed the session to be held for four weeks, it is likely to be curtailed to two weeks. The budget will be presented on March 8,” said an official from the state legislature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-governor-battle-is-all-set-to-intensify-further-101613677964469.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Old Delhi’s bistro-style hang-out||In Paris, you have your cappuccino in front of Notre-Dame. In Delhi, it has recently become possible to enjoy a cappuccino — and not just sweet milky chai — in front of the Jama Masjid.Actually, it’s a side view of the Jama—which offers a very different perspective of the Walled City’s signature monument than the stereotyped appearances encountered in books and movies.Read more: Delhiwale: Vasudev’s worldEbony café opened some days ago and is Old Delhi’s only bistro-style hang out. It’s in the heart of the historic district, and close to its ethos in many ways, and yet far from it. No pretensions here for the glorification of the area’s heritage, like in other local eateries. No black-and-white photos of vintage Chawri Bazar street scenes (which is just a few steps away). The menu doesn’t have paya or nihari, or kachori or jalebi. Instead, it has varieties of pastas, burgers, pizzas and waffles (and even vegan shake). True, some hyperlocalised forms of burgers and pizzas are available in other parts of the Walled City too (the international chain outlets are on the other side, in Daryaganj) but there is no other place around looking as effortlessly modern as this one.Read more: Delhiwale: The sound of musicInside, the place is as uncomfortably cramped as any market alley, but it is the little terrace-like space outside the door, covered by an elegant awning, that gives the café its distinctiveness. It is the kind of shading one would spot in the sidewalk cafes of European cities. The terrace has two tables, and by sitting here one feels as close to the café world of Vienna or Madrid as is possible. You might wonder about the point of spending time in a place so remote from the area’s character, but this uniqueness is refreshing. This evening the sun has set, the little lamps under the awning are aglow and the pigeons are flying about the Jama Masjid dome. A few steps away a bunch of labourers are gathered about huge parcels, some are sitting atop those packages smoking beedis. The terrace is completely exposed to this street life and yet is sheltered, snuggled within a Lakshman Rekha of potted plants. You feel outside and inside simultaneously.Read more: Delhiwale: Paradise in the midst of rosesOne may sit with a novel for hours—so assures the owner, Old Delhi dweller Mohammed Saddam Khan, “as long as there aren’t people waiting for seats.”Soon the great mosque starts streaming out the evening call to the maghrib prayer. Paris merges with Purani Dilli.Tucked in Pai Walan street, close to Jama Masjid’s gate no. 3, the café opens daily from 3pm to midnight. The cappuccino, at ₹90, is as good as it gets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-old-delhi-s-bistro-style-hangout-101613675154304.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Sealing of buildings back in Mumbai amid Maharashtra Covid-19 surge||Buildings in Mumbai that house five or more Covid-19 patients will be sealed, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), reacting to the steady spike in infections across the city and Maharashtra over the past few weeks with a string of measures that brought an uneasy lockdown déjà vu. Mumbaiites who are high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients could face up to six months imprisonment, or a fine of at least ₹200, or even both, if they break their home quarantine, the civic body also ruled.Maharashtra had reported its first case in March 2020, which was followed by strict shutdowns and curbs that were being lifted in a staggered manner only over the past few months. The local train services for all resumed only this month. On Thursday, the civic body decided it will file first information reports (FIR) against homequarantine violators and then send them to mandatory institutional quarantine, under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.According to officials, one such FIR was filed against a resident of Chandivli by the BMC with the Powai police, under sections 188 and 269 of the IPC. A building in Mahim was sealed after five patients were detected there.Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 5,427 cases, first spike in excess of 5,000 in 76 days (since December 4), and 38 deaths, taking the tally to 2,081,520 and toll to 51,669. Mumbai on Thursday recorded 736 new cases and three deaths due to the infection. The total has now gone up to 316,487, and the toll is 11,432. There are 4,782 active cases in the city. Mumbai had on Wednesday recorded 721 new Covid-19 cases, the highest since January 6 (795 new cases).The latest directives were given by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Thursday.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday tested positive for Covid-19. He was admitted to Fortis Hospital in Mulund, officials said. “I have tested positive for coronavirus. Though I am doing fine and following the advice of the doctors... With all your blessings, I will defeat Corona and will be at your services soon. Those who have come in contact in the last few days should take all the precautions and get tested...,” Tope tweeted.This was during a review meeting held via video conferencing with all assistant commissioners, deputy municipal commissioners and additional commissioners. The civic body is also reverting to earlier stringent containment measures. If five or more patients are detected in a building, the BMC will now seal the entire building as a containment zone. All high-risk contacts of patients will be hand-stamped, and BMC Covid-19 war room officials will telephone home-quarantined patients five to six times a day to check if they are at home. Among other measures, BMC will trace at least 15 close contacts per patient, who will go through mandatory home or institutional quarantine; action will be taken against those found in playgrounds and parks without wearing masks; a gathering of more than 50 people at a time will not be allowed at religious places and at weddings. The Mumbai police are now empowered to fine those not wearing masks, in addition to clean-up marshalsChahal on Thursday confirmed that FIRs will be lodged against citizens who break home-quarantine rules. The municipal commissioner also issued a circular and said, “It has been observed that after the ‘Mission Begin Again’ [a staggered plan to lift curbs] was launched, many citizens are stepping out of their homes and roaming in public places without wearing masks, which is not only unsafe for them, but also for fellow citizens.”The circular reiterated that is compulsory to wear masks while using public transport, commuting in public places such as streets, footpaths, markets, shopping centres, malls, restaurants, gymnasiums, offices, clinics and hospital premises. It is compulsory to wear masks at wedding ceremonies, religious places of worship. The circular also rapped government officers, saying no one will be allowed to attend meetings or enter institutional premises without wearing a mask.BMC will now conduct regular inspections at marriage halls and wedding ceremonies. Surprise inspections will take place in at least five such places every day. If any persons are found to be violating rules according to the act, criminal action will be taken against the management of the premises, and organisers (parents, family members) of the wedding.There are presently 2,400 clean-up marshals in Mumbai, who will fine those not wearing masks and spitting in public places. This number will be doubled to 4,800 marshals. The target given to the marshals to take action against citizens has also been doubled from the current average of 12,500 citizens to 25,000 per day. Marshals will patrol the city at night as well, and 300 marshals will travel in local trains to fine those not wearing masks during their commute. Those not wearing masks will be punished under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, and fined Rs200.Every ward will now have at least one CCC1 and CCC2 centres for quarantine of high-risk contacts and asymptomatic patients. BMC will also map areas where a high number of cases are being detected, to maximise testing in these areas. So far, BMC has conducted 3,080,528 tests since March.Travelers from Brazil will also to be sent to mandatory institutional-quarantine facilities. So far, travellers from UK, Europe, Middle East and South Africa are sent to mandatory institutional quarantine facilities.On Tuesday, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar had warned the city of another lockdown if citizens did not follow Covid-19 rules.Meanwhile, an order issued by Yavatmal collector M Devender Singh stated that not more five people shall be gathered at a time in the district as well as in city areas. Not more than 50 people can attend all large gatherings for religious processions, festivals and any other purposes. The collector has banned all processions and rallies and also restricted the number of people to 20 for attending last rites of a deceased. It has restricted timings of shops and markets till 8pm at night and hotels and restaurants till 9.30pm. All schools and colleges will remain closed till February 28. Educational institutions can continue studies through online classes. “Those not using masks at public places will be fined ₹500 for the first time, ₹750 for second time offence and a fine of ₹1,000 and a criminal case for repeated offence will be registered after that, stated the order. All the restrictions will be enforced Friday midnight (February 19 midnight).In Akola, complete lockdown will be imposed between 8pm on Saturday and 6am on Monday morning. It means no one will be allowed to move freely anywhere in the district except medical services, wholesale milk and vegetable supplies, auto rickshaw for travellers coming through railways and bus services, highways and dhabas at highways etc.. The district collector Jitendra Papalkar has also decided to impose night curfew between 8pm and 6am, which means not more than five people can gather at a place. Not more than 50 people can attend wedding ceremonies, if violated they will be fined the management will have to pay ₹10,000 as penalty besides ₹200 will be fined against each person other than 50 people, states the order. The district collector has restricted timings of shops, markets, hotels, restaurants, theatres etc. till 8pm at night. All schools and colleges will remain closed till February 28. All the restrictions will be enforced from Thursday till further onwards.ABOUT THE FIROne such FIR against a woman for violating home-quarantine rules was filed by the L-ward on Thursday, with jurisdiction over areas such as Kurla. A senior civic officer said, “She was a high-risk contact of a patient as her neighbour had tested positive for Covid-19. When ward officers called to check if she was at home, she did not respond. So BMC staff visited her home and found she was not home, and that her house help takes her dog for a walk twice a day, daily. An FIR has been filed against her with the Powai police station.” The FIR was filed as per provisions of the Epidemic Diseases act 1897, under sections 188 and 269 of the Indian Penal code. While section 188 prescribes punishment with imprisonment up to a month, or a fine of ₹200, or both, section 269 prescribes imprisonment up to six months, or a fine, or both.BMC’s G/North ward, corresponding to areas of Dadar, Mahim, and Dharavi, on Thursday sealed one building in Mahim, after five patients, all belonging to one family, were detected. The building has seven floors, of which the second floor houses the residence of the patients. The third, fourth, and fifth floors are commercial floors, and the sixth and seventh are residential floors. The first floor is vacant.(with inputs from Faisal Malik)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sealing-of-buildings-back-in-mumbai-amid-maharashtra-covid-19-surge-101613677371923.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||5.5km of Metro Phase-4 line may traverse Ridge, documents show||A section of the Ridge, known as Delhi’s green lung, may be compromised for the construction of a section of the Delhi Metro’s Aerocity-Tughlakabad corridor under the Phase-4 expansion plan, shows permission requests and letter exchanged between the Metro corporation and the city’s forest department.Documents accessed by Hindustan Times show that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has sought permission from the forest department to take up 50,875sqm of Ridge land for permanent and temporary use.Permission requests have also shown that at least 695 trees in the Ridge area will be affected by the Metro construction work.In a request sent to the forest department in 2019, DMRC said 5.55km of the proposed 23.62km corridor is in the Ridge, of which 20,083sqm was in Mahipalpur (Ridge area), 16,992 sqm near Indira Gandhi National Open University (morphological Ridge, a part of the Ridge that has ‘ridge-like features’ but is not part of the notified forests), 11,600sqm in Anandmayee Marg (Southern Ridge) and another 2,200sqm also in the Southern Ridge.Read more: Delhi Metro to go contactless as DMRC pushes for QR code, RuPay-based ticketingOf the total 50,875sqm of Ridge land for which DMRC has sought permission, 8,005sqm will be used to build permanent structures, while the remaining 42,870sqm will be used temporarily for construction work and will be returned to the forest department after work completion, the documents read.In another letter to the member secretary of the Ridge Management Board (RMB) in March 2020, the DMRC mentioned the total Ridge area required was 82,426sqm, of which 14,324sqm was to be kept permanently for entry/exits, ancillary buildings and shafts, etc, while the remaining 68,102sqm will be restored after project completion.Unlike constructions at a public place, entry into the Ridge requires the construction agency to seek approval not only from the city forest department but also from the RMB.Documents show that the forest department has also asked the DMRC to identify “an equivalent parcel of non-forest land, which can be earmarked for compensatory afforestation in lieu of diversion of forest land as per norms of Forest Conservation Act (1980)”.Read more: 'Metro man' E Sreedharan set to join Bharatiya Janata PartyIn an e-mail response to HT’s queries, DMRC said it has identified the land for compensatory plantation as directed by the forest department.Details of the Aerocity-Tughlakabad corridor show that at Mahipalpur, the alignment of the Metro corridor crosses through the southern Ridge for around 1,382 metres and through the morphological Ridge for 818 metres. At Kishangarh, the corridor will pass through 1,491 metres of the south-central Ridge and through 301 metres of the morphological Ridge.In a letter to the ridge board, the DMRC stated that the location of the station at Kishangarh was chosen to “serve commuters from Kishangarh, Shanti Kunj, Bhawani Kunj and Vasant Kunj sectors A and D”.The DMRC said they have “made all possible efforts to use only a minimum portion of the Ridge area”.“As a responsible organisation which has taken a number of measures to preserve the environment, DMRC is extremely conscious of its responsibilities,” DMRC said in their response.“However, it may be appreciated that the Ridge covers vast areas of south Delhi through which this alignment is planned and it would have been absolutely impossible to cater to the large population there without passing through the Ridge area. Also, only bare minimum land area in Ridge shall be used,” the DMRC said in its email.Read more: DMRC commissions 10 new escalatorsIt also confirmed that they are yet to receive the permissions they have asked for.Delhi L-G constituted the RMB in 1995 on the directions of the Supreme Court to protect the Ridge area from encroachment and non-forest activities. The apex court called for the protection of the Ridge as the “green lungs” of the city.Director of environmental NGO Toxics Links, Ravi Agarwal, who was also a former independent member of RMB, said, “Infrastructure in a growing city is only going to increase but how do you conserve and protect something like the Ridge, which is the only remaining green space for Delhi. There are always ways to divert alignments around the green belts, it has been done in the past. We had asked the Metro to go underground during the Airport Express Line construction and also told them to divert their alignment while their line was crossing Chattarpur.”Currently, a fully constituted RMB does not exist. It is yet to appoint two independent experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/55km-of-metro-phase-4-line-may-traverse-ridge-documents-show-101613675819487.html
19-02-2021||Other||Odisha: 16 held for stir against coal trucks emitting smoke||Sixteen tribal activists and villagers of Sundargarh district are in jail for the past 4 days for allegedly protesting against the expansion of a mines operated by state-owned Mahanadi Coalfields Limited that is allegedly causing massive pollution near their villages.On January 19 this year, around 5,000 people from 45 villages of Hemagir block of Sundargarh district started their peaceful protest against pollution from the trucks carrying coal from Kulda Open Cast Mine and Basundhara open cast mines to an unit of Jindal Steel and Power Limited in Chhatisgarh's Raigarh, 41 km away. The villagers, most of them Hill khadia, Bhuyan and Gond tribals, started a blockade to stop the trucks from Sundargarh travel to Chhatisgarh."It is impossible for most villagers in the area to not beathe the air laced with coal and flyash. The paddyfields are covered with a layer of coal dust," said a tribal villager requesting anonymity.A villager of Hemagir block said on February 14, police came and arrested Rajendra Naik, a tribal leader of Jana Shakti Vikash Parishad and 15 others on charges of murder, criminal intimidation among other charges. “Since January 19, around 200 people would gather at Taparia and block the way of the trucks headed for Chhattisgarh. Even at night, about 150 people continued the blockade. We had no other way as the trucks carrying coal leave behind a trail black dust on schools, hostels, houses as well as farmlands. Now police said if we do not stop agitating then many more would be arrested," the villager said.However, inspector of Hemagir police station, Ramakanta Sai said 16 persons were arrested after a truckdriver lodged a complaint that the activists tried to strangle him and beat him up. "The truckdriver was beaten up by the people who were opposing the transportaion of coal. In his complaint, the truckdriver alleged that there was an attempt to murder him. As per his complaint, we made the arrests," said Sai.Locals said the the ministry of environment and forest's expert appraisal committee recently had recommended environmental clearance for expanding the capacity of the Kulda opencast coal mine by 20%, despite popular opposition over the project’s impact on their health, agriculture and water bodies.The expansion would lead to increase of Kulda opencast mine's capacity from the current 14 million tonnes per annum to 19.60 MTPA. The clearance was recommended on condition that Mahanadi Coalfields Limited which is the owner of the mine, will plant 100,000 trees with broad leaves along the villages and 50,000 trees along the transportation route in two years to prevent air pollution. MCL, in its compliance reports, said that it had avoided transporting coal through any village.The agitating villagers however said MCL had lied in its compliance report. "Around 3,000 trucks pass through the 45 villages every day, leaving a trail of black dust. This month we had filed a complaint with the Odisha Human Rights Commission detailing the impacts of pollution from the coaldust after which the OHRC recommended that coal transporting vehicles should not be allowed to ply until the district administration reports on the action it has taken in the matter," said an activist.The Kulda mines was initially allowed to mine 10 MTPA. In 2018, it was allowed to scale up the mining to 14 MTPA. After the recommendation of the EAC of the Ministry of Environment and Forests the capacity was increased from 14 to 16.8 MTPA.Many of the activists on the ground said that they are scared of the police arrest, but would not stop the agitation. “We want a special corridor for coal transport so that our villages are spared of the coal dust. The coast dust has polluted out agricultural fields and water bodies," said an activist.However, Sundargarh sub-collector Abhimanyu Behera said he was aware of the pollution caused by the trucks and a new corridor would be built at a cost of ₹146 crore. "The construction of the corridor would soon start. But till the new road is made the villagers should not try to blcok the trucks. We have ordered MCL to transport the coal by covering with tarpaulins," said the sub-collector.Environmental activists said Odisha government's arrest of the 16 activists in Sundargarh was another example of stifling popular opposition. "Starting from Niyamgiri to Posco, the state government has not shied away from putting activists behind bars if they dare to oppose its industrialisation dreams. The government should release the activists and take steps in controlling the pollution due to coal transportation," said activist Prafulla Samantra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-16-held-for-stir-against-coal-trucks-emitting-smoke-101613674906853.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra crosses 5,000 Covid cases after 76 days, strict measures imposed||After a gap of 76 days, Maharashtra crossed 5,000-mark of Covid-19 cases and lockdown restrictions returned in Yavatmal, Akola and Amravati districts, which accounted for almost 20% of the state’s tally. On Thursday, the state recorded 5,427 new cases of Covid-19, taking the count to 2,081,520. The number of active cases is 40,858, following 2,543 reported recoveries in the last 24 hours. Thursday’s figures are the highest since December 4, when the state had reported 5,229 cases. The Covid death toll rose to 51,669, with 38 casualties reported on Thursday. Of these, 17 occurred in the last 48 hours and 10 in the last week. The remaining 11 deaths are from before last week, officials said. State health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas on Thursday directed all district collectors and municipal commissioners to strictly implement Covid protocol; limit the number of people at gatherings; increase testing; and ensure at least 20-30 contacts are traced for each Covid-positive patient. Vyas has also instructed that the number of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests be increased by 20 times in areas with spikes in new cases and medical centres should alert local authorities if they come across suspected Covid-19 patients. Furthermore, areas like public toilets, bus depots and railway stations should be disinfected regularly. Following the spike in Covid-19 numbers, authorities in Yavatmal, Akola and Amravati have imposed either partial lockdown or strict restrictions such as night curfews in their jurisdictions. From midnight today, Yavatmal district will have night curfews and gatherings of more than five are not allowed. Amravati district will observe complete lockdown once a week, on Sunday. Akola administration has also decided to enforce lockdowns on Sundays and night curfew. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar has ordered the district collectors of Yavatmal, Amravati and Akola districts to declare the most affected areas as containment zones. These are Amravati municipal corporation area and Achalpur tehsil in Amravati district; Yavatmal, Pusad and Pandharkwada municipal council in Yavatmal district; and Akot, Murtizapur tehsils and the area under Akola municipal corporation. “Detailed orders regarding permissible and non-permissible activities as well as all requisite precautionary measures in the said zones may be issued by you immediately,” said Kumar in his order. On Thursday, these three districts accounted for more than 1,000 cases, with 733 cases Amravati; 212 in Akola; and 131 in Yavatmal. State transport minister Anil Parab said chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has given powers to district authorities to take preventive measures in order to control the spread. “Covid-19 cases are rising in Akola, Amravati and Yavatmal. The chief minister has given all the powers to local authorities to bring the situation under control. They can also impose lockdown if required,” Parab told reporters on Thursday. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the number of cases were rising because the general public was not taking the necessary precautions. “The Central government also removed restrictions related to theatres and others; and the state also allowed local train services and state transport bus services, which cannot remain suspended for a very long time. Consequently, cases started rising,” said Pawar on Thursday. “If you see Amravati, the number of daily positive patients has reached close to Mumbai’s figures. It means things are getting serious there and we will have to make strict decisions to contain the spread,” he added. The order issued by Yavatmal collector M Devender Singh states that not more than five people can gather at a time in the district as well as city areas. Large gatherings for religious, festivals and any other purposes have been restricted to not more than 50 people. The collector has also banned all processions and rallies. The limit for attending last rites of a deceased is 20. Timings of shops and markets has also been restricted till 8pm at night while hotels and restaurants are allowed to operate till 9.30pm. Schools and colleges will remain close till February 28 and continue studies through online classes. “Those not using masks at public places will be fined ₹500 for the first time, ₹750 for second time offence and a fine of ₹1,000 and a criminal case for repeated offence will be registered after that,” states the order. All the restrictions will be enforced till Friday midnight.In Akola, complete lockdown will be imposed between 8pm on Saturday to 6am on Monday. During this period, no one will be allowed to move freely in the district except for medical services, wholesale milk and vegetable supplies, auto rickshaw for travellers coming through railways and bus services, highways and dhabas at highways etc. District collector Jitendra Papalkar has also decided to impose night curfew between 8pm and 6am. Not more than 50 people can attend wedding ceremonies, and in case of violation, they will be fined and the management will have to pay ₹10,000 as penalty in addition to ₹200 against each person other than 50 people, states the order. The district collector has restricted timings of shops, markets, hotels, restaurants, theatres etc till 8pm. All schools and colleges will remain close till February 28. District administrations in Nagpur, Buldhana, Parbhani and Jalna have either restricted gatherings to less than five people or have started to strictly implement the government’s standard operating procedure (SOP). Meanwhile, the vaccination drive saw 48,006 people get inoculated on Thursday. Of them, 40,931 were given the first shot of the vaccine while 7,075 were administered the second shot. Since January 16, when the vaccination drive began, 830,345 have received the vaccine, with 591,758 healthcare workers (HCWs) having got the first shot and 23,732 HCWs having got both shots. So far, 214,855 frontline workers (FLWs) have received the first shot, according to the state health department. Maharashtra has around 800,000 HCWs and 580,000 FLWs registered on the centralised CoWIN app. Meanwhile, the state task force formed for clinical management of critical patients has also made several recommendations to the state. Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state-appointed task force, said contact tracing should be increased to 18 to 20 people against each positive patient and those violating Covid-19 guidelines should be penalised. The task force also reviewed the protocols for clinical management of patients so that hospitals in the state are prepared in case of a surge in patients needing treatment in intensive care units (ICU). “We are in the process of preparing video capsules which would be available to anyone across the state for complete Covid management from asymptomatic patients to ICUs. The videos will have detailed information on how to approach a patient symptomatic or asymptomatic, their line of treatment and all the other details,” said Dr Pandit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-crosses-5-000-covid-cases-after-76-days-strict-measures-imposed-101613674784270.html

19-02-2021||Mumbai||Domestic ait traffic sees month-on-month increase since October||While reeling from the impact of the lockdown, domestic air travel has recorded an upward trend since October, with a month-on-month increase in the number of passengers. According to the January traffic report released by civil aviation regulator Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Thursday, 7.7 million passengers flew last month to destinations across the country. During the lockdown, India’s domestic passenger traffic slipped to a seven-year low in 2020. After commercial passenger flights resumed operations with restricted capacity on local routes, traffic increased from 45% between June and September last year to 80% in October 2020. DGCA’s report shows the number of fliers has progressively increased from 5.2 million in October 2020, to 6.3 million in November 2020 and 7.3 million in December 2020. However, the impact of Covid-19 pandemic continues to be felt by domestic air travel. “Passengers carried by domestic airlines during January 2021were 7.7 million against 12.7 million during the corresponding period of previous year (January 2020), thereby registering annual growth of -39.60 per cent,” read DGCA’s report. According to DGCA, the load factor of IndiGo, SpiceJet, GoAir, Air India, Vistara and AirAsia India was between 70% and 64.9% in January. Indigo flew the maximum number of passengers (4.2 million) followed by full-service carrier Vistara (0.9 million). IndiGo also recorded the highest on-time performance (OTP) in January with an average 93.7% of its flights from four metro airports (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad). The budget carrier’s OTP was followed by Vistara and Air Asia. CS Subbiah, former chief executive officer or Alliance Air, said, “Domestic traffic will not be able to go back to pre-Covid levels firstly, because domestic traffic also has an international component. Many passengers land into Delhi or Mumbai, and then travel towards their destinations taking domestic flights.” Subbiah said the international component in domestic air travel accounts for around 20%. “Currently we are operating maximum 100 flights under the government’s scheme, which is way below the original international flight numbers,” he said. “Not only Air India, but also foreign carriers who have tie-ups with domestic airlines are severely affected.” Subbiah said he didn’t anticipate the demand for air travel reaching pre-Covid levels until the latter half of this year. “It will only be around October when the vaccination drive would have reached around 40% and when international travel would have slowly resumed along with overall relaxed rules, that traffic might touch pre-Covid levels. However, yields will remain poor. They will start getting better only by 2022 summer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/domestic-ait-traffic-sees-month-on-month-increase-since-october-101613674424598.html
19-02-2021||Other||Telangana: 3 held for murder of Advocate couple||The Telangana police on Thursday arrested three persons, who allegedly hacked to death an advocate couple – Gattu Vaman Rao (53) and his wife P V Nagamani (50) – in broad daylight in Peddapalli district on Wednesday afternoon.The arrested included: Kunta Srinu (44), whose name was mentioned by Vaman Rao minutes before he succumbed and his associates Shivandula Chiranjeevi (35) and Akkapaka Kumar (44).Ramagundam commissioner of police V Satyanarayana told reporters in the evening that six special taskforce teams were constituted soon after the murder, to launch a manhunt for the killers.“This morning, we got a specific information that Kunta Srinu and Chiranjeevi were travelling in their car at Vankidi Chandrapur area on the borders of Telangana and Maharashtra. Our taskforce teams intercepted them and took them into custody,” he said.At the same time, the third accused Kumar was arrested near Manthani. All the accused were produced before additional commissioner of police, Godavarikhani, the commissioner said.He said the police had booked a case against the accused under Section 302 (murder), 341 (wrongful restraining) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy). “We shall produce them before the court on Friday,” Satyanarayana said.The police commissioner said Vaman Rao and Nagamani were returning from Manthani to Hyderabad after attending a court case. Kumar had tracked the movement of the couple and informed Kunta Srinu and Chiranjeevi, who followed them in another vehicle.“As Vaman Rao and Nagamani reached Kalvacharla village of Ramagiri block at around 2.30 pm, Kunta Srinu and Chiranjeevi waylaid them and started attacking them indiscriminately. While Satish, driver of Vaman Rao’s vehicle, jumped out to save his life, the two accused brutally assaulted the couple with sickles used to cut coconuts and fled the spot in their vehicle. The coupled died while undergoing treatment in the government hospital at Peddapalli,” the commissioner said.He said both Vaman Rao and Kunta Srinu belonged to the same village Gunjapadugu. Since Vaman Rao was filing cases against Srinu’s alleged illegal activities in the courts, the latter developed grouse against the former. The rivalry reached a flashpoint over the construction of a temple in the village and that led to the murder, the police official said.Satyanarayana said Kunta Srinu had a criminal background. “In the past, he was associated with Singareni Karmika Samakhya, a Naxalite outfit but later surrendered to the police. He entered politics later,” he said, adding that investigation was still on.Soon after the arrest of Kunta Srinu, the TRS issued a statement expelling him from the party.In the morning, the Telangana high court took suo motu cognizance of the Wednesday’s murder of an advocate couple in broad day light on the main road in Peddapalli district and directed that the state government submit a comprehensive report on the incident by March 1.A division bench headed by chief justice Hima Kohli also served notices on director general of police M Mahender Reddy seeking to submit all the evidences gathered from the scene of offence to the court.The high court directed that the police obtain the details of passengers travelling in two buses which were passing by the scene of offence and make them witnesses. “Several videos are doing rounds in the social media and they, too, should be preserved as evidences,” the court said.Meanwhile, lawyers belonging to various courts in Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana boycotted their duties on Thursday and staged demonstrations demanding stringent action against the accused.Several advocates of the Nampally criminal courts complex were taken into custody by the police, when they tried to take out a rally up to Raj Bhavan demanding safety and security to the practising advocates. They were taken to Begumpet police station and let-off later.Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy demanded that the state government hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation, since the people had lost faith on the state police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/telangana-3-held-for-murder-of-advocate-couple-101613674281256.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Some colleges start practical classes, others unsure as Covid-19 cases rise||City colleges that were preparing for partial reopening are now unsure of doing so, following a rise in the number of reported cases of Covid-19. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is yet to announce Covid-19 protocol for colleges to reopen. Meanwhile, some colleges have reopened partially for final-year students. “Our students are worried about not understanding important practical concepts online, so with the consent of their parents, we have started allowing not more than 15-20 students to our laboratories on a single day, for practical sessions,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of Kishinchand Chellaram College in Churchgate. “Exams will be conducted soon and our students were worried about not being prepared. We have also scheduled preliminary examination for students starting March 3 and only those who wish to appear for the exams offline will be encouraged to do so while the rest appear for the prelims online,” said Bagla. Other colleges are cautious about reopening in view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases. Raju Shinde, principal of St Xavier’s College in Dhobi Talao, said the Covid-19 figures raised doubts about reopening. There was confusion last week when the University of Mumbai (MU) first directed affiliated colleges to reopen on February 22 and then issued another circular that said colleges in Mumbai city and suburbs would remain closed until further direction from local civic authorities. “With the government going back and forth, we are left confused. Our students are waiting for their practical classes to begin,” said Kishore Peshori, principal, Smt MMK College of Commerce and Economics, in Bandra. Students said the uncertainty was adding to their anxiety. “At least give us a clear picture instead of announcing dates, only to withdraw it. Our practical classes have been deferred for too long,” said Akshata, a third-year student from Sathaye College in Goregaon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-some-colleges-start-practical-classes-others-unsure-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101613674185012.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Some Mumbai schools call students sans nod from civic body||While the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is yet to announce the Covid-19 protocol for schools in the city to reopen for offline learning, many schools have started calling small groups of students, particularly those from higher classes, to attend classes on school premises. BMC has allowed schools under consulates and embassies in Mumbai to reopen since January 18, but it is yet to announce any dates for other city schools. Earlier this week, HT had reported that city schools and parents of student had taken to social media to request BMC to allow schools to open at least partially for the benefit of students who will give board exams this year. Over the past few days, schools have started calling in students in small groups. A school in Kandivli, for instance, gave parents of Class 9 students the option of taking their exams online or offline. A school in Chembur called students in groups of 10-20, across grades, to attend special doubt-solving lectures. “It has been 10 months since schools are operating online and children are really missing out on the personal element of teaching. We know there are a lot of risks associated with offline learning, but we are following all safety protocols and only calling the weak students as we fear they will fail if we do not teach them offline,” said a teacher from the school. Despite calls and messages, BMC officials did not respond.On February 1, HT had reported that schools and junior colleges were trying different initiatives to teach students of Class 10 and 12 since the board exams will be held in April-May. Some schools have conducted teaching sessions in public gardens while others have called students to community halls or playgrounds in schools. Rajesh Pandya, a teacher and the vice-president of the Teachers Democratic Front, said the state needs to address the issue of learning loss among students in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. “Students from these areas are losing out on offline learning and they will not get enough time and training to prepare for their board exams. There needs to be some consideration for such students,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/some-mumbai-schools-call-students-sans-nod-from-civic-body-101613674064109.html
19-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra gets Bombay HC relief over cooperative society poll||In a relief to Maharashtra government which had extended the term of managing committees of cooperative societies as elections could not be held due to Covid-19 pandemic, the Bombay high court (HC) has dismissed a petition challenging the state government’s decision. The petition has sought appointment of administrators to oversee functioning of cooperative societies till elections can take place.The court held that as the government’s decision did not affect the statutory and legal rights of the petitioner, his prayers could not granted, and dismissed the petition. The division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht, while hearing the petition filed by Arun Kulkarni, was informed by advocate Satish Talekar that the government’s June 2020 decision which was followed by an ordinance on July 10, 2020 permitting extension of tenure of managing committees of cooperative societies was constitutionally not valid and hence should be set aside. Talekar in earlier hearings had submitted that there were around 35,000 cooperative societies in the state which included cooperative sugar factories, cooperative ginning mills, district central cooperative banks and multipurpose cooperative credit societies. He said that as the term of the managing committees in most societies had ended in January 2020, elections were inevitable but the state through concerned departments extended the tenure of the lapsed committees. Talekar submitted that this extension and the second extension due to the pandemic in June 2020 were not as per the mandate of the Cooperative Societies Act, and the fact that the state had made an amendment to the Act through an ordinance to justify its extension order was ultra vires of the Constitution of India. Kulkarni, through his petition, sought appointment of administrators or committee of administrators to take care of the affairs of cooperatives which was mandated in the pre-amended Act till elections for the managing committees could be conducted. However, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, for the state, opposed the petition on the grounds that the writ petition was not maintainable as it was canvassing a public cause and as the petitioner had failed to show any personal loss suffered by him due to the extension or ordinance, the same could not be entertained. Kumbhakoni further submitted that the Aurangabad bench of the HC had earlier rejected a petition which had challenged the January 2020 extension and the petitioner had failed to inform the court of the same. After hearing the submissions, the court said, “There is abysmal failure on the part of the petitioner to exhibit existence of legal grievance which needs to be appreciated and allayed by invoking the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.” The court dismissed the petition and said, “It is evident that petitioner has no legal peg for a justiciable claim to hang on. Therefore, he is not a ‘person aggrieved’ and has no locus standi to challenge the constitutional validity of impugned Ordinances and Order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-gets-bombay-hc-relief-over-cooperative-society-poll-101613673824921.html

One litre of diesel was priced at ₹87.32 in Mumbai whereas one litre of petrol cost ₹96.32. Both the fuel prices are all-time high. Petrol price crossed ₹96 in the city on Wednesday and diesel was priced at ₹86.98 for one litre. Transporters said that due to the constant increase in diesel prices, small transport businesses are being impacted and many are shut. “Many small transport businesses across the country are impacted due to the continuous increase in diesel prices. Small transport operators deal on a daily basis, and thus the constant fuel increase in a major concern,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC). On Tuesday, one litre of petrol was priced at ₹95.75 in the city whereas diesel cost ₹86.72. On Monday, one litre of petrol was available for ₹95.46 and diesel ₹86.34.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/diesel-costs-87-for-a-litre-petrol-at-96-32-in-mumbai-101613673464778.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro: 3 new automated motor driving test tracks in three months||Three more automated motor driving test tracks – in Dwarka, Jharoda and Lado Sarai – are likely to be operational in Delhi in the next three months, said a senior government official on Thursday.“The automated tracks in Dwarka and Jharoda are ready and should be operational in another month. In less than three months, the one is Lado Sarai should also be functional. The fourth one in Hari Nagar will take some time,” said the senior official in the transport department, who did not wish to be identified.Another government official said, “Last month, the government floated a tender for constructing a building in Lado Sarai to shift the present transport office in Vasant Vihar there. It essentially means, even though the automated track in Lado Sarai should soon get functional for tests, applicants would still have to visit the Vasant Vihar centre for paperwork until the new building in Lado Sarai is ready. This centre would cater to applicants from south Delhi localities such as Munirka, Vasant Vihar, Vasant Kunj and RK Puram.”Read more: Delhi Metro to go contactless as DMRC pushes for QR code, RuPay-based ticketingDelhi currently has nine automated driving test tracks. The first one was launched at Sarai Kale Khan in February 2018. The next few came up at Mayur Vihar I, Surajmal Vihar, Shakur Basti and Burari.“Work on the four tracks in Dwarka, Jharoda, Lado Sarai and Hari Nagar were supposed to be completed by mid-2020 but got delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, even though things are normal, applications are less. But the numbers are likely to increase soon,” said the second official.Tests on automated tracks are much more stringent. Unlike conventional tests, in which drivers have to drive on a track amid traffic in the presence of a motor vehicle inspector, the automated tracks simulate tougher driving conditions.Read more: DMRC commissions 10 new escalatorsThe tests are monitored by sensor-based cameras, the video is live-streamed in a control room at the spot and evaluation is done by a computer software. The result is generated after taking into consideration instances of the total time taken, unscheduled stops, the number of times the applicant hit a kerb or goes off track. Any driver who scores below 70% has to reappear for the test after a certain time.“The process is much more accurate. In the centres that have so far converted to automated tracks, the percentage of people failing the driving tests has gone up from 15%-20% to roughly 45%-50%. The process has a few flaws, such as the cameras acting over-sensitive at times especially on evaluation of the reverse-S test and parallel parking. But such issues can be tackled by adjusting error margins,” said a motor licensing official, at one of the centres with automated tracks, who did not wish to be identified.For four-wheelers, the test involves parallel parking, and driving through up-gradient, forward-8, reverse-S and traffic junctions. For two-wheelers, it is a serpentine track and there is the focus on emergency braking skills.KK Kapila, chairperson of the International Road Federation (IRF), a global body working for better and safer roads, said: “Automated driving test tracks and the evaluation process is stringent, no doubt, but it is also scientific. It is capable of ensuring that only people with decent skills and knowledge get a licence to drive. Also, by reducing human intervention in the process, it reduces room for corruption and the tout culture in regional transport offices. This technology should be adopted by all states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-new-automated-motor-driving-test-tracks-in-three-months-101613672204365.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||₹1cr cheques to families of two more front-line workers who died of Covid||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday provided financial assistance of ₹1 crore to the families of two more Covid front-line workers, who had died of the disease after contracting it in the line of duty. With this, the total number of families to have received the compensation is now 39.As part of another scheme being run by the Delhi government, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday provided financial assistance amounting to ₹3.18 crore to 488 construction workers in the city.Kejriwal on Thursday went to meet the families of Om Pal Singh, principal of the government boys’ senior secondary school Kalyanpuri, who had died of Covid-19 after having contracted it while working in one of the hunger relief centres. He then visited the family of Raj Kumar, a security guard at the Rajiv Gandhi hospital, who had also died of Covid-19.“The past one year has been tough on all of us. But during this one year, amid the pandemic, our Covid warriors fought the battle from the front for the people of Delhi. Today, I visited the families of late Om Pal Singh and Raj Kumar and handed over cheques of ₹1 crore each to their kin. The loss that these families have suffered is insurmountable, but I hope that this financial assistance will bring them some relief,” Kejriwal said.So far, the Delhi government has given the ₹1 crore compensation each to the families of 19 Delhi Police personnel, six Delhi fire service personnel, one each from the Indian Army, BSF and IB and 11 corona warriors (government schoolteachers, civil defence volunteers, security guards, doctors and so on).The Delhi government on Thursday expedited the process of disbursing claims to 488 construction workers, granting them ₹3.18 crore under various schemes. Sisodia, who is also the city’s labour minister, handed over cheques to construction workers present at an event organised at the Delhi Secretariat.“The labour department has streamlined the way funds are disbursed under the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board. Disbursements and aid earlier used to get stuck, but the Delhi government has now expedited this entire process,” Sisodia said.“Delhi is one of the first states which proactively distributed ₹10,000 each as Covid relief benefits to all registered construction workers. Till date, more than 48,000 construction workers have received the amount,” he said.On Thursday, 181 beneficiaries received aid under the maternity scheme, 131 under the education scheme, 53 under the death and funeral scheme and 51 beneficiaries under the pension scheme.“Every construction worker of Delhi should have the confidence that my government stands with me in times of need. People of Delhi should have that level of trust in the government,” Sisodia said.Applicants under this scheme do not have to stand in long queues at government offices, he said. The applicant only needs to call 1076 and a person from the department will pay a home visit to finalise the documentation process. Once that is complete, the applicant will receive a message that their registration is completed.Kusum, the wife of a construction worker who received ₹30,000 under the maternal health scheme, said, “My husband is a carpenter. He has a problem with his leg. Upon hearing about this scheme, we visited the labour office to enquire about it. Within 10 days of filing our details, we received the amount. These funds will help us take care of our newborn daughter Divya. It will help us eat and sleep better,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-hands-over-1cr-cheques-to-families-of-two-more-front-line-workers-who-died-of-covid-101613672205338.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Record 24k get vaccinated in Delhi||Delhi saw a huge spike in the number of people getting their Covid-19 vaccines on , with over 24,000 shots — the highest so far since inoculations began — being administered on Thursday. This is an increase of over 10,000 doses over the average 13,837 doses that were being administered in Delhi each day over the last seven days during which vaccination was carried out.The increase in vaccination numbers comes as the government increased the number of vaccination centres from 265 to 302 on Thursday.The vaccination turnout on Thursday stood at 80.8%, with a total of 24,417 shots being given. Of these, 3,537 were second doses being administered to beneficiaries who had completed the 28 day period since receiving their first shot.Read more: Buildings to be sealed, marshals in trains: BMC's new Covid-19 norms for MumbaiSo far, at least 11,188 beneficiaries have received their second dose of the vaccine out of the 25,762 who are eligible. This means, only 43.4% of the eligible people have come back for their second shots. This is marginally better than the country’s average of about 40% receiving the second doses of the vaccine.“The second dose of the vaccine can be taken anytime between four to six weeks. So far, around 40% of the eligible people have received the vaccine, but more are likely to come forward soon. We are not worried about the second dose hesitancy as the health care workers are aware that both the doses are needed for the vaccine to be effective,” said NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul on Thursday.Read more: Israel researchers test drug to prevent severe Covid casesWhat is worrying is that when it comes to the total number of health care workers immunised, Delhi lags behind the rest of the country. So far, only 44.8% of the total health care workers, who have been registered on the CoWIN portal, have been administered a dose of the vaccine as on Thursday — two days before the government closes the immunisation drive for health care workers on February 10. Addressing the issue of vaccine hesitancy at a webinar, Dr Paul said, “The world is asking for vaccines; we have the vaccine and we have the list of priority people and it is not fair for them to be refusing it. It is our societal duty to get vaccinated once identified as a beneficiary not just for myself, or my family, but to break the chain of transmission and to protect everyone. There are very few adverse events and no deaths”“Health care personnel like you are among the first to receive the vaccine because your role is essential in fighting this pandemic. Getting yourself vaccinated now will help in protecting you and the patients you care for,” said a letter by the All India Government Nurses Federation addressed to all the nurses urging them to get immunised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/record-24k-get-vaccine-shots-in-capital-101613672203700.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||40 tear gas shells missing after R-Day violence, says police report||A quick audit by Delhi Police after the January 26 tractor rally, which subsequently descended into violence and saw protesters fighting pitched battles with security personnel, has found that at least 40 tear gas shells were stolen by rioters in north Delhi’s Burari.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana had proposed the tractor rally inside the national Capital on Republic Day to protest against the three farm laws passed by the Centre. it was during this rally that violence broke out when the protesting farmers deviated from the pre-approved routes between them and police; assaulted police when they were stopped from entering parts of Central and New Delhi areas. At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers were injured in the violence.Police across the city have so far arrested 146 persons, mostly from parts of Punjab and Haryana. Of them, 34 are from Delhi.Read more: Farmers’ protest: Union minister Sanjeev Balyan chairs meet on Jat outreachPolice said they have registered a separate case of robbery and are probing the missing tear gas shells. A senior Delhi police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that all 40 tear gas shells had been traced back to Punjab and a police team has been sent to the state to recover them.“We even know the district in Punjab where the shells have been hidden. We are coordinating with the Punjab police. We have registered a case of robbery and will recover them at the earliest,” the officer added.A tear gas shell is used by the riot-control personnel of the police to control mobs who resort to rioting. Along with water cannon and canes, tear gas shells are usually the first line of defence adopted by law enforcement agencies to control unruly crowds.Read more: Farmers’ protest: India tries to dispel misgivings among British lawmakersAccording to a report filed by police, on the afternoon of January 26, a mob of about 1,000 persons had indulged in rioting near Burari ground and attacked police personnel, when they were stopped from moving towards the Red Fort. Police have said that most people, who later stormed the Red Fort premises — and ransacked offices inside the ASI protected structure, besides damaging the structure inside itself — were part of this Burari mob. The mob in Red Fort had also tried to snatch two guns and 20 bullets from two magazines from two constables there, but were unsuccessful.Though police did not comment on how the tear gas shells were actually stolen, the report filed just mentions that the shells had gone missing.Separately, the report also mentions that on January 26 afternoon, three trucks parked on the Burari flyover were also stolen by the mob. The trucks were, however, later recovered .As part of the probe into the robbery and rioting in Burari, police have so far arrested 14 people. Police have registered a case (FIR number 64) under sections of attempt to murder, rioting, robbery and criminal conspiracy against them.In the Burari case, all 14 arrested persons are Delhi residents.A second police officer said investigators are looking at footage from CCTVs and their own video recording to identify those behind the theft of the tear gas shells. On February 13, three men from west Delhi -- Sukhmeet Singh (35), Gundeep Singh (33) and Harvinder Singh (32)- -were arrested for rioting in Burari after their alleged act was caught on tape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/40-tear-gas-shells-missing-after-r-day-violence-says-police-report-101613672203109.html
19-02-2021||Delhi||Six held for selling ammo to criminals, 4.5k bullets seized||After a four-day operation, the Delhi Police arrested six men-- two of them MBA graduates -- and busted a gang that allegedly used to supply ammunitions to criminal gangs in Delhi and neighbouring states. Several bags containing about 4,500 live cartridges of different calibre were also recovered from the men.Police said of the arrested men, Deepanshu Mishra, 35, an MBA graduate in marketing, owned a gun house in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh while the second MBA graduate, Amit Rao, 33, ran a gun house in Ambala, Haryana. The cartridges were allegedly bought for ₹80 per piece from various manufacturers and were sold to criminal gangs for as much as ₹200-250 per bullet.Police identified the other arrested men as Ramesh Kumar, 46, who used to work for Rao; Ikram, 40, and his brother Akram, 42, both hailing from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh and working as gun repair men in Panipat, Haryana; and Manoj Kumar Chauhan, 39, a security guard who used to deliver the ammunitions consignments for the gang.Police have also recovered two cars from the six men, which were allegedly used to make deliveries.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said the first two arrests were made on February 14 from north Delhi’s Burari, after information was received that two suspects carrying illegal ammunitions were coming to the area. “Around 3.30pm, our team spotted Ramesh Kumar in a Hyundai i20 car and just five minutes later, Deepanshu Mishra also arrived there in a red Tata Manza car. Ramesh was spotted handing over a bag to Mishra. The police team searched the vehicles and both men were arrested. About 4,000 cartridges were recovered from the duo,” Yadav said.During further investigation, police came to know that there was an organised cartel behind the supply of bullets. “In order to arrest the other members of the gang, teams were sent to Jaipur in Rajasthan and the main supplier, Amit Rao, was arrested on Tuesday. Based on Rao’s interrogation and that of the other two arrested men, further searches were conducted in Haryana and brothers Ikram and Akram were arrested. Later, following another search, Manoj Kumar Chauhan was arrested,” the DCP said.Yadav said, the arrested men disclosed that they used to receive the cartridges from Ramesh Kumar and they would further supply them to various criminals in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.“The gun house owners bought cartridges from local manufacturers at a rate of ₹80 per bullet. Without making proper entries in their books, the owners further sold these bullets to criminal gangs through other members of the gang for as much as ₹200-250 per bullet. The profits were shared by all,” a second police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gang-that-supplied-bullets-to-criminals-busted-two-mba-grads-among-six-arrested-101613672145144.html
19-02-2021||Gurugram||Protesters take over railway tracks at Patli station; impact minimal, say police||Farmers protesting against the three central farm laws held a four-hour rail roko agitation on Thursday from noon to 4pm at Patli in Farrukhnagar, to pressurise the central government to repeal the laws.More than 100 protesters, including women, sat on the railway tracks and raised slogans against the government and the farm laws. Women recited poems for an hour to engage the gathering. A passenger train that was scheduled on the route, from Delhi to Rewari, on Thursday afternoon was also cancelled, said officials.The police had deployed around 150 personnel in the area to ensure that no damage is caused to the government property and no violence took place.Members of Gurugram Samyukta Kisan Morcha (GSKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions that is spearheading the protests, had blocked the railway tracks at Patli station. “We had reached the railway station by 11.30am, but the police did not let us enter the main tracks, following which three trains crossed the tracks. We managed to block the lines by 3.30pm and no trains crossed the stretch,” said Abhay Poonia, one of the members of GSKM.Another protester, Santok Singh, of Jharsa, said that they had blocked the yard of an inland container depot company in Patli. “We did not let the goods train carrying containers pass the stretch in the four hours and three of the trains were parked until 4pm. We did a silent protest and did not damage any of the property and cleaned the area before leaving at 4pm,” he said.The police, however, maintained that there was hardly any impact on railway services due to the protest.Hitesh Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (Manesar), said that the agitation passed off without any untoward incident. Except for one goods train, all other trains crossed the stretch as per the schedule, said Yadav.“We had deployed 150 police personnel at the protest site and it was peaceful. No trains crossed between 12.30pm and 4pm and the train operations were smooth throughout the day. There is hardly any train stoppage on this station except for goods and passenger trains which are connected from Rewari and Delhi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/protesters-take-over-railway-tracks-at-patli-station-impact-minimal-say-police-101613670705400.html
19-02-2021||Gurugram||Footfall remains low for first and second dose vaccinations||At least 69.4% of the targeted healthcare staff in the district took the second shot of the vaccine on Thursday, and over 56.3% of the front-line workers turned up for the first dose, according to the district health department data. Officials hinted at revising the vaccination drive strategy after consultation with the district administration, while awaiting roll-out of the third phase of vaccination.“The turnout for vaccination has been low in the district. Only 13,000 front-line workers of 18,000 have been inoculated till now. In case of healthcare workers, only 2371 of the 24,000 have taken the second jab,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.“It is likely that the department might have to revise its strategy or hold special vaccination sessions to improve the footfall, which will be discussed in the district level Covid-19 vaccine task force meeting on Friday,” said Yadav.On Thursday, at least 2,002 of the 2,881 targeted healthcare workers took the second jab, almost a month after taking the first shot of the vaccine. Both the vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — comprise two doses, to be administered at an interval of 28 days. But according to apex drug regulator and experts, the second dose can be given anytime between four and six weeks.Among the vaccine beneficiaries, at least 581 health staff from public health facilities and 1,421 from private hospitals took the shot at 38 session sites. “Since the staff is aware of the fact that the second dose can be taken within a few weeks, they are taking the vaccination process easy,” said Yadav.Simultaneously, at least 900 front-line workers, which included employees from the police department, panchayati raj institutions, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and National Security Guards were also targeted, but only 507 turned up for vaccination. Besides, 44 healthcare workers also took the first shot.The police department reported a poor footfall, with only 150 of the 400 targets turning up. Likewise, in panchayati raj institution, the coverage was restricted to 27 employees of the 200.For accelerating the vaccination drive across the country, a high-level meeting was chaired by PK Mishra, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, on Wednesday for opening the self-registration process for population aged 50 years and above. As per the statement issued by the union ministry of health and family welfare, Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) digital app’s version 2.0 with the provision of self-registration for vaccine beneficiary is ready and will be launched soon.“Till now, there has been no guideline from the state health department on the third phase of vaccination, but it is expected that the vaccination for the prioritised population might start by mid-March,” said Yadav.In Gurugram, the district administration, along with the health department, has initiated the process of collecting the data of citizens above 50 years of age by collating information through Family ID cards, electoral roll and details collected through surveys in the last one year for Covid-19 related activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/footfall-remains-low-for-first-and-second-dose-vaccinations-101613670704818.html
19-02-2021||Gurugram||U-turn ahead of Kherki Daula toll plaza compounds traffic issues||A U-turn ahead of the Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Manesar side is adding to the congestion at the toll plaza as a large number of vehicles going towards Gurugram have to wait for commuters from the other side to take the U-turn. Officials said that a sudden rush of traffic leads to congestion at this spot as hundreds of vehicles take the U-turn to avoid paying the toll, leaving those heading towards Delhi with no space to move forward.Officials of the Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the concessionaire for the expressway, said that there are continuous hold-ups at the turn as a large number of vehicles take a right turn towards the service road. “The traffic police will have to find a solution to this sudden rush of vehicles. It causes heavy jams during peak hour,” an official said.Nasib Singh, sub-inspector, Gurugram traffic police, said that they have deployed adequate personnel at the U-turn but the traffic flow is very high, due to which congestion is unavoidable. “We will deploy more personnel during the peak hours but there is a need to improve the condition of the road surface as often, vehicles get stuck due to large potholes, causing jams,” he said.Vikas Mittal, senior manager, National Highways Authority of India, said that they are relaying the roads on the highway and issue of traffic jams at U-turn will be taken up with the authorities. “Several steps are being taken to improve the movement of vehicles, and also provide facilities to commuters,” said Mittal.NHAI officials, however, said that U-turn is beyond the Kherki Daula toll plaza and is not in their jurisdiction and they will take up this matter with NHAI, Jaipur.Vineet Malik, who works in an industrial unit in Manesar said that congestion has increased since the toll payment was made digital. “We hoped that digital payment would resolve the delays but several people stop the traffic as they refuse to pay double the penalty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/uturn-ahead-of-kherki-daula-toll-plaza-compounds-traffic-issues-101613670704132.html
19-02-2021||Gurugram||Penalty collection up at Kherki Daula toll plaza, traffic woes continue||Following the implementation of the digital-only toll collection at the Kherki Daula toll plaza, the penalty collected from commuters not using FASTags has increased by four to five times on Tuesday and Wednesday, said officials.On an average, ₹2.5 lakh was collected in penalties every day, prior to the implementation of the digital-only payments from February 16. On February 16 and 17, penalties of ₹12.5 lakh and ₹11 lakh were collected, according to an official of the Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the concessionaire.Commuters who do not have a FASTag have to pay double the toll amount for the violation.Toll operators said that the violators were the main cause of congestion as it takes longer to collect the cash penalty. In some instances, the quality of RFID tags issued are also not up to the mark, due to which handheld readers are required to collect the toll and allow access, they said. Around 2,000 to 2,500 tags are being read by handheld machines every day.The MCEPL official cited above said the penalty collection is expected to decrease in the next few days. “The compliance improved on Thursday and we witnessed fewer tiffs with toll collectors as compared to previous days,” the official said.A toll collector said that on Wednesday evening they had to close a toll lane for half an hour after a vehicle owner refused to pay the penalty and wanted to pay the toll amount through cash, refusing to purchase a FASTag.A survey conducted by MCEPL on Wednesday for one hour found that of 200 vehicles that crossed the plaza, almost half either had no tag or have minimum balance. “Of 206 vehicles that passed through a lane, 94 vehicles did not have the tag and 60 vehicles did not have minimum amount and this led to congestion,” the MCEPL official cited above said, adding that this led to congestion.Vikas Mittal, senior manager, National Highways Authority of India, Gurugram, said that all efforts are being made to reduce congestion and improving compliance at the toll plaza. “Additional traffic marshals have been deployed on both sides to manage traffic, availability of tags has been increased. As far as quality of tags is concerned, we have already written letters to the agency concerned to take corrective action,” he said.Meanwhile, to boost the penetration of SMARTags, the NHAI on Thursday decided to launch a Free FASTag campaign till March 1, waiving off the tag cost of ₹100 at over 770 toll plazas across the country. The authority said that the total penetration of FASTags has reached around 87%, an increase of 7% in two days, with over 100 toll plazas achieving around 90% penetration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/penalty-collection-up-at-kherki-daula-toll-plaza-traffic-woes-continue-101613670703563.html

The homemaker was hit by the speeding vehicle — driven by one of her neighbours, identified as Somdut Prasad, who was learning to drive on the same stretch — from behind.The woman’s brother-in-law Sunil Kumar, who is one of the eyewitnesses in the case, said “the driver lost control over the wheels and hit her. “She suffered severe injuries all over her body and bled profusely from nose and ears. She died within a few minutes of reaching the hospital,” Kumar said.Farrukhnagar station house officer (SHO) Suresh Kumar said the 30-year-old suspect was arrested in two hours following the accident. “Prasad, a native of Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, has been living in a rented accommodation in the village for the last two years. He works in a private company,” he said.A case under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 279 (rash driving) and 304A (death by negligence) was registered at Farrukhnagar police station against Prasad.In another such accident, a man was killed after a bus ran over him near Bilaspur flyover on Tuesday. The deceased was returning from a job interview when the accident took place, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/woman-dies-after-being-hit-by-car-driven-by-learner-101613670643706.html
19-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG, Gurujal plan pilot urban forest based on Miyawaki method||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the district administration’s Gurujal society are planning to develop an urban forest in the city using a technique developed by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, whose methods have been gaining popularity across India. Gurujal has shortlisted at least 10 available open spaces in the city where a pilot project — to test the feasibility of this proposal — will begin later this year, officials privy to the matter confirmed.The Miyawaki method is heavily dependent on enhancing soil quality by first digging up the earth, and then pouring in large amounts of compost and natural material such as rice husk, which help retain water. Saplings (or seeds) are then scattered close together, forcing plants to compete with one another for space and sunlight, resulting in a green cover that can be up to 30 times denser and 10 times taller than traditional plantations.The use of native vegetation — with emphasis on four to five dominant species — is a key feature of this method, that also requires a careful, pre-emptive analysis of local agro-climactic conditions.“We have surveyed about 10 locations where we can test this concept. The most suitable so far is a two-acre plot owned by the MCG in Sector 109. We had started plantation work there last year to develop a city forest, but the saplings did not survive. Now, the area is under consideration for this Miyawaki forest. We are in talks with a Bengaluru-based organisation that has done multiple projects using this method, and will be finalising timelines soon,” said Anjali Singh, community outreach coordinator, Gurujal.Officials said that the proposal is only in a preliminary stage, and that greater proof of concept is required before full-scale plantation work can begin. “The Miyawaki method is much more expensive than traditional plantation, and requires close monitoring and regular maintenance for the first three to four years. After that, the forest becomes self-sustaining. We will need to first do a small scale experiment if this can be done in Gurugram,” said Singh, adding that no specific plans or budgets have been detailed for the final project as yet.Miyawaki horticulture has been gaining popularity in India in recent years due to the tall, dense vegetation that it can be created in a relatively small amount of time. NGOs, as well as urban local bodies in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, have all launched their own Miyawaki plantations in the last three to four years, though privately developed plantations — such as those on institutional campuses — have used this approach earlier.Vijay Dhasama, an eco-restoration practitioner who helmed the development of Gurugram’s Aravalli Biodiversity Park, likened the Miyawaki method to “gardening on steroids”. “This process can be very expensive, touching almost ₹12 lakh just for completing plantation work on a single acre of land, as per my own rough calculations. The plants need to be fed and monitored constantly. This sort of intensive horticulture would not be well suited for dry-deciduous forest ecosystems that are native to Gurugram. The term Miyawaki ‘forest’ is a misnomer. These are not natural forests,” he said.Dhasmana also said that it is too early to declare India’s Miyawaki forests — for which there is no official count — as a success story. “These plantations will be self-sustaining only if there are enough resources available for them to grow. Such resources, such as good soil and water, are constantly under threat in urban settings. There are also no long-term studies done, specifically in India, which show that the Miyawaki method provides any more ecological benefit than others. On the contrary, its popularity seems to be driven more by the perceived aesthetic value of tall plantations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-gurujal-plan-pilot-urban-forest-based-on-miyawaki-method-101613670642973.html

19-02-2021||Mumbai||Why did PM Modi lie about China’s infiltration in Ladakh: Shiv Sena||While welcoming the disengagement of the Chinese and Indian troops in eastern Ladakh, the Shiv Sena questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi lied to the country on the issue of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops’ infiltration into Indian territory. An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Thursday said that Chinese troops were about 20km inside the Indian border and killed 20 jawans in eastern Ladakh but the PM and other senior ministers of the Union government lied about Chinese infiltration when the Opposition questioned them.Also Read | In Pictures: Army shares pictures of PLA’s disengagement processAddressing the Rajya Sabha on February 11, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that India and China have agreed to disengage from the Pangong Tso area in eastern Ladakh and go back to status quo ante after a stand-off lasting nearly nine months. Singh said that according to the agreement, Chinese troops will pull back from Finger 4 area in the northern banks of Pangong Tso to beyond Finger 8.“Till two months ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was saying Chinese troops have not infiltrated the Indian border. The same PM is now saying that Chinese troops are retreating from our soil. Meaning, the Chinese did infiltrate and our Prime Minister was lying to the country,” the editorial said.The editorial further slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for celebrating the victory of the retreat. “We are happy that the Chinese troops are retreating. This is a victory of the diplomacy of the defence ministry, but why was the government lying about Chinese infiltration? It is now clear that all this while the Centre was fibbing about Chinese troops not entering our borders. The government itself has started celebration over this disengagement,” the editorial added.Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye dismissed the allegation made in the editorial and said, “Saamana and Shiv Sena have nothing productive to do besides criticising PM Modi. They should look issues that affect common man than play politics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-did-pm-modi-lie-about-china-s-infiltration-in-ladakh-shiv-sena-101613634905241.html

Later, he was expected to say at a security conference that “democratic progress is under assault” all over the world and democracies should work to “prove that our model isn’t a relic of our history”.Biden will announce the US contribution to Covax at a virtual meeting with leaders of the six other G7 countries - Canada, Germany, France, the UK, Japan and Italy.The first tranche of $2 billion from the US will go directly to the Gavi vaccine alliance, the White House said in a note. The remaining $2 billion will be released over 2021 and 2022. The first lot of $500 million will be paid after initial donor pledges are fulfilled and the first doses of coronavirus vaccines have been delivered.Covax is a collaboration involving the World Health Organization, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.“In too many places, including in Europe and the United States, democratic progress is under assault,” Biden was to say, according to excerpts released by the White House of his upcoming speech at the Munich Security Conference scheduled for later in the day.He will further say, “We must demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people. That is our galvanising mission. Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. We have to defend it. Strengthen it. Renew it. We have to prove that our model isn’t a relic of our history. It’s the single best way to realize the promise of our future.”Also on Friday, the US returned to the Paris Agreement on the climate crisis in a reversal of a major Trump era decision. “Now, as momentous as our joining the (Paris) Agreement was in 2016 - and as momentous as our rejoining is today - what we do in the coming weeks, months, and years is even more important,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pledges-4bn-for-covax-programme-returns-to-paris-pact-on-climate-crisis-101613757179874.html

19-02-2021||World||Harry and Meghan permanently quit UK royal life||Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan have permanently quit royal duties, Buckingham Palace said Friday, just over a year after they rocked the British monarchy by announcing plans to "step back" from their roles.Queen Elizabeth II ordered the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are formally known, to relinquish their honorary titles and patronages following the confirmation that they would not be returning as working royals.The couple relocated to the United States last year, in a move dubbed "Megxit" by the British press, and have since embarked on several commercial ventures there including lucrative tieups with the streaming platforms Netflix and Spotify.At an emergency January 2020 summit with the queen, Harry's father Prince Charles and brother Prince William, Harry agreed they would stop using their "Royal Highness" titles and the "Sussex Royal" brand.But the senior family members pledged to review the situation a year on -- with the move now made permanent, days after Harry and Meghan announced on Valentine's Day they are expecting their second child."The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have confirmed to Her Majesty The Queen that they will not be returning as working members of The Royal Family," Buckingham Palace announced."The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of The Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service."It noted their honorary appointments and patronages would be redistributed among the remaining working royals.'Service is universalHowever, it appears the pair will retain their official titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Harry remains sixth in line to the throne, with no change in the line of succession."While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family," the palace statement added.The decision means Harry, 36, who served as a soldier in Afghanistan and is passionate about veterans' welfare, must relinquish several honorary military titles related to the Royal Marines, air force and navy.Earlier this month he formally settled a libel claim against the publisher of The Mail On Sunday and MailOnline website over reports he had snubbed soldiers since stepping back from royal life.A spokesperson for the couple said Friday they had shown that they "remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world".The statement noted they had offered their continued support to the organisations they had represented "regardless of official role"."We can all live a life of service. Service is universal," it added.'Intimate' interviewThe couple's move to the US followed reports Meghan was deeply unhappy with life inside the centuries-old royal institution and increasing complaints from the couple about media intrusion.But its sudden nature jolted the monarchy and reportedly caused acrimony with Harry's brother William, who is second in line to the throne.Harry and Meghan have launched several legal cases against UK news outlets alleging invasion of privacy, with one lawsuit ending this month with a victory against Associated Newspapers.The couple are poised to give an "intimate" interview about their lives with US chat show host Oprah Winfrey.'Championed our work' Aside from his military titles, Harry also held Commonwealth appointments and some other patronages, including with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and Rugby Football League."The RFU has greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game," the organisation said on Twitter.Harry will remain as patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, the organisation for disabled military veterans confirmed.Meanwhile Meghan was also handed honorary roles after she wed Harry in a fairytale ceremony at Windsor Castle in May 2018, including becoming a patron of the National Theatre.The acclaimed theatre group also thanked her for the support offered during her briefer than expected tenure and said the process of appointing a new patron had begun.Jennie Bond, a former royal correspondent for the BBC, said the loss of titles would be a blow to the couple."This is going to upset Harry, obviously, particularly the military (losses)," she told the broadcaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-and-meghan-permanently-quit-uk-royal-life-101613755768518.html

19-02-2021||World||US should consult Taliban on any Afghan pullout delay: Pakistani envoy||The United States should consult the Taliban on any extension of a May 1 deadline for a full US troop pullout from Afghanistan and should not decide unilaterally, the Pakistani ambassador to the United States said on Friday.Ambassador Asad Majeed Khan's comments come as the Biden administration conducts a review of a February 2020 deal with the Taliban that is expected to determine whether it will meet the deadline to withdraw the last US soldiers from America's longest war.US and European officials say the Taliban have not fulfilled commitments they made in the accord and that conditions are not conducive to advancing the peace process amid a surge in violence blamed on the insurgents.The Taliban, seeking to reimpose Islamic rule in Afghanistan after their 2001 ouster at the hands of US-led troops, deny the charges and indicate they will resume attacks on US and allied troops unless the May deadline is kept.Khan told an online forum sponsored by the Stimson Center that US officials should consult the Taliban before deciding whether to maintain the last 2,500 US troops in Afghanistan."That is where the process should start," Khan said. "To present this as a fait accompli, I think, will only create difficulty."Khan's comments were significant as Pakistan, which helped facilitate the US-Taliban negotiations in Doha that clinched the February 2020 deal, wields considerable influence with the insurgents.The insurgents have sanctuaries in Pakistan, whose main military-run intelligence service gives them support, according to US and Afghan officials. Pakistan denies the allegation."If there is strong justification and reasoning to have an extension for logistical or other reasons, the parties have overcome difficulties ... before in terms of reaching common ground," Khan said. "It's really also a question of the credibility of the United States."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-consult-taliban-on-any-afghan-pullout-delay-pakistani-envoy-101613755088082.html
19-02-2021||World||Over 20 million years of life lost to Covid-19: Study | Here are some of the key findings||Over 20 million years of life have been lost to the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic globally, according to a new study aimed at understanding the mortality impact of the viral infection. Researchers analysed the premature mortality impact of Covid-19 by calculating the number of years of life lost (YLL) to the disease across 81 countries covering over 1.2 million deaths. They noted that the results of the study, published in the scientific journal Nature, confirm the “large mortality impact of Covid-19 among the elderly” and “call for heightened awareness in devising policies that protect vulnerable demographics losing the largest number of life-years.”Here are some of the key findings from the study:While the mortality rate for Covid-19 has been higher in the elderly, only a fraction of the years of life lost can be attributed to the individuals in the oldest age brackets. The researchers found that three-quarters of the YLL resulted from deaths in people below the age of 75 and almost a third from deaths below the age of 55. “Globally, 44.9% of the total YLL can be attributed to the deaths of individuals between 55 and 75 years old,” the study said.On average, Covid-19 took 16 years from each fatality and the majority of those years were from individuals with a significant remaining life expectancy. In high-income countries, a large proportion of the YLL was found to be borne by the oldest group but the pattern changed for low- and mid-income countries, where a large fraction of the YLL was from individuals dying at 55 or younger.The researchers also found gender disparity in the mortality rate for Covid-19 as well as in absolute years of life lost. After studying the sample of countries where death counts by gender are available, they concluded that men have lost 44 per cent more years to the pandemic than women. A higher average age-at-death of female Covid-19 deaths and, in terms of the absolute number, more male deaths than female deaths directly impacted the disparity.According to the study, there are two key sources of potential bias to the results that operate in different directions. The researchers said the study might underestimate Covid-19 YLL rates due to an undercount of the total death. On the other hand, people dying from the infection may belong to an at-risk population whose remaining life expectancy is shorter than the average person’s remaining life expectancy, and, consequently, the estimate of the total YLL due to Covid-19 may be an overestimate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-20-million-years-of-life-lost-to-covid-19-study-key-findings-101613751851747.html

We need to make progress on this, at home and abroad," Scholz said, adding that the additional money was meant to support the Covax program, the Word Health Organisation (WHO) and other international efforts."With today's announcement we make clear: We're standing side-by-side with the poorest countries," Scholz said. The German contribution would increase international funds for vaccines, drugs and tests by over 30 percent, he added."We'll only be safe if there is immunisation through vaccination all over the world," Scholz said.US President Joe Biden was expected to use his first meeting with leaders of Group of Seven advanced economies on Friday to announce an immediate $2 billion donation to the Covax program co-led by the WHO. Covax aims to ensure a fair supply of coronavirus vaccines around the world.The United States will provide an additional $2 billion over the next two years as other nations fulfil and make their own pledges, US officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-pledges-additional-1-5-bln-euros-for-covax-and-who-101613748621879.html
19-02-2021||World||EU to double Covax vaccine funding to 1 billion euros||The European Union's executive commission on Friday pledged to double its contribution to the World Health Organization’s Covax program, bringing the 27-nation bloc’s commitment to the initiative to deliver vaccines to poor nations to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen praised a “true moment of global solidarity" in a statement as leaders of the Group of Seven economic powers gathered in a virtual meeting.Von der Leyen also announced during the meeting an additional 100 million euros ($121.4 million) to support vaccination campaigns in Africa in partnership with the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“The funding will be used to strengthen health systems, ensure the cold chains, buy equipment and train staff," von der Leyen said. She added that the EU would discuss with drugmakers how they can ramp up their Covid-19 vaccine production capacity in Africa.“We are also exploring potential support to boost local production under licensing arrangements," she said.The EU is one of the leading donors to the Covax program, which aims to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 shots for low-and middle-income countries. Covax hopes to deploy some 336 million doses by the end of June, and around 2 billion doses by the end of the year.But the program has already missed the goal of starting vaccination in poor countries at the same time that doses were rolled out in rich countries.This week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sharply criticized the “wildly uneven and unfair” distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, saying 10 countries have administered 75% of the vaccinations given worldwide so far and demanding a global effort to get all people in every nation vaccinated as soon as possible.Amnesty International said a failure to ensure global access to vaccines represents “an abject moral failure that will ultimately harm rich countries."“The leaders of G-7 nations are shooting themselves in the foot by failing to ensure the equal distribution of coronavirus vaccines globally,” Netsanet Belay, the research and advocacy director at Amnesty International, said as the G-7 leaders prepared to hold their first meeting of the year.The European Union has been criticized for its handling of the bloc’s vaccine procurement process. Despite the EU securing a portfolio of up to 2.6 billion doses that would be largely sufficient to inoculate its 450 million residents, vaccinations in Europe have been slowed down by delays in the production and deliveries of shots.In addition to its Covax contribution, the EU said it wants to share some of its doses with neighbors in Europe and Africa. Von der Leyen has regularly insisted that global solidarity is needed not only to help the world’s poorest countries but also to protect the EU, as “nobody is safe until everybody is safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-double-covax-vaccine-funding-to-1-billion-euros-101613747051913.html

19-02-2021||World||US states remain split on guns in capitols after armed protests||In the past year, insurrectionists have breached the US Capitol and armed protesters have forced their way into statehouses around the country. But the question of whether guns should be allowed in capitol buildings remains political, and states are going in opposite directions.In Montana, a new state law signed Thursday allows anyone with a permit to bring a concealed firearm into the statehouse, reversing a decades-long policy banning guns inside the Capitol and fulfilling a longtime hope of Republicans who took control of the governor's mansion as well as the Legislature this year. GOP-dominated Utah passed a law this month allowing people to carry concealed weapons into its Capitol building and elsewhere in the state without a permit.Guns are allowed in statehouses in some form in 21 US states, according to a review by The Associated Press. Eight states allow only concealed firearms inside their capitols, while two states allow only open carry.Montana and Utah are two of at least 13 states that do not have metal detectors at the entrance to their capitols. The statehouses are open to the public even as many have closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.Several other states, though, are moving to restrict guns inside their capitols. In Michigan, where armed protesters forced their way inside the statehouse last year and the FBI said it uncovered a plot to kidnap the governor, a state panel banned the open carry of guns after the Jan. 6 riots in Washington, DC.Democratic state Sen. Dayna Polehanki said that “tensions are high” in Michigan following the assaults, and she's disappointed that concealed weapons are still allowed in the statehouse.“What they said is that weapons, guns, bullets are still welcome in our state capitol as long as we can’t see them. It doesn’t make anyone safer,” she said.Vermont lawmakers, meanwhile, are considering expanding their statehouse ban on guns to other government buildings. In Washington state, a bill that would ban open carry of guns in the statehouse and near permitted demonstrations has won early approval.“The purpose of openly carrying a weapon is to chill other people’s voices. And it works,” said its sponsor, Washington state Sen. Patty Kuderer, a Democrat.In nearby Oregon, crowds opposed to the building’s public closure during a pandemic-related session stormed the state Capitol, including at least one person armed with an AR-15. And in Idaho, self-styled “patriots,” anti-vaccination groups and others forced their way past police in August at the Capitol, shattering a window as they pushed and shoved into a gallery.In Montana, though, Republican Rep. Seth Berglee said the US Capitol riot didn’t affect his thinking about the law he sponsored.“People that have a permit are extremely law-abiding, and they are the type of people I would want to have around. I see them as being a deterrent to bad things happening,” he said.There’s a similar proposal this year in Oklahoma, where gun rights advocates are once again pushing to allow people to carry firearms inside the Capitol with a license. It hasn’t yet had a hearing.“A person needs to be able to protect themselves, no matter where they are,” said Don Spencer, president of the Oklahoma Second Amendment Association.Not everyone in Montana feels safer with the new measure in place, however. Democratic House Minority Leader Kim Abbott said more guns could add a chilling new dimension to debates in polarized times.“If you have more guns in the building when you’re talking about things that are so personal and intense ... you do worry about things escalating,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-remain-split-on-guns-in-capitols-after-armed-protests-101613744772125.html
19-02-2021||World||UK government broke the law by failing to disclose PPE contracts, court rules||The British government broke the law by failing to publish details of billions of pounds of spending on personal protective equipment during the coronavirus pandemic, a London court ruled on Friday.As Covid-19 swept across the world last year, Britain scrambled to secure protective gear for medics and nurses on the front line.The Good Law Project, a campaign group, and three opposition politicians brought a judicial review seeking details of undisclosed deals with firms that had no medical procurement expertise and, in some cases, delivered defective protective equipment.A judge at a London High Court said the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock, failed to comply with a public procurement law that requires the government to publish contract awards within 30 days."The Secretary of State spent vast quantities of public money on pandemic-related procurements during 2020," the judge said. "The public were entitled to see who this money was going to, what it was being spent on and how the relevant contracts were awarded."The health ministry said it had needed to move within very short timescales and against unparalleled global demand."This has often meant having to award contracts at speed to secure the vital supplies required to protect NHS (National Health Service) workers and the public," a spokesman said."We fully recognise the importance of transparency in the award of public contracts and continue to publish information about contracts awarded as soon as possible."The National Audit Office said last year there had been a lack of transparency and a failure to explain why certain suppliers were chosen, or how any conflict of interest was dealt with, in procurement deals between March and the end of July worth about 18 billion pounds.Opposition politicians have accused the government of running a "chumocracy" with contracts, including for the purchase of what turned out to be unusable PPE, and appointments made to those with family or business links to those in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-broke-the-law-by-failing-to-disclose-ppe-contracts-court-rules-101613743223364.html

The property had been shuttered since 2014 and was in a state of disrepair. The former US President had often mentioned his business ventures in Atlantic City while on the campaign trail for his infamous 2017 Presidential race.“Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me,” Trump had said in an interview. “The money I took out of there was incredible.”The Trump Plaza became Atlantic City’s 10th casino when it opened its doors in 1984. Though the Trumps have not been legally associated with the Plaza since 2009, after a series of bankruptcy filings, his name continued to appear on the building before it was closed in 2014.The 34-storied Trump Plaza was brought down with 3,000 pieces of dynamites by a Maryland-based professional demolition company, Controlled Demolition Inc. The other Trump businesses in the vicinity, including the crown jewel, Trump Taj Mahal, have all been sold.The New York Times reported that the implosion lasted only seconds, due to the lack of a basement and cavity space to absorb the debris. Atlantic City officials told reporters that the pile of rubble left behind is 70 to 80 feet tall and will be cleared by summertime.For the Democratic Mayor of Atlantic City, Marty Smalls, the way Trump’s businesses panned out in his city foretold the path United States took under the former President.“This is not about President Trump, because, quite frankly, the people here in the great city of Atlantic City knew how the presidency was going to play out on a national stage because we’re one of the cities that knew him best,” Small said to reporters after the implosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-plaza-brought-down-by-3-000-sticks-of-dynamite-101613744633796.html
19-02-2021||World||Water leaks indicate new damage at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant||Cooling water levels have fallen in two reactors at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant since a powerful earthquake hit the area last weekend, indicating possible additional damage, its operator said Friday.New damage could further complicate the plant’s already difficult decommissioning process, which is expected to take decades.Tokyo Electric Power Co. spokesman Keisuke Matsuo said the drop in water levels in Unit 1 and 3 reactors indicates that the existing damage to their primary containment chambers was worsened by Saturday's magnitude 7.3 quake, allowing more water to leak.The leaked water is believed to have remained inside the reactor buildings and there is no sign of any outside impact, he said.In 2011, a powerful magnitude 9.1 earthquake and tsunami damaged the Fukushima plant's cooling systems, causing three reactor cores to melt and nuclear fuel to fall to the bottom of their primary containment vessels.TEPCO will monitor the water and temperatures at the bottom of the containment vessels, Matsuo said.Since the 2011 disaster, cooling water has been escaping constantly from the damaged primary containment vessels into the basements of the reactor buildings. To make up for the loss, additional cooling water has been pumped into the reactors to cool the melted fuel remaining inside them. The recent decline in the water levels indicates that more water than before is leaking out, TEPCO said.More than 180 people received mostly minor injuries from Saturday's earthquake, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. The quake also triggered landslides, damaged homes and a high-speed train line, and caused widespread power and water supply disruptions.TEPCO initially reported that there was no abnormality at the plant from Saturday's quake.Matsuo said the cooling water level fell as much as 70 centimeters (27 inches) in the primary containment chamber of the Unit 1 reactor and about 30 centimeters (11 inches) in Unit 3. TEPCO wasn't able to determine any decline in Unit 2 because indicators have been taken out to prepare for the removal of melted debris, it said.Increased leakage could require more cooling water to be pumped into the reactors, which would result in more contaminated water that is treated and stored in huge tanks at the plant. TEPCO says its storage capacity of 1.37 million tons will be full next summer. A government panel's recommendation that it be gradually released into the sea has faced fierce opposition from local residents and a decision is still pending.Meanwhile, the Tokyo High Court on Friday held the government as well as TEPCO accountable for the 2011 nuclear disaster, ordering both to pay about 280 million yen ($2.6 million) in compensation to more than 40 plaintiffs forced to evacuate to Chiba, near Tokyo, for their lost livelihoods and homes.Friday’s decision reverses an earlier ruling by the Chiba district court that excluded the government from responsibility. Judge Yukio Shirai said the government could have foreseen the risk of a massive tsunami and taken measures after a long-term assessment in 2002 of seismic activities.Lawyers representing the plaintiffs welcomed the decision and said it would affect other pending cases.“The case raises the question of whether we should tolerate a society that prioritizes economic activities over people's lives and health,” said Izutaro Mangi, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/water-leaks-indicate-new-damage-at-japan-s-fukushima-nuclear-plant-101613744247016.html
19-02-2021||World||After visit of envoys, EU calls for early assembly elections in Jammu & Kashmir||Following a visit to Jammu and Kashmir by a group of 24 envoys, the European Union (EU) on Friday called for more political and economic steps, including the early holding of assembly elections, to restore normalcy in the region.EU ambassador Ugo Astuto and envoys of ten EU states, including key players such as France, Italy and the Netherlands, were part of the third group of heads of foreign missions to travel to Jammu and Kashmir since January 2020. The visit was aimed at allowing the diplomats to make an assessment of the ground situation.While taking note of recent steps by the Indian government, such as holding of elections to the District Development Councils (DDCs) in November-December and resumption of 4G internet services earlier this month, an EU official said: “We look forward to a number of other important steps to be taken in the political and economic sphere, including the early organisation of the legislative assembly elections.”“The right to freedom of expression online and offline is a key value for all democracies,” the official said.The visit by the envoys provided an opportunity to “see the situation on the ground and interact with local interlocutors as part of the EU’s outreach to all stakeholders”. The official added: “We look forward to continuing our dialogue with India on this.”Besides the EU envoy, the ambassadors of Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden were part of the group. The remaining envoys were from countries in different geographical regions, such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Ghana, Kyrgyz Republic and Malaysia.The Union government has said elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir following the completion of the delimitation process, which is underway. In his Independence Day address last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said: “As soon as the delimitation process is over, there will be elections in the future so that the union territory has its own government, which will undertake development work with renewed vigour.”Other diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two-day visit, which ended on Thursday, was too brief to make a comprehensive assessment though there were indications of a relative improvement in the situation.The diplomats also said most of the grassroots politicians, civil society representatives and businesspeople they had interacted with had stressed the need for more steps to ensure social and economic development, investments and creation of jobs.EU ambassador Astuto was also part of the second group of envoys that had visited Jammu and Kashmir in February 2020, following the government’s decision in August 2019 to scrap the region’s special status and split it into two union territories. India has said the move was aimed at improving governance, boosting development and tackling cross-border terrorism.However, the lockdown of Kashmir, snapping of internet connectivity and widespread detention of political leaders in 2019 had been criticised by the EU and other countries.The external affairs ministry said the latest visit allowed the envoys to witness, first-hand, Kashmir’s “march on the path of inclusive development and the dynamism in the grassroots democratic institutions”. The envoys visited Srinagar, Budgam and Jammu and were also briefed on the security situation by senior army officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-visit-of-envoys-eu-calls-for-early-assembly-elections-in-jammu-kashmir-101613742172553.html

It lagged richer Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-still-very-good-vaccine-despite-study-south-africa-adviser-101613742729395.html
19-02-2021||World||US officially rejoins Paris climate agreement, 30 days after Biden ordered move||The United States officially rejoined the Paris climate agreement on Friday, reinvigorating the global fight against climate change as the Biden administration plans drastic emissions cuts over the next three decades.Scientists and foreign diplomats have welcomed the US return to the treaty, which became official 30 days after President Joe Biden ordered the move on his first day in office.Since nearly 200 countries signed the 2015 pact to prevent catastrophic climate change, the United States was the only country to exit. Former President Donald Trump took the step, claiming climate action would cost too much.US climate envoy John Kerry will take part in virtual events on Friday to mark the US re-entry, including appearances with the ambassadors to the UK and Italy, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and UN climate ambition envoy Michael Bloomberg.Biden has promised to chart a path toward net-zero US emissions by 2050. Scientists have said that goal is in line with what is needed, while also stressing that global emissions need to drop by half by 2030 to prevent the most devastating impacts of global warming. Kerry along with Biden’s domestic climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, are crafting new regulations and incentives aimed at speeding the deployment of clean energy and transitioning from fossil fuels.Those measures will form the backbone of Washington’s next emissions reduction goal, or Nationally Determined Contribution, to be announced before a global climate leaders summit Biden will host on April 22. The next UN climate conference is in November in Glasgow.Biden has also signed more than a dozen executive orders related to climate change, and has mobilized every federal agency to help shape the government's response.Despite the excitement over the US return to global negotiations, climate negotiators say the path forward will not be easy. Biden’s climate goals face political challenges in the United States, opposition from fossil fuel companies and some concern among foreign leaders about US flip-flopping on climate policy."There’s a lot of ground to make up, but the hope of Paris is alive and strong," said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officially-rejoins-paris-climate-agreement-30-days-after-biden-ordered-move-101613740878319.html
19-02-2021||World||Facebook controversy: What prompted Australia PM to reach out to PM Modi? All you need to know||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday said that he discussed the progress of the “media platform bill” with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi during a telephonic conversation a day before. The discussion was held in the aftermath of Facebook’s decision to restrict publishers and people of Australia from sharing or viewing news content on its platform.The contentious legislation, titled News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code, aims to make two Big Techs - Google and Facebook - pay content publishers for sharing news on their platforms. While announcing the decision on Wednesday, Facebook said that the bill, already passed by the lower house of parliament, “fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content.”“It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,” William Easton, managing director, Facebook Australia & New Zealand, said in a blog post.What's the rationale behind the code?The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which drafted the code, had identified a bargaining power imbalance between digital platforms and Australian news businesses. The competition watchdog had said in a report that organisations like Google and Facebook are more than mere distributors or pure intermediaries in the supply of news in Australia. According to the chair of the ACCC, the bill would even out the bargaining power imbalance so that fair commercial deals can be made.Read | Facebook’s Australia face-off could backfire across the globeHere’s are some of the key elements of the code:The news media bargaining code will create a framework for registered news media corporations and digital platforms to negotiate for financial remuneration for the use and/or reproduction of news content.Digital platform corporations like Google and Facebook will have to provide the news business corporations with a range of information, including advance notification of planned changes to an algorithm that will have a significant effect on referral traffic to covered news content.The law would force the two Big Techs to enter mandatory arbitration with media outlets if they fail to reach an agreement over the value of the news content within three months. The arbiter will take the final call between the payment proposal put forward by both parties.The tech giants may make standard offers to news businesses, particularly smaller ones, to reduce the time and cost associated with negotiations.How Google and Facebook reacted?Google argued that the “baseball arbitration model” incentivises publishers to make ambit claims and resort to arbitration rather than good-faith negotiations. It had even threatened to pull its search engine from Australia if the government forces it to pay media outlets for their news content. However, the company has reluctantly struck deals with media companies, including NewsCorp, to pay for journalism.On the other hand, Facebook has decided to take the issue head-on by not caving, for the time being, to the government’s pressure. Easton said that platforms have fundamentally different relationships with news content, highlighting that Google Search is “inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content.” He argued that publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook which allows them to “sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.”“For Facebook, the business gain from news is minimal. News makes up less than 4% of the content people see in their News Feed,” he added.What’s next?Beginning Monday, the legislation will be debated in the Senate which is expected to adopt the law by the end of the week. Australia is mobilising support in its fight against Facebook and Morrison’s recent discussions with PM Modi, Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK’s Boris Johnson is proof of that. Morrison told reporters on Friday that “people are looking at what Australia is doing” and “they’re already going down this path,” indicating wider support on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-controversy-what-prompted-australia-pm-to-reach-out-to-pm-modi-101613739452925.html
19-02-2021||World||UK vows to share Covid-19 vaccines ahead of G7 meeting but uncertain of timeline, quantity||worldLeaders of the Group of Seven economic powers are holding their first meeting of 2021 on Friday, and vowing to share coronavirus vaccines with the world's poorest countries — though details of how soon and how much they will give remain scarce.Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, which holds the G-7 presidency this year, is meeting virtually with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and the United States to discuss international challenges -- chief among them the pandemic that has killed almost 2.5 million people around the world.Wealthy nations have snapped up hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines against the virus, while some countries in the developing world have little or none.Johnson, whose country has had almost 120,000 coronavirus deaths, will promise to give “the majority of any future surplus vaccines” to the UN-backed COVAX effort to vaccinate the world's most vulnerable people, and will encourage other G-7 countries to do the same, the British government said.But Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said it was is “difficult to say with any kind of certainty” when or how much Britain could donate.“We're not really able to give with certainty either a timescale or the numbers involved,” he told the BBC.French President Emmanuel Macron gave a firmer target, saying Europe and the US should allocate up to 5 per cent of their current Covid-19 vaccine supplies to the poorest countries “very fast, so that people on the ground see it happening.”In an interview with the Financial Times, Macron noted that Russia and China have been quick to offer doses of their own products to some African nations.As the African continent awaits delivery of doses through COVAX, an African Union-created vaccines task force said Friday that it would be getting 300 million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine in May.The AU previously secured 270 million doses from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson for the continent of 1.3 billion people.Macron said that “hundreds of millions of vaccines are being given in rich countries” while the vaccination effort in poor countries has barely started.“It's an unprecedented acceleration of global inequality and it's politically unsustainable too because it's paving the way for a war of influence over vaccines,” he said. “You can see the Chinese strategy, and the Russian strategy too.”The French president's office said France was ready to hand over 5 per cent of its doses but would not give exact numbers or a date.European governments are under pressure to speed up their domestic vaccination campaigns after being outpaced by Britain and the US.German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, signaled broad support for Macron's proposal but said details still have to be thrashed out.Seibert told reporters in Berlin that “there is an understanding in principle with the French president that European countries will hand over some of their stock to poorer countries on other continents that so far have not been supplied."“When that will happen, in what steps, certainly still has to be discussed," he said.Development and aid groups said rich Western countries needed to do more, and soon.“The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible,” said Romilly Greenhill, UK director of anti-poverty group the One Campaign.America's G-7 allies are keen to impress President Joe Biden at his first major multilateral engagement since taking office.They are hopeful that US re-engagement with the world following the “America first” years under Donald Trump will mean a more coordinated response on issues including Covid-19 and climate change.Biden has pledged to join the COVAX initiative, which Trump refused to support, and to distribute USD 4 billion in US funding to the program.Friday's G-7 meeting — and a speech by Biden at the Munich Security Conference the same day — comes the day the United States officially rejoins the Paris climate agreement, the largest international effort to curb global warming. Trump pulled the US out of the landmark accord in 2017.The Biden administration also said it was ready to join talks with Iran and world powers to discuss a return to the 2015 deal to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, which was repudiated by Trump.For Johnson, the G-7 presidency is a chance to demonstrate Britain is still a key global player following its exit from the EU, which became complete at the end of 2020.A full G-7 summit is scheduled to take place in June at the Carbis Bay seaside resort in southwest England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-vows-to-share-covid-19-vaccines-ahead-of-g7-meeting-101613738967134.html
19-02-2021||World||World Social Justice Day 2021: Know this year's theme, significance||The United Nations (UN) General Assembly (GA) recognises that social development cannot be ensured in the absence of social justice. On November 26, 2007, the GA declared that February 20 will be celebrated annually as the World Day of Social Justice. The purpose of this day is to recognise in letter and spirit that even though the world is moving ahead through cooperation and innovation, social inequality still persists.India itself is no stranger to the concept of social justice. BR Ambedkar, the father of the Indian Constitution, believed that without ensuring social justice, a society cannot ensure political justice to all its citizens.The theme of this year’s World Social Justice Day is social justice in the digital economy. The advancements in technology made over the past decade have helped human beings traverse the tricky landscape of a world wrecked by Covid-19. Workers were able to take their work home because of what the UN calls ‘digital labour platforms’ which provided “workers with income-generating opportunities and benefits from flexible work arrangements”. However, this has also exacerbated issues of the regularity of work and income, the right to form or join trade unions, and hampered skill utilization.The UN estimates that the consequences of the pandemic are going to affect the economy for years to come and since digital labour platforms are not restricted by borders and operate across multiple jurisdictions, there is an ardent need for international policy dialogue and coordination. The UN has chosen this year’s Social Justice Day to shed some light on the basic rights of workers who have now shifted to digital platforms, especially of those in the global South, whose lives are impacted by a lack of proper digital infrastructure too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-social-justice-day-2021-know-this-year-s-theme-significance-101613736793530.html
19-02-2021||World||Galwan Valley casualty numbers: China launches renewed diplomatic war on India||China on Friday launched a renewed diplomatic war on India, issuing official statements blaming New Delhi for the border tension in eastern Ladakh and the Galwan Valley clash last summer that left 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead.Following the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Daily releasing details - for the first time officially - of the four Chinese soldiers killed and one injured in the clash in June near the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Chinese defence and foreign ministries issued statements, pinning the blame for the deaths of soldiers on India.Separately, Chinese state media outlets released videos and write-ups, urging the Chinese citizens to remember the “martyrs” and how four PLA soldiers sacrificed their lives while defending the country’s western borders.The defence ministry was quoted as saying the families of all five soldiers will be well looked after.All five PLA soldiers were awarded, four of them posthumously, for their role in fighting the Indian Army’s border troops in the Galwan Valley, Chinese official media announced, citing the Central Military Commission (CMC).The title of “border-defending hero” was conferred on Battalion Commander Chen Hongjun posthumously, while Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran received first-class merit.“They all died in a clash with trespassing foreign military personnel wielding steel tubes, cudgels and stones last June,” official news agency Xinhua reported, quoting PLA Daily.Qi Fabao, who was seriously injured in the skirmish, received the title of “hero regiment commander for defending the border”.Emphasising how young the soldiers were, Hu Xijin, editor of the tabloid Global Times, wrote that Wang Zhuoran, the youngest of the four soldiers who died, was only 19 years old, while Chen Xiangrong and Xiao Siyuan were 24 years old. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, while blaming India, said the PLA Daily story has put the truth out in the open.“This will be a way to pay tribute to our heroes and martyrs and also will help the Indian side to draw lessons from it and better work with China to uphold peace and stability in the border region and properly resolve the border issue,” she said during a briefing.Hua added, “We hope the border issue will be put in the proper place in our bilateral relations. We hope to work with the Indian side to properly resolve the issue and uphold the general picture in the interest of our bilateral ties.”Mentioning two soldiers, Chen Hongjun and Xiao Siyuan, Hua said while the former would have become a father in four months (since death), the latter was getting ready for marriage.“I think our peace today is hard to come by,” she said.Both Hua and defence ministry spokesperson, Ren Guoqiang, in a statement published on Chinese social media, continued to blame India for the clash.Ren said that China’s position on resolving the Sino-Indian border problem has been clear, consistent and sincere.China, he said, is committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and negotiation, and has always been ready to maintain the overall stability of the relations between China and India and the two militaries.Ren added that reporting of the casualty figures by PLA Daily is an effort to portray the truth.India has consistently denied the allegation and has maintained that the PLA had trespassed across the LAC.Chinese foreign ministry’s Hua added that India is an important neighbour and restoring a healthy, stable relation relationship is the aspiration and also in the interest of the people of the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/galwan-valley-casualty-numbers-china-launches-renewed-diplomatic-war-on-india-101613734310732.html
19-02-2021||World||'It was like a war film': How Italian town with first known virus death fared||Italy delivered the first shocking confirmation of locally transmitted coronavirus infections outside of Asia a year ago Sunday, with back-to-back revelations of cases more than 150 kilometers (nearly 100 miles) apart in the country's north.First, a 38-year-old man in Codogno, an industrial town in the Lombardy region, tested positive for Covid-19, sending panicked residents to pick up their children from school, stock up on provisions at grocery stores and search in vain for surgical masks at pharmacies.By the evening of Feb. 21, a 77-year-old retired roofer from Vo, a wine-making town in the Veneto region, had died — at the time, the first known fatality from a locally transmitted case of the virus in the West, setting off alarm bells far and wide.In the days and weeks that followed, densely populated Lombardy would become the epicenter of Italy’s outbreak and, by the end of March, countries the world over would be under lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus that has now taken 2.4 million lives. But Vo, as one of the first towns in the West to be isolated, has a unique story, providing some of the first scientific insights into the deadly virus.Adriano Trevisan’s death sent shockwaves through the town west of Venice. Trevisan, well-known around Vo and a regular at a card game in a local bar, had been hospitalized for two weeks with circulatory issues related to a heart condition that could not be resolved with drugs, according to his physician, Dr. Carlo Petruzzi. There was no reason to suspect the coronavirus — as the retiree had had no contact with China, until then a key element in diagnosis.After being advised of the death, Mayor Giuliano Martini, who doubles as the town’s chief pharmacist, ordered schools and nonessential businesses to close and forbade residents from leaving the town, even for work. He asked local volunteer groups to help ensure food and pharmaceutical supplies entering the town were ferried to shelves. The town's three family doctors were put into quarantine because of suspected contact, and the closest hospital, a 30-minute drive away, was closed.“It was like a war film,” Martini said. “We were completely alone.”Surrounded by vineyards and farmland, the town of 3,270 people nestled against Monte Venda has long enjoyed bucolic isolation. But by three days after Trevisan’s death, its isolation was ensured by government decree: Rome dispatched soldiers to seal the town's 12 access roads. Blockades were also set up around the 10 towns near Milan where the other early case of local transmission was confirmed.“There was a sense of bewilderment, I would call it,’’ said Dr. Luca Rossetto, one of the practitioners in Vo. “Even myself, with an old specialization in preventative hygiene, should have the right mindset. But there was an absolute disorientation.”Rossetto reviewed his recent cases and realized he had seen seven people in the previous days with pneumonia-like symptoms. A week later, the 69-year-old physician himself was hospitalized with the virus, a light case from which he recovered.Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia, meanwhile, instinctively ordered blanket testing for all of the residents of Vo, with the aim of understanding the outbreak’s origin. That he was even able to make such a call is thanks to the foresight of University of Padua virologist Andrea Crisanti, who had ordered the necessary tools after the virus appeared in China. Many places around the world struggled to institute testing so quickly.Crisanti recognized that there would be value in testing the entire town immediately after the contagion was confirmed and then again after two weeks. And his work offered early insight into how the virus spread — clarity that Crisanti said was never properly translated into action.The results of the first round of nasal swab tests, available on Feb. 27, showed that nearly 3% of the population had been infected. That indicated that the virus had been circulating in the town since the end of January, according to Crisanti.“With that data, we should have closed both Veneto and Lombardy, immediately,” Crisanti said. But decision-makers, he said, “didn’t perceive the extent of the problem.”The question of whether more more restrictions on movement should have been instituted sooner has been hotly debated in Italy, with many politicians noting that such decisions were extremely difficult given that the measures come with a heavy economic and social cost and infringe on freedoms. There is even a criminal investigation into whether officials waited too long to lock down two towns in Lombardy.Shutting down Vo proved remarkably effective in stopping the transmission. When Cristanti conducted the second round of testing on March 7, no new cases were detected.Cristanti said that the findings — which were published by the journal Nature in June but known to Italian officials immediately — made clear that isolation and mass testing were the best way to contain the virus before vaccines.While Crisanti succeeded in persuading the Veneto region to increase testing, it wasn’t until March 9 — 17 days after the virus had been simultaneously detected in two Italian regions, with cases multiplying and a mass exodus toward the south under way — that then-Premier Giuseppe Conte ordered the entire country on a near-total lockdown that would last seven weeks.By the end of May, as cases began to recede in Italy, more than 232,684 people had been infected, mostly in the north, and 33,415 had died.Scientists still don’t know how the virus arrived in Vo.Though struck at the same time, Veneto fared much better than Lombardy, which became the epicenter of both of Italy's surges. It has half the population and its industry is more spread out, but experts have also credited its health system, which enables close contact among family doctors, district administrators and hospital officials and which is less reliant on private facilities. Another key element in its virus fight was the testing system created by Crisanti.Crisanti urged the government in Rome in August to expand its capacity for nasal swab tests in the hopes of keeping transmission low after a successful lockdown. While the government has, Crisanti is disappointed that it has relied heavily on rapid tests — as many other places have and as some experts have recommended — rather than strategically deploying more reliable nasal swabs to isolate outbreaks.By October, Italy was battling a resurgence that has proved even deadlier than the spring peak, with the toll now at nearly 95,000 Italians. If the virus’s arrival last February caught the country off-guard, the long-predicted fall resurgence was “madness,” Crisanti said.Vo, too, suffered a resurgence that is only now abating. The town’s pandemic death toll doubled, to 6.Boasting an unusually high number of restaurants per capita at 45 eateries, Vo is now an echo of its former self. The weddings, baptisms and first communions that drew dwellers of nearby cities to the hillside town have been limited by restrictions. Restaurant closures also forced the Vo wine cooperative to reduce 2020 production. The local dance hall has never reopened.Things might have been different, Martini believes.“The virus in Vo arrived in Vo and died in Vo,” the mayor said of the first cases a year ago. The failure to repeat the model: “Ruinous,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-like-a-war-film-how-italian-town-with-first-known-virus-death-fared-101613730355919.html

The company has 65,000 active drivers in the UK.Shares in Uber were down 3% in premarket trading in New York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-top-court-rules-uber-drivers-are-workers-not-selfemployed-101613729737681.html
19-02-2021||World||Covid-19: Pledges made towards equitable supply of vaccines through Covax||Several countries, including the US and France, and drug companies have pledged to donate towards the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility or Covax initiative. In order to prevent hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines, WHO started the ambitious initiative of Covax. It was rolled out in April last year by the UN health body in collaboration with the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to help 180 poor countries.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has also highlighted the major inequality as he said more than 75 per cent of the Covid-19 vaccines have been administered by the rich nations.The first interim distribution forecast was released by Covax on February 3. The proposed coverage "is in line with the Facility target to reach at least 3% population coverage in all countries in the first half of the year, enough to protect the most vulnerable groups such as health care workers,” the forecast had said.Also Read | HELINA missile strikes 5 out 5, ready for inductionCovax aims to supply around 2 billion Covid-19 doses to low-income countries by the end of 2021. The initiative focuses on accelerated manufacture and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines for free and equitable access to all.Here what countries and companies have pledged towards Covax:1. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday has said that the country will donate surplus coronavirus vaccines to developing countries. The donation of the vaccines will be apart from the 548 million pounds donated to the program. Johnson also aims to encourage other countries to boost their funding to Covax during the G7 virtual meet.2. Novavax Inc will also supply 1.1 billion doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccines. Novavax with its manufacturing and distribution partner Serum Institute of India has pledged the commitment.3. The US has targeted a contribution of $4 billion to the global program for equitable inoculation. President Joe Biden will announce the commitment of funds during the Group of Seven call on Friday.4. France has also committed to donating 5 per cent of the secured Covid-19 vaccine supplies to low-income countries through Covax.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pledges-made-towards-equitable-supply-of-vaccines-through-covax-101613725129187.html

Now they will ask the general public to pay the charges of autopsy and even medical examination of rape victims. So the decision is not a welcome one," said a rights activist Tamur Kamal while talking to The Express Tribune.The proposed plan also suggested charges for keeping corpses in the cold storage to ₹1,500 per 24 hours. For DNA testing ₹18,000 has been fixed."For the district Peshawar autopsy cases the department will charge ₹5,000 per case while for the cases referred from other districts the charges will be ₹25,000 per post-mortem," said an official of the department, adding that for kinship and paternity test ₹20,000 fee has been proposed."For drug abuse analysis ₹3,000 charges have to be paid. Urine tests and alcohol analysis will cost ₹2,000. Test for poison detection to cost ₹4,000 while freezer charges for dead bodies will be ₹1,500 per 24 hours," he informed The Express Tribune.The unclaimed bodies are sent to the Khyber Medical College University for cold storage by the local police where they are stored sometimes for months till their identification and retrieval by the family.The Express Tribune reported that the decision to introduce 17 new charges was taken to meet the operational expenditures of the Forensic Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-charge-rape-victims-rs-25-000-for-medical-examination-101613725010020.html

MBS's prestige suffered a blow after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the hands of Saudi security personnel seen as close to the crown prince.Former US President Donald Trump maintained steady contact with the crown prince through his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defence-secretary-calls-saudi-crown-prince-reaffirms-strategic-ties-thanks-him-for-saudi-efforts-in-yemen-101613724311249.html

They have yet to ascertain a full list of live and dead animals sold legally or illegally at the market.Also read| Patanjali claims Coronil gets Ayush Ministry certification as per WHO schemeThe experts also insist that China carry out widespread testing of its mink farms after two-way transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between humans and minks was confirmed in Europe.The WHO expert team finished their four-week trip to China last week. At a press conference, they announced that any leak of the virus from a lab was unlikely, while the Wuhan wet market's role remains unclear. The investigators also doubted that bats had carried Covid-19 to the market, suggesting that there was an intermediate host.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-believes-badgers-rabbits-could-have-spread-covid-19-to-humans-101613723007608.html
19-02-2021||World||From bats to seafood market, what WHO coronavirus experts learned in Wuhan||A World Health Organization team has left China after gaining some new insights into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 2.3 million people — but with the major questions still unanswered.The visit was politically sensitive for China — which is concerned about any allegations it didn't handle the initial outbreak properly — and has been closely watched around the world.Team member Peter Daszak sounded upbeat on arriving at the airport Wednesday at the end of the four-week trip to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 cases were detected in December 2019.“We have clear leads on what the next steps should be," he said. "We know a lot more after the work that's been done.”The team's major conclusions seemed to confirm what most researchers had already surmised about the virus. The visit was never expected to definitively pinpoint the origin of the pandemic — an undertaking that, based on others, could take years.Here's a look at the theories the team explored during their visit:THE BATSThe mission to Wuhan did not change a major theory about where the virus came from. Scientists think bats are the most likely carriers, and that they passed it on to another animal, which passed it on to humans. While there are other possibilities — a bat could have infected a human directly, for instance — the path through a second animal remains the most likely scenario, according to the WHO team and its Chinese counterparts. The question is what animal and where.___THE MARKETThe Huanan Seafood Market had a cluster of cases at the start of the outbreak and was initially suspected as the place where people first became infected. The discovery of earlier cases has all but ruled out that theory, but researchers still want to know how this early cluster happened.The market dealt mainly in frozen seafood but also sold domesticated wildlife. That included rabbits, which are known to be susceptible to the virus, and bamboo rats and ferret badgers, which are suspected of being susceptible. At the WHO mission's closing news conference Tuesday, one team member said some of these animals have been traced to farms or traders in regions that are home to bats that carry the virus that is the closest known relative of the one that causes Covid-19.The virus could also have been introduced to the market by an infected person. Chinese health officials note that only surfaces at the market tested positive for the virus, not any of the animal products. A Chinese official said Tuesday there appeared to be cases elsewhere in Wuhan around the same time as the market cluster, so the transfer of the virus from animals to humans could have happened elsewhere.___THE LABThe Chinese and the international experts concluded it is extremely unlikely the virus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a lab with an extensive collection of virus samples. Former President Donald Trump and officials in his administration were among those who floated that possibility — prompting angry denials from China. And most experts have long been skeptical of it.In making its determination, the team said that such leaks are extremely rare and there's no evidence the virus existed in that lab or any lab anywhere in the world when the pandemic began. It also reviewed safety protocols at the institute, leading the team to conclude “it was very unlikely that anything could escape from such a place,” WHO team leader Peter Ben Embarek said.___THE COLD CHAINThe joint investigation left open the possibility that the virus could have been spread to humans through frozen food products, a bit of a surprise as foreign experts have generally played down the risk.It's a theory that has been widely promoted by Chinese officials, who have detected the virus on imported frozen food packaging and seized on that to suggest the virus could have come to China from abroad.WHO team member Marion Koopmans noted that it still wouldn't answer the question of where the virus came from originally. “Its not the cold chain by itself, that cannot be," she said at the airport. "The virus has to come from somewhere.”___THE DATAThe mission has been dogged by questions about how much freedom China would give the researchers to visit the places and talk to the people they wanted to. In the end, they appeared satisfied with the arrangements, at least in their public comments. Team member Thea Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-bats-to-seafood-market-what-who-coronavirus-experts-learned-in-wuhan-101613723141269.html
19-02-2021||World||Discussed Facebook news ban with PM Modi, says Australian PM||Australia and Facebook held high-stakes talks Friday after the social media giant sparked global outrage by blacking out news for its Australian users, as Canberra insisted it wouldn't back down on a new law that would force the tech firm to pay for journalistic content.From Thursday, Facebook has blanked out the pages of media outlets for Australian users and blocked them from sharing any news content, rather than submit to the proposed legislation.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had spoken with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday to find a way out of the showdown, and that negotiations would continue over the weekend."We talked through their remaining issues and agreed our respective teams would work through them immediately," Frydenberg said.Prime Minister Scott Morrison also urged Facebook to "move quickly past" what he called threatening behaviour and "come back to the table".He said his government's world-first legislation to force Facebook and Google to pay Australian media for news content published on their platforms was garnering interest from leaders around the world."People are looking at what Australia is doing," he said, noting that he had already discussed the situation with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canada's Justin Trudeau.The legislation, called the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code, was approved this week by the lower house of parliament and will be debated beginning Monday by the Senate, which is expected to adopt the law by the end of the week.Facebook has defended its dramatic response to the law, saying the legislation "fundamentally misunderstands" the platform's relationship with media organisations and that it had no choice but to bar news content from its services in Australia.Since the ban came into effect, visits to Australian news sites by users at home and abroad dropped significantly, with overseas traffic down by over 20 percent per day, according to data analytics company Chartbeat.The data also suggested users were not yet leaving Facebook in response to the ban, with no apparent rise in Google search traffic recorded.News Corp Australia Executive Chairman Michael Miller, speaking to a separate Senate inquiry in Canberra, said the full impact of Facebook's decision was yet to be felt by publishers.Yesterday saw referral traffic from the platform disappear, he said, while "direct traffic to our websites was up in double digits".Miller also encouraged the social media giant to return to direct negotiations with media outlets."The door is still open to Facebook."Facebook's sweeping ban drew widespread criticism for inadvertently blocking access to several critical government pages, including emergency services, health departments and the national weather service -- with most restored in the hours after it came into effect.Despite earlier threats to pull its services from Australia over the legislation, Google softened its stance and instead brokered several deals with large media companies, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-pm-morrison-says-he-has-discussed-facebook-news-ban-with-pm-modi-101613722476990.html

There, the company’s coronavirus vaccine is formulated and filled into vials before being shipped for distribution.Biden’s visit will be just his second trip away from the East Coast since taking office last month, following a Tuesday appearance in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at a CNN town hall. Last week, he toured the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, getting a first-hand look at federal research on the virus.Biden has regularly touted his administration’s progress accelerating vaccinations, and has encouraged any American with the opportunity to take a shot. “If you’re eligible, if it’s available, get the vaccine. Get the vaccine,” he said during the Tuesday town hall.The US has given about 1.67 million shots per day over the past week, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker, up from an average of roughly 900,000 per day in the week before Biden took office. Supply is increasing as Pfizer and Moderna Inc., the other company whose vaccine was granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, ramp up their production, as well as efforts led in part by the Biden administration to increase the number of people able to administer vaccines.Also read| Biden admn introduces immigration bill; Indian IT professionals to be benefitedSince taking office, Biden has ordered an additional 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, bringing the total to 300 million, which is enough for 150 million people. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines each require two doses. The president said Tuesday that Pfizer agreed to speed up shipments after Biden invoked the Defense Production Act, which enables the government to nationalize manufacturing in emergencies.Unlike Moderna, Pfizer declined full participation in the government’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine-development program under former President Donald Trump. Biden has since scrapped that name.Before Friday’s virtual meeting of the leaders of the Group of Seven nations, White House officials on Thursday said the US would immediately commit $2 billion to the effort known as Covax, which aims to help lower-income countries with vaccines. Biden will pledge an additional $2 billion through 2021 and 2022 on condition that other nations’ fulfill their commitments.A third vaccine, from Johnson & Johnson, would require only one shot but the administration said Wednesday that it sees its distribution starting out slowly once it’s authorised by the FDA, which will likely happen within a few days of a Feb. 26 meeting to consider the company’s application and clinical data.Also read| China's population ageing fast, may lift birth restrictions in some regionsIf the vaccine is authorized, the administration’s contract would be for 100 million doses by the end of June. White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said Wednesday that those deliveries would begin with just a few million doses and most distribution would be “back-end loaded.”Biden’s most recent visit to Michigan was during the final stretch of his campaign, on Oct. 31, when he and former President Barack Obama made joint appearances at rallies in Flint and Detroit. He won the state by more than 154,000 votes, which amounted to a 50.6% to 47.8% victory over Trump. Trump’s narrow 2016 win there, with a 0.23% margin over Hillary Clinton, was the first Republican presidential victory in the state since that of George H.W. Bush in 1988.While recent state races have also been close, Democrats currently hold the governorship as well as both Michigan Senate seats. Biden seriously considered Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who’s been in office since 2019, to be his running mate.During his first visit to the state after a group of militia members were arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap Whitmer, he said “there’s not a better governor in the United States of America” than her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-visit-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-plant-as-us-shots-accelerate-101613720012161.html

It has built artificial islands, Paracel and Spratly island chains in order to claim the 12 nautical miles of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In January this year, it passed a law that gave power to its coastguard to fire on foreign vessels and demolish structures built in disputed waters.Motegi expressed serious concern with regard to China's Coast Guard Law, and the four Ministers concurred to strongly oppose unilateral and forceful attempts to change the status quo in the context of the East and the South China Sea.The four Ministers concurred on further advancing practical cooperation in various areas such as quality infrastructure, maritime security, counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, education, and human resource development."The four Ministers reaffirmed their strong support for the "ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific", which is ASEAN's proactive efforts, and ASEAN's unity and centrality as well as the ASEAN-led regional architecture. They also welcomed proactive efforts by other countries including those in Europe toward a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific," read the release.Motegi also expressed grave concern for the deteriorating situation in Myanmar and explained that Japan was strongly urging the Myanmar military to immediately stop violence against citizens including shootings, release those who have been detained including State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and swiftly restore Myanmar's democratic political system. The four Ministers shared the view on the need to recover the democratic regime early, read the release.In addition, the four Ministers also exchanged views on regional issues such as North Korea as well as cooperation on global challenges including response to the COVID-19 and climate change.Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad is a four-member grouping of Australia, Japan, India, and the US. It is committed to respecting and upholding international rules and obligations through positive, practical engagement to protect and support the sovereignty, prosperity, and security of the Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-expresses-worry-over-china-s-attempts-to-alter-status-quo-in-indopacific-101613719536828.html

She had been on life support at a hospital with what doctors had said was no chance of recovery.Video of the shooting showed her sheltering from water cannons and suddenly dropping to the ground after a bullet penetrated a motorcycle helmet she had been wearing.The woman is the first confirmed death among the protesters who have faced off with security forces after a junta took power Feb. 1, detained Myanmar's elected leaders and prevented Parliament from convening.Her brother, Ye Htut Aung, who spoke to The Associated Press from a mortuary, said she died at 11:05 a.m. Friday. A source at Naypyitaw's 1000-Bed General Hospital, speaking on condition on anonymity because of fear of harassment from the authorities, confirmed the death.A spokesman for the ruling military at a news conference this week did not deny the 19-year-old woman had been shot by security forces, but said she was one of the crowd that had thrown rocks at police, and the case was under investigation. There were no independent accounts of her taking part in any violence.Protesters had already hailed Mya Thwet Thwet Khine as a hero and commemorated her during demonstrations earlier this week.Since the coup, the US and British governments have imposed sanctions targeting the new military leaders, and they and other governments and the United Nations have called for Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration to be restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19yearold-woman-shot-last-week-at-myanmar-protest-dies-101613717451631.html
19-02-2021||World||Biden administration introduces ambitious immigration bill in Congress; Indian IT professionals to be benefited||In a major move that will benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian IT professionals in America, the Biden administration has introduced an ambitious immigration bill in Congress which among other things proposes to eliminate the per-country cap for employment-based green cards.The US Citizenship Act of 2021 proposes a pathway to citizenship to 11 million undocumented workers, elimination of per country quota for employment-based green cards and work authorisation for dependents of H-1B foreign workers.The bicameral immigration bill, if passed by both the chambers of the Congress – House of Representatives and the Senate – and signed into law by President Joe Biden, would bring citizenship to millions of foreign nationals, including undocumented workers and those who came to the country legally.The legislation would also benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian IT professionals and their families.Those waiting for a Green Card for more than 10 years, would get the legal permanent residency immediately as they would be exempted from the visa cap.Indian IT professionals, waiting for more than a decade now, and whose number runs into thousands, are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this provision of the bill.Authors of the bill – Senator Bob Menendez and Congresswoman Linda Sanchez – told reporters that the US Citizenship Act of 2021 establishes a moral and economic imperative and a vision of immigration reform that is expansive and inclusive.It grows the economy by making changes to the employment-based immigration system, eliminating per-country caps, making it easier for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) advanced degree holders from US universities to stay in the US and improving access to green cards for workers in lower-wage industries.It would also give dependents of H-1B holders work authorisation, and prevent children of H-1B holders from "ageing out" of the system.“I am the daughter of immigrant parents from Mexico. I have dedicated my career to building an immigration system that lets people live without fear, and a system that gives immigrants – like my parents – who sought a better life and contribute to our nation a fair opportunity to thrive,” Sanchez said.“Immigrants contribute greatly to our country and society. They own businesses, pay taxes and teach our children. They are our coworkers, neighbours and friends,” said Menendez.“We have a historic opportunity to finally enact bold immigration reform that leaves no one behind, addresses root causes of migration and safeguards our country’s national security. We have a moral and economic imperative to get this done once and for all,” he said.The ruling Democrats have a majority in both the House and Senate. However, in the upper chamber, they need the support of 10 Republicans to get the legislation through the Congress before it can be signed into law.The Democratic leadership and the White House hope that they will get the necessary support in the interest of millions of non-citizens living in the country.Supported by the White House, the bill creates an earned roadmap to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants, with an expedited three-year path to citizenship, and giving all other undocumented immigrants who pass background checks and pay taxes with an eight-year path to citizenship without fear of deportation.It reforms the family-based immigration system to keep families together by recapturing visas from previous years to clear backlogs, including spouses and children of green card holders as immediate family members.It also eliminates discrimination facing LGBTQ families, provides protection for orphans, widows and children, allows immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join the family in the US on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.In a statement, President Biden said he looks forward to working with leaders in the House and Senate to address the wrongdoings of the past administration and restore justice, humanity and order to the immigration system.“This is an important first step in pursuing immigration policies that unite families, grow and enhance our economy, and safeguard our security,” he said.“The legislation I sent to Congress will bring about much-needed change to an immigration system where reform is long overdue. It will responsibly manage the border with smart investments."It will address the root causes of irregular migration from Central America. It will modernise our legal immigration pathways and create an earned path to citizenship for so many – including Dreamers, farm workers and TPS (Temporary Protected Status) holders,” he said“These are not Democratic or Republican priorities, but American ones. I have laid out my vision for what it will take to reform our immigration system and I look forward to working with leaders in Congress to get this done,” Biden added.Commenting on the development, FWD.us president Todd Schulte said it is a critical moment for immigration policy in the US. FWD.us is a pro-immigration lobbying group based in the United State.“This is a substantial step forward for major immigration legislation and would provide a desperately-needed pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants who have spent decades building their lives and families here," Schulte said.FWD.us represents top IT companies from Silicon Valley.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described it as a hopeful and historic day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-introduces-ambitious-immigration-bill-in-congress-indian-it-professionals-to-be-benefited-101613716185043.html
19-02-2021||World||After Basmati Pakistan all set to register Himalayan pink salt for GI tag||Pakistan has decided to register Himalayan pink salt as Geographical Indications (GI) to prevent its unauthorised use by other countries.A GI tag is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess origin-based qualities and reputation in the region.The precious salt is extracted from the Salt Range in Punjab which extends along the south of the Potohar Plateau and the north of the Jhelum River.The decision was taken in a meeting with the Intellectual Property Organisation (IPO) Pakistan chaired by Commerce Adviser Razak Dawood. IPO Chairman Mujeeb Ahmed Khan also attended the meeting, the Dawn newspaper reported on Friday.An official announcement said that during the meeting, GI registration of products from various regions of Pakistan was discussed. The move aims to curb unauthorised use of Pakistan’s GI by other countries.Pink Himalayan salt is said to be loaded with minerals that are beneficial to health.Pakistan is fighting a case in the 27-member European Union against India's move to get Basmati rice registered as its product.“We decided that, after registration of rice, pink salt from the Salt Range mountains of Pakistan will be registered as GI,” the adviser said, adding that this will encourage and motivate our producers to expand their business at a global level.For this, a registrant would be designated with the approval of the Cabinet. Similarly, a list of other products on a priority basis will be pursued.“We urge our business community to identify and inform IPO of other products that can be registered as GI in order to protect them for realising their export potential,”Dawood said.The commerce adviser expressed satisfaction at the progress made and reiterated the importance of GI registration for various products.The registration of GI products will serve as a potential economic tool to promote and enhance national and international trade of Pakistan.Speedy registration will protect GIs of Pakistan and eradicate the possibility of violation of these products, the adviser said.He further advised the commerce ministry to double its efforts for registration of potential products as GI on a priority basis, it said.In January, Pakistan received the GI tag for its Basmati, paving the way for creating a local registry for the particular strain of rice and making a case in the international market, as the country fights a case in the EU against India's move to get Basmati rice registered as its product.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-basmati-pakistan-all-set-to-register-himalayan-pink-salt-for-gi-tag-101613716226035.html
19-02-2021||World||China's population ageing fast, may lift birth restrictions in some regions||China is considering lifting all restrictions on births in its northeast provinces as the next step in attempts to arrest the falling birthrate in the rapidly aging society.The northeast region can implement a “comprehensive birth policy pilot plan,” the country’s National Health Commission suggested in a statement from last August that was released Thursday. China has a history of testing new policies in a few areas and then rolling them out nationwide if successful.China’s population is aging more quickly than most of the world’s developed economies due to decades of family planning aimed at halting population growth. Even with the loosening of those policies in recent years the birthrate has continued to decline, dropping in 2019 to the lowest level since at least 1949.It likely continued to fall in 2020, with the number of newborn babies registered with the police dropping by about 15%. Full data will be released in April.The news helped boost the share prices of related companies Friday, with formula maker Beingmate Co., maternity and children’s supplies retailer Shanghai Aiyingshi Co. and toy manufacturer Goldlok Holdings Guangdong Co. up by their 10% daily limit. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was little changed as of 1:50 p.m.The Communist Party has already signaled its willingness to further relax birth restrictions during the 14th Five-Year Plan period that starts this year, urging an “inclusive” birth policy at a Party conclave held in late October.The northeast provinces have some of the country’s lowest birthrates, and the commission said they can conduct research on how lifting birth restrictions would impact the local economy and social stability. However, the statement noted that the desire to have children is low in the region despite the current relatively loose restrictions.“Socioeconomic factors have become an important factor affecting births, especially economic burdens, infant and child care, and female career development,” according to the statement, which called for improved public services and steps to address the concerns families have about raising children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-population-ageing-fast-may-lift-birth-restrictions-in-some-regions-101613715753819.html
19-02-2021||World||Massive breach fuels calls for US action on cybersecurity||Jolted by a sweeping hack that may have revealed government and corporate secrets to Russia, U.S. officials are scrambling to reinforce the nation’s cyber defenses and recognizing that an agency created two years ago to protect America’s networks and infrastructure lacks the money, tools and authority to counter such sophisticated threats.The breach, which hijacked widely used software from Texas-based SolarWinds Inc., has exposed the profound vulnerability of civilian government networks and the limitations of efforts to detect threats.It's also likely to unleash a wave of spending on technology modernization and cybersecurity.“It’s really highlighted the investments we need to make in cybersecurity to have the visibility to block these attacks in the future,” Anne Neuberger, the newly appointed deputy national security adviser for cyber and emergency technology said Wednesday at a White House briefing.The reaction reflects the severity of a hack that was disclosed only in December. The hackers, as yet unidentified but described by officials as “likely Russian,” had unfettered access to the data and email of at least nine U.S. government agencies and about 100 private companies, with the full extent of the compromise still unknown. And while this incident appeared to be aimed at stealing information, it heightened fears that future hackers could damage critical infrastructure, like electrical grids or water systems.President Joe Biden plans to release an executive order soon that Neuberger said will include about eight measures intended to address security gaps exposed by the hack. The administration has also proposed expanding by 30% the budget of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, or CISA, a little-known entity now under intense scrutiny because of the SolarWinds breach.Republicans and Democrats in Congress have called for expanding the size and role of the agency, a component of the Department of Homeland Security. It was created in November 2018 amid a sense that U.S. adversaries were increasingly targeting civilian government and corporate networks as well as the “critical” infrastructure, such as the energy grid that is increasingly vulnerable in a wired world.Speaking at a recent hearing on cybersecurity, Rep. John Katko, a Republican from New York, urged his colleagues to quickly "find a legislative vehicle to give CISA the resources it needs to fully respond and protect us.”Biden’s Covid-19 relief package called for $690 billion more for CISA, as well as providing the agency with $9 billion to modernize IT across the government in partnership with the General Services Administration.That has been pulled from the latest version of the bill because some members didn’t see a connection to the pandemic. But Rep. Jim Langevin, co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said additional funding for CISA is likely to reemerge with bipartisan support in upcoming legislation, perhaps an infrastructure bill.“Our cyber infrastructure is every bit as important as our roads and bridges,” Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, said in an interview. “It’s important to our economy. It’s important to protecting human life, and we need to make sure we have a modern and resilient cyber infrastructure.”CISA operates a threat-detection system known as “Einstein" that was unable to detect the SolarWinds breach. Brandon Wales, CISA's acting director, said that was because the breach was hidden in a legitimate software update from SolarWinds to its customers. After it was able to identify the malicious activity, the system was able to scan federal networks and identify some government victims. “It was designed to work in concert with other security programs inside the agencies,” he said.The former head of CISA, Christopher Krebs, told the House Homeland Security Committee this month that the U.S. should increase support to the agency, in part so it can issue grants to state and local governments to improve their cybersecurity and accelerate IT modernization across the federal government, which is part of the Biden proposal.“Are we going to stop every attack? No. But we can take care of the most common risks and make the bad guys work that much harder and limit their success,” said Krebs, who was ousted by then-President Donald Trump after the election and now co-owns a consulting company whose clients include SolarWinds.The breach was discovered in early December by the private security firm FireEye, a cause of concern for some officials.“It was pretty alarming that we found out about it through a private company as opposed to our being able to detect it ourselves to begin with,” Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, said at her January confirmation hearing.Right after the hack was announced, the Treasury Department bypassed its normal competitive contracting process to hire the private security firm CrowdStrike, U.S. contract records show. The department declined to comment. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has said that dozens of email accounts of top officials at the agency were hacked.The Social Security Administration hired FireEye to do an independent forensic analysis of its network logs. The agency had a “backdoor code” installed like other SolarWinds customers, but “there were no indicators suggesting we were targeted or that a future attack occurred beyond the initial software installation,” spokesperson Mark Hinkle said.Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the hack has highlighted several failures at the federal level but not necessarily a lack of expertise by public sector employees. Still, “I doubt we will ever have all the capacity we’d need in-house,” he said.There have been some new cybersecurity measures taken in recent months. In the defense policy bill that passed in January, lawmakers created a national director of cybersecurity, replacing a position at the White House that had been cut under Trump, and granted CISA the power to issue administrative subpoenas as part of its efforts to identify vulnerable systems and notify operators.The legislation also granted CISA increased authority to hunt for threats across the networks of civilian government agencies, something Langevin said they were only previously able to do when invited.“In practical terms, what that meant is they weren’t invited in because no department or agency wants to look bad,” he said. “So you know what was happening? Everyone was sticking their heads in the sand and hoping that cyberthreats were going to go away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-breach-fuels-calls-for-us-action-on-cybersecurity-101613715625967.html
19-02-2021||World||Joe Biden's immigration agenda takes shape as bill unveiled||President Joe Biden’s proposed immigration overhaul was introduced in Congress on Thursday, kicking off what will likely be one of his most difficult legislative challenges.The legislation, known as the US Citizenship Act of 2021, hews closely to the outline that Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office. The proposal includes an eight-year path to citizenship for most of the roughly 11 million immigrants living illegally in the US, bolsters the nation’s refugee and asylum systems and calls for additional technology to be used to help secure the southern border.The citizenship path is not conditional on the implementation of border security measures, which had been a trade-off included in past immigration bills designed to earn Republican support.Representative Linda Sánchez, a California Democrat, sponsored the bill in the House and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez is its chief sponsor in the Senate.Previous attempts to reform the nation’s immigration system have failed over the past two decades, and Biden’s bill could face an even more daunting path because GOP lawmakers’ opposition to legalizing undocumented immigrants, which they decry as amnesty, hardened during the Trump era.The White House previously signaled it is open to breaking the package into pieces and presenting them separately in order to win over at least some Republicans. Biden said in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday that smaller measures could help fix the system “in the meantime.”Yet his team plans to defer to leaders in the House and Senate on the best path forward, including whether to try to use a procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to pass it with only Democratic votes while building support for broader legislation. The Democrats are employing the reconciliation process to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.Menendez said Thursday during a virtual press conference that it’s time to go big on an immigration overhaul after calling former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies “a cornerstone of Trump’s hateful horror show.”“It’s time to bring all 11 million undocumented out of the shadows,” he said, calling them essential workers who should not be left behind by piecemeal efforts. “We are not going to make concessions out of the gate. We are not going to start with 2 million.”Menendez said lawmakers won’t know if they can get 60 votes in the Senate until they try, which would be necessary to vote on the bill without using the reconciliation process.“We will never win an argument we don’t have the courage to make,” he said.Menendez said some Republicans want portions of the package — like provisions for farm workers or tech workers — but he made clear he wants a broad path to citizenship in return. It’s possible portions of the package could eventually move separately, including in a second budget reconciliation bill Democrats are planning on later this year, which would not need Republican votes, the senator said.Menendez said there is a strong argument to be made that some provisions should be eligible because immigration has substantial budget impacts. Senate rules restrict what kinds of provisions can be included in a bill moving through reconciliation.“We are not foreclosing any pathway,” Menendez said.Several other bills could serve as vehicles to move parts of the Biden plan.A bipartisan group of lawmakers has reintroduced the Dream Act, which would offer deportation protections and a citizenship path to immigrants, known as Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the US as children. Democrats have also supported legislation that would offer immediate relief to farmworkers.Biden’s proposal makes Dreamers, farmworkers and migrants with Temporary Protected Status eligible to apply for permanent legal residence right away, which would allow them to apply for citizenship within three years. That faster path to citizenship is meant to signal that those groups are important, but it doesn’t mean the White House has decided to pursue piecemeal bills to protect them, an administration official said on Wednesday.Only immigrants who were in the country on or before Jan. 1, 2021 would be eligible for the legalization process.Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas is also introducing a bill that would offer permanent legal status to about 5 million undocumented immigrants who have worked in front-line jobs during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as so-called Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status.The Menendez-Sánchez bill would expand legal immigration for those seeking employment- and family-based visas by clearing backlogs of those waiting for green cards, lifting per-country visa caps, and exempting spouses and minor children from annual green card quotas. It includes a pilot program that creates 10,000 new visas for workers to help spur economic development in certain parts of the country.It also contains provisions designed to please labor unions, which have in the past complained that certain visa programs allow companies to employ lower-paid migrant workers instead of American citizens. The bill would tie green card levels to macroeconomic conditions and establish a commission on workplace conditions comprised of union officials, civil rights advocates and others, administration officials said.Biden has already signed a number of executive actions intended to roll back Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, including reversing a travel ban on some predominately Muslim nations, allowing certain asylum seekers to start entering the US while their cases are being processed and beginning the process of winding down Trump’s “public charge” rule, which sought to deny green cards to immigrants who used Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of government assistance.The president also ordered construction halted on Trump’s wall at the Mexican border. Biden's proclamation rescinded the national emergency that Trump declared to secure funding for the project.The current administration is facing pressure from business groups to end Trump’s bans on most work visas, which the former president put in place shortly after the pandemic hit the US. The White House has put the visa bans under review but has yet to revoke them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-immigration-agenda-takes-shape-as-bill-unveiled-101613713200725.html
19-02-2021||World||Covid-19: US President Joe Biden to commit $4bn to Covax that favours India||US President Joe Biden will announce on Friday a total contribution of $4 billion to the Covax facility, a programme backed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines around the world that his predecessor Donald Trump had spurned over his feud with the global health body.India is the largest beneficiary of Covax, clinching a deal earlier this month to receive 97.1 million of the 2 billion doses to be distributed under the programme, according to an agreement announced earlier in February. Covax is a collaboration involving the WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).Biden will announce the new contribution during a virtual meeting of the G7, according to a senior administration official.The first tranche of $2 billion will go to Gavi, the White House said in a note. The remaining $2 billion will be released over 2021 and 2022. The first lot of $500 million will be paid after initial donor pledges are fulfilled and first vaccine doses have been delivered.“In close cooperation with Gavi, this additional $2 billion in funding will serve to expand Covax’s reach,” the White House note said. “We also call on our G7 and other partners to work alongside Gavi, to bring in billions more in resources to support global Covid-19 vaccination, and to target urgent vaccine manufacturing, supply, and delivery needs.”Former US president Donald Trump had kept the United States out of this programme as he had fought with the WHO for what he had called partisan support of China’s misleading initial claims and statements about the origins of the coronavirus. Trump had terminated US funding for the WHO - as its biggest contributor – in the middle of the deadliest pandemic to hit the world in more than 100 years.It turned out to be a part of a pattern that defined his legacy - the US left Unesco, the Paris Agreement on climate, the Iran nuclear deal, and UN human rights council during his tenure.On his first day in office, Biden announced that the US will rejoin the Paris Agreement and the WHO. He has since vowed to return the US to the world stage and reclaim its leadership role that was forsaken by Trump as he had sought to pursue an America-first agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-president-joe-biden-to-commit-4bn-to-covax-that-favours-india-101613710607511.html

The 63-year-old Nazir is on trial at Sheffield Crown Court charged with a number of sexual offences."Nazir has denied two counts of attempting to rape a girl under 16, indecent assault of a boy under 14 and raping a boy under 16," the UK media report said.Besides Nazir, his two brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 70, and Mohammed Tariq, 65, are also accused of the "indecent assault" but are not fit to plead and face a trial of the facts.Reportedly, the allegations came to light in 2016 when a man and a woman contacted the police, more than 40 years after the alleged assaults took place. As things stand, the ongoing trial is expected to last three weeks after the defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges.Also read| Rich nations stockpiling a billion more Covid-19 shots than needed: ReportIn November last year, Nazir had announced his retirement from the Upper House of the UK's Parliament amid charges of sexual misconduct. Nazir had resigned amid reports that a House of Lords Conduct Committee recommended that he should have been expelled."...Lord Ahmed breached the Code of Conduct by failing to act on his personal honour in the discharge of his parliamentary activities by agreeing to use his position as a member of the House to help a member of the public but then; sexually assaulting the complainant, lying to the complainant about his intentions to help her with a complaint to the Metropolitan Police regarding exploitation by a faith healer, exploiting the complainant emotionally and sexually despite knowing she was vulnerable," stated the committee's report.Though Nazir's tainted credentials are well known, the Pakistani media had covered up his ouster as voluntary retirement.Nazir is not new to controversies. The 63-year-old was born in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir but migrated to the UK as a child with his parents. He has been an ardent supporter of Khalistani terror groups and a critic of the Indian government's policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-british-pakistani-peer-sexually-abused-two-children-in-1970s-report-101613708169624.html

The government is raising surveillance against mutant varieties as they may be more resistant to vaccines, which Japan started to distribute this week."It may be more contagious than conventional strains, and if it continues to spread domestically, it could lead to a rapid rise in cases," Kato said.The new strain appears to have originated overseas but is different from other types that have been found sporadically in Japan, according to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. It has the E484K mutation on the spike protein of the virus that has been found in other variants, which may undermine the effectiveness of vaccines.Japan has reported 151 cases of variants from Britain, South Africa and Brazil, according to the health ministry. The nation has had more than 400,000 cases of Covid-19 with 7,194 fatalities.Meanwhile, 5 staff and 39 foreign detainees at a Tokyo immigration facility have tested positive for Covid-19.All 130 detainees at the facility have been tested for the virus, according to a spokesperson for the Tokyo Regional Immigration Bureau. None of the cases is serious, and all infected detainees remain quarantined from others.The representative declined to comment on the nationality of the infected detainees, citing privacy concerns.Japan's detention system for immigration law violators and asylum seekers has been widely criticized for its medical standards, monitoring of detainees and response to emergencies."Many detainees are locked in a small, closed spaces," said Motoko Yamagishi, the head of a migrants-rights group.

19-02-2021||World||Oil rally may be just what Putin needs to keep Russians happy||Rising oil prices and a weak ruble could provide the Kremlin with as much as $33 billion in extra cash for social spending this year, giving Vladimir Putin the financial wherewithal to help head off growing public discontent.Thanks to a 25% price surge this year, Russia now receives more rubles per barrel of Brent crude than any time since mid-2019. If oil remains high, the windfall would be enough to allow the budget to receive an extra 2.3% of gross domestic product, according to Sova Capital in Moscow.“It’s very important to stimulate business and consumers whose disposable incomes were down last year,” said Artem Zaigrin, chief economist at Sova Capital in Moscow. “Without additional funding, there are risks that the economic recovery will fade.”Amid growing tensions with the West and fears of new sanctions, Putin has been reluctant to spend heavily in recent years, even during the pandemic. Stagnant living standards have helped fuel public anger at the Kremlin, which has boiled over into the biggest nationwide protests in years and poses a challenge for Putin’s ruling party in parliamentary elections this fall.So far, the Kremlin says it aims to stick with its earlier plan to cut spending this year and next, reversing most of the pandemic increase, in order to limit borrowing, as well as vulnerability to more Western sanctions on its debt. Any oil windfall usually goes straight to a rainy-day fund.But after a decade of stagnating incomes, pressure is growing to spend more money. Just last week, the Kremlin changed the rules so it can add expenditure to the budget without approval from parliament.Non-energy revenue was higher than expected last year after Russia experienced one of the smallest contractions of major economies, so there will also be leftover budget money to spend in 2021.It’s premature to start thinking about extra spending since it isn’t clear yet if oil prices will stay high, said Alexandra Suslina, a budget specialist at the Economic Expert Group, a Moscow think tank. “It seems like a populist move ahead of the elections,” she said.The Russian president may announce new spending measures at his annual address to the nation expected in the next few weeks. So far, however, his spokesman has denied reports of plans to announce more expenditures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-rally-may-be-just-what-putin-needs-to-keep-russians-happy-101613709173208.html

While India had previously stated that 20 of its soldiers died in the clash, Beijing had acknowledged casualties but had not disclosed details.India posthumously honoured five Indian Army soldiers, who blocked PLA aggression to capture territory in east Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 last year, with gallantry medals on Republic Day this year.In the seven-hour conflict along the Line of Actual Control, the first in more than five decades, Indian soldiers had retaliated in full measure when the Chinese troops refused to withdraw from a location near Patrolling Point 14 in line with the agreement reached between the two countries and triggered the clash. The PLA troops had come prepared with barbed wire sticks and spears.At its peak, the violent clash involved more than 600 rival soldiers with a majority of casualties on both sides due to hypothermia with the soldiers getting pushed out of the cliff into the freezing Galwan river.Also read | Face-off between India and China in Galwan valley: Here’s what we knowFrom the start of the skirmish, India had maintained that China tried to change the status quo as the PLA troops tried to transgress into Indian territory near the southern bank of Pangong Tso. The Chinese state media has consistently blamed India for the clash – an allegation that has been firmly and consistently denied by New Delhi.After months of disengagement talks, the two nuclear powers earlier this month agreed to pull back their troops, tanks and other equipment from the banks of Pangong Tso in the Ladakh region. Disengagement between rival soldiers deployed on heights on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso began on February 10 and is nearing completion.While PLA has retreated to its base east of Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, India is moving back to its permanent position near Finger 3. Neither side will patrol the contested areas in between until an agreement is reached through future talks.In a statement in Parliament on February 11, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that structures built by both sides after April 2020 at heights on both banks of the lake will be removed. PLA had set up scores of structures in the Finger Area including bunkers, pillboxes, observation posts and tented camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-4-soldiers-killed-in-galwan-clash-with-india-reveals-their-name-report-101613699636347.html
19-02-2021||World||Rich nations stockpiling a billion more Covid-19 shots than needed: Report||Rich countries are on course to have over a billion more doses of Covid-19 vaccines than they need, leaving poorer nations scrambling for leftover supplies as the world seeks to curb the coronavirus pandemic, a report by anti-poverty campaigners found on Friday.In an analysis of current supply deals for Covid-19 vaccines, the ONE Campaign said wealthy countries, such as the United States and Britain, should share the excess doses to "supercharge" a fully global response to the pandemic.The advocacy group, which campaigns against poverty and preventable diseases, said a failure to do so would deny billions of people essential protection from the Covid-19-causing virus and likely prolong the pandemic.The report looked specifically at contracts with the five leading Covid-19 vaccine makers - Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax.It found that to date, the United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan have already secured more than 3 billion doses - over a billion more than the 2.06 billion needed to give their entire populations two doses.Also read| Harris taps growing political power of women lawmakers; promotes Covid-19 relief"This huge excess is the embodiment of vaccine nationalism," said Jenny Ottenhoff, ONE Campaign's senior director for policy. "Rich countries understandably hedged their bets on vaccines early in the pandemic but with these bets paying off in spades, a massive course correction is needed if we are going to protect billions of people around the world," she added.The analysis found that, along with other Covid vaccine supplies procured by the global COVAX vaccine-sharing plan and in bilateral deals, the excess rich-country doses would go a long way to protecting vulnerable people in poorer countries.This would significantly reduce the risk of deaths from Covid-19, it said, as well as limiting the chances of new virus variants emerging and accelerating an end to the pandemic.The World Health Organization on Thursday urged nations with vaccines not to share them unilaterally, but to donate them to the global COVAX scheme to ensure fairness. The One Campaign report found that with current supply deals, Australia, Canada, US, UK and European states would be available to share Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rich-nations-stockpiling-a-billion-more-covid-19-shots-than-needed-report-101613695996589.html
19-02-2021||World||Joe Biden rolling out plan for $4 billion global Covid-19 vaccine effort||Joe Biden will use his first big presidential moment on the global stage at Friday's Group of Seven meeting of world leaders to announce that the US will soon begin releasing $4 billion for an international effort to bolster the purchase and distribution of coronavirus vaccine to poor nations, White House officials said.Biden will also encourage G-7 partners to make good on their pledges to COVAX, an initiative by the World Health Organization to improve access to vaccines, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview Biden's announcement.Former President Donald Trump declined to participate in the COVAX initiative because of its ties to WHO, the Geneva-based agency that Trump accused of covering up China's missteps in handling the virus at the start of the public health crisis. Trump pulled the US out of the WHO, but Biden moved quickly after his inauguration last month to rejoin and confirmed that the US would contribute to COVAX.The $4 billion in U.S. funding was approved by Congress in December and will be distributed through 2022.The US is committed to working through COVAX to ensure “equitable distribution of vaccines and funding globally,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday.It remains to be seen how G-7 allies will take Biden's calls for greater international cooperation on vaccine distribution given that the U.S. refused to take part in the initiative under Trump and that there are growing calls for the Biden administration to distribute some US-manufactured vaccine supplies overseas.French President Emmanuel Macron, in an interview Thursday with the Financial Times, called on the US and European nations to allocate up to 5% of current vaccine supplies to developing countries — the kind of vaccine diplomacy that China and Russia have begun deploying.And earlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sharply criticized the “ wildly uneven and unfair” distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, noting 10 countries have administered 75% of all vaccinations.Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also raised with Biden the prospect of Canada getting the vaccine from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer's facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, according to a senior Canadian government official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.Canada has been getting all its Pfizer doses from a company facility in Puurs, Belgium, and has experienced disruptions in supply.But Biden, who announced last week that the US will have enough supply of the vaccine by the end of the summer to inoculate 300 million people, remains focused for now on making sure every American is inoculated, administration officials say.The president, in his first national security memorandum last month, called for his administration to develop a framework to donate surplus vaccines once there is a sufficient supply in the US.The COVAX program has already missed its own goal of beginning coronavirus vaccinations in poor countries at the same time that shots were rolled out in rich countries. WHO says COVAX needs $5 billion in 2021.Guterres said Wednesday that 130 countries have not received a single dose of the vaccine and declared that “at this critical moment, vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community.”The Group of Seven industrialized nations are the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Canada and Italy. Friday's meeting of the G-7, the first of Biden's presidency, is being held virtually.In addition to discussing vaccine distribution, Biden also plans to use the meeting to discuss G-7 countries' collective competitiveness and economic challenges posed by China, according to the White House.Biden is also scheduled to deliver a virtual address to the Munich Security Conference on Friday before traveling to Michigan to visit Pfizer's vaccine manufacturing facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-rolling-out-plan-for-4-billion-global-covid-19-vaccine-effort-101613697370739.html

19-02-2021||World||Australian news sites' traffic falls after Facebook blocks content: Report||Total web traffic to Australian news sites dropped by around 13% after Facebook Inc blocked their content on the social media platform this week, according to early data that underscores the outsize impact the US company has on the local market.The data from New York-based analytics firm Chartbeat showed that a pickup in traffic to news sites from Google was outweighed by a significant slump in traffic from Facebook."Unfortunately, Facebook's disappearance has resulted in a hit to publishers' traffic numbers: when Facebook traffic dropped off, overall Australian traffic did not shift to other platforms," a Chartbeat spokeswoman said.The Chartbeat data, which compared both domestic and foreign traffic to around 250 Australian news publishers on Wednesday before the ban to Thursday, provides some of the first tangible evidence of the impact of Facebook's move.The social media giant on Wednesday barred users from sharing or reading news from Australian publishers on its platform in protest of a looming law that will force it and Alphabet Inc's Google to pay publishers for content.Google and Facebook had campaigned together against the laws, which are expected to be passed by parliament within days, and both threatened to cancel services in Australia. Google, however, sealed pre-emptive deals with several media outlets in recent days.Total traffic to the Australian news sites from various platforms used outside the country fell by about 30%, the Chartbeat data showed.Chartbeat said that the percentage of traffic in Australia to the news sites from Google Search rose from around 26% on the day before the ban to about 34% afterward, while traffic from Facebook fell from around 21% to about 2%.The analytics firm said that it counts Australian Broadcasting Corp and Australian Community Media among the publishers it works with, but could not say if any specific publishers were included in this data.The Chartbeat data also found that the percentage of traffic to news sites coming from Facebook outside of Australia fell from around 30% to about 4%, while Google Search grew from around 38% to about 52%.The Chartbeat spokeswoman said foreign readership of Australian news sites is driven heavily by Facebook, with historical data showing around 15% of visits to Australian publishers being driven by Facebook compared to 12% of visits to publishers globally.A 2020 University of Canberra study found 21% of Australians use social media as their primary news source and 39% of the population uses Facebook to receive news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-news-sites-traffic-falls-after-facebook-blocks-content-report-101613696619619.html
19-02-2021||World||Uber faces UK Supreme Court ruling on worker rights in gig economy test||Britain's Supreme Court will rule on Friday in a battle over workers' rights at taxi app Uber that could have ramifications for millions of people in the gig economy.In a case led by two drivers, a London employment tribunal ruled in 2016 that they were due entitlements such as the minimum wage, paid holidays and rest breaks.The Silicon Valley-based company appealed the decision all the way to Britain's top court which will provide its verdict from 0945 GMT on Friday.Uber drivers are currently treated as self-employed, meaning that in law they are only afforded minimal protections.If the firm loses, it could still take several months for the details to be worked out following a further employment tribunal hearing, depending on the nature of the Supreme Court's decision."It would involve them working out exactly how many hours they worked, how much they got paid for those hours and identifying occasions when that meant that they were paid less than the minimum wage," Matt McDonald, a partner who specialises in employment disputes at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, told Reuters.Also read| Australia to hold talks with Facebook’s Zuckerberg after block"As an administrative job for the courts, it's a messy one," he said.A total of 25 drivers form part of an expanded group who are part of the case. Uber has around 60,000 drivers in Britain, including 45,000 in London, one of its most important markets.A win, however, would be a major boost to it and several transportation, delivery and courier companies which use a similar business model, including food service firm Deliveroo and taxi rival Addison Lee.The gig economy, where people tend to work for one or more companies on a job-by-job basis, has faced criticism from unions who say it is exploitative whilst businesses cite flexibility as an advantage.Uber saw off a challenge in its home market of California in November when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers' status as independent contractors, not employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-faces-uk-supreme-court-ruling-on-worker-rights-in-gig-economy-test-101613693279869.html
19-02-2021||World||Pakistan asks India to allow neutral international observers to visit J-K||Pakistan on Thursday urged India to let neutral international observers visit Kashmir and assess the situation on ground by free interaction with the Kashmiri people.Foreign Office Spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri made the comments during the weekly briefing here.Envoys from several countries, including member states of the European Union and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) visited Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday and Thursday to assess the ground situation in view of the efforts made to restore normalcy by strengthening democratically-elected local bodies.India has told Pakistan that it has no locus standi to comment on internal affairs of India, asserting that the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been and will remain an integral part of the country.Chaudhri said that India should allow UN observers, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the OIC Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission, and the international media to visit Kashmir and assess the situation on ground by free interaction with the Kashmiri people.Earlier this month, spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said that India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.To a question about India prohibiting the Sikh Yatris to visit Pakistan for religious purposes, he said Pakistan provides maximum facilitation to the Sikh Yatris from all over the world, including India, for visiting their religious sites in Pakistan.“We believe that India should also facilitate Sikh Yatris for visiting their religious sites in Pakistan,” Chaudhri said.On Wednesday, India denied permission to around 600 Sikh pilgrims to visit Pakistan, citing the security and COVID-19 situation in the country.Chaudhri said that a workshop on “Exchange of Good Practices in tackling COVID Pandemic and the Way Forward” was organised for SAARC member countries plus Mauritius and Seychelles in a virtual format.“In line with its policy of enhanced regional and international cooperation in dealing with the pandemic, Pakistan is also participating in the said workshop and sharing its good practices with the regional countries,” he said.Responding to a question about Afghan peace process, the spokesperson said Pakistan desires that the developments made so far toward durable peace in Afghanistan should be preserved and built upon. He said all the stakeholders in Afghanistan should seize the opportunity of reaching a long-lasting peace.He said Head of Afghan Massoud Foundation, Ahmad Wali Massoud, along with his delegation, who arrived in Islamabad on Tuesday, met Prime Minister Imran Khan who reiterated his longstanding position that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and that a political solution is the only way forward.The Prime Minister also underscored that all Afghan parties must work for reduction in violence leading to a ceasefire and conveyed that Pakistan would support whatever the Afghans agreed upon about the future of their country.Chaudhri also said Prime Minister Khan is likely to visit Sri Lanka later this month. He said the two sides are currently working on the elements of the programme keeping in view the COVID-19 health related protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-asks-india-to-allow-neutral-international-observers-to-visit-jk-101613693978606.html
19-02-2021||World||US says it's ready to join talks to resume Iran nuclear deal||The Biden administration said Thursday it's ready to join talks with Iran and world powers to discuss a return to the 2015 nuclear deal. It’s also reversed the Trump administration’s determination that all UN sanctions against Iran had been restored and eased stringent restrictions on the domestic US travel of Iranian diplomats posted to the United Nations.The State Department said the US would accept an invitation from the European Union to attend a meeting of the participants in the original agreement. The US has not participated in a meeting of those participants since former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018.“The United States would accept an invitation from the European Union High Representative to attend a meeting of the P5+1 and Iran to discuss a diplomatic way forward on Iran’s nuclear program,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.Such an invitation has not yet been issued but one is expected shortly, following discussions earlier Thursday between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his British, French and German counterparts.Also read| Some electricity restored in Texas, but water woes persistMeanwhile, at the United Nations, the administration notified the Security Council that it had withdrawn Trump's September 2020 invocation of the so-called “snapback” mechanism under which it maintained that all U.N sanctions against Iran had been re-imposed. That determination had been vigorously disputed by nearly all other UN members and had left the US isolated at the world body.In another move, officials said the administration has eased extremely strict limits on the travel of Iranian diplomats accredited to the United Nations. The Trump administration had imposed the severe restrictions, which essentially confined them to their UN mission and the UN headquarters building in New York.Earlier Thursday, Blinken and the foreign ministers of Britain, Germany and France urged Iran to allow continued United Nations nuclear inspections and stop nuclear activities that have no credible civilian use. They warned that Iran’s actions could threaten delicate efforts to bring the US back into the 2015 deal and end sanctions damaging Iran’s economy.Iran is “playing with fire,” said German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who took part in the talks Thursday in Paris with his British and French counterparts. Blinken had joined via videoconference.Also read| Texas senator Ted Cruz says he went on vacation amid storm 'to be a good dad'Iran has said it will stop part of International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities next week if the West doesn’t implement its own commitments under the 2015 deal. The accord has been unraveling since Trump pulled the US out of the agreement.Blinken reiterated that “if Iran comes back into strict compliance with its commitments ... the United States will do the same,” according to a joint statement after Thursday’s meeting that reflected closer trans-Atlantic positions on Iran since President Joe Biden took office.The diplomats noted “the dangerous nature of a decision to limit IAEA access, and urge Iran to consider the consequences of such grave action, particularly at this time of renewed diplomatic opportunity.”They said Iran’s decision to produce uranium enriched up to 20% and uranium metal has “no credible” civilian use.The 2015 accord is aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran denies it is seeking such an arsenal.“We are the ones who have kept this agreement alive in recent years, and now it’s about supporting the United States in taking the road back into the agreement,” Maas told reporters in Paris.Also read| Canada vows to be next country to go after Facebook to pay for news“The measures that have been taken in Tehran and may be taken in the coming days are anything but helpful. They endanger the Americans’ path back into this agreement. The more pressure that is exerted, the more politically difficult it will be to find a solution,” he said.Iran’s threats are “very worrying,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said, stressing the need “to re-engage diplomatically in order to restrain Iran, but also bring it back into compliance.”The diplomats also expressed concern about human rights violations in Iran and its ballistic missile program.In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani expressed hope Thursday that the Biden administration will rejoin the accord and lift the US sanctions that Washington re-imposed under Trump, according to state television.Tehran has been using its violations of the nuclear deal to put pressure on the remaining signatories — France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China — to provide more incentives to Iran to offset the crippling sanctions.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the president of the European Council spoke with Rouhani this week to try to end the diplomatic standoff. The head of the IAEA is scheduled to travel to Iran this weekend to find a solution that allows the agency to continue inspections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-it-s-ready-to-join-talks-to-resume-iran-nuclear-deal-101613692230124.html
19-02-2021||World||US President Biden to debut at G7 with vaccines, economy and China in focus||Joe Biden will attend his first meeting as US president with Group of Seven leaders on Friday to discuss plans to defeat the novel coronavirus, reopen the battered world economy and counter the challenge posed by China.The Covid-19 pandemic has killed 2.4 million people, tipped the global economy into its worst peacetime slump since the Great Depression and upended normal life for billions just as the West grapples with the rise of China.Biden "will focus on the global response to the pandemic, including vaccine production, distribution of supplies" and efforts to fight emerging infections, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Thursday.He "will also discuss the global economic recovery, including the importance of all industrial countries maintaining economic support for the recovery" and "the importance of updating global roles to tackle economic challenges such as those posed by China," Psaki said.The call with G7 leaders at 1400 GMT is a chance for Biden, a Democrat who took over from Republican former President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, to project a message of re-engagement with the world and with global institutions after four years of his predecessor's "America First" policies.Besides Biden, Italy's new prime minister, Mario Draghi, will be a new face at the leaders' virtual table, though he is famous for "doing whatever it takes" at the European Central Bank to save the euro during the European debt crisis.Britain, which holds the rotating chair of the G7 and is trying to recast itself as a steward of the rules-based international system following Brexit, will ask members to help speed up the development of future vaccines to 100 days.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keen to build ties with Biden who did not support Brexit and who, as a presidential candidate, last year publicly warned Britain against endangering peace in Ireland.Johnson has said he is interested in the idea of a global treaty on pandemics to ensure proper transparency after the novel coronavirus outbreak which originated in China.China will also be on the agenda.In his first major foreign policy speech as president, Biden cast China as the "most serious competitor" of the United States."We’ll confront China’s economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China’s attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance," Biden said on Feb. 4.The G7 of the United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Canada has a combined gross domestic product of about $40 trillion - a little less than half of the global economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-to-debut-at-g7-with-vaccines-economy-and-china-in-focus-101613693150902.html
19-02-2021||World||Canada vows to be next country to go after Facebook to pay for news||Canada vowed on Thursday to make Facebook Inc pay for news content, seeking allies in the media battle with tech giants and pledging not to back down if the social media platform shuts off the country's news as it did in Australia.Facebook blocked all Australian news content on its service over proposed legislation requiring it and Alphabet Inc's Google to pay fees to Australian publishers for news links.Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, in charge of crafting similar legislation to be unveiled in coming months, condemned Facebook's action and said it would not deter Ottawa."Canada is at the forefront of this battle ... we are really among the first group of countries around the world that are doing this," he told reporters.Last year, Canadian media organizations warned of a potential market failure without government action. They said the Australian approach would permit publishers to recover C$620 million a year. Without action, they warned, Canada would lose 700 print journalism jobs out of 3,100 total.Guilbeault said Canada could adopt the Australian model, which requires Facebook and Google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive activity on their services, or agree on a price through binding arbitration.Another option is to follow the example of France, which requires large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content."We are working to see which model would be the most appropriate," he said, adding he spoke last week to his French, Australian, German and Finnish counterparts about working together on ensuring fair compensation for web content."I suspect that soon we will have five, 10, 15 countries adopting similar rules ... is Facebook going to cut ties with Germany, with France?" he asked, saying that at some point Facebook's approach would become "totally unsustainable".University of Toronto professor Megan Boler, who specializes in social media, said the Facebook action marked a turning point which would require a common international approach."We could actually see a coalition, a united front against this monopoly, which could be very powerful," she said in a phone interview.This week, Facebook said news makes up less than 4% of content people see on the platform but contended that it helped Australian publishers generate about AU $407 million last year.Google has signed 500 deals worth around $1 billion over three years with publishers around the world for its new News Showcase service and is in talks with Canadian companies.Guilbeault said Google would still be subject to the new Canadian new law, since Ottawa wanted an approach that was fair, transparent and predictable."What's to say that Google - tomorrow, six months, a year from now - doesn't change its mind and says its doesn't want to do that any more?" he said.Lauren Skelly, a spokeswoman for Google in Canada, declined to comment on Guilbeault's remarks, saying the company did not know details of the legislation.Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in Internet and e-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said Canada should aspire to Google's approach, where companies put money into content that provided added value."If we follow the Australian model ... we'll find ourself in much the same spot," he said by phone. "Everybody loses. The media organizations lose ... Facebook loses."Kevin Chan, head of public policy for Facebook in Canada, said there were "other options to support news in Canada that will more fairly benefit publishers of all sizes".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-vows-to-be-next-country-to-go-after-facebook-to-pay-for-news-101613691987610.html
19-02-2021||World||Texas senator Ted Cruz says he went on vacation amid storm 'to be a good dad'||Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took his family on vacation to Cancun, Mexico, this week as his home state was paralyzed by a deadly winter storm, drawing criticism from leaders in both parties and potentially damaging his political ambitions.In a statement on Thursday, the Republican senator said he was returning to Texas. He accompanied his family to Mexico a day earlier, he said, only after his daughters asked to go on a trip with friends, given that school was canceled for the week.“Wanting to be a good dad, I flew down with them last night and am flying back this afternoon,” Cruz wrote.“My staff and I are in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas,” he continued. “We want our power back, our water on, and our homes warm.”Cruz addressed his travels only hours after The Associated Press and other media outlets reported that he had traveled to Cancun on Wednesday, with hundreds of thousands of Texans still grappling with the fallout of a winter storm that crippled the state's power grid and killed more than three dozen people, some while trying to keep warm.The statement did little to quell a fierce political backlash that comes as Cruz eyes a second presidential run in 2024. He was already one of the most villainized Republicans in Congress, having created adversaries across the political spectrum in a career defined by far-right policies and fights with the establishment.More recently, he emerged as a leader in former President Donald Trump's push to overturn the results of the November election. Billboards calling for his resignation stood along Texas highways earlier in the month.Even the state Republican Party chair declined to come to Cruz's defense on Thursday.“That’s something that he has to answer to his constituents about," Texas GOP Chair Allen West said when asked whether Cruz’s travel was appropriate while Texans are without power and water.“I’m here trying to take care of my family and look after my friends and others that are still without power,” West said. “That’s my focus.”Hundreds of thousands of people in Texas woke up Thursday to a fourth day without power, and a water crisis was unfolding after winter storms wreaked havoc on the state’s power grid and utilities.Texas officials ordered 7 million people — one-quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking the water, after days of record low temperatures that damaged infrastructure and froze pipes.In Austin, some hospitals faced a loss in water pressure and, in some cases, heat.News of Cruz's absence quickly rippled across the state.Livia Trevino, a 24-year-old whose Austin home was still without water Thursday, said she felt abandoned by government leaders.“They are taking vacations and leaving the country, so they don’t have to deal with this, and we are freezing to death. We don’t have water and we don’t have food,” she said.In his statement, Cruz said that his family had lost heat and power as well.“This has been an infuriating week for Texans," he said.While the situation will not help Cruz's political future, the two-term senator is not in any immediate political danger. His current term expires in early 2025, and the unofficial beginning of the next Republican presidential primary election is two years away.Still, Democrats across Washington were eager to talk about the controversy.One of Cruz's most aggressive critics on the left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, encouraged her supporters on Thursday to volunteer for a “welfare check phone bank” to help Texans affected by the storm.“So many elected leaders in Texas have failed their constituents,” the New York Democrat wrote in an email. “Instead of focusing on relief, they’ve chosen to go on Fox News to spread lies or to board a plane to Cancun.”Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki leaned into a question about Cruz's “whereabouts.”“I don’t have any updates on the exact location of Sen. Ted Cruz nor does anyone at the White House,” Psaki said, adding that President Joe Biden's administration is focused on “working directly with leadership in Texas and surrounding states on addressing the winter storm and the crisis at hand.”Cruz's office declined to answer specific questions about the family vacation, but his staff reached out to the Houston Police Department on Wednesday afternoon to say the senator would be arriving at the airport, according to department spokesperson Jodi Silva. She said officers “monitored his movements” while Cruz was at the airport.Silva could not say whether such requests are typical for Cruz’s travel or whether his staff had made a similar request for his return flight.U.S. Capitol Police officials and the Senate sergeant-at-arms have encouraged lawmakers and their staff to be conscious of potential threats and to consider advising law enforcement about their travel at airports and other transportation hubs.Cruz's office did not immediately say whether the senator would self-quarantine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people who have traveled to get a coronavirus test three to five days after their return and to quarantine for a full week, regardless of the test results.Cruz checked in for his return flight Thursday afternoon in Cancun and walked briskly through the terminal pulling a roller bag to security. He wore a golf shirt, jeans and a face mask in the style of the Texas state flag.The senator was accompanied by a Spanish-speaking man wearing a black polo shirt with the name and logo of The Ritz-Carlton hotel chain.Cruz told reporters that he planned to “go home and keep working to get the grid reopened, to get power restored, to get the water back on."“A lot of Texans are hurting and this crisis is frustrating. It’s frustrating for millions of Texans. It shouldn’t happen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-senator-ted-cruz-says-he-went-on-vacation-amid-storm-to-be-a-good-dad-101613691826765.html

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg in a bid to break a legal standoff after the tech giant angered the government by blocking the nation’s news sharing on its platform.“We’ll see if there’s a pathway forward,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a Nine Network television interview on Friday, adding he would talk with the company’s chief later in the day after contacting Zuckerberg about his displeasure about Thursday’s “outrageous” block.Still, Frydenberg said the government will proceed with its controversial legislation that will force Facebook and Google to pay Australian publishers for news content -- the law is expected to pass parliament next week.Zuckerberg’s company switched off the main news source for almost one in five Australians and disabled a raft of government Facebook pages carrying public health advice on the coronavirus, warnings from the weather bureau and even the site of a children’s hospital.In contrast, Alphabet-owned Google -- which also opposes the law -- has negotiated a string of deals in the past week with media companies, in a bid to avoid the arbitration process enforced by the law.“There is a A$9 billion ($7 billion) online advertising market that is completely dominated by Google and Facebook, and we’re trying to create a level playing field,” Frydenberg said. “The rest of the world is watching us very closely.”In the U.K., conservative MP and chairman of the Commons media committee Julian Knight called Facebook’s block in Australia “bullying” and the “worst type of corporate culture,” according the the BBC. The U.K. News Media Association said the move showed stricter regulation might be required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-hold-talks-with-facebook-s-zuckerberg-after-block-101613688115343.html
19-02-2021||World||'Mr. Kitty' goes virtually to Washington over GameStop saga||The social media movement that made a beloved icon of GameStop enthusiast Keith Gill continued to rally behind the YouTube personality known as Roaring Kitty as he testified to Congress on Thursday about his role in last month’s stock market frenzy.“Today, the world shall know his name,” cheered one online fan on the social media website Reddit, superimposing a headshot of Gill over a boxer's body.The 34-year-old Gill became the most visible face of the GameStop rally largely because of his videos, where he wore a red headband and colorful, cat-themed T-shirts as he spent hours each week talking about the stock from the basement of his home in a suburb of Boston.For the virtual hearing of the House Committee on Financial Services, Gill wore a jacket and tie, although the headband could be seen hanging on a poster of a kitten with the words “Hang in There!” —- a crowd-pleasing reference to people still holding onto GameStop shares after its remarkable rollercoaster rise and fall.Gill reaped a big profit in the troubled video-game company after months talking about GameStop stock on his YouTube channel and on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, where he went by the pseudonym DFV, for ‘deep value’ plus an expletive.But on Thursday he rejected suggestions that he played a key role in the GameStop frenzy, arguing his social media conversations sharing analysis of company fundamentals were no different than what people do at bars, golf courses or with family members at home.“The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors and influence the market is preposterous,” Gill told lawmakers. “My posts did not cause the movement of billions of dollars into GameStop shares."But Gill did acknowledge that some investors jumped in too late. GameStop shares soared as high as $483 in January but have since fallen back, trading Thursday afternoon at around $45."It is tragic that some people lost money and my heart goes out to them,” Gill said.Gill's testimony won plaudits Thursday from WallStreetBets members on Reddit and the live-chatting service Discord.“DFV is pretty boss right now,” wrote a Discord user, responding to another who said: “DFV answering these questions straight. Only person I can bear to listen to.”Lawmakers on Thursday seemed far less interested in probing Gill than in other panelists representing Wall Street hedge funds and other bigger players. Some of the toughest questions went to the CEO of smartphone-based investment service Robinhood, which was widely criticized for restricting trading of GameStop and other volatile stocks for more than a day.But along with congressional scrutiny, Gill is now facing an investigative inquiry from a Massachusetts state regulator and a class-action lawsuit claiming he misrepresented himself as an amateur investor while convincing other investors to buy GameStop shares. Gill was registered as a broker-dealer and worked as a “financial wellness educational director” for insurance company MassMutual while he was sharing his thoughts on GameStop online.Gill emphasized to lawmakers his humble upbringing in Brockton, Massachusetts, where his father was a truck driver, his mother a nurse, and Gill was the first in his family to get a 4-year college degree but then struggled to keep steady work as he attempted a career in finance.He said he began analyzing stocks as a hobby and to supplement his income. He took to social media to trade tips and help work out his ideas with other individual investors about stocks like GameStop, a phenomenon he said is helping to level the playing field for smaller investors.“Ultimately my GameStop investment was a success," he wrote in prepared written remarks. “But the thing is, I felt that way in December far before the peak, when the stock was at $20 a share. I was so happy to visit my family in Brockton for the holidays and give them the great news — we were millionaires."Gill said he analyzed stocks on his own time and got curious about GameStop in June 2019, after it began trading at a deep discount after a poor quarterly earnings report. He bought call options and increased his position throughout 2019 and 2020, convinced that the stock price was “dramatically undervalued."With options, an investor can pay a few dollars for the right to buy a stock at a later date at a certain price. If the stock hits or surpasses that target, investors can reap a bigger return than if they simply bought a share.One Redditor going by the name Bruchtime27 penned an ode to Gill that began: “I love you man."“You did your homework for years, learning about the market and understanding what your strategy would be, all while talking care of your family and no doubt just being an all-around good dude through some incredibly difficult times since ‘08,” the user wrote.As they celebrated Gill, many commenters on Reddit and Discord launched profanity-ridden tirades against the other panelists testifying at the hearing, particularly Vlad Tenev, Robinhood's CEO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mr-kitty-goes-virtually-to-washington-over-gamestop-saga-101613681957056.html

She accused Robinhood of providing investors poor execution and lost rebates, adding that that makes its popular app far from free.Tenev pushed back, arguing Robinhood’s platform has dramatically lowered the cost of trading for retail investors, something its been able to do by selling customers’ orders rather than charging commissions. He wouldn’t commit to sharing its proceeds from payment for order flow arrangements, adding that Robinhood needs to generate revenue because it’s a for-profit business.“Robinhood forced the entire industry to drop commissions and replicate our business model,” he said in an exchange that came five hours into the hearing.Ocasio-Cortez’s inquiry came just after her fellow Democrat and member of the so-called squad of progressives, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, said in a tense exchange with Citadel Founder Ken Griffin that taxing stock transactions would discourage dangerous speculation caused by high-frequency trading.Griffin disagreed, saying “a transaction tax will injure Americans hoping to save for retirement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-questions-if-free-robinhood-trades-are-really-free-101613689790367.html
19-02-2021||World||Google revamps AI teams in wake of researcher’s departure||Google restructured its responsible artificial intelligence efforts to centralize teams under a single executive, Marian Croak, a move by the internet giant to stabilize groups working on ethics research and products after months of chaos.Croak, a vice president of engineering, will be the Lead for the Responsible AI Research and Engineering Center of Expertise, she said in a YouTube video announcing her appointment Thursday. The Alphabet Inc. unit has sought to defuse employee rancor stemming from the acrimonious departure of a prominent Black researcher, Timnit Gebru. Croak, a Black Google executive who is currently focused on site-reliability matters, will report to Jeff Dean, the senior vice president of Google AI.Croak acknowledged in the video that there’s a lot of “dissension” in the ethical AI realm right now, with researchers disagreeing on principles.“Whose definition of fairness, or safety, are we going to use?” she said. “There’s quite a lot of conflict right now within the field, and it can be polarizing at times. And what I’d like to do is have people have the conversation in a more diplomatic way, perhaps, than we’re having it now, so we can truly advance this field.”Croak will oversee the Ethical AI team that’s become the focus of intense scrutiny as well as employees on other fairness teams. These include people working on machine learning, computer-vision systems, natural language processing and those who engineer fairness products, a person familiar with the situation told Bloomberg News, which was first to report the changes. Megan Kacholia, who attracted employee criticism after dismissing Gebru, will no longer oversee these researchers, the person said.Gebru responded to the news by writing on Twitter that Google was trying to “neutralize one Black woman with another.”The crisis began in early December when Gebru, who’s best known for showing how facial recognition algorithms are better at identifying White people than Black people, said she was fired by email. Google said it had accepted her resignation after a conflict over an AI research paper critical of its technology that Google executives demanded Gebru retract or remove Google authors from. Her dismissal upset the Ethical AI research team she co-led, with members of her group taking to Twitter to publicly support her and criticize Google.Two weeks later, a group of Google artificial intelligence researchers sent a sweeping list of demands to management calling for new policies and leadership changes. Five weeks ago, Google also sidelined the other leader of its AI ethics research team, Margaret Mitchell, locking her out of its corporate network.This isn’t the first time Google has turned to Croak to handle the issue. A few days after Gebru’s dismissal, Croak moderated a meeting of Dean and Kacholia on one side, and researchers and the Black Googlers Network on the other.“My biggest disappointment is with Marian Croak legitimizing this,” Gebru wrote on Twitter. “Starting with hosting Megan & Jeff’s gaslighting session.”(Updates with comments from Timnit Gebru starting in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-revamps-ai-teams-in-wake-of-researcher-s-departure-101613689805325.html

The pandemic will only end when it’s eradicated across the world, they added.The U.S. has already ordered enough vaccines for at least 300 million adults, and at least 400 million if Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine wins approval for use in the coming weeks. Biden’s administration is considering how to donate surplus doses abroad but won’t do so until people in the U.S. have been widely vaccinated, the officials said.After the first $2 billion payment, an additional $500 million will be delivered when existing donor pledges are fulfilled and when recipient nations receive first doses, the officials said. The remaining $1.5 billion will depend on other countries making new pledges of their own, but the officials didn’t specify criteria.Covax allows countries, including wealthy ones, to tap into vaccine supplies. The U.S. isn’t planning to do so at this time, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-to-pledge-4-billion-to-vaccine-program-for-poorer-nations-101613688143338.html

"Today (we) begin the plan to serve those who are on the front lines" in the fight against coronavirus, said Vice President Delcy Rodriguez in televised comments."In the coming months, we will have more than 70% of the population vaccinated and we will achieve the so-called herd immunity," said the Health Minister Carlos Alvarado.Official figures as of Wednesday showed Venezuela has had a total of 134,319 Covid-19 cases and 1,297 related deaths. Medical experts and opposition leaders have said the figure is likely much higher.Venezuela has around 1 million health workers, according to medical organizations.They frequently complain of low wages and poor working conditions in public hospitals, which suffer from lack of water, power and medical supplies.At the Miguel Perez Carreno hospital in western Caracas, 150 nurses, or 90% of their total, did not show up to work on Thursday to protest salaries of only $3 per month, according to two sources familiar with the situation.The information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Rodriguez said that in the next two weeks, health personnel will be vaccinated in Caracas and nearby states of Miranda and La Guaira.As she spoke, state television showed images of a half dozen women in blue and green uniforms in hospitals receiving injections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/venezuela-begins-coronavirus-vaccination-for-health-professionals-101613682036039.html

In an interview with the Financial Times, Macron said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel supports the idea. He also said that sharing doses with African countries won’t delay domestic vaccination campaigns by “a single day.”Earlier on Thursday, Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the WHO director-general, said that Macron’s efforts were encouraging, as previous offers to donate doses haven’t materialized yet.“There have been many challenges,” Aylward said at a press briefing, citing interruption in vaccine deliveries to countries interested in giving to Covax, which is led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he spoke to Macron last week about vaccines, including about the barriers to boosting production. In the FT interview, Macron described cheaper inoculations provided by Russia and China as contributing to a strategy by these countries to gain influence abroad.The French pledge comes as Macron’s government is being criticized by opponents at home for the slow start to its vaccine campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-donate-5-of-its-vaccine-doses-to-poorer-countries-101613682059124.html

Marco Rubio's U.S. Senate seat in 2022 as she settles into life after Washington.The former president's eldest daughter and ex-senior White House adviser spoke with Rubio several weeks ago and told him she would not be running for his seat, according to a Rubio campaign spokesperson. The two have also discussed appearing at a joint event.The conversation, first reported by The New York Times, comes a day after Donald Trump re-emerged after nearly a moth of self-imposed silence, conducting a series of interviews to commemorate the death of conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh. Trump would not comment on his political future in the interviews, saying it was too soon to talk about whether he will run again in 2024.But there is plenty of speculation that other Trumps may want to follow in his footsteps. Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law, who served as a chief campaign surrogate, is still considering running for the Senate in North Carolina. And the former president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., remains deeply popular with his father's base.In a pair of friendly statements, Rubio and Ivanka Trump praised one another for their efforts together working on issues like paid family leave.“I am incredibly grateful to Ivanka for her friendship and support," said Rubio. “The challenges working moms and dads face in today’s economy are real, and Ivanka was a formidable and effective advocate for them.”“Marco has been a tremendous advocate for working families, a good personal friend, and I know he will continue to drive meaningful progress on issues we both care deeply about,” said Ivanka Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-tells-rubio-she-won-t-run-for-his-senate-seat-101613682131047.html

The longer we wait to act, the harder it will be to bring these women back into the work force," Harris told the group.Attendees included House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, Representative Barabara Lee and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.Harris has already been deeply involved in policy and diplomacy in the early weeks of President Joe Biden's administration. Earlier she met with Black Chambers of Commerce and Black mayors at a meeting convened by the African American Mayors Association to talk about Covid-19 relief, and this week held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron.Harris' meeting on Thursday occurred as Congress has more female members than ever before, with 27% of all seats, more than double the number in 2001. The vast majority of women lawmakers are Democrats, and a growing percentage of women have voted for Democrats in recent elections. Black women rallied behind Biden during critical turns in his 2020 presidential campaign.Murray said women are facing challenges with remote learning for children, so they must get them back into schools safely. "Women are leaving the work force because of this," she said.The meeting also included Melanie Campbell of the Black Women's Roundtable; Jen Earle, National Association of Women Business Owners; Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry and Tina Tchen, CEO of the anti-sexual harassment group Time's UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-taps-growing-political-power-of-women-lawmakers-promotes-covid-19-relief-101613682144048.html
19-02-2021||World||Almost a quarter of all freshwater fish species are in peril, thanks to humans||The 18,000 types of fish living in rivers make up a quarter of all vertebrate species. After two centuries of industrial development, 23% of them are now threatened with extinction, according to new research published today in the journal Science. Individual rivers face different challenges, from overfishing in the Mekong River to increased damming along the Amazon, said Sébastien Brosse, a freshwater ecology professor at Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse, France. What this study does is quantify those challenges.The French and Chinese scientists who contributed to the paper classified fish populations based on six scientific criteria including species and ecosystem function, which they then used to calculate a novel biodiversity index score—a “holistic measure of multiple measures of biodiversity change”— expressing humans’ impact on life in 2,456 river basins. More than 86% of rivers have been either moderately or severely affected by industrialization, with the remaining 13%, approximately, concentrated in tropical Africa and Australia. That’s far below the target many environmental organizations have set for conserving 30% of natural habitats by 2030. “This study provides support to the growing realization that the world is facing a freshwater biodiversity crisis, and humans are the primary cause,” said Julian Olden, an ecology professor at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the study. Overfishing, land use, redirected rivers, dams, soil and water pollution, and climate change have all contributed to the decline or extinction of native fish, as well as the rise of invasive species. That would be concern enough, the authors write. But the damage may impact the larger ecosystems that support much broader swaths of life and human industry. “Freshwater ecosystems are some of the most biodiverse places on the planet,” said Michele Thieme, lead freshwater scientist at World Wildlife Fund, who wasn’t a part of the study, “and we must protect them for the variety of services that they provide to nature and people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-a-quarter-of-all-freshwater-fish-species-are-in-peril-thanks-to-humans-101613682153040.html
19-02-2021||World||NASA confirms Perseverance spacecraft entered Mars atmosphere||NASA confirmed Thursday that the Mars 2020 spacecraft carrying the Perseverance rover had entered the Red Planet's atmosphere."We have confirmation of entry interface" said operations lead Swati Mohan.The risky, autonomously guided landing phase lasts about seven minutes, and it takes more than 11 minutes for a radio signal to reach Earth.That means the rover is already on the surface, but it is not yet known whether it crashed or landed successfully.The vessel careened into the Martian atmosphere at 12,500 miles (20,000 kilometers) per hour, protected by its heat shield.It was then expected to deploy a supersonic parachute the size of a Little League field, before firing up an eight-engined jetpack to slow its descent even further, before eventually lowering the rover carefully to the ground on a set of cables.The landing site, measuring 4.8 miles by 4.1 miles (7.7 kilometers by 6.6 kilometers), places the rover at the site of an ancient river delta that could harbor signs of fossilized microbial life.NASA scientists will follow the progress of Perseverance's descent by listening for simple tones from the craft, and from data it relays to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.The crater is "absolutely treacherous for landing," Allen Chen, lead engineer for the landing stage said Thursday. "There's a cliff wall that's about 200 feet tall that runs right through the middle of the landing site."There are craters full of sand that if we landed in them we would not be able to drive out of. And there are there rocks to the east, actually all over the place, rock fields -- that would be a bad day for us if we were to land on them."Perseverance has new landing technologies up its sleeve to help it navigate the landing with greater precision, including the "Terrain Relative Navigation" that uses a special camera to identify surface features and compare them to an onboard map.Conditions are dynamic and there's always a chance no signals make it back -- but that doesn't necessarily mean landing failed, because the spacecraft is performing all its maneuvers by itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-confirms-perseverance-spacecraft-entered-mars-atmosphere-101613681871404.html
19-02-2021||World||Global uproar as Facebook blocks news in Australia||Facebook faced a worldwide backlash from publishers and politicians on Thursday after blocking news feeds in Australia in a surprise escalation of a dispute with the government over a law to require it to share revenue from news.Facebook wiped out pages from Australian state governments and charities as well as from domestic and international news organisations, three days before the launch of a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme.Though the measure was limited to Australia, denunciations came from far afield, with politicians elsewhere describing it as an attempt to put pressure on governments that are considering similar measures around the world.Facebook’s actions “will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of Big Tech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison wrote on his own Facebook page.The dispute centres on a planned Australian law that would require Facebook and Alphabet’s Google to reach commercial deals to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or agree a price through arbitration.Facebook said it had blocked a wide swathe of pages because the draft law did not clearly define news content. It said its commitment to combat misinformation had not changed, and it would restore pages that were taken down by mistake.“The actions we’re taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content,” a company spokesman said.The head of the British parliamentary committee overseeing the media industry, Julian Knight, was among politicians abroad who thought the message was aimed far beyond Australia. “This bully boy action that they’ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world,” Knight said.“They’re almost using Australia as a test of strength for global democracies as to whether or not they wish to impose restrictions on the way in which they do business. So, we’re all behind Australia.”News publishers saw Facebook’s tactics as evidence that the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, cannot be trusted as the gatekeeper for their industry. Henry Faure Walker, chairman of Britain’s News Media Association industry group, said banning news during a global pandemic was “a classic example of a monopoly power being the schoolyard bully, trying to protect its dominant position with scant regard for the citizens and customers it supposedly serves.”The head of Germany’s BDZV news publishers’ association, Dietmar Wolff, said: “It is high time that governments all over the world limit the market power of the gatekeeper platforms.”Facebook shares traded down 1.5% on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-uproar-as-facebook-blocks-news-in-australia-101613672011674.html

Experts from both the central forensic science laboratory and the state forensic science laboratory also visited the spot to collect samples and take pictures of the blast site.“A broken mobile, a burnt circuit and a strip of wire have been found from the platform and the railway tracks. They have been sent for analysis. Whether the circuit and wire were used to trigger an IED blast can be confirmed only after an analysis,” said a police officer, without divulging details.Officials said that the blast had formed a small crater measuring around 5 inches in diameter on the concrete platform suggesting that it was a powerful explosion.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that it appeared to be a conspiracy and pre-planned attack to kill Hossain. The opposition, including the BJP and the Congress have demanded a CBI probe into the incident. She had also hinted towards an IED explosion.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh had on Thursday made the demand for a CBI probe, and on Friday Adhir Chowdhury, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha said: “I am demanding a CBI probe. West Bengal is incapable of unearthing the truth. Police is clueless about this incident.”Hossain and 26 others were injured in a blast on platform number 2 of Nimtita railway station in Murshidabad district on Wednesday.Allegations had surfaced that the area where the blast took place was dark as there were no lights. Railway officials, however, said that the entire area was well lit except for the southern end of the platform. Security personnel were also present on the platform contrary to what was alleged.Hospital authorities have said that Hossain’s condition was stable but critical.“He had to undergo a surgery on Thursday soon after being shifted to a state-run hospital in Kolkata from Murshidabad. His condition is stable but critical. He will need to undergo one more surgery,” said a doctor of SSKM hospital where Hossain was admitted along with 14 other victims of the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forensic-analysts-sit-visit-blast-site-in-bengal-s-murshidabad-no-arrests-yet-101613757221885.html

Now, the Central government will surely approve the proposal,” he said.Under the rules for changing names of places, the Union home ministry approves proposals sent by state governments to change the name of districts.In 2008, Chouhan had made the announcement of changing the name of the district.For the past few days, BJP leaders have been raising the issue of changing the names of several places including Hoshangabad. Recently, BLP MLA and pro-tem speaker Rameshwar Sharma said, “Any place shouldn't be named after a destroyer.”MP Congress Committee spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “The BJP-led state government has nothing to do with the development of the state. They don't want to put any effort to ensure the safety of girls because they are busy in renaming places and communalising everything. Now, people have started understanding the real face of BJP leaders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-hoshangabad-to-be-renamed-as-narmadapuram-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-101613752820658.html

The Leader of the Opposition in the assembly also seemingly indicated his ambition to become the Chief Minister once again, as he declared that on coming back to power he will provide 10 kg rice per head to the poor free of cost. "....elections will come in two years and we will come to power and we will do your work..there is no doubt about it. hundred per cent we will come back," Siddaramaaih said. Speaking at an event in Mysuru, he hit out at the BJP government for reducing the quantity of free rice provided to the poor from seven kg that was announced during his tenure as Chief Minister, to five kg. "They (BJP) have reduced it to 5 kg and I got to know that they will further reduce it to 3 kg. Can those who do injustice to the poor be tolerated?... So, once our government comes back to power, I will give 10 kg rice per head to the poor. Let it cost how much ever, money is not a matter," he declared. Siddaramaiah was earlier Chief Minister from May 2013 to May 2018 during which the Anna Bhagya scheme was a populist programme under which seven kg of rice is provided free of cost to every member of a BPL household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-confident-of-congress-coming-back-to-power-in-2023-101613753667432.html
19-02-2021||India||'DigiLocker' for MEA's 'Passport Seva' launched||Inaugurating the "DigiLocker" platform for the "Passport Seva Programme" of the Ministry of External Affairs, Union minister V Muraleedharan on Friday said it would enable citizens to submit the documents required for passport services in a paperless mode and they would not be required to carry the original documents.Speaking at the event, the minister of state for external affairs said the "Passport Seva Programme" has brought in huge transformation towards the delivery of passport services in the country."This has seen a sea change in the last six years. The monthly submission of applications has crossed the one million-mark for the first time in 2017. I am told that more than seven crore passports have been issued through the Passport Seva project till date," he said."We took several significant steps to improve the service delivery experience for the citizens. Not only the work of simplifying passport rules has been achieved but also, we have worked towards taking passport services closer to the doorstep of the citizens," Muraleedharan added.Noting that starting passport seva kendras in head post offices was a step in this direction, he said as a result of that, 426 post office passport seva kendras (POPSKs) have been operationalised and many more are in the pipeline.This, when added to the 36 passport offices and 93 existing passport seva kendras, makes a total of 555 passport offices for the public, the minister said.To give further fillip to the citizen-centric approach and enhance the passport service experience in a paperless mode, "we have now successfully integrated into the DigiLocker platform of the government", he said.This would enable citizens to submit the documents required for passport services in a paperless mode through DigiLocker, Muraleedharan said, adding that now, they are not required to carry the original documents."I would also like to add here that as a next step, we are working on the idea of a passport to be included as one of the documents in DigiLocker. Moving forward, I am confident that this will help the citizens to retrieve the passport whenever required," he said.In case of loss of passport and while reissuance, this facility will be of great help, the minister pointed out.DigiLocker is a flagship initiative of the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) under the Digital India Corporation (DIC). DigiLocker aims at "digital empowerment" of citizens by providing access to authentic digital documents in their digital document wallet.The issued documents in the DigiLocker system are deemed to be at par with original physical documents."We are also working towards rolling out e-passports for the citizens that are designed to increase security, making it more difficult to tamper with the data recorded on a passport, thereby limiting the chances of fraud," Muraleedharan said.In the coming years, biometric passports would help improve immigration processes at airports that are equipped with automatic e-passport gates, he added.In the upcoming Passport Seva Programme V2.0, the use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, chatbot, analytics, robotic process automation (RPA) will further ease the experience of the citizens and lead to expeditious service delivery, the minister said.With the availability of the DigiLocker facility now, the citizens do not have to look for the original documents to carry with themselves when they are away from home, he said."I welcome all the citizens to use the DigiLocker facility and make the passport application process paperless," Muraleedharan said.For the ease of the Indian diaspora abroad to avail passport services smoothly, the government has integrated 150 Indian missions and posts in foreign countries into the Passport Seva project, he said."The government under (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi has been giving due importance to realising the full potential of Digital India. Digital India is transformational, it brought in public accountability through mandated delivery of the government's services electronically and minimised the interaction between officials and citizens."I am confident that leveraging the DigiLocker for passport services would ensure ease of access for all citizens," the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digilocker-for-mea-s-passport-seva-launched-101613753079951.html

These mutations are apparently different from that of the UK, South African or Brazilian strains of the virus. As studies are on to find more about these new variants, here is all we know about them so far.> All these strains are of A2 type of coronavirus, which is common in India.> N440K mutation was found in a sample collected from Yavatmal in Maharashtra.> This is more prevalent in South India. Scientists at the Cellular and Molecular Biology found reported this variant in January, as reported by PTI.> N440K was a very small number in September and October last year. But now it is getting a much bigger proportion.> It is believed to be milder than the previous variant.> It escapes neutralising antibodies, which means even if there are antibodies in the human body, this mutation can save itself from them.> N440K is commonly found in Andhra Pradesh. It can also escape neutralising antibodies.> N440K was found in a case of re-infection in Delhi.Apart from these two, there is another mutation named V911I, which was found in a sample collected from Satara.

19-02-2021||India||Banks liable for safety of lockers: SC; asks RBI to issue guidelines in 6 months||Banks offering locker and safe deposit facilities owe a duty of care to customers operating the lockers and are liable for its safety, the Supreme Court held in a significant decision passed on Friday.Issuing guidelines in this regard, a bench of Justices Mohan M Shantanagouder and Vineet Saran said, “Banks as service providers under the Consumer Protection Act owe a separate duty of care to exercise due diligence in maintaining and operating their locker or safety deposit systems. This includes ensuring the proper functioning of the locker system, guarding against unauthorized access to the lockers and providing appropriate safeguards against theft and robbery.“The very purpose for which the customer avails of the locker hiring facility is so that they may rest assured that their assets are being properly taken care of,” the Court said in its order. It observed how in a globalized world, the steady movement towards a cashless economy has made lockers an essential service for the common man.“The banks cannot wash off their hands and claim that they bear no liability towards their customers for the operation of the locker….this will lead to a state of anarchy wherein the banks will routinely commit lapses in proper management of the lockers, leaving it to the hapless customers to bear the costs,” the bench observed. Such actions of the banks would not only be violation of the Consumer Protection Act but also damage investor confidence and harm reputation of our emerging economy, the judges added.The case before the Court was of a hapless consumer whose locker was broken open by United Bank of India’s Kolkata branch in September 1994 for non-payment of rent. He approached the district consumer court for compensation. The top court held, “The breaking open of the locker was in blatant disregard to the responsibilities that the bank owed to the customer as a service provider,” and went on to award ₹five lakh compensation to the petitioner and ₹one lakh towards litigation expenses. The bank was directed to pay the amount to the petitioner either by itself or by deducting it from the salaries of the erring bank officials, provided they were still in service.While examining the case, the Court stumbled upon the fact that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not specify the liability of banks in such a scenario. In 2007, RBI issued directions to banks imposing duty of care in respect of protection of bank lockers and mandating transparency vis-à-vis the locker holder in allotment and breaking open of the lockers. However, it was largely left to the individual banks to formulate the exact procedures for fulfilling this duty of care. Going by past decided cases before National Consumer Commission and High Courts, the top court noticed that the banks often took the defence that they were not liable as they were not aware of the locker contents.The bench said, “The banks as custodians of public property cannot leave the customers in the lurch merely by claiming ignorance of the contents of the lockers.” The present state of regulations on locker management was found “inadequate and muddled” by the Court with every bank following its own procedure.The threat faced by customers would be more pronounced in modern times with dual key operated lockers giving way to digital lockers, the judges opined. Customers would be completely at the mercy of the bank for protection of their assets and the electronically operated lockers could face manipulation by miscreants.Taking a proactive approach, the bench gave RBI six months to lay down comprehensive directions mandating the steps to be taken by banks with respect to locker/safe deposit facility management. While doing so, the banks should not have the liberty to impose unilateral and unfair means on the consumers, the bench said. Till such time the RBI guidelines are framed, the Court directed the principles laid down in this judgment to be binding upon banks.In the present case, although the bank accepted its mistake as the petitioner had cleared dues of 1994-95 prior to the breaking open of his locker, the bench laid down that henceforth, due notice in writing shall be given to the locker holder giving reasonable time prior to breaking open of the locker.Further, the locker shall be opened in the presence of authorized officials and an independent witness after due notice is served to the locker holder. This part was considered essential as the petitioner in the present case alleged that he was returned only two gold ornaments while he had kept seven ornaments in the locker. The Court did not examine this issue and asked the petitioner to file a civil suit where evidence in this regard could be submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-liable-for-safety-of-lockers-sc-asks-rbi-to-issue-guidelines-in-6-months-101613750503846.html

Echoing his concern, NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said, “If we look at Kerala, the increase in the number of cases can be traced since the time of festivals.”Meanwhile, Pune on Friday became the latest region to make RT-PCR tests mandatory for passengers arriving from Kerala. Earlier, the Karnataka government had issued new guidelines mandating all those coming into the state from Kerala to produce a negative RT-PCR test report of not older than 72 hours. Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said on Friday that those arriving from Kerala and Maharashtra will be ‘monitored scrupulously’ with a special focus on border districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adds-4-505-covid-19-new-cases-15-more-deaths-tally-over-1-03-million-101613744761182.html

Later, she announced that she would hold a series of Atmeeya Sammelanams (meetings with her close confidants) from all districts of Telangana before coming out with a concrete action plan.A senior YSR Congress party leader of Telangana, who is now playing a crucial role in Sharmila’s proposed political party, said she has been holding hectic consultations with retired bureaucrats, officials and leaders who had earlier been associated with late YSR.“She is going about with her task in a calculated manner. She is taking advice from all those who were close to her father in formulating her political philosophy. She is also making a thorough study of the issues concerning different parts of Telangana,” he said.Also read: Activist Disha Ravi sent to jail for 3 days, cops want to question her next weekRetired IAS officer K Prabhakar Reddy, who had worked as an additional secretary in the chief minister’s office during the YSR regime, met Sharmila a couple of days ago and gave many inputs to her on preparing the party agenda. Similarly, retired IPS officer Udaya Simha, who was the chief security officer of YSR, also held talks with her.Sharmila is also focussing on powerful caste groups of Telangana who had been the backbone of her father in the past. On Thursday, she held a meeting with Telangana Reddy Sangham leaders and discussed the strategy to consolidate the Reddys - a strong community constituting nearly 15 per cent of the vote bank in the state.“We shall extend support to the new political party of Sharmila. The Reddys have lost their political relevance during the Telangana Rashtra Samithi regime, which is dominated by the Velamas. We are confident that Sharmila will bring back the glory to the Reddy community,” said Reddy Sangham president Satyanarayana Reddy.Political analyst Suresh Dharur said Sharmila would become a rallying point for the Reddy community which was feeling lost during the TRS rule in Telangana. “Reddys had been the backbone of the Congress for a long time, but they had taken a beating after the death of YSR and the party suffered a series of electoral debacles after the formation of Telangana,” he said.Though some leaders like PCC working president A Revanth Reddy are making efforts to restore the fortunes of the Reddy community, the party has failed to show any signs of revival. “That is why they must be looking towards Sharmila,” Dharur said.He, however, wonders whether Sharmila would shrug off her Rayalaseema tag and appeal to the masses of Telangana, where the regional sentiment is strong.But, the leader close to Sharmila quoted above said she might be from Rayalaseema, but she was very much a daughter-in-law of Telangana. “We shall play the Telangana daughter-in-law card to counter the Telangana sentiment,” he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagans-sister-sharmila-ropes-in-father-s-confidants-into-her-new-telangana-part-101613741355863.html

Patole wondered why the two actors have not questioned the price rise like they did when the Congress-led coalition was in power at the Centre until 2014.While Kumar is considered a supporter of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Bachchan has been frequently accused of not taking a stand on any important issue. The BJP is currently in power at the Centre and is the main Opposition party in Maharashtra. Vij belongs to the BJP, which has already thrown its weight behind the actors.The controversy comes in the backdrop of the Maharashtra government, which also comprises the Congress, ordering a probe into tweets put by a number of celebrities, including Kumar, Sachin Tendulkar and Lata Mangeshkar, over the ongoing farmers’ protests in Delhi.

19-02-2021||India||Lalu Yadav's bail plea in fodder scam rejected||The Jharkhand High Court on Friday declined bail to ailing RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is presently in AIIMS Delhi, in a fodder scam case. This case against Prasad relates to fraudulent withdrawal of ₹3.76 crore from Dumka treasury during December 1995 to January 1996."The bench of justice Aparesh Kumar Singh rejected Prasad's bail application after finding that the leader was yet to serve about two months in custody to complete the half of the seven years sentence," said assistant solicitor general and CBI's counsel Rajiv Sinha.The RJD chief has been languishing in jail since December 23, 2017, after his conviction in three fodder scam cases. He has already secured bail in two cases on the ground of completion of half sentence. He moved bail application in the third and last case on similar ground in the high court last year.Prasad argued that he had completed half of the seven years sentence (42 months) in custody in the third case and urged the court to grant him bail.Supporting his claim, the RJD chief, last month, had submitted several lower court orders with detailed computation of the period of his custody.However, the CBI, the opposite party, vehemently opposed Prasad's claim and argued that the leader is yet to serve more than four months in custody to complete half sentence.A special CBI court, in 2018, had sentenced Prasad to 14 years of imprisonment - seven under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections and another seven under Prevention of Corruption Act - in the said case. It had expressly said both sentences would run consecutively.Prasad's lawyer Prabhat Kumar said that the high court, for the purpose of bail, was considering the maximum seven years’ sentence.The RJD chief was handed over 3.5 years and 5 years in prison in earlier two fodder scam cases in which he had secured bail after completing half of the sentence.Prasad, who had been undergoing treatment in custody for over two years in Ranchi's Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), was shifted to AIIMS New Delhi last month after his condition deteriorated.The RJD chief had suffered a jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was given bail by the Supreme Court in December that year. The leader is still facing trial in two fodder scam cases one each in Ranchi and Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lalu-yadav-s-bail-plea-in-fodder-scam-rejected-101613738189052.html
19-02-2021||India||Amravati surge due to Covid-19 mutation, people's carelessness, says Maharashtra official||A spike in Covid-19 cases in Amravati district of eastern Maharashtra could be because of a coronavirus mutation which is more infectious, but people's carelessness is the bigger reason, a senior health official said on Friday.Amravati has witnessed the sharpest spike in cases in the state this week. The number of new cases in the district jumped from 82 on Tuesday to 230 on Wednesday.Dr Subhash Salunke, technical adviser to the Maharashtra government on the Covid-19 outbreak, said those with comorbidities are at a greater risk due to a virus mutation found in samples from the district."The mutated virus is more infectious and triggering pneumonia early. If a person has pre-existing health conditions, such type of infection could increase the risk of death. However, it is only a possibility, and the district so far has not reported any spike in death toll," he said.Dr Salunke, however, also said that "complete carelessness" on people's part was the main reason for the spike. In many cases, people from the same family have tested positive, he noted."This means they are exposed to infection during the same period. It could happen only at some public function, gathering, etc, where Covid-19 protocols has been ignored," he said.The state government was focusing on contact tracing and increase in RT-PCR tests to tackle the surge in cases, he added.On Thursday, an official had said that researchers had found two new mutations in coronavirus samples from Amravati and Yavatmal districts of eastern Maharashtra after genome sequencing.These mutations were characterized by the virus' ability to escape neutralizing antibodies in the host person's body, said Dr Rajesh Karyekarte, head of the Department of Microbiology at the state-run B J Medical College in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amravati-surge-due-to-covid-19-mutation-people-s-carelessness-says-maharashtra-official-101613737326949.html

He accused that the government looted ₹21.50 lakh crore through taxes imposed on petrol and diesel prices since May 2014 and said that the BJP should now be called as ‘Bhayankar Janloot Party’.“BJP’s new name should be- ‘BhayankarJanloot Party’. Congress demands that the Modi government should stop oil loot and give relief to the people of the country by cutting petrol and diesel prices,” Surjewala said while addressing a press briefing.From May 1, 2019, the prices of petrol and diesel went up by ₹15.21 per litre and ₹15.33 per litre, respectively, Surjewala said adding that petrol price was increased by nearly 200 times or even more since this period.‘ईंधन-टैक्स-जीवी’ मोदी सरकार देश की जनता के लिए बनी अभिशापमई 2014 से आज तक पेट्रोल-डीजल पर टैक्स लगा की 21.50 लाखCr की लूटBJP का नया नाम- ‘भयंकर जनलूट पार्टी’कांग्रेस मांग करती है कि मोदी सरकार तेल लूट बंद कर देश की जनता को पेट्रोल-डीजल के दाम में कटौती कर राहत देबयान-: pic.twitter.com/pB1b1H8fXM“The crude oil prices on Friday stood at $63.65 per barrel and on the basis of this, petrol should be priced at ₹32.72 per litre and diesel should be at ₹33.46 per litre. Then why isn’t the Modi government selling the fuels at these prices?” Congress's press release showed. Expanding on this point, Surjewala pointed out during the briefing that the Centre had imposed 820% additional excise duty on diesel and 258% additional excise duty on petrol.With regard to the domestic use of crude oil in India, Congress said the production level had been reduced by 53,66,000 metric tonne by the Centre and the budget for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) had been reduced to ₹28,800 crores this year from ₹32,501 crores in 2020-21.Petrol and diesel prices continued to rise for the 11th consecutive day. In Delhi, petrol crossed the ₹90 per litre-mark after an increase of 31 paise while diesel was being sold at ₹80.60 per litre, after an increase of 33 paise.

No major economic activity has taken place (in Jammu and Kashmir) after the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A," JCCI president Arun Gupta told reporters here.Voicing his concern over the continued restrictions on the movement of people at Lakhanpur, the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir, Gupta said 40 per cent of the businesses, including hotel and transport industries, depend on pilgrims and tourists but due to the continued restrictions, people are reluctant to visit the UT."The Covid-19 restrictions were eased across India in January this year but the J&K government has kept Lakhanpur in the red zone category and not allowing inter-state bus services, besides subjecting people coming from outside to Covid testing," he said.Gupta said the people are suffering immensely due to the "harsh restrictions" and are affecting the business in the UT, which has already suffered a lot due to the prolonged lockdown."The governments outside J&K are coming to the rescue of their residents by reducing existing taxes but on the contrary the J&K government is planning to impose property tax to further weaken the people economically. This time when people are struggling to make both ends meet and pay tuition fees of their children, the imposition of property tax is grave injustice and illogical," he said.He said the chamber is not willing to take an agitation path due to the economic crisis people are facing, but "we will not hesitate to launch indefinite strike if government imposes property tax. We will not allow it to happen."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-major-economic-activity-in-j-k-post-abrogation-of-article-370-traders-body-101613734354937.html

Either the farmers will accept the loss of one crop or farmers will take the help of more workers to harvest crops. But the protest sites will not be vacated, the union leader has said.After rail roko on February 18, the Bharatiya Kisan Union is now planning to reach Kolkata on tractors, as Rakesh Tikait said at Hisar mahapanchayat on Thursday.Following Republic Day violence in Delhi, the focus of the protest has shifted to garner more support from other states through mahapanchayats to counter the government's claim that only Punjab farmers are protesting the laws. A number of mahapanchayats of Kisan Sabhas have been held in January-February in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab. Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi, Sachin Pilot have attended these gatherings. The BKU leadership has upped the ante against BJP leaders and said they will not be invited to any family function or programme until the farm crisis is resolved. The decision was recently taken at a panchayat of farmers held at Muzaffarnagar. "Consider this an order or advice, but nobody should send them (BJP leaders) invitations (for functions)," BKU chief Naresh Tikait said.Farmers have been protesting against three agriculture laws since November, making little headway in the stalemate situation. The implementation of the laws has been put on hold by a Supreme Court order. While the government has reiterated that room for more discussion is open, no date for further discussion has been fixed yet. Farmers union leaders are travelling and attending Kisan sabhas.The image of the protest has been sullied after Republic Day when protesters entered Delhi resulting in a stand-off with the police. After the Republic Day tractor march, the farmers observed 'chakka jam', 'rail roko' across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-ready-to-sacrifice-one-crop-for-protest-bku-ups-ante-101613734445267.html

Lalu Yadav's bail plea was heard by the high court, which asked him to file a fresh petition after two months. As he has already completed almost half of his sentence, he moved a bail plea.The RJD leader has been in prison since December 2017 and was sentenced to seven years of jail in 2018 under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and seven years under the Prevention of Corruption Act in relation to the fodder scam case.The fodder scam pertains to the scandalous withdrawal of ₹3.5 crore from the Dumka treasury by the officials of the Animal Husbandry Department between the period of 1991 and 1996 when Lalu served as Bihar's chief minister."Order on bail deferred due to CBI's delay.

19-02-2021||India||SC expunges remarks against NCLAT members by larger bench||The Supreme Court on Friday expunged disparaging remarks passed against three sitting members of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in an order passed by a bench of five members of the same Tribunal last year. Hurt by the personal remarks made against them by the five-member bench on December 22, the three members – Justice (Retd) Jarat Kumar Jain, Balvinder Singh and Vijai Pratap Singh – had approached the top court. A reference made by a three-member bench had led to the passing of the said order where the five-member bench of NCLAT held the reference to be not maintainable, a “misadventure” which was against judicial discipline. On going through the petition, the apex court agreed that the remarks required to be expunged. The bench of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai said, “We are with you. Shall we expunge the remarks straightaway?” Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Vinay Garg informed the court that the remarks offending his clients were reproduced in the petition. Also Read | No evidence but can’t rule out conspiracy against Gogoi: SCThe five-member NCLAT bench had remarked, “We hope and trust the members of the Referral Bench would exhibit more serious attitude towards adherence of the binding judicial precedents and not venture to cross the red line….such misadventure weakens the authority of law, dignity of institution as also shakes people’s faith in rule of law.” There were other portions too pointed out in the petition containing personal remarks against the three members. The bench said, “We are of the view that the observations made against the members of the tribunal in the special leave petition (SLP) be expunged.” What invited these remarks against the petitioners was a decision given by them sitting in a three-member combination on September 25, 2020. In that order, they noticed an earlier decision by a five-member bench of NCLAT that was contrary to decisions rendered by the Supreme Court. The issue related to whether entry in the company’s statutory balance sheet would amount to acknowledgement of debt by the company. The Supreme Court judgments held in the affirmative while a five-member NCLAT bench ruled the opposite. Since a five-member NCLAT ruling binds a three-member bench, the petitioners chose to refer the question to the five-member bench. The petition by the three members in Supreme Court filed through advocate Amit Sharma, said, “The larger bench has crossed the limits of its jurisdiction and has made unsavoury and most disparaging comments which tend to be personal in nature against the Referral Bench.” The three members did not challenge the setting aside of their reference order but limited their challenge to the personal remarks made against them. They approached the court under Section 62 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code which allows any NCLAT order to be appealed before the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-expunges-remarks-against-nclat-members-by-larger-bench-101613734070199.html
19-02-2021||India||Australia PM reaches out to PM Modi for support in fight against Facebook||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has reached out to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for support in his fight against Facebook over a proposed law that aims to make the social media giant pay for sharing content from media organisations. The matter figured in a phone call between Morrison and Modi on Thursday, amid worldwide outrage over Facebook blacking out news and media content for its users in Australia and barring them from sharing news articles. Morrison said in a tweet on Friday that he and his “good friend” Modi had “discussed progress of our [Australia’s] media platform bill” but didn’t give details. He said India and Australia, as comprehensive strategic partners, can work together on common challenges such as Covid-19, the circular economy and an open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Also Read | Facebook’s Australia face-off could backfire across the globeMorrison also told the media in Sydney on Friday that the law figured in his call with Modi. “There’s a lot of interest in it. People are looking at what Australia doing,” he said. There was no official word from the Indian side on the conversation. Modi said in a tweet on Thursday that he and Morrison had reiterated their commitment to consolidating the comprehensive strategic partnership and discussed “regional issues of common interest”. He added, “Look forward to working together for peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific.” In a message posted on Facebook on Wednesday, Morrison had said he was “in regular contact with the leaders of other nations” over “Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia...cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services”. He described Facebook’s actions as “arrogant” and “disappointing”. Morrison’s raising of the issue with Modi on Thursday was the “first step of a plan to mobilise global support to stop Facebook ‘bullying’ elected governments”, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Morrison’s government is also preparing for a long-drawn battle with the tech giant if needed, the report said. Anger grew in Australia after Facebook also blacked out posts from essential government departments such as state health departments, fire and rescue services and the Bureau of Meteorology, and crisis services such as Suicide Prevention Australia. Facebook has some 17 million users in Australia. Also Read | Australian news sites’ traffic falls after Facebook blocks content: ReportThe Australian side’s move to lobby India for support is understandable as the country is estimated to have more than 300 million Facebook users and is the tech giant’s largest market worldwide. In his post on Facebook, Morrison said the company’s actions “only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of BigTech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them”. He added, “They may be changing the world, but that doesn’t mean they run it.” Morrison said Australia will “not be intimidated by BigTech seeking to pressure our Parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code. Just as we weren’t intimidated when Amazon threatened to leave the country and when Australia drew other nations together to combat the publishing of terrorist content on social media platforms.” Ahead of Australia’s Senate debating the proposed law on Monday, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg held talks with treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Friday and the negotiations were set to continue over the weekend. Canada too plans to make Facebook pay for news content and is seeking allies in the campaign against tech giants. Canada’s heritage minister Steven Guilbeault, who is overseeing efforts to frame similar legislation, condemned Facebook’s actions in Australia and said Canada could adopt the Australian model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-pm-reaches-out-to-pm-modi-for-support-in-fight-against-facebook-101613733170294.html

19-02-2021||India||Bank unions plan to march towards Parliament against privatisation||Opposing government's privatisation plans, bank unions on Friday staged protest in all the state capitals and plan to march towards Parliament next month if their demands are not met, All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Budget speech earlier this month announced plans to privatise two public sector banks.About 10 lakh bank employees and officers under the banner of United Forum of Unions consisting of nine unions AIBEA, AIBOC, NCBE, AIBOA, BEFI, INBEF, INBOC, NOBW, NOBO are agitating against government's proposal, AIBEA said in a statement.The bank unions, after Friday's dharna, will stage protests across the country in the next 15 days. "On 10th March, we will hold a protest demonstration before Parliament during the Budget session," AIBEA said.Thereafter, 10 lakh employees and officers of the banks will observe two days of continuous strike on 15-16 March, 2021. "If the government proceeds further, we will intensify the agitation and go for prolonged strikes and indefinite strike. We demand of the government to reconsider their decision," AIBEA added.The union said after India got independence no private sector bank came forward to help the economic development of the country that necessitated the nationalisation of major private sector banks in 1969.Since then, banks have made great strides and have played a significant role in the country's development and from 8,000 bank branches in 1969, today there are as many as 100,000 bank branches across India, of which many are in rural areas.AIBEA said from 2010 to 2020, public sector banks have earned a total profit of ₹14,57,000 crore."The only problem facing banks is the bad loans. Most of the bad loans are by the corporates and rich industrialists. Instead of taking action on them, the government wants to privatise and hand over the banks to them," AIBEA General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said.Throwing light on the condition of private sector banks today, the bank union said many of them have collapsed, last year Yes Bank was in trouble and recently Lakshmi Vilas Bank was acquired by a foreign bank."We have seen the problems in ICICI Bank. Hence one cannot accept that private sector banking is very efficient. Only public sector banks give loans to common people, poor people, agriculture, small-scale sector, etc. Private Banks help only the big corporates," AIBEA said.Moreover, the public sector banks have given permanent jobs to young unemployed, while in private banks, it is only contract jobs. "There will be no reservation in jobs for SC/ST category employees if banks are privatized."Citing government claims that crores of poor people have opened their accounts in banks under Jan Dhan Yojana as public sector banks with 75 per cent of total branches have opened 40.50 crore of new accounts but the private sector banks with 25 per cent of total branches have opened only 1.25 crore accounts under this scheme.AIBEA said the banking sector has total deposits worth ₹146 lakh crore currently, which is hard-earned public savings."We cannot allow private hands to play with this huge public savings. Hence privatisation is a bad idea. If the government is serious about economic development, public sector banks should be strengthened. In public interest, in people's interest, in the country's interest, we oppose privatisation of public sector banks," Venkatachalam said.In 2019, the government had given the controlling stake in IDBI bank to insurance behemoth LIC.Besides, in 2020, 10 public sector banks were consolidated into six big size banks last fiscal. With this the number of public sector banks in India now stands reduced to 12 from 27 in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bank-unions-plan-to-march-towards-parliament-against-privatisation-101613729986757.html

Disha Ravi, who was arrested from her Bengaluru home on February 13 in connection with the Greta Thunberg toolkit case, was produced before the judge after being questioned by the police for five days.The court order came after the police requested the judge to remand her in judicial custody for three days because they wanted to question her again on February 22.Additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for the police, told the court that Disha Ravi had been evasive during interrogation. Ahmed said the police want to question her again and bring her face-to-face with the other co-accused in this case.The public prosecutor said the police had served notice to co-accused Shantanu Muluk who was expected to be questioned on February 22.Disha Ravi, he said, had sought to shift the blame for the toolkit on Muluk and lawyer-activist Nikita Jacob, the third accused in the case.The three, Ahmed said, needed to be confronted with each other.Disha Ravi has also filed a bail application which is likely to be taken up on Saturday. Muluk and Jacob have already been granted transit anticipatory bail by the Bombay High Court.Countering the additional public prosecutor, Siddharth Agarwal, who was appearing for Ravi, said that the case diary was not properly given and was also not in accordance with the law.Earlier in the day, a city court directed the media and the police to exercise restraint while giving out details of the case, which dates back to earlier this month, when Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted out a toolkit over the ongoing farmers’ protest in India. The kit, it is alleged, was given to Thunberg by Ravi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-seek-three-day-extension-of-disha-ravi-s-custody-order-shortly-101613730326454.html
19-02-2021||India||Tibetan tourist guide dies following torture in Chinese prison, sparks fury||A Tibetan tourist guide, Kunchok Jinpa, aged 51, who was tortured in Chinese prison succumbed to prison injuries resulting in largescale fury over the custodial deaths.Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) expressed concern over the increasing number of custodial deaths in China.There had been no news of Jinpa's whereabouts since his detention in 2013. New information indicated that the Chinese authorities detained Kunchok Jinpa on November 8, 2013, providing his family no information on his whereabouts, and later convicted him of leaking state secrets for passing information to foreign media about local environmental and other protests in his region.His 21-year sentence is unparalleled for such an offence, and no information about his trial or conviction had been publicly available outside China until now, stated TCHRD.Kunchok Jinpa died in a hospital in Lhasa in the Tibetan Autonomous Region on February 6, 2021, less than three months after being transferred there from prison without his family's knowledge.Local sources said he had suffered a brain haemorrhage and was paralysed."A well-regarded Tibetan man in his early 50s known for his strong courage and conviction in exercising human rights in Tibet has been beaten to death by the Chinese authorities in Tibet while he was being transferred to a hospital in Lhasa. He was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment because he shared information about peaceful protests that were happening inside Dhiru in Tibet to the outside world i.e. International Media," said Tenzin Dawa, a researcher at TCHRD.She further stated, "So there must be an immediate impartial and independent investigation of custodial deaths in Chinese prisons and all these investigations must be carried out according to the United Nations standards. We also call upon the Chinese authorities to revoke its policy being subjected to arbitrary detentions and imprisonments."Tibet has been under Chinese-occupation since March 1959. Over 155 Tibetans have set themselves on fire inside Tibet since 2009 in protest against China's repression and occupation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tibetan-tourist-guide-dies-following-torture-in-chinese-prison-sparks-fury-101613729747241.html

19-02-2021||India||Disha Ravi’s petition in Delhi High Court in ‘toolkit case’: Who said what||The Delhi High Court on Friday heard 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi’s plea seeking to restrain the city police from leaking information related to its probe of the 'Google toolkit’ on farmers’ protest to the media. While the police have denied leaking any information to the media, the Bengaluru activist in her plea stated the police had prejudged her guilt in the matter and had been putting out a “biased and defamatory narrative”.The Delhi Police have submitted an affidavit in the matter denying any leak of information accessed during the investigation. The court has directed the police to stick to its stance in the affidavit and told media organisations to ensure their information came from authentic sources. Here’s who said what at the hearing What the police saidDelhi Police told the court that the plea by Ravi is an attempt to defame and vilify the police and put pressure on the investigating agency. Additional solicitor general SV Raju, representing the police, told the court that the climate activist’s messages which have allegedly been leaked are from February 3 and she was arrested on February 13. “She must have sent the messages to several people, why only blame the police,” he said during the hearing. Ravi was arrested from her home in Bengaluru for her alleged involvement in creating and editing a ‘toolkit’ related to the farm stir in the national capital. On February 14, she was sent to five days in police custody by a court in Delhi. What Delhi High Court directedBefore dictating the directives for the police and media personnel, the court told the counsel of TV news channel Network 18, “There is no doubt that the video is sensational, extremely sensational.” The bench was referring to the broadcast of a news report on the case by the channel. The Delhi HC directed the police to stick to their affidavit that they have not leaked anything and also asked them to adhere to the office memorandum of 2010 on press briefing. The court said they were entitled to brief the media but must strictly follow guidelines laid down by the Union ministry of home affairs. Media houses were directed by the court to ensure that their sources are authentic. The editorial team at news organisations must note that such news breaks should be verified and the sources should be authentic, the court underlined. “While a journalist cannot be asked to reveal his source, it must be authentic,” it said.The court has also told editors to exercise proper editorial control so that dissemination of information does not hamper the investigation. There is an important role of the media and they should not sensationalise the same. The leak ought not to be disseminated that it prejudices the right of an individual,” the court noted, adding that there is no doubt that regulation of content has been a very contested issue across the world and India was no exception.The court, however, refused to take down the articles already published and said that the issue would be considered at a later stage. Three factors considered by the court are—the balance between the privacy and dignity of an individual and public interest, sovereignty and integrity of the country, and the right to free speech.The high court told Ravi to ensure that people related to her did not share information regarding the case. What Disha Ravi saidThe Bengaluru climate activist asserted that she would not make attempts to malign the police in sharing scandalous information. The matter will next be heard on March 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-s-petition-in-delhi-high-court-in-toolkit-case-who-said-what-101613726951726.html

There was no such undertaking in the present matter," the state government said in its affidavit."It is most submitted that the State of Andhra Pradesh has not taken any step in violation of any agreement/ direction. The State of Andhra Pradesh has been duly administrating its own territories and has not infringed upon the territory of the petitioner," it said.Andhra Pradesh told the apex court that it has been consistently holding elections in Ganjaybadra, Pattuchennuru and Paguluchennuru villages and they fall in No.1 Araku Lok Sabha Parliamentary Constituency and in No.13 Saluru Assembly Constituency."The SC categorically noted, after the dismissal of the Suit, that it was merely recording the fact that parties had entered into a mutual agreement. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination, can it be stated that there was a breach of undertaking or that of any order/direction passed by this Hon'ble Court. The contempt petition is therefore liable to be dismissed on this ground alone," it said.The state government told the apex court that elections have consistently been held to Lok Sabha and the State Assembly in the aforesaid villages since the year 1952 and so far as the local body elections are concerned, it has conducted local body elections in these three villages since inception of Panchayat Raj Act."The Answering Respondent herein submits that even in the years of 2006 and 2013, elections were held to the Panchayats concerned and the following persons came to be elected as Sarpanches. In view of the above, it is clear that the villages fall within the State of Andhra Pradesh."There is, therefore, absolutely no contempt that is made out. The Petitioner has failed to even refer to any document that entitles," it said.The top court on February 9 had asked Andhra Pradesh to file its response on a plea filed by Odisha seeking contempt action against senior officials of the southern state, for notifying panchayat polls in three 'disputed area' villages of the petitioner state.More than five decades since the first status quo order on the territorial jurisdiction dispute with AP over 21 villages, Odisha has moved the top court once again seeking contempt action against officials of the southern state for notifying panchayat polls in three of its villages.The Naveen Patnaik government has said the notification amounts to invading Odisha's territory.The dispute over territorial jurisdiction over 21 villages popularly called as Kotia Group of villages first reached the top court in 1968 when Odisha on the basis of three notifications -- issued on December 1, 1920, October 8, 1923 and October 15, 1927 -- claimed that Andhra Pradesh had trespassed into its well-defined territory.During the pendency of the suit filed by Odisha, the top court had on December 2, 1968 directed both the states to maintain status quo till the disposal of the suit and said, there shall be no further ingress or egress on the territories in dispute, on the part of either party .The suit filed by Odisha under Article 131 (the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction over any dispute arising between the states or between the centre and state) of the Constitution was finally dismissed on technical grounds by the top court on March 30, 2006, and with the consent of both the states it directed that status quo be maintained till the dispute is resolved.Now, the Odisha government has sought contempt action against AP's three senior officials -- Mude Hari Jawaharlal (contemnor-1), collector of Vizinagaram district; Adityanath Das, Chief Secretary of AP (contemnor-2), and N Ramesh Kumar, State Election Commissioner of Andhra Pradesh (contemnor-3).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/administrating-own-territories-not-infringed-upon-odisha-s-area-andhra-to-sc-101613726154155.html

Through the drug inspector, the partially used vials will be sent to Kausauli’s Central Drug Laboratory for testing.”The post-mortem report on one of the babies who had breathing difficulty and died four hours after being administered the vaccines attributed the death to what has been described as a pneumonic consolidation on the left lung.The family of the second infant who died 18 hours after being administered the vaccines, told the hospital not to conduct the autopsy on their child.The infants had received three vaccines - Pentavalent, rotavirus and oral polio on Wednesday at two centres.Pentavalent is a five-in-one vaccine given to all newborns for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B.Thirteen other children who also received the same batch of vaccination along with him at an anganwadi in Masakalipalayam are said to be healthy. Six other children who were vaccinated along with the second infant at a primary healthcare centre in Sowripalayam are also said to be fine.“The vaccine technical committee is looking into the cause of deaths,” health secretary Radhakrishnan told reporters in Coimbatore on Thursday.“We will do a thorough inquiry. When there is an adverse event, we immediately stop the batch of vaccines and report to local and district committees. In this case, other babies who were given the same batch of vaccines are normal. It’s not right to speculate; the committee will find the correct cause.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paediatric-vaccines-sent-for-tests-says-tamil-nadu-govt-after-2-infants-die-101613726048677.html

He also outlined that in the Union Budget this year ₹50,000-crore has been set aside for research for the next 5 yea through the National Research Foundation.PM Modi also asked the students of Visva-Bharati to prepare a vision document and aim to develop the villages around Visva-Bharati and make them self-reliant. He said that Visva Bharati students should focus on propagating the artisanal and cultural aspects of the rural areas and villages that surround the campus to the entire world. He also said that the idea of Visva Bharati built by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore was to ensure that whoever studies in this university looks at the world from an Indian perspective.PM Modi also highlighted that before India adopted the Western mode of education in schools and colleges, Thomas Munro, who was former governor of Madras Presidency when India was under colonial rule, had realised the importance of Indian education. He lauded Rabindranath Tagore for bringing self-reliance in the education system of the country through Visva Bharati university.The event which was held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic was also attended by West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and Visva-Bharati vice chancellor professor Vidyut Chakraborty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-education-policy-will-pave-path-for-atmanirbhar-bharat-pm-modi-101613725782902.html

It's time to make punishment under it more stringent at par with murder," he wrote, referring to the death of 40 cattle and three men after a cattle-laden truck overturned on NH-60 near Basta bypass of Balasore district on Thursday.The vehicle carrying around 100 cattle was heading towards West Bengal when it hit a SUV following which it turned turtle on roadside. “I call upon you to have the said incident investigated and exemplary punishment meted out to the accused,” Sarangi wrote in his letter.Also Read: Odisha: 16 held for stir against coal trucks emitting smokeEarly this month, Odisha police had rescued 12 cattle from Pathan Mahala under Old Bazar police limits in Bhadrak district while they were reportedly smuggled in a postal parcel container.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-minister-asks-naveen-patnaik-to-make-cow-slaughter-punishment-same-as-murder-101613719969371.html

It hit the target five out of five times at the range and now is ready for induction on HAL Rudra and light combat helicopters. The final test was conducted on Friday morning.The HELINA missile is a third-generation anti-tank weapon with infra-red seeker, fire-and-forget features. It is comparable with the wire-guided HJ-8 or Hongjian-8 system with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and BARQ laser-guided missile developed by Pakistan.While the Indian Apache Longbow helicopters are fitted with Hellfire missiles with over 10 kilometres range, the Helina is the Indian answer to a helicopter launched anti-armour missile. The significance of helicopter launched missile has assumed significance after the stand-off with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in east Ladakh with the China deploying a large number of armour and rocket regiments in the battle theatre. HELINA provides an option of taking down enemy tank beyond its range by using the fire and forget mode.The HELINA system has an all-weather day and night capability and can take out enemy tanks with conventional and explosive reactive armour. The missile can engage targets both in direct hit mode as well as the top attack mode. The IAF version of the missile is called Dhruvastra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/helina-missile-strikes-5-out-5-ready-for-induction-101613719486762.html

The talks will be held on the Chinese side of the LAC in Moldo.During the 10th round of talks, corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies will discuss disengagement at other friction points—Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra—in eastern Ladakh, officials said.As part of the agreement on disengagement between the two nations, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was to move its forces to the east of Finger 8 on the north bank, and the Indian Army was to move to its base near Finger 3, defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament earlier this month. He added that India and China have also agreed to temporarily suspend their regular patrolling activities on the north bank.The minister said these are mutual and reciprocal steps and structures that were built by both sides after April 2020 in both north and south bank areas will also be removed.“India's strategy and approach during disengagement talks with China are based on directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that we will not allow an inch of our territory to be taken by anyone. It is a result of our firm resolve that we have reached the situation of an agreement," Singh had said. The border standoff between the Indian Army and PLA erupted on May 5 last year after a violent clash in the Pangong Lake areas and both sides gradually increased their deployment by rushing thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry to the tense Ladakh region.Earlier in the day, China admitted that four of its soldiers were killed in a clash with the Indian troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley in June last year. The rare acknowledgement came in a PLA Daily newspaper article. As many as 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the brutal clash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-complete-in-pangong-tso-india-china-military-commanders-to-hold-10th-round-on-saturday-101613715107206.html

Ramdev's Patanjali had last year brought out its medicine against Covid-19.Releasing the scientific research paper, Ramdev emphasised its certification from the World Health Organization (WHO) and said this research paper is to satisfy those who had earlier questioned the scientific relevance of the medicine. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari were also present at the event.1st evidence-based medicine for Covid-19 (CoPP-WHO GMP certified)With the guidance of Pujya Swami Ji & Pujya Acharya Ji & the hard work of scientists at Patanjali Research Institute, the efforts have been successful.#Patanjalis_EvidenceBased_Medicine4Corona #PatanjaliCoronil pic.twitter.com/L4xdZTajWWPatanjali's Coronil was under scrutiny earlier due to the lack of scientific evidence and trials that could determine its efficacy in combating the deadly virus that has taken more than 156,000 lives in the country. Coronil was first advertised as a cure for the coronavirus infection but later licensed as an "immunity booster" amid the controversy over its trial data and composition.The yoga guru said during the event that the aim of the institute is to accredit the ancient medical science of India globally by providing scientific evidence and fulfill the Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision in healthcare. He said while modern medicine aided the highest recovery rate and the lowest case fatality rate in the country, the credit should also be given to ayurvedic medicines and yogic lifestyle of the people of India."Patanjali Research Institute’s scientific research and success on the first evidence based corona medicine will benefit 158 countries of the world," the company's dairy arm also tweeted.Patanjali Research Institute’s scientific research and success on the first evidence based corona medicine will benefit 158 countries of the world#Patanjalis_EvidenceBased_Medicine4Corona #PatanjaliCoronil pic.twitter.com/uH3JbjXyYyThe union health minister also emphasised the need of using modern scientific tools to highlight the importance of Ayurveda at the international level.

19-02-2021||India||A year later, UAE govt grants birth certificate to interfaith couple’s child||When 39-year-old Regulavalasala Tirumala Kalyan Chakravarthy and his 35-year-old wife Javeria Masood were blessed with a girl child in Abu Dhabi in January last year, they felt they were the most fortunate couple on the earth.But little did they realise then that their troubles had just begun. Chakravarthy and Javeria applied for a birth certificate for their daughter, whom they named Suhakshita, from the department of health, Emirate of Abu Dhabi, in the first week of February.As per the laws of the United Arab Emirates, obtaining a visa for a new-born child of an immigrant is mandatory within four months of the delivery of the baby. Chakravarthy got a passport for his daughter from the Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi, but he was shocked when his application for a birth certificate required for obtaining the visa was rejected by the health department. “The authorities told me that according to the marriage rules for expatriates in the UAE, a Muslim man can marry a non-Muslim woman but a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man, and so, the child born to them cannot be acknowledged as per the law of the land,” Chakravarthy said, on phone from Abu Dhabi.Chakravarthy, a Hindu, and a graduate in science from Vishakapatnam, met, fell in love and married Javeria, a Muslim and a graduate in physiotherapy. Their families approved. “We got married in 2008 with the blessings of elders from both sides. We were blessed with a son in 2011. After working for a few years in private companies, we moved to Abu Dhabi in 2018 for a better life,” he said. “We were blessed with a daughter on January 28, 2020 and we named her Suhakshita,” he said.The couple pleaded with the UAE authorities to grant a birth certificate to their daughter, saying that they were not aware of the local rules.Chakravarthy and Javeria sought help. “We requested local Indian associations and Indian embassy to come to our rescue. We even consulted not less than 15 lawyers and as a last resort, filed a petition in the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department in the last week of February,” he said.According to Raja Srinivas, community welfare secretary of Indian social and cultural centre, Abu Dhabi, a person without valid visa will be treated as an illegal migrant and be penalised heavily for the period of stay in the country. “In Chakravarthy’s case, too, his child would be liable to be penalised for not having a valid visa, for the period four months after her birth. That was his concern,” Srinivas said.As the judicial department was looking into his petition, a lockdown was imposed in the country due to coronavirus pandemic. And there was no way the issue could be settled within four months. After the lockdown rules were relaxed gradually, the couple intensified their efforts. “Luckily, we got help from good Samaritans like Raja Srinivas who took up the matter with the Ministry of Interior, UAE through the Indian embassy and continued to pursue the matter,” he said.On February 2 this year, Chakravarthy and Javeria got a call from the judicial department to present themselves along with the daughter. “The councillor at the department heard our case patiently and asked us to come back on February 7, when he gave the order in our favour,” he said. Within hours, the couple got a call from the health department.“On February 8, we were handed over the birth certificate for my daughter and it was a big relief for us,” Chakravarthy said.The couple has applied for the visa for Suhakshita and is hopeful of receiving it soon. “We are grateful to the UAE government for respecting our rights,” Chakravarthy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-later-uae-govt-grants-birth-certificate-to-interfaith-couple-s-child-101613714110548.html

The court also refused to restrain media houses from reporting on the matter but asked them to ensure that their sources were authentic and to not sensationalise the issue. “The leak ought not to be disseminated that it prejudices the right of an individual,” the court said.The court also refused to take down the articles already published and said that the issue would be considered at a later stage. It directed the editors of media houses to exercise proper editorial control so that dissemination of information does not hamper the investigation. “While a journalist cannot be asked to reveal his source, it must be authentic,” it added.The court also told Ravi to ensure that people related to her do not share information. The Bengaluru-based climate activist asserted she would not make attempts to malign the police in sharing scandalous information.The court dictated the order based on three factors—the balance between privacy and dignity of an individual and public interest, sovereignty and integrity of the country and the right to free speech.It was hearing a petition filed by Ravi seeking to keep the Delhi Police from leaking “any investigation material” accessed by them as part of the probe into the ‘toolkit’ case. The police claim that the Bengaluru activist was the one who shared the document on farmers’ protest with Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg. Ravi, however, said that the police had pre-judged her guilt and were giving “biased and defamatory narrative.”During the hearing, the Delhi Police told the court that the 22-year-old activist’s petition to stop them from leaking probe material to the media was an attempt to defame and vilify the force and put pressure on the investigating agency.Additional solicitor general SV Raju, who is appearing for the police told the court that the messages which have allegedly been leaked are from February 3 and Ravi was arrested on February 13. “She must have sent the messages to several people, why only blame the police,” Raju said.The court also rebuked television channel Network 18 for the news report they had broadcast. “There is no doubt that the video is sensational, extremely sensational,” the court told the Network 18 counsel.The police have denied leaking any investigation material contained in the first information report to the media following which the court had asked the police to file an affidavit.Justice Prathiba M Singh, who is hearing the activist’s plea, had issued notices to the News Broadcasters Association Network 18 and Times Now news channels on Ravi’s petition.Ravi was arrested on February 13 from her home in Bengaluru and produced before a Delhi court on the next day for her alleged involvement in sharing the toolkit related to the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders with Thunberg. The police have alleged that Ravi had later asked the Swedish activist to take down the post that comprised the document after its incriminating details accidentally got into the public domain.The police have also issued warrants against Mumbai-based activist and advocate Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk, an activist from Beed, for creating and sharing the document for creating and amplifying an online campaign related to the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders. According to the police, a second toolkit of similar nature was also in the works but could not be executed. Investigators said the second document was created by Jacob and Muluk and a UK-based activist Marina Patterson, who is allegedly linked with the global movement “Extinction Rebellion” also referred to as “XR”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-s-plea-an-attempt-to-defame-cops-put-pressure-on-investigating-agency-delhi-police-tell-court-101613710812703.html

The D614G strain which is prevalent was found in all the samples," he said.But in Amravati, Yavatmal and Satara, they also came across different mutations, Dr Karyekarte said."In Amravati, we came across a mutation named E484K in all the four samples. When we inquired if all samples belonged to one family, we were told they were taken from different locations, so the conclusion was that it was a common mutation," he said.The character of the strain found in Amravati is that it escapes neutralizing antibodies, he said.Also Read: Sealing of buildings back in Mumbai amid Maharashtra Covid-19 surge"In a nutshell, even if there are neutralizing antibodies in the human body, the particular mutation escapes or saves itself from these antibodies," Dr Karyekarte said.In Yavatmal samples, they found a mutation named N440K, which is commonly seen in Andhra Pradesh, he said."It was also found in a case of re-infection in Delhi. This mutation too can escape the neutralizing antibodies and cause re-infection," he added.In Satara sample, a new mutation named V911I was found but the researchers could not find significant scientific references about this mutation in published journals, he said.All these strains are of A2 type of coronavirus, which is common in India.Maharashtra on Thursday reported over 5,000 new cases after a gap of 75 days.Dr Murlidhar Tambe, Dean of B J Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said these "small curves" (spurts in infections) are happening due to lax behavior as gatherings, weddings and various functions are happening and no physical distancing is being followed.They have received six samples for genome sequencing from Akola where a spike has been witnessed, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-mutations-found-in-two-maharashtra-districts-101613711563960.html

19-02-2021||India||China officially admits 4 PLA soldiers killed, 1 injured during Galwan clash||China on Friday made public for the first time details of four People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers killed in a clash with the Indian troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley including one who died during a rescue mission near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between the two countries in June last year.A PLA regimental commander survived with head injuries suffered in the clash, an article in China’s official military daily said on Friday.The rare acknowledgment in a PLA Daily newspaper article comes amid the ongoing disengagement of border troops after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks from near the south and north banks of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso. After the clash, Indian military planners put a much higher number of Chinese casualties even as China had not disclosed the numbers. The disengagement and withdrawal are believed to have been caused at least in part by internal factors.Also Read | China says disengagement in Ladakh progressing smoothlyHT has reached out to the ministry of external affairs and the army for their responses. This story will be updated once the responses come.A prominently published article on page one of the daily gives details of the incident leading to the deaths but does not explain the reason why the information was being shared eight months after the clash. As many as 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the clash.The article used a Chinese saying as the headline: “Saving tears for Victory”. It claimed the clash as a major victory for the PLA. The article was subsequently carried by other state media outlets. It said the five Chinese officers and soldiers stationed in the Karakorum Mountains were recognised by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of China for their role in the border confrontation with India to commemorate their contributions to defending national sovereignty and territory.The CMC, headed by President Xi Jinping, awarded Qi Fabao, the regimental commander from the PLA Xinjiang Military Command, the title of “Hero regimental commander for defending the border,” Qi is said to be alive with head injuries.The remaining four were posthumously awarded for bravery: Chen Hongjun with “Hero to defend the border”. Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan, and Wang Zhuoran were awarded “the first-class merit”. The first three were killed in the clash and Wang Zhuoran while conducting a rescue mission across a river.“This is the first time China has unveiled casualties and details of these officers and soldiers’ sacrifice, four of whom died when dealing with the Indian military’s illegal trespassing of the Galwan Valley LAC,” the tabloid Global Times reported.The Chinese state media outlets blamed India for the clash. India has consistently denied the allegation and said the PLA trespassed across the LAC.“The awards process also revisited the whole incident - how the Indian military deployed a large number of soldiers who premeditatedly hid, trying to force the Chinese military to concede. How the Chinese soldiers defended the sovereignty of the country amid attacks of steel tubes, cudgels and stones was also highlighted,” the article said. It claimed Indian soldiers had outnumbered the Chinese border troops.“When facing enemies that outnumbered us, none of us flinched. Amid their stone attacks, we drove them away,” Chen Xiangrong, one of the soldiers killed was quoted to have written in his diary.“Since April 2020, relevant foreign military violated the previous agreement… they trespassed the border line to build roads and bridges and intentionally incited troubles, changing the status quo along the border… they even violently attacked Chinese soldiers that were sent for communication,” the PLA Daily report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-pla-soldiers-killed-1-died-during-rescue-mission-in-galwan-in-june-china-101613707847416.html

The envoys met with several public representatives, community leaders and residents of the Union Territory’s winter capital of Jammu on Thursday.“I told them how it was grossly discriminatory against women of Jammu and Kashmir, who after marrying men from other states were denied their right to ancestral property and how they used to lose their citizenship of J&K,” said Vandana, a woman Sarpanch from Nagbani.24 foreign envoys from several countries in the European Union including the French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain, EU ambassador Ugo Astuto, were part of the delegation that also included the envoys for Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and several other South American and African countries.

This was the third such visit organised by the government in its bid to dispel “misinformation” after the revocation of Article 370, which earlier governed the region.In Jammu, the envoys met woman sarpanches, Jammu Mayor, members of West Pak Refugees Action Committee, Valmiki community and others.“They sought to know about revocation of Article 370 and we told them that we are very happy over its revocation because it was a stumbling block in development and it was highly discriminatory against the people of the UT,” said Vandana.“We told them how the three-tier Panchayati raj system is helping the poor immensely and ensuring development at the grass roots level,” said another woman Sarpanch, Anjali Sharma from Mathwar. She said they also told the envoys how Pakistan has been peddling lies at the international forum to mislead the world community over Jammu and Kashmir.The Central government has maintained that the revocation of Article 370 was done to end discrimination against people of Jammu and Kashmir and the ‘dynastic’ rule which had prevented the growth of the region. The envoys visit, the ministry of external affairs said on Thursday, was an opportunity to witness, first-hand, “Jammu and Kashmir's march on the path of inclusive development and the dynamism in the grassroots democratic institutions.”“On behalf of my community, I told the envoys about what had been happening to us during all these 73 years. I told them that for the first time, we voted in the district development council (DDC) elections and that earlier, when Article 370 existed, we were deprived of our basic right to vote in the assembly elections,” said Sukhdev Singh Manhas, vice president, West Pak Refugees Action Committee.We also told them how our children were not considered for government jobs, professional courses and didn’t have the right to property here, Singh added.Also Read: Foreign envoys’ visit to J&K is an eye opener, saw visible change: OfficialsJammu Mayor Chander Mohan Gupta said, “I told them how elections to local bodies could be held and the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution could be implemented in J&K only after the revocation of Article 370.”Akash Kumar and Manisha from the Valmiki community told the envoys of the “worst kind of slavery” their community faced due to successive Kashmir centric governments and how Article 370 deprived them of voting rights, jobs and property.“We told them how under Article 370, we only got jobs as sweepers in the municipal bodies irrespective of our educational qualifications,” said Manisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/article-370-was-discriminatory-envoys-told-and-apprised-of-pak-lies-on-jk-101613707370764.html

"I love my mother. I am making an appeal to the President that her death sentence is commuted. It is up to the President to forgive her. But I have faith," Mohammed Taj was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.According to the agency, Taj has been living with his custodian parent Usman Saifi in the Sushila Vihar colony in Bulandshahr.Shabnam, a school teacher, and her lover Saleem were sentenced to death for sedating seven members of her family and slitting their throats on April 14, 2008. Among the dead was a 10-month-old child, who was strangled. Shabnam’s family was against her relationship with Saleem, a Class 6 dropout due to the difference in their social and economic status.Also read | UP teacher who killed her family may be India's 1st woman to be hanged in 70 yrsShabnam and Saleem were arrested within days of the murders and were sentenced to death by the trial court in 2010, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2015. Their mercy plea was rejected by Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Supreme Court also turned down their review petitions in January last year, saying that Salim had “meticulously executed the killing after Shabnam administered sleeping pills in tea”.The death warrant about the date and time of hanging has not been issued by Amroha court. Authorities in jail in Mathura are preparing for the possibility she may be ordered to be hanged soon. Shabnam could be the first woman convict to be hanged after Independence if the death sentence is carried out as expected by jail officials.More than 750 men have been sent to the gallows and only eight of them during the last two decades, data compiled by the research organisation Project 39A of National Law University, Delhi shows.

19-02-2021||India||‘Influenced by BJP, several countries will accept BJP ideals’: Tripura minister||Tripura law minister Ratan Lal Nath on Thursday claimed that several countries including the United States and Sri Lanka were influenced by Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) ideals and were thinking of accepting them.Nath's statement came while trying to clarify Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb's claim that Union home minister Amit Shah shared plans of expanding BJP's base even in Nepal and Sri Lanka when he was the party's president."Our CM meant that all other countries in the world will be influenced by the thoughts of the BJP. But that does not mean the BJP will form its base in those countries. His statement was explained in a wrong way," Nath said. The video clip of his statement was shared on social media platforms on Thursday."We feel that the whole world will accept the thoughts of the BJP. Those who are in Sri Lanka are now thinking of accepting thoughts of the BJP. America is also thinking to accept. The entire world is now thinking," said Nath.The minister further claimed that the entire world was drawn towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ideals and persona."We launched the Covid-19 vaccine and other countries are procuring the vaccine from us. The International Yoga Day is being celebrated throughout the world after Narendra Modi talked about it. So, the entire world is thinking about his thoughts and ideas." he said.Also Read: Senior BJP, RSS leaders meet Tripura CM after 'BJP in Nepal' remarkA few days ago in a meeting with party leaders in Tripura, CM Biplab Deb said BJP’s expansion of influence in southern states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu was a foregone conclusion given the ambitious strategy adopted by senior party leaders like Amit Shah."We were talking at a meeting in the State Guest House, when Ajay Jamwal (BJP's zonal secretary for northeast) said that BJP had come to power in several states. In reply, Amit Shah said that Nepal and Sri Lanka are still left. We have to win there as well," Deb said recalling the conversation. Deb claimed that the BJP became the largest party in the world due to Amit Shah's leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/influenced-by-bjp-several-countries-will-accept-bjp-ideals-tripura-minister-101613701254307.html
19-02-2021||India||It is in America's interest to assist the rise of India: US think tank||Asserting that the US ought to counteract the influence of Chinese authoritarianism early and often, a top American think tank on Thursday said that one relatively low-cost way is to encourage India to engage more deeply as a competitor with China in the global economy.In its latest report "A US-India Trade Agenda for the Biden Administration", the Washington-DC based think tank Hudson Institute said that India should aim for better relations with American corporations as increased US investment and trade relations will enhance the potential for US-India cooperation in confronting the rise of China.The report, written by Husain Haqqani and Aparna Pande, says that it was in America's interest to assist the rise of India."The US ought to counteract the influence of Chinese authoritarianism early and often. One relatively low-cost way is to encourage India to engage more deeply as a competitor with China in the global economy," it said.The report calls upon India to move away from protectionism."For Indian consumers and business, protectionist practices deliver the opposite of protection. Softened restrictions could attract American and European companies that are moving away from China," it said.Not only would India's economy grow but this would also help with employment generation, it said.It also suggested that Indian bureaucracy's antipathy to foreign corporations has become an obstruction in closer India-US relations."Preventing competition within the Indian market," the report points out, and "using regulation to benefit indigenous companies" will only impair India's growth and limit its potential.The Hudson Institute, in its report, calls upon the Biden administration to "encourage India to lower tariffs, to remove barriers to foreign retail, to roll back unnecessarily restrictive data privacy rules, and to provide economic incentives for foreign investment."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-in-america-s-interest-to-assist-the-rise-of-india-us-think-tank-101613698615703.html
19-02-2021||India||Meet Dr Swati Mohan, Indian American leading NASA's Perseverance Rover Landing on Mars||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Perseverance rover on Thursday (local time) successfully touched down on the surface of Mars after surviving a blazing seven-minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere. Among the scientists who are part of this historic mission, Indian-American Dr Swati Mohan spearheaded the development of attitude control and the landing system for the rover."Touchdown confirmed! Perseverance is safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life," exclaimed NASA engineer Dr Swati Mohan.When the world watched the dramatic landing, in the control room, calm and composed bindi-clad Dr Mohan was communicating and coordinating between the GN&C subsystem and the rest of the project's team.Apart from being the lead systems engineer during the development process, she also looks after the team and schedules the mission control staffing for GN&C.NASA scientist Dr Mohan emigrated from India to America when she was just one-year-old. She spent most of her childhood in the Northern Virginia-Washington DC metro area. At the age of 9, after having watched 'Star Trek' for the first time, she was quite astounded by the beautiful depictions of the new regions of the universe that they were exploring. She had immediately realised that she wanted to do that and "find new and beautiful places in the universe."She also wanted to become a pediatrician until she was 16. It was, however, her first physics class and the "great teacher" she received, that she considered "engineering" as a way to pursue her interest in space exploration.Dr Mohan holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Cornell University and completed her MS and PhD from MIT in Aeronautics/Astronautics.While she has been a member of the Perseverance Rover mission since the beginning at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, Dr Mohan has also been a part of various important missions of NASA. The Indian-American Scientist worked on projects Cassini (a mission to Saturn) and GRAIL (a pair of formation flown spacecraft to the Moon).The largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world touched down on Mars Thursday, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The agency's Perseverance rover landed on the Red Planet at 3:55 pm (Eastern US time) Thursday, bringing an end to the "seven minutes of terror" that saw a fiery atmospheric entry and parachute-assisted descent.The rover's landing mechanism then fired eight retrorockets to slow down and guide it to a proper landing spot before using nylon cords to lower it onto the surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-dr-swati-mohan-indian-american-leading-nasa-s-perseverance-rover-landing-on-mars-101613694037800.html

19-02-2021||India||Hit by Covid-19 pandemic, country’s aviation sector yet to witness growth in passenger traffic||Indian airlines flew 7.734 million passengers in January, far lower than the 12.7 million they did a year ago as restrictions on flights, flying, and international travel (and travellers), all on account of the Covid-19 pandemic took their toll on the sector.The Directorate General of Air Travel released domestic passenger data for the month of January on Thursday. In December, according to DGCA, airlines carried 7.32 million domestic passengers. That marked a 15% improvement over November.In contrast, January has seen only a 5.5% growth over December. In December, DGCA allowed airlines to sell tickets up to 80% of an aircraft’s capacity, up from 70% the previous month. This stayed the same in January.The average number of daily flights in January was around 2100, much lower than the average number of daily flights of around 3100 in January 2020, according to a report by Icra.“Domestic traffic will not be able to go back to pre-Covid levels firstly because domestic traffic also has an international component. Many passengers land into Delhi or Mumbai, and then travel towards their destinations taking domestic flights,” said CS Subbiah, former chief executive officer of Alliance Air.Subbiah added, “Currently we are operating maximum 100 (international) flights under the government’s scheme, which is way below the original international flight numbers. This international component towards domestic travel itself is around 20% or may be even more as not only Air India but also foreign carriers who have tie-ups with domestic airlines. Secondly, even though many states have smaller numbers, they are still asking travellers to produce test reports that they are not infected.”Read more: Covid-19 mutant strains: Civil aviation ministry releases updated SOPAccording to Subbiah, things will improve only from the summer of 2022.According to the DGCA report, the load factor (seats occupied to those available) of six major domestic airlines IndiGo, SpiceJet, GoAir, Air India, Vistara and AirAsia India was between 65% and 70% in January.DGCA said low-cost carrier IndiGo flew the most number of passengers (4.2 million).IndiGo also recorded the highest on-time performance (OTP) in January with an average 93.7% of its flights from four metro airports -Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad -- departing and arriving on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hit-by-covid-19-pandemic-country-s-aviation-sector-yet-to-witness-growth-101613680900715.html
19-02-2021||India||Rahul, BSP MP raise LAC situation at defence standing committee meet||At least two opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) questioned Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on the border situation involving China at a defence standing committee meeting on Thursday, according to three people aware of the details.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Kunwar Danish Ali also asked General Rawat questions about whether India was at a disadvantage due to having ordered fewer Rafale jets than what the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government planned, the people said.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s decision to enter a government-to-government deal -- worth $8.7 billion -- with France to buy 36 Rafales was announced in April 2015, with the deal signed a little more than a year later. This replaced the UPA’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) using parts imported from France.Read more: Puducherry CM translates fisherwoman's complaint as a praise to Rahul GandhiOn the second day of the three-day meetings to examine the defence ministry’s demand for grants, Gandhi wanted to know what made the government settle for 36 jets instead of 126. General Rawat answered Gandhi’s queries by referring to the government’s flagship Make in India initiative, which encourages local manufacturing, and how the government planned to plug gaps in India’s defence infrastructure by placing orders with HAL, according to the people cited above.To this, both Gandhi and Ali pointed out that HAL was not an offset partner in the deal.“Gandhi was also curious about the ongoing disengagement process at the India-China border and Rawat was answering him,” said one of the MPs HT spoke to.Read more: Puducherry political crisis: LG orders floor test on Feb 22However, Jual Oram, chairman of the committee, asked Gandhi to stick to the agenda. The Congress leader argued that the border situation was integral to the agenda on the table. Ali then requested Oram to allow MPs to question defence officials. There could now be a separate discussion on China.General Rawat, who attended the meeting with defence secretary Ajay Kumar and other ministry officials, told Gandhi that defence minister Rajnath Singh had already made the government’s position clear about the border standoff, with Indian and Chinese troops having agreed to disengage in eastern Ladakh’s Pangong Tso after months of stand-off.A Bharatiya Janata Party MP said the difference of opinion was not very significant. “There was no blame game,” he said. When contacted, Oram said he was not at liberty to divulge what transpired at the meeting.

We want everyone to know our history of defending end-to-end encryption and trust we’re committed to protecting people’s privacy and security.Read more: SC pulls up FB, WhatsApp over privacy: Key takeaways from proceedings“We’ve also included more information to try and address concerns we’re hearing.

As per the new policy, WhatsApp said it will share some data about users’ interactions with business accounts with its parent company Facebook, and that accepting these terms were mandatory in order to use the application.Read more: ‘Police leaked private WhatsApp chat’: Disha Ravi asks court to stop cops, mediaThe ministry on January 19 wrote to WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart expressing “strong concerns” over this and asked the company to roll it back.

19-02-2021||India||Activist Disha Ravi seeks restraint on private chat leaks||The Delhi high court said on Thursday that a plea filed by detained climate activist Disha Ravi, seeking to restrain the city police from leaking information related to its investigation of the “toolkit” related to the farmers’ protest to the media, needed to be considered even as the police denied responsibility for any such leaks.Justice Prathiba M Singh, who will hear the petition on Friday, issued notice to the News Broadcasters Association and two news channels — Network 18 and Times Now — on Ravi’s plea that the police had prejudged her guilt in the matter and had been putting out a “biased and defamatory narrative”.Emails sent to the channels by HT had elicited no response as of press time.Read more: Disha Ravi's arrest: 'False to say there were lapses', says Delhi Police chiefThe court also asked the police to file an affidavit after solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, appearing for the police, told the court that Delhi police had not leaked any investigation material contained in the first information report against Ravi to the media.Ravi, 22, was arrested on February 13 from her home in Bengaluru and produced before a Delhi court on February 14 for her alleged involvement in sharing the toolkit (for creating and amplifying an online campaign) related to the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders with Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg. Ravi broke down in the courtroom and said she had edited two lines in the toolkit in support of the farmers’ movement against three agricultural reform laws.The same document was shared on social media by Thunberg and later deleted.Read more: Disha Ravi can get warm clothes, masks and books in police custody, says Delhi courtRavi’s plea, filed in the high court, said that she was “severely aggrieved and prejudiced by the media trial surrounding her arrest and the ongoing investigation, where she is being viscerally attacked by the police and several media houses.”On Thursday, senior advocate Akhil Sibal appearing for Ravi, told the court that the police was behind the leak of information.He also sought a statement by the police that no information on the case would be shared with the media in future. The solicitor general opposed this and said the demand was designed to attract media attention.In her petition, Ravi said that police took away her mobile phone on February 13 and forced her to provide them with the credentials of her private accounts.“Thus, only police had access to the contents of Ravi’s private conversations and any leaks of the same necessarily constitutes the commission of a cognizable offence and is a violation of the petitioner’s dignity, reputation, and fundamental right to privacy, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the petition said.Read more: Were informed about activist Disha Ravi's arrest later, says Bengaluru policeThe plea has also said the police first “leaked investigative material” such as her WhatsApp chats which were only in their possession. It said that the chats were published and disseminated by various media houses.The petition has also claimed that the “media houses published one-sided, defamatory suggestive innuendo, and half truths about the petitioner”.Ravi said that police took away her mobile phone on February 13 and forced her to provide them with the credentials of her private accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-disha-ravi-seeks-restraint-on-private-chat-leaks-101613679925718.html
19-02-2021||India||Social media moderation: Government plans new platform to flag online posts||As the process of amending the Information Technology Act, 2000 gathers pace, the Centre is considering an alternative system for faster adjudication of cases related to cyberspace, revolving around what experts term a civil takedown of content.The alternative system would be worked out in such a way that the process has legal sanctity and confers powers on the government to take strict action on complaints against offensive content, officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.“The idea is that people who do not want to approach courts or the police regarding violative online content, say a video that the user wants taken down, can have an alternative,” said one of the officials.Read more: Changing the status quo for social media companies in IndiaThe official added that one of the options is to set up a website for grievance redressal that would address such complaints speedily. At present, complainants can either challenge the content they find offensive in the courts or report it to intermediaries, if any are involved, to address their concerns.“The ideal time frame for action would be 48 hours, so that the content can be contained. Cases of women’s safety or cyber frauds can also be reported this way,” the official said. “Of course, criminal cases would need more time to investigate. This wouldn’t clash with that.”At present, for cases that do not constitute a crime, a possible civil solution is to approach the courts. “The ministry of electronics and information technology has been receiving a far greater number of complaints,” a second official said. “There is a need for strengthening of cybersecurity, the provisions relating to intermediaries are also in the works and the country should soon have a data protection law as well.”Read more: ‘Police leaked private WhatsApp chat’: Disha Ravi asks court to stop cops, mediaIn February 2019, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) noted that over 60,000 cybercrime cases were recorded in the previous three years. “As per data maintained by the National Crime Records Bureau, 12,317, 21,796 and 27,248 cases of cybercrime incidents have been registered in year 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively,” the ministry said.NCRB’s data show that 44,546 more cases of cybercrime were registered in 2019.MHA runs a cybercrime reporting portal, cybercrime.gov.in, that was initially started in 2019 to record cases relating to the safety of women and children online. It dealt with online content such as rape videos and child pornography, but has since expanded to include other kinds of cases as well, such as cyber fraud.The portal has no fixed time frame for resolution of cases. “Substantive parts of the IT Act are up for a new avatar,” the second official said. “The government is also revisioning how digital services are provided and consumed.”Read more: Delhi education department to enhance its social media presenceThe first official added that right now, services are provided in different forms, such as cloud services, small applications, big applications, intermediaries and third-party content. “There needs to be a reassessment. There are companies that have gained dominance across different forms. Their positions have to be clarified.”NS Nappinai, a Supreme Court advocate and founder of Cybersaathi, said the move would be welcome. “A remedy for a civil takedown {of offensive content} would be most welcome,” she said. “I would urge the ministry to evaluate a shorter time period than 48 hours, since under the IT Act the takedown period for intermediaries is 36 hours and international trends are for takedowns in 24 hours or less.”She added that victims had little recourse to immediate civil options over offensive content against them posted online. “The only issue is that the victim should not be made to run from pillar to post. A cohesive system has to be worked out,” she added.Nappinai stressed that the issue is complex because everyone assumed that an intermediary meant an online entity. “One may be a digital entity and not online but still be able to avail the safe harbour granted to intermediaries under section 79 of the rules.” Section 79 pertains to intermediary guidelines, which provides safe harbour for intermediaries in a way that they are exempt from penal action for content shared by users.“There is need to gain an understanding of whether they are entitled to safe harbour under all roles,” said the second official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-media-moderation-government-plans-new-platform-to-flag-online-posts-101613680077473.html
19-02-2021||India||Signs of Covid uptick as states lower guard||Three states and one Union Territory have seen their seven-day averages of daily Covid-19 cases rise by between 20% and 69% of lows seen after the end of the first wave of the pandemic, an analysis by HT shows. This highlights the potential risk of a surge in cases amid fears of mutant strains gaining ground, and laxity in adhering to protocols due to Covid fatigue being reported across the country.In addition to the regions mentioned above — Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir — the first wave continues unabated in the southern state of Kerala.To be sure, all this comes even as India has vaccinated 10 million people, although an outbreak now could divert the attention of the public health system from vaccination to managing infections.The increase in cases is being reported from these areas as restrictions on several economic and social activities have eased, and people and governments appear to be getting complacent, with almost no mask discipline in many parts of rural India, and even some cities. At the same time, testing is over 50% of its peak across India; in Delhi, too, it is 30% lower than peak capacity levels.Read more: Israel researchers test drug to prevent severe Covid casesWhile Maharashtra, the state worst-hit by the disease, is again seeing a strong resurgence of infections with cases rising rapidly over the past week, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir also face the immediate risk of seeing a second Covid-19 surge, according to HT’s analysis. Kerala, meanwhile, remains the only state in the country which is yet to bring its primary wave of infections in control.This resurgence in new cases, along with rising positivity rates and a drop in testing comes at a time when cases across the majority of the country are at the lowest in eight months, which has prompted local governments to start relaxing norms, and encouraged people to drop their guards.To identify the regions where cases are rising again, HT analysed data from India’s 20 most populous states and UTs to narrow down on four regions where the case rate (the seven-day average of daily cases) appears to have bottomed out and has again started rising — Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir. In these regions, the case trajectory has risen as high as 69% and at least 20% from the lowest levels since the peak of the first wave.Read more: Bharat Biotech seeks Covid-19 vaccine approval in over 40 countriesEpidemiological estimates by the University of Michigan’s Centre for Precision Health Data Science show that while India overall has an effective reproduction number (Rt) of 0.95, only these four states have an Rt of above 1 – Punjab (1.16), Maharashtra (1.12), Haryana (1.05) and Jammu and Kashmir (1.03). An Rt of more than 1 means an outbreak is expanding in a region.Experts warn that these cannot be treated as isolated islands of infection, and with travel restrictions eased, an outbreak in one state can easily spread to another. In Maharashtra, which leads the country with 2.08 million infections and 51,669 deaths as of Wednesday, cases have gone up 69% from their recent trough. In the past week, 4,088 new cases have been reported in the state on average against a low of 2,415 on February 11.Another alarming sign for the state is the rapidly rising positivity rate. On average, 8.4% of all samples tested in the past week have been positive – this has doubled in the last three weeks. The single-day positivity rate in Maharashtra in the past five days, for instance, has been 6.3%, 12.2%, 9.8%, 9.0% and 8.4%. HT reported on Tuesday that the increase has coincided with the resumption of suburban train services – with almost no social distancing norms.Read more: Karnataka imposes restrictions on travel from Kerala amid Covid spike in B'luruTo contrast these numbers against the rest of the nation, India’s overall Covid-19 number has deviated only 3% above the lows seen since the end of the first wave, while the average positivity rate is only 0.1% above the lowest point (1.6%).Testing has also dropped significantly in the western state. In the past week, the state has tested 51,060 samples a day on average, nearly half the peak capacity — at its peak the state was testing an average of over 101,893 samples a day in mid-September.Read more: Covid-19 mutant strains: Civil aviation ministry releases updated SOPIn Maharashtra, the administration has gone into damage control mode in the past week.

High-risk contacts will again be stamped with indelible ink on their hands for identification. Buildings in Mumbai with more than five positive cases will now be sealed as well. On Wednesday, seven districts in the state (Amravati, Buldhana, Yavatmal, Akola, Nagpur, Parbhani and Jalna) imposed restrictions on movement of people and have restricted gatherings to five or fewer people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/signs-of-covid-uptick-as-states-lower-guard-101613679629992.html
19-02-2021||India||No evidence but can’t rule out conspiracy against Gogoi: SC||An enquiry by a retired Supreme Court judge into a possible larger conspiracy hatched to defame former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi in a sexual harassment complaint leveled by his own staffer has found no corroborative evidence to believe such allegations.However, the former judge relied on a letter written by the chief of Intelligence Bureau to acknowledge possibility of a conspiracy by those who were disgruntled by the former CJI’s judicial ruling on “serious tough” issues such as the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and tough steps taken by him on the administrative side to streamline the Registry.The report prepared by former SC judge Justice (Retd) AK Patnaik was submitted to a bench of Justices SK Kaul, AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. The one-man enquiry committee headed by Justice Patnaik was asked to examine the allegations of a lawyer Utsav Singh Bains who filed an affidavit before the Court giving details of a larger conspiracy by a lobby involving fixers, corporate accused and disgruntled judges and politicians. The Committee was not to go into the merits of the sexual harassment complaint leveled against the former CJI.Read more: SC denies registering suo motu contempt against Rajdeep SardesaiIn April 2019, the Supreme Court took suo moto cognizance of these allegations and constituted Justice Patnaik Committee to examine its veracity. The Director, Intelligence Bureau, Commissioner of Delhi Police and Director, Central Bureau of Investigation were asked to assist the Committee in its work.The bench after going through the exhaustive report, said, “The report has also taken note of the limited investigative powers and access to records which it had and based on those materials and evidence before him, it has been opined that it is not possible to find corroborative material qua the allegations of Utsav Singh Bains made in the affidavit.Simultaneously, the bench noted, “The report also acknowledges that the existence of a conspiracy cannot be completely ruled out and this has been so opined as Justice AK Patnaik has not been able to obtain various records including electronic records of Whatsapp, Telegram etc.”Read more: Supreme Court agrees to consider issue of priority vaccination for members of legal fraternity, issues notice to CentreThe possible conspiracy theory was attributed in the report to a letter written by IB Director on July 5, 2019 which stated “on account of the then Chief Justice of India taking serious tough decisions like in the case relating to National Register of Citizens (NRC), there was strong reason to believe that persons who were unhappy with those decisions hatched a conspiracy against the then Chief Justice of India.”The report also made a reference to certain tough administrative decisions taken to streamline the process in the Registry. The bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who alone appeared in the suo moto proceeding, “We are of the view that two years having passed and the possibility of recovery of electronic records at this distance of time is remote, especially since the scope of the enquiry and the power of the learned Judge is limited, no useful purpose will be served by continuing these proceedings.” The Court closed the suo moto case and directed the enquiry report to be placed back in sealed cover.Read more: No link between Char Dham road widening and glacier burst, govt tells Supreme Court; hearing adjourned for 2 weeksThe suo moto proceedings were initiated by a bench headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice Arun Mishra.

This in-house Committee was headed by the present CJI, Justice SA Bobde along with two other judges – Justices Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee. In November 2019, Justice Gogoi retired and three months later, the Supreme Court staffer who leveled the sexual harassment allegation was reinstated into service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evidence-but-can-t-rule-out-conspiracy-against-gogoi-sc-101613678497381.html

They were taken to Begumpet police station and let-off later.Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy demanded that the state government hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation, since the people had lost faith on the state police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murder-of-advocate-couple-triggers-protests-telangana-hc-takes-up-case-101613677562422.html
19-02-2021||India||Movement of trains hit as farmers block rail tracks||The “rail roko” call given by farmers’ bodies impacted rail movement in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan on Thursday with reports of sporadic blockades reported from other parts of the country. Railway officials said there was negligible impact of the strike even as some trains were stopped as a precautionary measure.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a group of about 40 farmers’ bodies protesting against three new farm laws, had given a call for a four-hour nationwide rail blockade from noon till 4pm.According to farmers’ bodies, the strike received massive support across the country with trains being stopped. “In many places trains were not stopped for long to prevent inconvenience to passengers,” the All India Kisan Sabha said in a statement.In Punjab and Haryana, farmers at several places squatted on railway tracks, which led to disruptions. Protests were also staged at some places in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.Read more: 'Rail roko agitation passed off without any untoward incident': Indian RailwaysIn Punjab, trains passing through rural areas were stopped at several places, especially in agriculture belts of Malwa and Doaba areas. In several places, tea and snacks were offered to stranded passengers. Some trains coming into Punjab were stopped at Jammu, officials said. In Haryana too, hundreds of farmers, including women, peacefully participated in the agitation at multiple locations in Dadri, Bhiwani, Jind, Sonepat, Rohtak, Hisar and Fatehabad, said Dayanand Punia, state secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha. Due to the blockade, the busy Delhi-Ambala-Amritsar railway track was affected, leading to the diversion of six trains and the stoppage of many others.Read more: Rail roko: Trains halts in Punjab as hundreds of farmers lay siege to railway tracksThe affected trains waiting at various railway stations were allowed to commence their journeys after farmers lifted the blockade at 4pm.In Rajasthan, officials said the Rewari-Sri Ganganagar special train was the only one cancelled due to the agitation, while a few others were delayed. Most of the protests were in western Rajasthan. “The train movement remained almost unaffected. There were reports of minor blockade on two of our routes. However, it was ensured that the issue is addressed. Hence, train movement remained unaffected,” said Ajit Kumar Singh, chief public relation officer (CPRO), North Central Railways — the zone which covers a large part of Uttar Pradesh.Read more: Rail roko will be peaceful, will not join politics: Rakesh TikaitIn Bihar, trains were blocked in Patna-Buxar, Gaya-Patna, Mokama-Barauni, Siwan-Chhapra, Kiul-Gaya, Muzaffarpur-Samastipur, Bhagalpur-Jamalpur and Patna-Darbhanga stretches. Supporters of the CPI (ML), the RJD and the JAP took part in the agitation. Railway officials said that around 20 trains were affected by the agitation.The protest saw a mixed response in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu with some sporadic protests by Left organisations. Some members of Left farmers’ bodies were arrested in Madhya Pradesh for trying to disrupt rail traffic. No disruption in rail traffic was reported from Goa, Kerala and north-eastern states.“Majority of the zones have reported not a single case of any stoppage of train by the agitators. Few trains were stopped in some areas of some railway zones, but now train operation is normal and trains are being operated smoothly,” said a railway spokesperson. The railways deployed 20 additional companies of the Railway Protection Special Force across the country.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/movement-of-trains-hit-as-farmers-block-rail-tracks-101613675319767.html
19-02-2021||India||'Deplorable!' India rejects UN experts' concerns on ending of J&K's autonomy||India on Thursday said concerns expressed by UN human rights experts on Centre's move to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and enact new laws disregarded the fact that the region is an integral part of the country and that the decision on the changes was made by Parliament.Fernand de Varennes, special rapporteur on minority issues, and Ahmed Shaheed, special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, had said in a statement issued in Geneva that the changes in Jammu and Kashmir could curtail political participation of Muslims and other minorities and lead to potential discrimination in employment and land ownership.Also read: Quad meet stresses on rules-based world order, respect for territorial integrityThe external affairs ministry questioned the timing of the remarks by the UN experts, saying they were “deliberately timed” to coincide with the visit by 24 envoys to Jammu and Kashmir.ALSO WATCH | 24 foreign envoys reach J&K’s Srinagar to assess situationThe statement by the special rapporteurs “disregards the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India and the decision of 5 August 2019 regarding the change in the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into a union territory of India was taken by the Parliament of India,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.Srivastava said it was “deplorable” that the experts had not waited for India’s response after sharing a questionnaire on February 10. “Instead, they chose to release their inaccurate assumptions to the media,” he said.De Varennes and Shaheed said in their statement, “The loss of autonomy and the imposition of direct rule by the government in New Delhi suggests the people of Jammu and Kashmir no longer have their own government and have lost power to legislate or amend laws in the region to ensure the protection of their rights as minorities.”The experts said the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was “established with specific autonomy guarantees to respect the ethnic, linguistic and religious identities of its people”, and it was the only Indian state with a Muslim majority.They contended the government had “unilaterally and without consultation, revoked the constitutional special status of Jammu and Kashmir” in 2019, and passed “domicile rules which removed protections given to those from the territory” in May 2020. “Subsequent changes to land laws are further eroding these protections,” they said.Also read: 'New laws, ending of J&K's autonomy affect rights of minorities' - UN expertsThe experts added, “The number of successful applicants for domicile certificates that appear to be from outside Jammu and Kashmir raises concerns that demographic change on a linguistic, religious and ethnic basis is already underway.”The new legislation “overrides previous laws which granted the Kashmiri Muslim, Dogri, Gojri, Pahari, Sikh, Ladhaki and other established minorities rights to buy property, own land, and access certain state jobs”.“These legislative changes may have the potential to pave the way for people from outside the former state of Jammu and Kashmir to settle in the region, alter the demographics of the region and undermine the minorities’ ability to exercise effectively their human rights,” de Varennes and Shaheed said.The special rapporteurs urged the Indian government to ensure that economic, social and cultural rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir are protected, and they are able to “express their political opinions and participate meaningfully in matters affecting them”.However, Srivastava said the UN experts had failed to account for steps aimed at “ending decades of discrimination, enshrining democracy at the grassroots level through successful conduct of local elections for the District Development Councils, and ensuring good governance”. He said their statement also “ignored the positive impact of extending laws applicable to the rest of India to Jammu and Kashmir, enabling the people... to enjoy the same rights as available to people in other parts of India”.Srivastava said apprehensions of a demographic change are “baseless and unfounded” as most of the domicile certificates were issued to erstwhile permanent resident certificate (PRC) holders.“We expect the special rapporteurs to develop a better understanding of the issues under their consideration before jumping to hasty conclusions and issuing press statements,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deplorable-india-rejects-un-experts-concerns-on-ending-of-j-k-s-autonomy-101613675119326.html
19-02-2021||India||From kin to Saraswati Puja, salvos from Shah, Mamata turn personal before polls||Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday raised political heat in the poll-bound state by several degrees when salvos they aimed at each other became personal, targeting Shah’s son and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief’s nephew.Sparks flew in the district of South 24 Parganas where Amit Shah launched the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) fifth and last Rath Yatra and addressed rallies at Namkhana and Kakdwip while Banerjee addressed her party workers at Pailan.Shortly after Shah, who is on a two-day visit to Bengal, accused Banerjee of not letting people perform Durga and Saraswati pujas and alleged that the only person benefitting in Bengal was her nephew Abhishek, a Lok Sabha member from the same district, the chief minster hit back.She accused Shah’s son, Jay Shah, of amassing wealth and dared the Union home minister to contest Abhishek before challenging her.Though Shah and other BJP leaders have made similar remarks at their recent election rallies, this was the first time Banerjee defended her nephew in public. The strong words she used drew public attention.“The Central government has sent ₹3,60,000 crore for the people of Bengal. But do you get any money? In Bengal, the bhatija (nephew) is the only beneficiary,” Shah told the crowd at Namkhana.“I have never seen any Union home minister lying so much,” Banerjee, who is popularly called didi, or elder sister, said while hitting back.“They keep parroting the words didi and bhatija (nephew). I feel bad when I see Abhishek facing this because of me. He was a child when he saw me getting injured in an attack during the Left era. He was emotionally affected. After growing up, he wanted to join politics. I have not made him the deputy chief minister or cabinet minister. He is just an MP. I wanted to send him to the Rajya Sabha but he insisted on getting elected by the people,” said Banerjee before flaring up.“I dare you (Shah) to field your son in politics. Don’t play with fire. There should be a lakshman rekha (line of demarcation)….. I challenge Amit Shah. First you contest Abhishek and then face me. Your son will not escape from corruption charges. Your son is my bhatija too. He had no money. Tell us how he made hundreds of crores of rupees. How is he a leader in the cricket world?” said Banerjee.Jay Shah is the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and president of the Asian Cricket Council.Referring to the road accident in which Abhishek Banerjee suffered an injury to his left eye in October 2016, the chief minister alleged that it was a conspiracy to kill him and as a result he cannot see with one eye. She, however, did not name any suspect.“Does Mamata Ji allow you to perform Durga Puja? Can people in Bengal perform Saraswati Puja? We saw her performing Saraswati Puja for the first time this year,” Shah said at the Namkhana rally.Shah also announced development projects for Sagar Island, venue of the Ganga Sagar Mela during Sankranti festival when millions of pilgrims visit the island. With an eye on the polls to be held in March-April, Shah said if the BJP comes to power in Bengal it will implement the recommendations of the 7th pay commission for state government employees and give ₹6000 a year to every fisherman in the coastal belt. “We will also reserve more than 33% government jobs for women,” he said.Shah also visited the famous Kapil Muni Ashram at Ganga Sagar. He said at the rally that the place will be developed into an international tourism hub.Mimicking Shah in Hindi, Banerjee said, “This man has no other work but to drop in every other day. He keeps saying Mamata Ji has not done this and Mamata Ji has not done that. He says I do not let people perform pujas. Can you recite mantras (prayers in Sanskrit) for Saraswati Puja?” said Banerjee, who has been performing Saraswati Puja at her residence since decades. To drive home her point, she recited parts of three separate mantras dedicated to Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge.“If Durga Puja is not taking place then how could we give ₹50,000 to each of the state’s 28000 community clubs for the festival…..We know Hindutva very well. We can teach you,” said Banerjee.Banerjee also targeted the BJP’s strategy of sending its senior leaders to the homes of voters.Women are my top supporters. I urge them to box the ears of these leaders and take photos of the act. Boxing someone’s ear will not lead to a police case,” said Banerjee.Reacting to Banerjee’s comments on Jay Shah, the Bengal BJP said the allegations are very old and legal reply was given to those raised it.“Making these allegations once again will not help Banerjee in the coming elections. It will have no effect on people,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-kin-to-saraswati-puja-salvos-from-shah-mamata-turn-personal-before-polls-101613672955352.html
19-02-2021||India||Akbar’s lawyers may rely on part of judgment in appeal||A day after a Delhi court acquitted journalist Priya Ramani in a defamation case filed by former minister and MP MJ Akbar, some legal experts said that a possible appeal by the latter could revolve around the judgment itself, which admits in one part that the content referred to in the suit is “defamatory in nature”, and that the “defence of the accused regarding” only part of the article referring to Akbar and the rest to “other male bosses is rejected” .To be sure, the judgment then went on to say that “Akbar was not a man of stellar reputation”, and reasoned that “the right to reputation cannot be protected at the cost of right to life and dignity of women as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution...”. It added that “.. perpetrators of sexual harassment ... can also be a person of reputation...”. Based on this reasoning, laid out in the verdict, judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey acquitted Ramani.Read more: Priya Ramani vs MJ Akbar case: 5 takeaways from the orderWhen contacted, Akbar’s counsel said they were intending to file an appeal.“With the court saying that the contents are defamatory, he (Akbar) stands vindicated. This was what we had intended to show to the court that you cannot make such defamatory comments through the article and social media posts,” senior advocate Geeta Luthra, heading the legal team for Akbar saidSome legal experts were of the opinion that Akbar’s legal team could focus on the judgment’s comment on the content being defamatory in an appeal, and on it dismissing one aspect of Ramani’s defence that only part of the article was about Akbar.The case concerns Ramani’s tweet in 2018, read in consonance with an article she wrote for Vogue magazine in 2017. In the latter, she wrote about a situation where an editor interviewing her made her feel uncomfortable by conducting the interview in his hotel room.Read more: Priya Ramani acquitted in MJ Akbar defamation caseIn the tweet, which came in the wake of the MeToo movement, she named Akbar as the editor. Several other women spoke about their experiences with him at the same time; one of them Ghazala Wahab even testified in favour of Ramani during the case. Akbar resigned as junior foreign minister and sued Ramani for defamation.Siddharth Dave, a senior advocate in the Supreme Court said there are established exceptions by which an act may not be defamatory. In this case, he added, the exceptions would be: truth; that the content was published in good faith and for the larger public good. “The judgment is convoluted in its reasoning as the logic given by the court does not explain how the exceptions claimed stood justified. The judge should have confined himself within the walls of defamation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akbars-lawyers-may-rely-on-part-of-judgment-in-appeal-101613674423657.html
19-02-2021||India||Interview: ‘Centre denied rights to people of Puducherry’, says CM Narayanasamy||At a time when Puducherry’s new Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has asked him to prove his majority in the state assembly on February 22, CM V Narayanasamy, 73, spoke to Divya Chandrababu about the four MLAs who quit the party, the upcoming floor test, and the Congress’s prospects in the state elections this year. Edited excerpts:Are you ready to face the floor test?They’ve asked for a floor test. I’m clear, whenever we have been asked, that we will do according to the Constitution.Are you in talks with any of the MLAs who have quit? Have you accepted Malladi Krishna Rao’s resignation?We are talking to Malladi Krishna Rao. The other people’s resignations have been accepted.Are you saying you have a majority including him which will take your support to 15 MLAs?I’m not going into numbers. We have got a majority.You seem confident that your government won’t fall.Definitely. Whatever they (the BJP) do, it will be a death knell for them. People will say these are the people who are responsible for topping the government.Now that the L-G has taken charge, do you see it as a relief because you wanted the President to call back Kiran Bedi?She (Soundararajan) took oath in Tamil. For the first time a Tamilian has been appointed as L-G to take additional charge. But we have to see, you know the attitude of the Government of India, and the present NDA government.Some central BJP leaders said that Bedi was removed so that your standoff with her doesn’t work in your favour in the upcoming polls.Let them say that. Our main grievance is against the central government. Kiran Bedi is secondary for us. Our main issue is the central government denied the genuine rights to the people of Puducherry.Do you believe there was a plan to bring your government down ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s visit ?In politics, we have to face everything boldly. We will face any eventuality. The people of Puducherry love the Gandhi family.But your government has been weakened two months before elections.This is the BJP’s ploy in every state. They purchase and blackmail MLAs. They use ED, CBI, I-T against the opposition party leaders. That’s what they did in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal. They are murdering democracy.Are you saying they purchased or blackmailed the four MLAs who have resigned?Not four MLAs. I’m telling you about the three MLAs -- except Malladi Krishna Rao -- they’ve been blackmailed by BJP.What about your own candidature?Our Congress-led UPA alliance will come to power. Our leadership and alliance parties will have to decide (on the CM candidate)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interview-centre-denied-rights-to-people-of-puducherry-says-cm-narayanasamy-101613673130790.html
19-02-2021||India||Maharashtra Congress threatens to block Bachchan, Akshay Kumar films||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole slammed Bollywood actors Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar for their silence over the fuel price rise and threatened to stop the shooting and release of their films in the state. He questioned why the two actors have not spoken out against the price rise like they did during the Congress-led central government’s regime until 2014. Patole, who made the comments in Bhandara during a tractor and bullock cart rally in support of the farmers protesting against the three farm laws, said the actors should speak up in public interest. “Both the actors reacted on social media when petrol prices touched ₹70 per litre during Manmohan Singh’s government. Now petrol and diesel are being sold at ₹96 and ₹86, while cooking gas is priced at ₹800. But both the stars have kept mum. They haven’t uttered a word against the anti-national policies of the [Narendra] Modi government, which are hurting the common man the most. We won’t allow their films to release or the shooting to take place anywhere in Maharashtra.” Patole also questioned if the actors are afraid of the “Modi government’s dictatorship”. “This is not a threat, but in democracy it is the responsibility of celebrities, who are idols of the citizens, to talk in the interest of the general public. If they are not speaking owing to the pressure from the ruling BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), the people of the country would not pardon them,” he said. Opposition leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called Patole’s comments a publicity stunt. “Patole knows that the statement can gain him publicity by naming Bachchan and Kumar. How can anybody stop the shooting or stall the release of movies in a democracy. You are the head of a ruling party and not the owner of the state,” said the BJP leader. BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said such threats result in losses to business and employment. “The threat would not hurt the actors. They have the option to move out to other states in such a scenario. But it leads to a major loss of investment and employment generation. This is an attempt to bring mob rule by the Congress.” Also Read | New Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole vows to take party to the topMeanwhile, the Congress announced a state-wide protest against the Centre over the continuous rise in fuel prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-congress-threatens-to-block-bachchan-akshay-kumar-films-101613645173870.html

He cited the Act and said it required the reserve to be kept “as an inviolate area for the purposes of tiger conservation”.“Not only has the law of the land been violated... but they have also compromised with the safety, protection, and conservation of the national animal..”The Wildlife Protection Act says that tiger reserves shall not be diverted for ecologically unsustainable uses. Bansal said in case it is required, then it is mandatory for the government to seek NBWL’s approval and NTCA’s advice.

19-02-2021||India||Rail roko: Local train service unaffected in Maharashtra||Farmers in Maharashtra continued their agitations on Thursday and resorted to ‘rail roko’ (rail blockade) stir across the state and tried to disrupt outstation train services to protest against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre. One outstation train – the Aurangabad-Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) Janshatabdi Express – was blocked at Lasur railway station for 30 minutes around 10.05am. There were no other disruptions in the operation of outstation trains anywhere else in Maharashtra. The protests did not have an impact on the functioning of Mumbai local trains either. The farmers staged agitations at places such as Dahanu, Aurangabad and Parbhani before they were stopped by police personnel and detained. “We staged a rail roko at Dahanu, Aurangabad and Parbhani and blocked the trains. Our farmers were taken into police custody. We will continue such agitations till the laws are repealed,” said Ajit Navale, general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha (Maharashtra). In Dahanu, nearly 300 agitators reached the circulating area of the railway station. The city police blocked the entry of the agitators on the railway tracks. “The protestors arrived at the circulating area on the west side of Dahanu railway station. They were protesting with the Communist Party of India (CPM) banners. There was no impact on train movements,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, Western Railway. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the protesters are not farmers but workers of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA). “Farmers will never cause inconvenience to others. The protestors are Congress, NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) and Shiv Sena workers and not farmers,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.Also Read | Rail roko: Delhi Metro shuts entry, exit to four stationsThe Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farm unions had given a call for a four-hour rail roko demonstration across the country on Thursday, as a part of their campaign to get the three farm laws repealed. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at different borders of Delhi since last November against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. In December, farmers from across Maharashtra had gathered in Mumbai to agitate against the three laws, in solidarity with the farmers protesting at Delhi borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rail-roko-local-train-service-unaffected-in-maharashtra-101613640186075.html

We are all witness to how alertness of 130 crore Indians became an example for the world in the fight against coronavirus. In this fight, the wisdom and habits taught in our homes, Yoga-Ayurveda has also played a big role," he said.He said the whole world was concerned about India's situation when the pandemic unfolded but today "India's fight against coronavirus is inspiring the whole world".The Prime Minister lauded Shri Ram Chandra Mission for instilling meaningfulness, peace, health and spiritual wellbeing among the people.He also praised the Mission for popularizing yoga.He said in today's fast and stressful life when the world is fighting lifestyle-related diseases and pandemic, Sahaj Marg, Heartfulness and Yoga are like a beacon of hope for the world.The Prime Minister said India is playing a central role in global vaccination."Our vision for wellness is as much global as it is domestic.

19-02-2021||Today's||For India’s women, a week of hope — and anguish||This week, both reaffirming and disturbing in parts, has been important for Indian women. It has been a time for regaining strength and hope, but also a simultaneous reminder of how little changes, even when things do change. The Priya Ramani win against the defamation suit by former Union minister MJ Akbar and the Unnao murders of two Dalit girls have bookended our conversation and our thoughts. I was in the crowded courthouse when the Ramani verdict came — not as a reporter, but as a supporter. I don’t know Ramani closely, but given her courage, her willingness to be the subject of scrutiny, her decision to hold power to account, and her act enabling other women to speak up, I felt this was the least I could do when, really, she was fighting for us all. Akbar, still a Member of Parliament from the ruling party, arrived flanked by a posse of policemen. Our hearts sank for a few minutes. Did the police presence indicate an adverse judgment? But if he had his troops, Ramani had a small army of women (and some men) to fortify her. And as it turned out, the judge, a man, reminded us of some home truths: The right to reputation cannot be at the cost of the right to dignity. A man of social status can also be a sexual harasser. And the most important one, for the MeToo Movement, women are entitled to express their “grievances”, at any forum and even after decades. I could not help but think of Justice Pushpa Ganediwala, the Bombay High Court judge, who had declared that in the absence of skin-to-skin contact, a 12-year-old girl could not claim that she was sexually assaulted by a 39-year-old groper. That verdict came from a woman, and the Ramani verdict from Justice RK Pandey, a timely reminder that both misogyny and feminism can be gender-neutral. More importantly, the verdict shut down the debate on the most banal and common question asked of women: Why didn’t you speak up earlier?Let me, for the last time, attempt to tell you the multitude of reasons there may be. The power differential can make it frightening. The fear of consequences to your career is real. In many professional spaces, women are fighting twice as hard as men to get to the same place and get the same opportunities. If you then speak out about your experience of sexual harassment, there is every chance you will not be sent on certain assignments. As women, many of us have internalised our lives as a prolonged version of boot camp, a sort of Darwinian call to toughen up or perish. As young women, we are terrified that men we consider our mentors can turn out to be monsters. We are yet to wrap our heads around one of the toughest existential truths — there is no connection between brilliance and decency. Our ideas of consent have evolved and changed because feminism has pushed the boundaries. Think of Monica Lewinsky, for instance, and how in the 1990s, we all thought she made a choice to have an affair with the president of the United States. Today, we would put the onus of responsibility for that choice on the man who wields the power and carries the advantage of age. Today, we would wonder which 20-something woman could or would say no to the most powerful man in the world. And finally, women don’t speak up in real- time, because look at what happens when they do. We celebrate the Ramani win because she was not punished for speaking her truth. And not because MJ Akbar has been punished. This is how low our expectations are. And this is when we are women of privilege. But think of the Dalit woman who was strangled with her scarf in Hathras or the two Dalit girls found dead and tied up in a field in Unnao and you remember how much tougher it is for millions of women in India than it is for us. One of the first stories I covered as a cub reporter was the gang rape of a Dalit woman, Bhanwari Devi, in Rajasthan. She was assaulted for trying to stop the child marriage of a one-year-old. Among the rapists was the child’s father. She took her fight all the way to the Supreme Court, from which were born the Vishaka guidelines, the mandatory workplace sexual harassment rules that we all know and practise today. It will be 30 years in 2022 since the rape. Bhanwari Devi is still to get justice. So, the next time you ask women why we do not believe in due process or why we do not speak up in real-time, you may want to pause and hold your silence.

19-02-2021||Today's||Shake power structures to give women dignity||The asymmetrical shape of power that colours sexual abuse was on display on February 17 when former minister MJ Akbar entered courtroom 203 on Rouse Avenue. Escorted by a phalanx of police personnel and his team of lawyers, Akbar was there to hear the verdict of additional metropolitan magistrate, Ravindra Kumar Pandey.The verdict acquitted journalist Priya Ramani against whom Akbar had brought charges of criminal defamation. The judge accepted Ramani’s assertion that “the complainant is not a man of sterling reputation” and ruled that even though her article was per se defamatory, a woman’s right to dignity superseded the right to reputation.It’s an extraordinary judgment that has ramifications far beyond an individual case where a victim of sexual harassment has had to defend herself in a court of law. For one, it marks the first major legal victory in India’s MeToo Movement where chief justices, film actors and celebrated artists have been let off.Second, it offers a rare empathetic ear to the “systemic abuse” of women at work and acknowledges that the “time has come for our society to understand the sexual abuse and sexual harassment”. This too is unprecedented in a legal system where, hearing another case of sexual harassment, the Supreme Court ruled that it was wrong for a senior judge to “flirt” with a junior official. The use of the word “flirt” trivialised what Judge Pandey rightly calls “systemic abuse”.Despite new laws passed in the aftermath of the December 2012 gang rape, India’s women continue to fight a battle of endemic sexual violence. On the day newspapers reported on Ramani’s victory came the horrific news of two Dalit sisters, found dead in Unnao, in a state that has seen an over 66% increase in crimes against women in the past four years and where the trauma of Hathras is yet to die down. Those who say why mention caste forget the fact that it is caste-enabled power structures that facilitates this violence. This lopsided power structure is also why Bhanwari Devi, to whom we owe our law on workplace sexual harassment, is still awaiting justice after a lower court judge ruled that dominant caste men could not have raped her since she is a subordinate caste woman. Her case is still pending in the Rajasthan High Court. The MeToo Movement undoubtedly gave a few women a voice and a platform, but it left out the vast majority of India’s working women, women employed as domestic workers, in brick kilns, as farm labourers, in garment factories. Dalit, tribal, trans and marginalised voices were never heard.The verdict in favour of Ramani who had the support of both her family and her lawyer Rebecca John is worth celebrating and savouring. But it is not enough. It can never be enough until we rearrange power hierarchies to give all women the dignity and right to work without fear.Namita Bhandare writes on genderThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/shake-power-structures-to-give-women-dignity-101613738817526.html
19-02-2021||Today's||Large hydro projects risk Himalayan communities||The impact of the February 7 flash floods in Uttarakhand is still being estimated while rescue and relief operations remain challenged and the death toll rises. The tragedy has brought into sharp focus the environmental risks to the Himalayan people and to the region’s development. This is a moment for all our decision-makers in state governments, courts and Parliament to review their support for Himalayan dams.In recent years, the central government’s unconditional push on renewable energy (RE) has motivated the Himalayan states to seek RE status for the hydropower sector. In March 2019, the Cabinet granted this status to all hydropower projects, effectively removing the earlier policy distinction between projects up to 25 MW and larger ones. This decision came after the standing committee of the ministry of power observed that Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of hydropower stations “is even lesser than solar projects” and that the “net effect of hydro projects has always been positive for the surrounding”.This position signals grave risks for all Himalayan communities, as it could make this ecologically sensitive region the densest hydropower zone in the world. As the committee report shows, the reassessment of large dams as RE has been done with the sole aim of attracting energy finance for hydropower development in the Himalayan region, stated to be “abundant” in water resources.Globally, climate policy debates now take energy transition as a given. The spatial aspects of this ongoing global energy transition, especially the participation of state governments in electricity decarbonisation, are crucial to understand. Energy transition policies and projects are creating new “clean energy” geographies and new energy politics around RE.India’s re-engagement with large hydro is one such regional dynamic. It has drawn small, border Himalayan states into global and national climate and energy discourses. As the representative of Uttarakhand stated to the parliamentary committee, “Solar energy, wind energy or any other form of renewable energy is always going to be smaller. For us, as a state in the Himalayas, hydro is our main stake.”The ambitions of the Indian Himalayan states to seize the energy transition narrative illustrates what climate scholars identify as a shift from “burden-sharing to opportunity-sharing” in climate policies. The parliamentary committee report details several attempts by state representatives to persuade national policymakers to recognise that India’s energy transition pathways necessarily include the politically delegitimised and ecologically damaging large hydro.Governments anticipate a number of developmental benefits of energy transition such as cheaper, reliable energy for economic development, revenues from export of “green” fuel, access to international development finance, and increased local business opportunities. These are referred to as “co-benefits” in climate policy discourses. Co-benefits are crucial to justify the exemptions, concessions and incentives given upfront by states to attract private investments for large-scale RE projects. These discourses have been applied to policymaking in the “Himachal model” of private hydro-development. The state’s policies guarantee purchase of power, easy and cheap land transfers and exemptions from local consent.The hydro sector is still dominated by public sector units due to their access to long-term finance and State guarantees.Despite several policy changes, the share of the private sector has remained low as compared to private investments in the coal power sector. The committee report shows the Himalayan state representatives and the hydropower bureaucracy stating unambiguously that the RE status and accompanied incentives are needed to attract private investments to the sector. The RE tag is a means to create new investment opportunities in the hydro sector for financial elites and energy capital.The social and environmental risks of large dams are well-documented. Although the committee’s report records that “geological surprises” resulting from weak Himalayan geology, “lack of technology or expertise, natural calamities like landslides, floods, and cloud bursts etc cause severe setbacks in construction schedules”, the committee didn’t see these as problems that require in-depth examination. Instead, the report dedicates its attention to reducing the financial risk to existing and potential dam-builders.In an effort to attract investments from the private sector that is reluctant to venture into “remote” Himalayan locations, government agencies are willing to undertake construction of “enabling infrastructure” at public cost. Himalayan road construction, that has a serious impact, should be seen as an integral part of incentivising private hydro-development in this region.The standing committee report is an excellent example of the opportunistic use of RE and how the development of private hydro-finance overtakes the assessment of social and environmental risks of dams.Manju Menon and Kanchi Kohli are with the Centre for Policy ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/large-hydro-projects-risk-himalayan-communities-101613658884452.html
19-02-2021||Today's||EU’s China dilemma is a sign of things to come||After the end of the Cold War, the world grew accustomed to the notion of a single global economy, one in which political barriers were a secondary concern or applicable only to those countries adopting a deliberate policy of isolation.Such one-world globalism was not a novel consideration. A similar idealism was a feature towards the end of World War II — at the Yalta Conference, the establishment of the United Nations, and even the Bretton Woods Conference — that persisted until early 1947. As historian Benn Steil has written, events came to a head that year. Leaders in the United States (US) concluded that the post-War European recovery could no longer rely on the free flow of commerce with a Soviet sphere of influence. The result was the division of the European — and world — economy, and the creation of the Marshall Plan, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the European Coal and Steel Community.Europe is once again the primary testing ground for the future cohesion of the international economy. The European Union (EU) remains one of the world’s three largest concentrations of economic activity, along with the US and China. Decisions taken by the EU — and Germany in particular — will have major ripple effects on much of the rest of the world.The persistent assumption among elites in both North America and Europe was that, despite its many differences, the North Atlantic economy would remain something of a cohesive whole. It reflected shared values and history and was characterised by dense networks of exchange and institutions. Recent attempts at advancing European strategic autonomy, led by French President Emmanuel Macron, might rankle with Americans, much as Gaullism and Ostpolitik once did. But concerns in Washington are growing that transatlantic divides on global economic issues go beyond a quest for autonomy.Such concerns were apparently realised after the finalisation, in principle, of a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) between EU and China in December. The CAI’s supporters argue that the agreement had long been under negotiation; that it did not mark a capitulation on such matters as foreign direct investment screening, export controls, or disinformation; and that it ensures better market access, a level-playing field, and sustainability objectives in China.But the voices of criticism within Europe — particularly among the strategic community — have been overwhelming. The criticism has less to do with the economic implications — there are devils in the details and China’s commitments are questionable. But the agreement was nonetheless an unambiguous political victory for Beijing, which may explain why Xi Jinping himself reportedly intervened to ensure a favourable outcome. At the same time, the brunt of criticism has been directed less at Brussels and more at Berlin, which is accused of having pushed through the deal for the narrow benefit of German manufacturing and telecommunications corporations.Less than two weeks before CAI was agreed upon, US national security adviser-designate Jake Sullivan rather unusually took to Twitter to voice concern and suggest a delay before concluding the deal. “The Biden-Harris administration would welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices,” he wrote. While European leaders had previously indicated that their troubles with the US were a consequence of former President Donald Trump’s contemptuous attitude, the failure to work with a new US administration — despite such public entreaties — suggests deeper discontent.There are some important countervailing trends to suggest that Europe’s present rift with Washington is not irreparable and that its relationship with Beijing is not without its own challenges. The first is an unanticipated consequence of Brexit. The Biden administration’s frustration with Brussels has resulted in unexpected cooperation with the Boris Johnson government in London, which has independently reached its own conclusions about Beijing. The second is an impending leadership transition in Berlin, given the outsized role that Germany played in CAI. Third, Chinese efforts in Europe have also struggled. The recent 17+1 summit — a format once perceived as undermining European cohesion — saw some participating countries downgrading their involvement. Other matters, such as the detention of two Canadians by China and developments in Hong Kong and Xinjiang have contributed to unified positions staked by European governments with their American counterparts.Amid these turbulent undercurrents, the European private sector recognises the dilemma it now faces. The ability to integrate supply chains, innovation streams, data, critical components, and finance with both the US and China appears increasingly untenable. This will, over time, prove costly, hampering efficiency, knowledge, and economies of scale. The dilemma is not unique.In both the US and India, the political consensus has shifted gradually away from economic over-dependence on China. In India’s case, it has resulted in specific outcomes — a drop in Chinese imports, greater investment scrutiny, and restrictions on digital apps and public procurement.The evolution from a one-world economy to a two-world system with its many redundancies will, unlike the post-World War II era, be long-drawn-out and costly. The differences between States, even close allies, are real but not necessarily insurmountable. Instead, greater engagement between national security communities and the private sector may be the need of the hour.Dhruva Jaishankar is executive director, ORF AmericaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/eus-china-dilemma-is-a-sign-of-things-to-come-101613658882758.html
19-02-2021||Editorials||The rise of freak weather events||A huge winter storm is sweeping across the southern United States (US), with Texas being the worst-hit. Millions of people in the state have been struggling to cope with the lack of power and frigid conditions. The extreme weather is expected to continue until the weekend, and deaths attributed to the storm have been recorded in four other states, besides Texas. Many other parts of the world — The Netherlands, Russia, Syria, Greece — also saw unusually cold weather this week, but nowhere is it as bad as in Texas. Difficult weather conditions across the US have had serious implications for the pandemic: Some shipments of vaccines have been delayed and some clinics have had to cancel vaccine appointments.While scientists are trying to establish the link between this particular episode of freak weather in the southern US and the climate crisis, there is a growing body of research that has established the connection between the climate crisis and a phenomenon called the polar vortex. Scientific research suggests warming in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else on the planet, may be weakening the jet stream that confines the cold air in the northern hemisphere. A weakened jet stream allows freezing air to move to lower latitudes. As experts have pointed out, what is happening in Texas can’t be just seen as a natural event, and is in part due to the climate crisis.The Texas event and other freak climate events across the world — India too has witnessed such incidents in recent years — are a reminder for governments that they must re-evaluate their nation’s utility infrastructure for climate resilience, and invest heavily to upgrade them so that they can quickly adapt and function during freak and extreme weather events. For example, the main electric grid in Texas was built with the state’s most common weather extremes in mind — soaring summer temperatures that cause millions of Texans to turn up their air conditioners all at once — but now it has to be recalibrated to tackle such cold events too. All over the world, operators have to be ready for intense heat waves, floods, water shortages and other calamities, all of which could create unknown risks for electricity set-ups. This transition won’t be easy, because most planners face an unprecedented challenge. The extreme weather events of the 21st century will look nothing like those that happened before — and years of past preparation will not provide any workable template.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-rise-of-freak-weather-events-101613738513582.html
19-02-2021||Editorials||The implications of Biplab Deb’s gaffe | HT Editorial||Tripura’s chief minister Biplab Deb recently said that home minister Amit Shah — while he was the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — had joked, at a closed-door meeting, that after achieving electoral success domestically, the party would expand in Nepal and Sri Lanka. “We were talking during a meeting at the state guest house when Ajay Jamwal (BJP’s zonal secretary for the northeast) said the BJP was in a good position as it was in power in many states. In reply, Amit Shah said Sri Lanka and Nepal are still left. We have to take the party there and win there as well,” said Mr Deb, with a laugh.In the absence of a comment from Mr Shah on the issue, it is not possible to know whether he did indeed make such a remark. Mr Deb’s comments can be read as a light-hearted joke about the BJP’s tremendous success in recent years at home. But, in the neighbourhood, it is being read as the characteristic arrogance of Indian leaders in assuming that smaller neighbours have little agency of their own and fall within an Indian “sphere of influence” where political ideologies can be exported and political configurations determined. This may not have been the intent, but given the sensitivities on nationalism and sovereignty in the neighbourhood, this reading of the comment is not surprising.Remember, in Nepal, there is an active conservative constituency which seeks the restoration of monarchy and the Hindu state — and Nepali commentators have been left wondering if the BJP has plans to actively intervene in the country with such an objective in mind. India’s past political interventions in these countries only leads to further apprehensions and has prompted official responses from both Sri Lanka and Nepal. The lesson for Indian leaders, particularly those occupying constitutional positions, is to be more responsible, recognise boundaries, and know that jokes aren’t always funny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-implications-of-biplab-deb-s-gaffe-hteditorial-101613658825260.html
19-02-2021||Editorials||Engage with the academic world | HT Editorial||In January, the ministry of education, in consultation with the ministry of external affairs (MEA), issued revised guidelines for virtual conferences/seminars/trainings. The guidelines stipulate that any ministry or department, central educational public institutions, public-funded universities, and state-owned companies would require the approval of the relevant administrative secretary for both the event and list of participants. The subject matter must not be related to the security of State, border, Northeast states, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh or “any other issues which are clearly/purely related to India’s internal matter/s”. The guidelines add that there must be “appropriate level of scrutiny” to “identify the nature and sensitivity of data/contents of presentation/information” shared by the Indian delegation. MEA approval will be required for all events related to “India’s internal matters”, events with foreign funding, and events “involving sensitive subjects (political, scientific, technical, commercial, personal) with provisions for sharing of data in any form”.India has always taken pride in being a democracy and an open society. A fundamental tenet of an open society is the free and frank exchange of views and, in academic settings, cutting-edge research on all subjects, including those which may not align with the State’s narrative or priorities. Given the interconnected nature of disciplines which blurs the line between internal and external domains, the presence of specialised academics working on India abroad, the value of comparative perspectives in sharpening the understanding of events at home, and the fact that “internal affairs” can encompass every subject related to India, the guidelines are excessive and will stifle academic discussions. At a time when the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards virtual conferences, this is a moment to deepen international knowledge-sharing, rather than curtail it.A range of academic organisations and scholars — from the American Historical Association and 17 other umbrella American academic organisations to the Indian Academy of Sciences and Indian academics in foreign universities — have criticised the provisions, and rightly so. India has legitimate security concerns and must be fully vigilant. But India is also a confident democracy, willing to examine its strengths and weaknesses, and open to learning from the best. And that is why it must not be insecure about free academic exchanges on all subjects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/engage-with-the-academic-world-hteditorial-101613658823116.html
