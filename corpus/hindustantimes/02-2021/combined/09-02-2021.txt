09-02-2021||Mumbai||Cryptocurrency fraud: No bail to 2 members of gang that duped 15,810 of ₹113.10 crore||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday rejected bail applications filed by two members of a gang that duped about 15,810 investors or over ₹113.10 crore after luring them to invest in several schemes relating to a cryptocurrency - money trade coins (MTC) launched by the group.Both the accused, Sachin Shelar, 43 from Dombivli and Taha Kazi, 26, from Kausa locality in Mumbra, had moved HC for bail claiming that they were ordinary employees of the firms floated by prime accused, Amit Lakhanpal, and as such acted as per his instructions. They claimed that there was, no evidence to suggest that they were beneficiaries of the fraud.Justice Sandeep Shinde rejected the claims after noticing that evidence collected by police suggested that both of them were active at all stages of the fraud, right from floating schemes, developing websites, monitoring the rate of cryptocurrency, activating and blocking investor accounts and collection of cash from different parts of the country and its appropriation.HC said though a forensic audit of the groups’ bank accounts was yet to be concluded to trace the money trail, today it could not be said that the two were not beneficiaries of the fraud. In fact, looking at their role in the entire process, it was unlikely that they were not beneficiaries of the fraud, the court added.The fraud came to light after an investor, Pravin Agarwal, lodged a complaint with Chitalsar police station at Thane in 2018. He came in touch with the group when he attended a seminar organised by Lakhanpal in August 2017 at Taj Mansingh, New Delhi, where the main accused posed as an officer of the Union finance ministry and lured the attendees to invest in the cryptocurrency launched by Flinstone Group, promising high returns.Agarwal thereafter visited the group office at Thane and invested ₹10 lakh in MTC. The company then opened Agarwal’s MT pay account and “transferred” the virtual currency worth the investment into his account in January 2018. However, instead of encashing the investment on due dates, the group kept on luring him with high-interest returns by rolling the investment in new schemes floated by it, prompting him to approach the police.In this backdrop, both Shelar and Kazi were arrested by unit 1 of the Thane crime branch in June 2018. Opposing their bail plea, additional public prosecutor Veera Shinde pointed out that Shelar was not an ordinary employee of the group but was on the board of director of six group companies. Shinde further pointed out that he had fled to Dubai along with the prime accused, Lakhanpal, soon after the crime was registered by Chitalsar police.Shinde pointed out that Kazi was in charge of technical operations of the group such as developing a website, finalising advertising materials and also controlled online registration of investors and the rate of the group’s cryptocurrency.The prosecutor further pointed out that the police have found that the group had duped in all 15,810 investors to the tune of ₹113.10 crores. Justice Shinde found force in her submissions and dismissed the bail applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cryptocurrency-fraud-no-bail-to-2-members-of-gang-that-duped-15-810-of-113-10-crore-101612895278363.html

As per the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), the centre treated merely 50-60 patients till date. City doctors claimed the reduction in Covid positive cases has led to the poor response to the post-Covid treatment. The KDMC had set up the daycare facility for pulmonary physiotherapy, jointly with the Indian Medical Association (IMA). The centre located at Mahajan Hall in Kalyan (West) provided daycare physiotherapy facility for those with breathing problems. Prashant Patil, president, IMA, said, “The post-Covid centre was only functional for 45 days, while the response was poor. Sometimes, not a single patient visited the centre for a day. As the number of Covid-19 cases has reduced, the patients visiting the centre has come down too. The centre aimed to rehabilitate the lungs to treat the lung damage observed in Covid.” The tennis court was earlier set up as a Covid care centre by the KDMC, it was later shut when the number of positive cases in KDMC reduced. Mhatre said, “Several patients have been suffering from blood pressure issues, diabetes and heart ailments after recovering from the Covid infection. These patients usually visit the private hospitals for treatment and there they are charged excessively. A centre by the KDMC will help such cases,” said Mhatre. However, despite the dismal response to its first centre, the KDMC now plans to start a post-Covid care hospital at the tennis court of Savlaram Krida Sankul (sports complex), following demand by KDMC corporator Dipesh Mhatre. KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi said, “This new centre will have all the facilities to give treatment for those suffering from health issues after recovering from Covid. The centre in Kalyan was merely a rehabilitation centre focusing on breathing exercises which we closed. The new centre at Dombivli is for holistic treatment of any ailment suffered post-recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poor-response-to-post-covid-19-rehab-centre-in-kalyan-101612894918263.html

The delay in punishment was attributed to the time it took the adjudicated the age of the accused and then the transfer of files from one board to other. During this time, the suspect was let off on bail three months after his detention, get married to another woman and had children. He will, however, be sent to a special home for juvenile convicts now.The Dadri police had detained the minor in July, 2002, a month after the girl’s family discovered her pregnancy and reported it to the authorities. The girl had named the suspect and said he had raped her while she was alone at home. In August that year, the Gautam Budh Nagar (GB Nagar) chief judicial magistrate transferred the case to the district sessions court. Here, a challenge was mounted over the age of the accused. It took five years for the court to decide that the accused was indeed a minor and had it transferred to the juvenile justice board (JJB) in Meerut. When a JJB was constituted in Gautam Budh Nagar in 2012, an issue of jurisdiction arose, and the case was transferred to it in there. However, the proceedings took time and the verdict was declared Tuesday.“JJB principal magistrate Viresh Chandra and member Aneet Baghel today held the accused guilty. He has been sent to the Special Home for Juvenile Convicts at Etawah,” said prosecution officer Amit Uppal. “Since he had already been in confinement for 3 months, the rest will be served at the special home.”Uppal confirmed the accused person’s marital status and that he had children, but could not confirm anything about the rape survivor. Regarding the delay, Uppal said, “There are several cases that have been delayed for years. Sometimes witnesses are not available, at other times the court does not function, police officers may not be able to be present over some reason and on some dates the judge may be on leave. In rape cases, particularly, tracing victims and witnesses is very difficult.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nineteen-years-after-rape-accused-man-sent-to-juvenile-home-101612894857410.html

The suspects, identified as Rohit, 23, a resident of Aligarh and Subhash, 24, a resident of Mahoba, were arrested after an encounter with police at Dada roundabout in Greater Noida, police said. Two other suspects, Dev Sharma and Vishan Singh Bhadoria, were arrested by police on Sunday evening. The four suspects had allegedly killed Narendra Nath, 70, and his wife Suman Nath, 65, at their house in Sector Alpha 2 on Thursday night. According to police, Rohit, the mastermind who had killed the woman, received a bullet injury to his left leg, while Subhash was injured in his right leg during the encounter. Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that Rohit and Subhas had been on the run. “On Tuesday, police was conducting a checking drive when they spotted the suspects on a high-end motorcycle. Police asked them to stop for checking but they opened fire which led to an encounter and they were arrested,” he said. A stolen gold chain, a ring, two mobile phones, two countrymade guns, some Indian currency notes and some foreign currencies were recovered from their possession, police said. Police had announced ₹25,000 reward on arrest of each suspect. Vishal Pandey, additional DCP, Greater Noida, said that police have now arrested all four criminals in this case. “During investigation, we found that there were five glasses and only three of them were used for drinking. We have also recovered the stolen valuables, including jewellery and bank documents. Based on electronic surveillance, we first arrested Dev Sharma and Vishan Singh Bhadoria who revealed that Rohit and Saurabh had hatched the murder plot,” he said. Rohit had borrowed ₹2 lakh from Narendra Nath, police said, adding that the four suspects first killed Narendra and then his wife as he didn’t want to return the money.The elderly couple’s son Rohit Nath, who lives with his family in AWHO society, said that he feels there are still some gaps in the investigation. “There were six glasses at the spot, so who was the fifth suspect at the time of crime. The suspects had stolen cash and jewellery from the house. We do not know these suspects are. If the police recover the stolen valuables, then we can be satisfied that these are the same criminals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-more-suspects-arrested-in-elderly-couple-s-murder-in-greater-noida-101612894677493.html

The suspects were identified as Manoj Shah, 40, a native of Darbhanga in Bihar, and Satyendra Upadhyaya, 30, from Ballia district in Uttar Pradesh.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that the suspects were presently living in Faridabad. “Police had information that the suspects were involved in cheating people through fake currency notes. On Tuesday, police received a tip-off about their movement near Barola T-point and arrested them red-handed,” he said. Fake currency notes (in denominations of ₹500, ₹200 and ₹100) with a face value of ₹17,96,400 were recovered from them, police said, adding that some real notes worth ₹3,600 were also recovered.Vishal Kumar, in-charge of Barolla check post, said the gang had a unique modus operandi to cheat people. “The suspects used to roam around in Delhi-NCR and strike a conversation with people. They would tell their victim that they had some fake currency notes which looked almost real. Then they exchanged fake notes having face value of ₹15,000 with real notes worth ₹10,000 from the victim,” Kumar said.Kumar further said that in fact those fake notes were not fake. “The suspects used to give real notes to the people to take them in confidence. People used to circulate those notes in the market without any hurdle and again contacted to supply more fake notes,” he said.But this time the suspects would play the trick. “The suspects used to buy fake notes in bulk from Chawri Bazar in Delhi. They placed only two original notes on the front and back and properly sandwiched the fake notes in the bundle. They used to fix the deal with the victim to exchange real notes worth ₹5 lakh with fake notes having a face value of ₹18 lakh. The suspects used to call the victims for the exchange in a crowded market so that the victims could not count the money,” Kumar said.The two suspects told police that they had been involved in this racket since March last year after they lost a job during the lockdown. “It is believed they have cheated several people of ₹20-30 lakh in the last few months,” police said.A case has been registered against them under Section 420 (cheating) of IPC. The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fake-currency-notes-with-face-value-of-18-lakh-seized-two-arrested-101612894619354.html

The deceased was identified as Uttam Kesharwani, a native of Fatehpur. The incident that took place around 4.30am was caught in CCTV cameras, police said, adding that the guard died on the spot.“There were two security guards on duty during the night. In the CCTV monitors inside the control room, they saw the suspect on the premises after which a security guard went out to check the situation,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.

The other guard then called the police helpline and reported the incident.According to police, the company is an American cash solutions and logistics firm which transports money for large businesses. A complaint in the case was filed by the manager of the company, based on which a case of murder (section 302 of the Indian Penal Code) was registered against the unidentified person at Sector 20 police station.The police officials said that all angles are being looked at though it appears to be an insider’s job as the suspect knew exactly where he was going. But he was unable to break in and take away any valuables due to Kesharwani’s intervention. Three teams have been formed to identify and track the suspect.Police said that the second guard claims to have frozen out of fear but his role is also being investigated.

09-02-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad civic body plans to revise property tax structure||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation plans changes to the property tax model linking it to revised rental values and property location. Officials said the new model will see a 25% increase in tax revenue.This is the first time in 20 years that the civic body moved to revised the rental value. Residents may have to shell out three times the property tax that they are used to paying. Civic body officials say it would help in completing important projects.Under the proposed structure, the corporation has categorised localities in 100 residential under three heads ‘A,’ ‘B’ and ‘C’ based on the rental vales, which will now be linked to the district magistrate’s circle rates. ‘A’ category localities comprise of prime localities and will have the highest rental value, while the category ‘C’ are least developed and will have least rental value.Further, under each head, the location of the property on roads of varying width -- less than 12 m, between 12 m and 24 m and over 24 m -- will have a proportional impact on the tax. Previously, the corporation used to rely solely on this criterion for determining property tax.At present, about 330,00 households pay the tax, which is charged annually based on the monthly rental value that ranges from 0.60p to ₹1.90 per square feet (psf) of the property. “Under the proposed arrangement, the rental value will now range from 0.75p to ₹4 psf under the three categories,” said Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, corporation’s chief tax assessment officer. House tax, of which property tax is 10%, brings in ₹125 crore. “The proposed property tax structure is similar to the one in Lucknow. We estimate that the plan will bring in an additional 25% tax revenue,” said municipal commissioner M S Tanwar. “The rental values will be defined every two years.” “The rates had been unchanged since 2001. We have invited the public to put forth their objections within 15 days (till February 20 at any of the body’ five zonal offices or headquarters). We will fine tune the proposal and implement it from the next financial year,” he said. Some of the colonies which are categorised under category ‘A’ include blocks of Kavi Nagar, Raj Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Neelam Vihar and Seemant Vihar in Kaushambi, sectors in Vasundhara and Vaishali, Shalimar Garden (main), Raj Nagar Extension besides Nyay Khand, Niti Khand, Abhay Khand, Shakti Khand and Gyan Khand in Indirapuram. The rental value of properties on three different roads defined under category A is proposed to range from ₹1.25 to ₹4 psf, for category B from 90p to ₹3.5 psf and for category C from 0.75p to ₹3 psf. Commercial and industrial taxes, which are linked to residential rates, will also be increased. “The hike will affect the common man and basing the property tax on the circle rate is wrong. The circle rate is meant for sale/purchase of properties and not for tax. We will file objections and oppose the move. In order to increase revenue, the corporation must try to bring in households still left out of the ambit of house tax and also act against those yet to pay the tax,” said Raj Nagar councillor Rajendra Tyagi. As per rules, the commissioner can decide on determining property tax. However, the councillors can object during House Meetings, although they may not be able to stop the reform.Box: proposed property tax structure The rental values for calculation of property tax will be defined on basis of circle rates released by the district magistrateColonies in 100 residential wards divided into three categories with different rental values based on their locations at different roads Rental value for three categories of colonies will be defined on the basis of location on roads having width less than 12 metres; road with from 12 metres to 24 metres and those located on roads having width more than 24 metres Old rental values of properties range from 0.60p per square feet to ₹1.9 per square feet Category ‘A’ colonies are proposed to have rental value in range of ₹1.25 to ₹4 per square foot; category ‘B’ colonies in range of 0.90p to ₹3.5 and category ‘C’ colonies in range of 0.75p to ₹3 per square foot Some of the colonies which are categorised under category ‘A’ include blocks of Kavi Nagar, Raj Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Neelam Vihar and Seemant Vihar in Kaushambi, sectors in Vasundhara and Vaishali, Shalimar Garden (main), Raj Nagar Extension besides Nyay Khand, Niti Khand, Abhay Khand, Shakti Khand and Gyan Khand in Indirapuram||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-plans-to-revise-property-tax-structure-101612894559692.html
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Dip in demand for engineering; no takers for 55,000 college seats||Demand for engineering seats is low according to the state common entrance test (CET) cell, whose data reveals nearly 45% seats in first-year, undergraduate engineering (BTech) courses remained vacant across the state this year. While seats in government-aided and university-managed institutes have more takers comparatively, almost 98% of the total vacant seats are in private, unaided engineering institutes in the state this year. Figures shared by the admissions authority shows 54,667 of the 55,444 vacant seats across engineering institutes this year are in unaided institutes. Vacancy in postgraduate (MTech) courses stands at 55.2% this year compared to 65% last year. “The blanket ban on new engineering colleges has specially been implemented keeping in mind the mushrooming of private engineering colleges across the country. Year after year new private players start colleges, but the quality of teaching keeps dipping and seat vacancy keeps increasing,” said an official from the state CET cell. Last year, seat vacancy in BTech courses was at 48%. Admissions to all professional courses were delayed by a few months in 2020 due to the pandemic and the ambiguity surrounding the implementation of the quota for socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC, also known as the Maratha quota) in Maharashtra. After waiting for clarity on the issue of the quota, the state decided in November 2020 to conduct admissions to all courses without implementing the SEBC quota. As per figures shared by the CET cell, vacancies in Masters in business administration (MBA) and Masters in management studies (MMS) courses stand at 32.85% this year and seats under the economically weaker sections (EWS) quotas show vacancies across courses. Over 76% seats in the EWS category have found no takers this year. Experts have blamed this on job losses in the Covid era. “Students who secure seats under the EWS quota need to pay 50% fees, but that amount too could be too much for someone without a job. While students applied for the course in February 2020, many youngsters ended up losing jobs during the lockdown and that has strained the family income. This could’ve forced students to forfeit their admissions this year,” said Dr R K Srivastava, professor and head of department at Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education (SIMSREE). The EWS quota was first implemented in 2019 and data from the CET cell shows that in Bachelor in engineering and technology (BE/BTech) courses, seat vacancy in the EWS quota stood at 82% across government and private institutes in 2019-20 academic year with 1,877 out of 10,249 reserved seats finding takers. Similarly, the overall seat vacancy in the EWS quota in Masters in engineering and technology (ME/MTech) admissions stood at 94% and 90% of seats under the EWS quota stayed vacant in management courses (MBA/MMS) that year. “Demand for seats under the EWS quota is slowly picking up, but students are still unaware of the rules and regulations. In some cases, students had all the required documents, but were not aware that they will have to pay 50% of the fees, which many could not afford especially since fees at private institutes are higher than at government institutes. The government needs to look into this lacuna,” said a senior official from a government-run engineering institute in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-dip-in-demand-for-engineering-no-takers-for-55-000-college-seats-101612894558962.html
09-02-2021||Noida||UP Gate farmers gear up to maintain gathering in absence of Rakesh Tikait||At the UP Gater farmers’ protest site, the union leaders are facing an issue: the number of protesters seem to go up whenever Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait was present, but not otherwise.Tikait’s popularity soared since January 28 when a video of him in tears went viral. He was seen responding to Ghaziabad district administration’s ultimatum to farmers, following the violence in Delhi on Republic Day, that he would rather surrender than give in. That video gave new life to a protest that was seemingly losing steam after the violence.“His popularity is growing, and he is now seen as spearheading the protest at UP Gate,” said Gaurav Tikait, president of the youth wing of the BKU and Rakesh Tikait’s nephew. “We have noticed that the number of people does tend to come down when he is not here. Also, many farmers have to harvest sugarcane, which is a major crop in western UP.”Leading up to Republic Day, the protest site saw thousands of farmers join to attend the tractor rally to Delhi. After the violence, attendance dropped as many feared police reprisal.“Since the video, people rushed to meet Rakesh Tikait. When he is there, there are easily around 4,000 to 5,000 people. We are trying to keep the numbers the same when he is out for meetings and attending rallies,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of UP-Gate farmers’ committee.Rakesh Tikait could not be reached for comment. But, he was addressing a rally in Haryana’s Kurukshetra where he asked people to prepare a plan to increase the gathering at places where protesters were fewer.“The agitation will go on for long and we have given time to the government till October 2. It should not happen that you return home like you did on January 26. Now you make plan to increase the gathering and get prepared to stay for at least five days at the protest site,” Tikait said.He also told gathering that the incident at the Red Fort was allegedly part of conspiracy.“It has been over 77 days and the government is not listening. Some youths were taken to the Red Fort. In 1988, when 5 to 6 lakh farmers led by Chaudhary Mahendra Singh Tikait (found of BKU) went to Boat Club in Delhi they were at some distance from the Parliament. But no one went to the Parliament. We also say many times that we will go to Parliament, but we never went. But the incident of putting up the flag at Red Fort was conspiracy,” Tikait told gathering at Kurukshetra.Tiakit, who now has a “verified” Twitter account, also took a dig a the speech made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Rajya Sabha on Monday and tweeted on Tuesday while calling himself as “andolan jeevi” who had been fighting for the rights of farmers and poor for past 30 years.The Prime Minister on Monday strongly defended the three farm laws which he said will largely benefit small and marginal farmers. He also warned country against “andolanjeevis” (those who live off protests), and the influence of FDI (“foreign destructive ideology”).The PM also appealed to the agitating farmers’ groups to call off their protest and said that all doors for suggestions and improvement remain open.The farmers are protesting at UP Gate since November 28, 2020 and demanding repeal of three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-gate-farmers-gear-up-to-maintain-gathering-in-absence-of-rakesh-tikait-101612894498953.html

He had married the woman five years ago in a village in Greater Noida. The couple has two children aged 2 and 4 years, police said. Police said that the man used to drink heavily and this led to frequent quarrel with his wife. “A few days ago the woman had shifted to her parents’ home in Greater Noida with her children.

09-02-2021||Noida||Covid-19 vaccination: GB Nagar health department makes 80 booths for mop up round||NOIDA: Facing a tough task of inoculating 10,510 left out health workers – listed for first phase of Covid-19 vaccination – the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has made as many as 83 vaccination booths for the mop up round on February 15. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the health department officials have been asked to exponentially increase the pace of coronavirus vaccination as the district’s performance has not been very encouraging in the first phase of vaccination. “The vaccination officials have been asked to ensure proper authentication of beneficiaries and timely data reconciliation on Co-Win app. They have also been told to provide adequate attention to issuance of provisional digital vaccination certificates after the first dose and final certificate after the second dose,” he said. GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that a three-day meeting in this connection has been called upon, which began on Monday. “Since many of the beneficiaries have reportedly either left their jobs or shifted to some other places, we’ll be able to locate the exact number of left out health workers, after uploading the exact data on February 11,” he said. The CMO also said that all the remaining health workers will be inoculated during the mop up round on February 15. “For the mop up round, as many as 83 vaccination booths have been readied, which is maximum number of booths in any session so far. Each of these booths will have the capacity to vaccinate at least 125 persons in a day. It is expected that after the mop up round, all the health workers in the district have the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine,” he said. It may be noted that after the six sessions for the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination that ended on February 5, the overall turnout for the phase in GB Nagar district was nearly 57% as 13,943 health workers took the jabs out of enlisted 24,453 beneficiaries. District vaccination officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that the failure of potential beneficiaries to get vaccinated in the mop up round will automatically push them to age-appropriate vaccination category. “The second dose of the vaccine is also scheduled to start from February 13 for people, who were inoculated on January 16 in the first phase,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-vaccination-gb-nagar-health-department-makes-80-booths-for-mop-up-round-101612894438704.html

The factory did not have a no-objection certificate from the fire department, said officials, adding that the incident took place around 11 am.“It seems that the factory had a furnace for which it used LPG cylinders. One of the cylinders was kept close to the furnace and because of the heat, it burst injuring the five people nearby,” said Arun Kumar Singh, chief fire officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.The officials said that there were another 150 workers in the main factory and only the five were present in the shed with the furnace. It took one fire tender nearly 15 minutes to control the fire.“Because of the lack of any hazardous material, the fire did not spread making it easy to control. Though the factory appeared to have the necessary fire fighting equipment, they did not have an NOC. Necessary action will be taken soon in this case upon further investigation,” said Singh.Workers said that the blast also damaged the tin roof of the shed. “We heard a huge bang after which we rushed outside. We saw that a part of the shed had caught fire and the people inside were injured. It took us a while to pull them out after which we realised that a cylinder had burst,” said Monu, a worker at the factory.Police said that the five injured workers were first taken to the district hospital from where they were referred to the burn unit of a higher centre in Delhi. “Two of them are said to be in critical state and are undergoing treatment for third degree burns,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.He said that no complaint has been filed in this matter yet. But action will be taken as soon as the complaint is filed, SHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/five-injured-in-cylinder-blast-at-noida-hardware-factory-101612894438116.html
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: MMRDA’s cycle vision back on track in BKC||After a failed attempt a decade back, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has revived its plan of installing a cycle track in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). The cycle track will be built along the footpath with bollards separating the pavement from the track, officials said.On Tuesday, the guardian minister for Mumbai suburbs, Aaditya Thackeray, tweeted, “MMRDA is executing a cycle track in BKC. With increased offices, connectivity, we hope this would help with the last-mile connect.” He further said that pedestrians, cyclists, cars, and buses should have their rightful space on the streets and the government is working towards the same.RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “The work is in progress. Around 4.5-5km stretch in BKC will have a cycle track.” When asked about the changes incorporated this time around, Rajeev said the height of the track has been raised at the footpath level. The MMRDA is also painting the track a separate colour for motorists to identify.In 2011, MMRDA had spent around Rs6 crore to create a cycle track. However, the project failed as two-wheelers used the lane to manoeuvre traffic. It was also used as a parking spot by autos.However, MMRDA, in August 2020, launched a public-bike sharing scheme in BKC, which has picked pace. As per recent data, more than 78,000 trips have been made on the e-bikes in five months. These bikes were mainly introduced for connectivity to the suburban Bandra and Kurla railway stations.AV Shenoy, a transport expert from the Mumbai Mobility Forum, said, “We will have to wait and watch as to how it works this time around. Authorities must give equal importance to pedestrian infrastructure also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mmrda-s-cycle-vision-back-on-track-in-bkc-101612894378360.html
09-02-2021||Noida||Dense fog expected for next two days, Noida among most polluted cities||Weather and pollution analysts on Tuesday said the next two days could see dense fog and “very poor” air in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. The three cities were once again the top-3 most polluted cities in the country.The western disturbance (moisture laden winds that originate from the Mediterranean) that hit the north Indian states earlier this month affected a change of wind direction -- from the icy cold and dry north-westerly to warm and moist southerly and south-westerly.These winds are slow and moisture-laden, which will lead to suspension of particulate matter and low ventilation. The dense fog will impact visibility especially over open areas like expressways and highways. Between around 4 am to 10 am, the visibility at some places will drop to 50 metres, experts said. “The wind speed (over the national capital region) is around 5kmph. This is likely to remain till Thursday. But, after the western disturbance passes after Friday, the wind speed will increase and disperse the fog,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. On Tuesday, the maximum and minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 25.9 degrees Celsius (°C) and 10.3°C, respectively against 10.1°C and 24.1°C a day earlier. According to the IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to remain around the season’s average for next two day and hover around 27°C and 10°C. Air QualityMeanwhile, Noida’s air quality worsened due to the low wind speed and is likely to worsen further. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on a scale of 0 to 500, on Tuesday was 347 – third worst in the country -- against 310 a day earlier. Greater Noida’s AQI was against 348 – second worst in the country -- against 319 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 374 – top polluted city-- against 329 on Monday. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered “very poor” and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), air quality will worsen further for the next three days. “Surface winds are low and south south-westerly direction and forecasted to decrease. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate but within the Very Poor category for the next two days. High end of Very Poor AQI is forecasted 12th February,” read the Safar statement on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dense-fog-expected-for-next-two-days-noida-among-most-polluted-cities-101612894317479.html
09-02-2021||Bangalore||Reservation demands by prominent communities add to Yediyurappa's troubles||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday found himself in an uncomfortable spot as an influential seer of the Valmiki community threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike if the government does not accept demands of increasing reservation opportunities."By 9 March if this (increase in reservation) does not happen, I will start an indefinite hunger strike," Prasananda Swami, an influential seer of the Valmiki community, said on Tuesday in Rajanahalli, Davangere, about 265 kilometres from Bengaluru."If the government does not announce this and I die, all of you....," he said, cutting short his sentence while the crowd roared in support.CM Yediyurappa had flown to Davangere in a chopper to attend the Maharshi Valmiki Jaatre fair. Yediyurappa, who was seated next to the seer on the stage, was seen asking the pontiff not to make such statements.Also read: S Jaishankar, Antony Blinken discuss situation in MyanmarThe community, classified as Scheduled Tribe, is demanding that their reservation be increased from around 3 per cent to 7.5 per cent to provide more opportunities."I have already constituted a committee under (Justice) Nagmohan Das and they have submitted a report. We are reviewing this," Yediyurappa said."The Swamiji has made statements out of pain and he has every right to make them as he is seeking better opportunities for members of this community," the CM added.Yediyurappa assured to look into the demands at the earliest.The developments come at a time when seers from various communities and prominent political leaders, including from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have backed these campaigns and their respective demands, adding to Yediyurappa's troubles.The Panchamasali, a sect under the dominant Lingayat community, have demanded to be included in the 2B category. The Kurubas, another politically influential community, also held a rally which culminated in Bengaluru on Sunday and demanded to be categorised as Scheduled Tribes (ST).Basangouda Patil (Yatnal), one of the harshest critics of Yediyurappa, was at the forefront of the Panchamasali campaign. Rural Development and Panchayati Raj minister from Yediyurappa's home district of Shivamogga is leading the campaign for the Kuruba community.B Sriramulu and Ramesh Jarkiholi are two prominent leaders from the Valmiki community who flanked the chief minister on his arrival at the Valmiki rally.The chief minister, who turns 78 on 27 February, has struggled to manage expectations from various communities who the BJP either considers their core-support base or would like to get their backing to help the saffron camp return to power with a full majority in the 2023 Karnataka assembly polls.Yediyurappa has left himself vulnerable to demands from turncoat ministers, who helped him to power, forcing him to make four reshuffles in five days. The cabinet choices and reshuffles have increased the divide within multiple factions operating within the BJP in Karnataka.The chief minister's relations with the high command in Delhi has soured in recent months that leaves him fighting one crisis after another within his government and party, much to the advantage of the opposition.Yediyurappa's statement in the legislative assembly, that he had no powers of his own and all demands of reservations have to be discussed with the central leadership, had painted a bleak picture of helplessness and inability to deal with matters of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/reservation-demands-by-prominent-communities-add-to-yediyurappa-s-troubles-101612894090973.html

The victims demanded their money back after they saw no progress in the project. Senior inspector Vilas Chowgule of Waliv police said, “On 19 January, Pal told his son that he was going to a Pelhar branch of a national bank to deposit a cheque. But he never returned home. His son Ramraj, 28, registered a case of kidnapping with us. During the investigation, we found that Pal did not go to the bank and had planned his kidnapping. We looked for Pal in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, Pune and other areas, but in vain.”“Ramraj told us that Pal would inform his creditors about his kidnapping and immediately switch off his phones. We traced the call locations, which led us to Vapi. We reached the spot to find Pal working as a watchman in a factory,” said Chowgule.Pal was brought back to Vasai on Monday. “We will register a case of cheating under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code against Pal and are investigating further,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-builder-stages-kidnapping-to-avoid-repaying-80-lakh-booked-101612893958106.html

Gambhir said that it will help the poor to get food in this freezing cold. This is the second community kitchen opened by the member of parliament in east Delhi. The first “Jan Rasoi” was inaugurated in December last year at Gandhi Nagar wholesale market. Gambhir said that the second “Jan Rasoi” will feed more than 2,000 people each day. “Food is the most basic necessity and even in the national capital people are unable to get two square meals a day. This is not just a kitchen but a movement to feed those in need, a movement to end hunger. I have not entered politics to compete in drama and dharnas but to bring real change and that is what I am doing,” Gambhir said. Bharatiya Janata Party’s national vice-president and party’s Delhi in-charge Jay Panda was also present on the occasion.Nearly 100 people will be able to eat in the canteen at a given point of time and food will be given through coupons provided at the entrance. “Due to the Covid-19 situation in the country, all social distancing measures will be taken and not more than 50 people will be allowed.

09-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court acquits man held for killing mother||The sessions court on Tuesday acquitted a 40-year-old autorickshaw driver for killing his 70-year-old mother Sitabai, on November 10, 2017, for lack of evidence and benefit of the doubt.Additional sessions court judge, Mahesh Lone, acquitted Naresh Mahali, 40, a resident of Kharadpada, Vasai (East) after the prosecution failed to produce concrete evidence before the court.Mahali, a father of five children and widower, was an alcoholic. He would often assault his children and mother. Sitabai had warned him of his actions many times, said defence lawyer Naresh Gaur.On November 10, his family members left home after he abused and assaulted them in an inebriated state. The same night, Sitabai confronted him. In a fit of rage, Mahali picked up a sickle from the kitchen and slit his mother’s neck. He later went to sleep. The next morning, the family members found Sitabai’s body and informed Waliv police. “Mahali was arrested for murder and was lodged in Thane jail. However, he was released on bail in April 2020, owing to Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, Mahuli stayed in his Vasai home,” Gaur said.“There were no eyewitnesses present during the trial. The police photographer produced the photo of a kitchen knife before the court, whereas a sickle was used for murder. The photographer too was not questioned by the public prosecutor,” said Gaur.Even the forensic analysis did not prove the stains on the weapon were the blood of an animal or human. The victim had worn a traditional tribal attire at the time of the incident, but the prosecution produced a sari before the court. Hence, Mahuli was acquitted for the murder due to lack of evidence and failure by the prosecution to prove the murder, the judge added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaicourt-acquits-man-held-for-killing-mother-101612893838015.html
09-02-2021||Other||Sidhu spent 13 days as fugitive with friends, was active on Facebook||New Delhi: Farmers protesters at Singhu border never allowed actor-activist Deep Sidhu to speak from the stage because of his “association with the ruling party” and his “extremist views”, said Harinder Happy, a member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha -- a group of 40 farm unions that is spearheading the agitation against the three farm laws.But, around 8pm on January 25, Sidhu allegedly hijacked the stage and addressed the people. “He delivered a provocative speech. We asked him to leave the spot immediately. Nobody saw him after that,” Happy said. Protesters at the Singhu border claim that was the last they saw of Sidhu until he was seen again at the Red Fort during the Republic Day’s tractor parade. Delhi police are now trying to piece together the sequence of events from that evening to the afternoon of January 26, when Sidhu was seen among those who stormed the Red Fort, vandalised the monument and hoisted two flags —one of the farmers union and another a religious flag. Police are also probing if someone else was also involved with Sidhu in planning the vandalisation at Red Fort. Police have alleged that the violence during the rally and the events at the Unesco World Heritage site, were not spontaneous acts but were planned as part of a conspiracy. At least 394 police officials and 10 farmers were injured when protesters deviated from the pre-approved routes of the tractor rally and clashed with police when they were stopped from entering parts of New Delhi and Central Delhi. Police officials, who are privy to the details of Sidhu’s interrogation, said on January 26, as soon as his photographs and videos started circulating in the media, the actor quietly fled to Sonipat, about 20 km away from Singhu border. He was with many friends and supporters, but their numbers thinned as the calls for his arrest grew louder. Police suspect that he borrowed vehicles from his friends as some of the vehicles that Sidhu was using, until January 26, were not spotted by any CCTV camera installed at the toll plaza on the GT Karnal Road. “For the first 24 hours, his phone was on. He was staying at a friend’s place in Sonipat. On January 26, he released his first Facebook Live, claiming innocence and hitting at those who branded him a traitor” said an investigator associated with the case. At 8pm on January 27, the Delhi police held a press conference reiterating that no person involved in the violence will be spared. “Within two hours of the media briefing, at around 10pm, Sidhu switched off his cell phone. His last location was Sonipat. Then, he started changing his location,” the first investigating officer added. After the January 27 press conference, at least 12 teams of the crime branch, special cell, and the local police were conducting raids at multiple locations in Punjab and Haryana to find Sidhu. Police also tapped the phone number of many persons related to Sidhu. A team even visited his wife’s house in Purnea, Bihar. “He was not in Bihar either. We found that during all these days, Sidhu visited Chandigarh, Bilaspur(Himachal Pradesh), Amritsar, and then Karnal from where he was finally arrested. He has claimed that he stayed at his friend’s house. We are verifying this. He even removed his turban to avoid being identified. The videos of Sidhu at the Red Fort and in the days before the violence show him with a turban,” a second police officer added. On Monday night, when police arrested Sidhu, he was waiting for a car to flee to Purnea. “He was waiting at the Karnal bypass for a car that was offered by his associate for the journey, when the police team caught him around 10.30pm. He was hiding in Karnal and was dropped at the bypass by another associate on a bike, just 10 minutes before his arrest,” the officer said. A third police officer, who did not wish to be identified, said on February 3, after Delhi police announced ₹1 lakh reward on Sidhu’s arrest, Sidhu found himself cornered and could not find many friends to shield him while in hiding. “He could have passed off as one of the farmers among the thousands already on the GT Karnal road with their tractors. But the farmers union had distanced themselves from Sidhu, so this made it more difficult for him to hide. He had to stay away from the protest sites. We have information that he visited some of his friends near Singhu (not the main stage or near farm leaders) on February 1 but he did not stay there for long. We will question him on why he visited the border again,” the third officer added. But even while in hiding for 13 days, Sidhu was active on his Facebook account. Between, January 26 and February 8(until his arrest), he uploaded five videos and claimed that he was not among the rioters; reiterated that lies were being spread against him; and asked people to stay united. He also wrote posts about how the protest started after the farm laws were passed in September and the “reality of the political and social structure” and alleged that he was “set up by the farm union leaders”. On Tuesday afternoon, hours after Sidhu’s arrest, special cell deputy commissioner of police Sanjeev Yadav said such posts and videos were uploaded by Sidhu’s friend from the US and that Sidhu was careful to not do it himself to avoid arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sidhu-spent-13-days-as-fugitive-with-friends-was-active-on-facebook-101612893777398.html

The HC also stayed the elections that were to be held in these districts till February 16. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Vinay Joshi, while hearing the 31 petitions filed by aggrieved candidates, was informed that as per section 30 and rule 246 of the said Acts the rota rule had to be followed while permitting the filing of nominations.Advocate Sarang Aradhye for one of the petitioners submitted that while there were eight reservation categories, each of them would have an opportunity to contest the election every five years on a rotation basis, implying that each category would have a chance to hold the post of sarpanch and there would be no reservation for anyone category in perpetuity. He submitted that the state government had adopted the rotation policy in 1995 and since then the rota system was in place.Aradhye further submitted that however in some districts the rota had not been followed and even though the candidates had raised their objection before the Tahsildar, it was not heeded and hence the petitions.After hearing the submissions, the bench stayed elections which were to be held within 30 days of their announcement on January 29, 2020, and directed the collectors of the said districts to consider the petitions as representations, give the candidates a hearing and decide on the same before February 16 and disposed of the petitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-temporarily-stays-sarpanch-elections-in-six-districts-101612893660693.html
09-02-2021||Delhi||AAP calls BJP ‘anti-poor’ as MCDs impose ₹5 charge for using public toilets||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporation’s decision to impose ₹5 charge on the usage of public toilets was “anti-poor” as thousands of slum residents in the city are dependent on public toilets.The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and accused the AAP of misleading people.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs).“BJP-ruled MCDs have decided to impose ₹5 per use at toilets under their jurisdiction. This decision will cause immense distress to slum dwellers. The BJP is an anti-poor party and they have proved it yet again. The BJP-ruled MCDs have miserably failed to maintain the toilets under their jurisdiction and now by this decision, they are forcing poor people to leave Delhi or to opt for open defecation. These are inhuman schemes,” said AAP’s municipal affairs in-charge Durgesh Pathak.The Delhi Congress on Monday had alleged that dwellers of slum clusters in south Delhi’s Andrews Ganj and nearby areas, under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), were having to pay ₹5 for using municipal toilets.Congress councillor Abhishek Dutt said ₹5 was being realised by the private company maintaining the community toilet complex from users at the Indira Camp slum cluster in Andrews Ganj. He said this was being done despite the civic body agreeing to not take money from users of toilet blocks or urinals in slum clusters.Dutt said so far, residents had been using the facility free of charge. Being the area councillor, Dutt raised the matter to the municipal authorities and also wrote to the SDMC mayor seeking her intervention.Dismissing the allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These allegations are baseless. The AAP is misleading people. The municipal corporation’s proposal to levy usage charges on toilets is for units that are located in upmarket areas and not on toilet blocks located in and around slums, resettlement colonies and lower-income areas. It would be better if they stop confusing people and ensure that their government releases appropriate funds for the upkeep of these amenities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-calls-bjp-anti-poor-as-mcds-impose-5-charge-for-using-public-toilets-101612893597938.html
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: No bail for man booked for sexual abuse of 5 kids||A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) court has recently ordered to expedite the trial of man booked for sexually assaulting five children from Wadala in 2018.The special court rejected the bail application of the 20-year-old man observing that he may continue to abuse more children if he was released on bail.The court, however, asked the prosecution to expedite the trial and directed the jail authorities to produce him before the court for the next hearing.The accused had claimed that the children described the suspect as a man around 40 years of age, while the accused is just 20 years old. The defence had pleaded that the accused was falsely implicated in the case and was himself a victim of circumstances.The prosecution had claimed that he had ravished five boys by showing them naked pictures, as well as committed unnatural sex with them. He had also threatened them that he would upload the photos online. The prosecution has also claimed that the victims have identified the accuses as the same person who abused them during the test identification parade. The court noted that his earlier bail pleas were also rejected, and there is no change in circumstance. Further, the court noted that the trial against him was stuck because of the lockdown.“On merits, there are serious allegations against the accused that he has done unnatural sex with five boys. So, this is not the case where the accused can be enlarged on bail in view of the act done by him. Accused and all the five boys are residing in the same locality,” the court observed while rejecting bail application of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-no-bail-for-man-booked-for-sexual-abuse-of-5-kids-101612893538026.html

09-02-2021||Pune||Post-Covid Pune gradually tunes back to music, organisers uphold Covid norms||Despite the theatres and cultural halls only allowed to operate at 50 per cent capacity in the state, Pune city is gradually regaining its cultural flavour. The months of December, January and February are a feast for music and performing art lovers in the city. In the post Covid era, organisers of musical festivals are gradually putting their foot forward to hold traditional and popular music festivals once again. However, with the Covid-19 threat not completely over, the form and the grandeur of the festivals have changed. The music festivals which used to be organised in open spaces are now happening indoors with 50 per cent of the total seating capacity. Due to this restriction, many organisers are facing a budget crunch and have to adapt to new methods to manage the event. Rahul Deshpande, a popular classical singer announced that ‘Vasantotsav’, a 14-year-old music festival dedicated to his grandfather late veteran singer Vasantrao Deshpande will be conducted in this month from February 19 to 21. However, the festival will be held indoors at the Ganesh Kala Krida Manch and after five years it will be charged with tickets for music lovers. “As we started to get sponsors, we did not charge the audience but this year I cannot afford to organise this Mahotsav for free. We have placed tickets in affordable ranges,” said Deshpande. “This is the birth centenary completion year of my grandfather. We had various plans to mark the celebrations, but nothing could happen because of Covid-19,” he added. Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav, Vasantotsav, Gan Saraswati Mahotsav and Swar Jhankar Mahotsav are some of the popular and prestigious annual music festivals in the city which music lovers look forward to. Due to pandemic this year, the calendar of these festivals has collapsed and with changing rules and norms issued by the government, organisers are trying to plan the events accordingly. Planners are also demanding the operation of theatres with 100 per cent capacity. “We are keeping a close eye on the rules. We strongly demand that the theatres should be functional with 100 per cent capacity as everything else has now opened up. In outdoor events there is still a restriction of 200 people. So, programs mostly have been moved indoors. We want to organise the Mahotsav but it has to be financially viable as well,” said Rajas Upadhye, CEO of Swar Jhankar music festival. Swar Sagar is an annual musical festival that is being organised in Pimpri-Chinchwad since 1998. Last week, the Pimpri-Chinchwad social foundation successfully conducted the event following the protocols of Covid-19. “The festivals used to be for three to four days on an open ground earlier but this year we only had it for two days in Acharya Atre hall with 50 per cent capacity. However, we received a very good response from music lovers. This year some of the local artists performed but we had a very good response,” said Pravin Tupe, chief coordinator of the festival. Sawai Gandharv Bhimsen Mahotsav was organised by the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal, in light of the birth centenary year of Bharat Ratna Pandit Bhimsen Joshi. ‘Abhivadan’ a musical tribute two-day program was organised by Arya Sangit Prasarak Mandal this year. The Swar Jhankar Mahotsav has collaborated with Vasantotsav this year. Instead of having a full-fledge music festival, Swar Jhankar will organise concerts every month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/postcovid-pune-gradually-tunes-back-to-music-organisers-uphold-covid-norms-101612893297952.html

09-02-2021||Chandigarh||GMCH fares worst in vaccine coverage in Chandigarh||Amid general hesitancy among health workers in Chandigarh to take the Covid-19 vaccine shot, employees of the health department have been most forthcoming while those of Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, have shown least participation, official data shows. In Chandigarh, around 19,000 health workers are to be inoculated. They include those employed by the heath department at Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, three sub-district hospitals and around 50 dispensaries besides employees of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).The vaccine coverage of the health department stands at 31.3%, followed by 30.8% at the PGIMER and just 18.5% at GMCH. The overall coverage has been around 28%, the data presented on Monday at the state-level task force for vaccination has revealed. Taking this into account, the UT authorities have decided to also create sessions for frontline workers at GMCH, so that more people can be inoculated within the available resources. Also, with the central government setting the deadline of February 20 for administering the first dose to health workers, the administration has directed its officials to give the workers at least two chances to take the shot.Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director-cum-principal, GMCH, said all efforts are being made to create a favourable environment for a better turnout at our sites. “The numbers are less than we expected. Every health worker is being informed that the vaccine is important for their protection,” she said. Meanwhile, a senior health official, who did not wish to be named, said that seeing the present turnout, coverage cannot go past 40% by February 20, even though there might be a jump in the last week as the deadline approaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gmch-fares-worst-in-vaccine-coverage-in-chandigarh-101612893240034.html

The two arrested were identified as Shrikant Ghanshyam Ambore (24) and Kanhaiya Yadav Dhawale (24) a resident of Kharabwadi in Khed and both natives of Takalgaon in Hingoli. They had come to the hospital in order to get treatment for their wounds caused after suffering a fall from the motorbike they were riding at 1 am on Monday. “They were drunk and had fallen off the bike that one of them was riding. One had some face injury while the other had a minor injury. They came near the hospital and were honking. My colleagues and I were attending to a woman who was close to delivering a baby. While I rushed out, the security asked them what was wrong, and they started hitting him. I tried to go near the door and call the police when they realised what was happening and tried to manhandle me and followed me outside the door. As the policeman came, one of them tried to run away but could not cross the compound wall. So instead, he threw a stone at the policeman. After they were subdued, we treated their wounds before the police took them away,” said Dr Vinayak Dnyaneshwar Mohole (25), a resident doctor at the hospital that was manhandled. The two men were arrested and produced in a court later on Monday. “The court remanded them to police custody until Tuesday. They work in the private sector. They had arrived at the hospital 10-15 minutes before the assault happened and did not want to wait for the doctors to attend them,” said police sub-inspector VJ Panchamukh of Chakan police station who is investigating the case. A case under Sections 353, 332, 34 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 85 of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949, and Section 4 of Prevention of Violence Against Doctors, Medical.

09-02-2021||Pune||Police crackdown on vehicle vandals, 472 arrested in 145 cases over four years||The Pune police have arrested 472 accused in 145 cases of vehicle vandalism during the past four years. In total, 442 vehicles have been destroyed worth crores of rupees in this timeframe.According to the crime branch data, as many as 11 cases were lodged during 2021 where 50 vandals mostly youth were arrested for damaging 72 vehicles across the city while 162 vandals were arrested in 50 cases for destroying 124 vehicles in 2020. In 2018, 139 accused were arrested in 48 cases for destroying 131 vehicles compared with 121 accused arrested in 50 cases for damaging 115 vehicles. DCP (crime) Bacchan Singh said, “A total of 50 cases of vandalising vehicles were registered in 2020 in which 162 accused were arrested. Most of such incidents have taken place in slum areas and done with the intention to create terror in the locality and show their “bhaigiri” by aspiring criminals. Such cases are being taken very seriously and stringent preventive action like MCOCA/MPDA is being taken against repeat offenders, while juvenile accused are counselled by juvenile unit and police stations.” The city police led by the crime branch is carrying out intense combing operations in slum pockets and areas prone to vehicle vandalism to arrest miscreants with the objective of vehicle vandalism. The Pune police are now booking the accused under more stringent legal provisions such as the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, IPS offences ranging from extortion, robbery and issuance of grave threats to life by spreading terror amongst the citizenry at large. The data available with city police states that the vandals mostly belong to the age group between 18 and 20 years which include a major chunk of school dropouts hailing from impoverished backgrounds. The reasons behind vehicle vandalism include flimsy reasons like settling local rivalries, ego battles, establishing clout in their respective localities or neighbourhood or extortion money from shopkeepers including robbing local traders. Both the local police station officials and crime branch sleuths are creating awareness among citizens including those engaged in vandalism. A list of 400 vandals on record of the city has been prepared and notices are being sent to them regarding the crime. Also, repeat offenders have been warned that they would be booked under stringent provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) if they continued with their waywardness. Milind Pawar, a leading lawyer from Pune said, “Vehicle vandalism is a very serious crime, and the city police are rightly taking action under serious crime categories as the accused involved are either juvenile in conflict with the law or youngsters who later on graduate to become bigger criminals. The combing operations and invoking of MCOCA and MPDA against the accused will keep the vehicle vandalism under a tight leash. More crackdowns on the gangs engaged in vandalism is the need of the hour and arrests are mandatory to keep the crime rate under check.” Daljeet Singh Goraya, Ganga Kingston society secretary said, “The hooligans are indulging in this kind of violent behavior just like the outlawed motorcycle gangs operational in Mohammadwadi. These anti-social elements should be taught a lesson by iron hand and the city police combing operation and subsequent arrests will act as a strong deterrent in the near future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/police-crackdown-on-vehicle-vandals-472-arrested-in-145-cases-over-four-years-101612893238029.html

09-02-2021||Chandigarh||Petrol breaches ₹84 mark in Chandigarh||A litre of petrol breached ₹84 mark while diesel went past ₹77 mark for the first time in Chandigarh on Tuesday. A similar trend is being seen in the neighbouring cities of Mohali and Panchkula. Fuel in Mohali remains the costliest, with petrol at ₹89.26 per litre and diesel at ₹80.01 per litre. In Panchkula, prices stand at ₹85.16 and ₹77.86, respectively. Fuel prices have been on the rise in the city since the beginning of this year, with new records being set every passing day. The rise in prices of both fuels has been around ₹3.6 since January 1, when petrol was available for ₹80.35 per litre and diesel for ₹73.58 per litre. Petrol now costs ₹84.02 and diesel is available for ₹77.19.“The rising costs of diesel has hit us hard. Trucks have poor fuel efficiency, and even a small hike in prices can cost us thousands of rupees,” said BL Sharma, general secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association, adding that the price of commodities coming to the city from other places is set to go up with rising transportation cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petrol-breaches-84-mark-in-chandigarh-101612893119621.html
09-02-2021||Chandigarh||Soon, Chandigarh properties to have digital number plates||As part of the smart city project, each house and commercial property in Chandigarh will soon have digital number plates. Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) is developing a digital door number system, which will include QR (quick response) code number, unique property ID and GIS (geographic information system) mapping of residential and commercial properties in Chandigarh.The QR code will provide the geo-coordinate, house number and location of the property, and authorised users will also be able to access information regarding different municipal services and pending bill payments. The water and electricity meter IDs will also be linked with the digital door number (DDN).“DDN system is to properties what Aadhaar is to all Indian citizens. It will be a secure and unique identification number for each property to be used across and synced with all municipal services. The new unique ID will simplify the complex address system. It will help us create an accurate database for attributes of all commercial and residential properties,” said NP Sharma, chief general manager, CSCL. The estimated cost of the project is ₹10 crore, and CSCL is currently finalising the request for proposal. It is also considering it to be taken up under corporate social responsibility.The project provides the basic linkage between various services being provided by the MC and the administration to the citizens. The ID created through this system can be used to connect all the services, and will ensure greater synergy between different departments.As part of the project, mobile and web-based applications are also be developed. “These apps will help people access information regarding different MC services, call emergency help, check on the status of their complaints, get route directions to their houses (on the pattern of Google Maps) and interact with officials – all on the basis of the unique ID mentioned on the DDN,” said Sharma.The main motive of this project is to provide digital address and geo-tagging of addresses. It will be synced with the Integrated Command and Control Centre being set up in Sector 17.At the time of emergency, the citizen will only need to provide the unique ID of the property. “This ID will provide the exact address, and with this the emergency service provider can reach the spot using the shortest path,” said Sharma. Even for e-commerce sites and retailers, the residents only need to give the unique property ID for delivery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/soon-chandigarh-properties-to-have-digital-number-plates-101612892999488.html
09-02-2021||Gurugram||District records 103% vaccination turnout||The Covid-19 vaccination coverage for front-line workers exceeded the target for the first time on Tuesday. With as many as 1,135 front-line workers turning up to take the vaccine jab, as against the set target of 1,100 workers, the district health department reported a coverage rate of over 103%. Officials ascribed the high footfall to the turning up of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) staffers at various vaccination sites. Out of 500 MCG front-line workers targeted, over 652 people came for inoculation at five vaccination sites. After the senior officials of MCG, including the commissioner, took the vaccine shot on Monday, the workers have been motivated to come forward, said the officials. The MCG workers have so far remained apprehensive of taking the vaccine. On Monday, the vaccination coverage increased from 54% to 93%.“At a few MCG vaccination sites, the front-line staff came out in large numbers. At the Sector 10A community centre, almost 200 people came for vaccination in groups,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “The staff members have been encouraged to come forward as their doubts related to the safety of the vaccine have been cleared after senior officials took the jab,” he said. The MCG deployed one of its supervisors at each vaccination site to coordinate with registered beneficiaries, asking them to turn up for vaccination. The police department also continued with its high footfall of almost 80%. Of the 600 police personnel, at least 483 were administered vaccine at five sites. The district health department also held a vaccination session for 50 healthcare workers, but over 78 registered beneficiaries turned up. Although the health department targeted a total of nearly 1,150 healthcare and front-line workers on Tuesday, 1,213 took the vaccine jab at 12 session sites. Till now, more than 70% of the registered healthcare workers have been covered under the vaccination drive. “Due to routine immunisation programme, the Covid-19 vaccination has been put on hold for a day on Wednesday. It will again start from Thursday across 15 vaccination sites. We will have five vaccination sites for MCG and the police each and one site for health workers. The rest will be for staffers of the Bhondsi Jail,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/district-records-103-vaccination-turnout-101612892337899.html
09-02-2021||Gurugram||Five, including two officials, booked for pocketing road repair money||Five persons, including a block development, panchayat officer (BDPO) and chairman of block committee of Pataudi, were booked on Monday for allegedly fudging bills amounting to ₹18,000, by forging documents to make illegal payments for repair works, said police.The police said that the case came to light when a roadroller, mentioned in the documents for road repairs, turned out to be a two-wheeler. As per the norms, to sanction money, the bill needs to have registration number of roadroller used for the repair or road construction. However, a right to information (RTI) petition filed by an activist revealed that the registration number in the documents was that of a two-wheeler. Following this, the activist, last November, filed a complaint with the police for registration of an FIR against the officials involved. An inquiry was conducted by the deputy commissioner of police, Manesar, following which a case under sections 420 (cheating), 409 (breach of trust) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Patuadi police station on Monday. A case was registered against the BDPO of Pataudi, the chairman of the block committee and the contractors concerned. Despite repeated attempts, the BDPO and the chairman did not respond to calls for comment. Ramesh Kumar, the activist, said that he had also filed a complaint with the CM Window. “Accidents are reported every day due to the poor condition of roads and officials take money without carrying out repairs and construction of the road. They show repair work only in documents, but never carry them out,” he said. KK Rao, the commissioner of police said that they are conducting an investigation and no arrest has been made so far. “We are also discussing the case with other stakeholders and based on the outcome, the suspects will be arrested and strict action will be taken against them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/five-including-two-officials-booked-for-pocketing-road-repair-money-101612892337304.html
09-02-2021||Gurugram||Air quality dips to very poor, experts cite slow winds||The city’s air quality entered the very poor zone of the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin on Tuesday, recording a value of 313, a spike from Monday’s AQI of 298 that was in the poor category. Experts said that the deterioration was due to slower wind speeds during the day and calm wind conditions during the night, which were unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants.

09-02-2021||Gurugram||Cops identify six accident-prone spots||Six accident-prone spots have been identified by the police, following 43 accidents and 12 deaths at these spots this year.The police said that they have analysed the factors causing fatal accidents on these stretches, with speeding and wrong-side driving identified as the most common and dangerous ones.According to the survey conducted last month, a majority of accidents on city roads have taken place at the junction of Supermart-2 in DLF Phase 4, stretch from Golf Course Extension Road to Sector 65, the spot ahead of Central Plaza on Golf Course Road, Sector 56 crossing, stretch from Sushant Lok-1 crossing to Sector 40 and the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR).“Speeding and driving on the wrong side were the major causes behind the high accident rates at these points,” said KK Rao, the commissioner of police.The survey was conducted by local police teams and traffic personnel in the last week of January. A report in this regard was submitted to the commissioner of police on Monday.Rao said that the officials have analysed the behaviour of two-wheeler motorists, cyclists and pedestrians and they have planned to deploy traffic teams to monitor the speed limit of the vehicles. As per the traffic police records, 70 accidents have taken place between January 1 and February 9, with 30 deaths and 39 injuries in all.Over 300 people are killed every year on the city roads, as per the data over the last four years. Last year, 347 deaths were reported, while 422 deaths were recorded in 2019.Rao said they have deployed a police control room van at all traffic crossings and have directed all the station house officers (SHOs) to patrol the area at night. “The SHOs have been asked to keep a check on the traffic signal and to ensure deployment at these signals. They will also challan those speeding and driving on the wrong side at night, as commuters flout rules due to limited police deployment,” he said.Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert, expressed concern over the fact that an on-road death is reported every second day. “The police is caught unawares. No action is being taken to prevent mishaps despite so many lives having been lost. There are various other spots where the roads are unsafe, there are engineering faults and speeding is the main concern, but they are still out of the police radar,” she said, adding that despite several awareness drives and deployment, people do not pay heed to safe practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cops-identify-six-accident-prone-spots-101612892279303.html
09-02-2021||Gurugram||Woman lawyer assaulted by three men in Sector 29||A 24-year-old woman, who works as an advocate at a city court, was allegedly assaulted by three men outside a CNG pump in Sector 29 on Monday. According to the police, the suspects assaulted her over a scratch on their car that appeared while she was reversing her own car outside the pump. The police said the incident took place around 11.30am outside the CNG pump near Huda Metro station. The suspects had parked their car in the middle of the road and, despite repeated requests, they allegedly refused to move it.The woman’s car hit theirs while reversing that led to an argument and a scuffle. The woman alleged that the two men abused and assaulted her and threatened her for life when she tried to resist their attack. “My cousin sister and aunt were with me when the incident took place. They were demanding ₹10,000 for a minor scratch on their Skoda car. Although, I offered to get it repaired but they tried to snatch my bag,” she said. The police said the suspects blocked her passage so that she could not move from the spot. They also pulled her out of the car and touched her inappropriately. The victim called the police control room, following which policemen from Sector 29 intervened and resolved the issue, asking her to get the car repaired. Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that they are investigating the case and have taken the call detail records of the suspects. “We are yet to arrest the suspects,” he said. A case was registered at the Sector 29 police station under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/woman-lawyer-assaulted-by-three-men-in-sector-29-101612892277355.html
09-02-2021||Gurugram||30-year-old man dies of severe injuries sustained in accident on Sector 43 road||A 30-year-old man died on Monday after a speeding Fortuner SUV allegedly rammed his motorcycle ahead of a traffic signal near Super Mart-2 in DLF Phase-4, around 1am. The man’s death took the death count in road accidents in the city to 30, from 86 on-road collisions and accidents, since January 1, even as the authorities continue to struggle to make roads safer and ensure that traffic norms are not violated.In the incident on Monday, the police said that the driver of the SUV, which had a Delhi registration number, fled the spot, leaving behind his car on the spot. A passerby spotted the injured man, identified as one Mojahar Hussain, and took him to a private hospital where he died during treatment on Monday. According to the police, Hussain, a construction supervisor, was on his way to meet his relatives in Sushant Lok-1 from Carterpuri in Sector 23 late Sunday night, when he met with the accident around 1am. The police said that due to the high speed of the vehicles, Hussain was flung to the other side of the road, around 50 metres from the spot of the collision, due to the impact.The police said that the motorbike and the front side of the SUV were completely damaged due to the impact. Jaswant Singh, in charge of Sector 43 police post, said, “The SUV driver was speeding and driving rashly. After taking left from the signal, the driver lost control and rammed into the motorbike from behind. “The biker fell on the road and sustained critical injuries to his head and body. He also suffered injuries to his arm and leg. The SUV driver must have also suffered injuries, as the collision was powerful,” he said. Singh said that a passerby spotted the injured man lying in a pool of blood and took him to a private hospital in Sushant Lok-1, where he died. Hussain’s body was handed over to his family after a post-mortem examination on Monday, said police. The deceased is survived by his wife and two children. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death by negligence) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the SUV driver at Sushant Lok police station, said police. The police said that the SUV owner has been identified as a resident of Kapashera in Delhi and that a notice will be served to him. They have impounded the SUV and are checking CCTV footage from different locations of the stretch to establish the speed of the vehicle.Experts said that city roads need to be made safer and not be made with only fast motor vehicles in mind.Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert and former member of the now-defunct Haryana Vision Zero, said, “It’s time to prioritise safety over speed. Only then can we make Gurugram a city where people walk by choice and not compulsion. The safe systems approach advocates that safety should supersede everything, including mobility. This is where the problem starts. City agencies are more concerned with moving motor vehicles as quickly as possible, even if it comes at the cost of pedestrians and cyclists. Last year’s data of all pedestrian deaths in Gurugram shows that over 90% of them took place either on national highways, state highways or the Golf Course Road, all of which are high-speed corridors. Therefore, it is essential that speed along these road stretches, especially at the intersection, needs to brought down to a safe limit, and this can be done quickly via good design. However, any effort to increase speed will only lead to an increase in traffic crashes, especially those involving vulnerable road users.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/30yearold-man-dies-of-severe-injuries-sustained-in-accident-on-sector-43-road-101612892278068.html
09-02-2021||Patna||Mumbai-based smugglers arrested with gold worth over ₹2 crore||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) late on Monday night arrested two people from Dibrugarh-New Delhi AC special train (02423) and recovered four bars weighing six-kilograms of foreign-origin gold."Acting on the basis of specific intelligence, very meticulously and painstakingly developed over days, the sleuths of Patna Zonal Unit of the DRI apprehended two persons at Patliputra Railway Station when the train arrived. The DRI sleuths recovered 4 gold bars from their possession,” said an official, adding that the arrested syndicate carriers have been identified as — Navnath Suryavansi and Vikram Misal- both residents of Sangli, Maharastra.They were travelling in AC-1 compartment of the Delhi-bound train. The gold bars were found to be concealed in specially tailored cloth vests.The official said they didn't produce any valid document evidencing legal importation, possession and transportation of above gold bars. The gold bars were examined by a government valuer who assessed their value to be around ₹2.96 crores. In their respective statements recorded under section 108 of the Customs Act, they revealed that the aforesaid gold had been smuggled from Myanmar into India. Both have been taken into custody. Further investigation is on.According to RPF Inspector PK Barnwal, the DRI got an input that two suspected persons travelling in the first-class compartment of the train are carrying an illegal consignment. Following a tip-off, the RPF requested Danapur control to give an extra stoppage to the train at Patliputra Junction to facilitate the search operation. When the train arrived at platform number 2, with the assistance of RPF personnel, DRI sleuths searched the compartment and caught the duo. The arrested duo tried to dodge the officials after producing a fake document allegedly issued by JMB Bulians, HB Road, Masjid Gali, Fancy Bazar, Guwahati. When DRI sleuths scanned the receipt, they noticed that the date of issue of the document was February 8, the day of their boarding from Guwahati Junction at around 7 am.The accused have been arrested under the Customs Act, 1962 and remanded to judicial custody while further investigation is in progress.The DRI officials had recovered gold consignment three times from the Dibrugarh-New Delhi AC special train and twice before from North East Express in the last six months.The intelligence inputs indicated that the recovered gold bars carrying foreign markings had been smuggled into India from Myanmar through the international land border at Moreh in Manipur. The smuggling syndicate operating from Guwahati was attempting to dispose of the contraband in the cities of Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai which notably have thriving markets for the yellow metal and jewellery."The smuggling syndicate sourced and recruited poor and needy individuals from various parts of the country to act as carriers of the smuggled gold by luring them with the prospect of quick and easy money," said the official. The smugglers used air, land and rail routes to locally transport the smuggled gold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/mumbaibased-smugglers-arrested-from-with-gold-worth-over-rs-2-crore-101612890417610.html

09-02-2021||Kolkata||'Ahead of polls, officers being posted with political supari': West Bengal Guv||The Mamata Banerjee-administration is posting government officers with 'political supari' ahead of the crucial assembly polls, said West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.“It has come to my notice that some officers were being given postings with political supari. I have warned them personally that they should not play with fire,” Dhankhar said while addressing a program in Howrah on Tuesday.At least two dozen senior officers of the Indian Police Service and West Bengal Police Service in the state were transferred on Saturday. The list includes important postings such as that of police commissioners of Kolkata and adjoining cities of Howrah and Salt Lake.Also read: Rescuers race against time to save 37 men trapped in tunnel in Chamoli’s Tapovan“This is a distasteful and irresponsible remark. Governor is a constitutional post and if he wants to, he may write to the President or the Centre. Instead of doing that, why is he making a laughing-stock of himself? He is taking our courtesy as our weakness. The posting of Dhankar at Raj Bhavan in Kolkata was in fact a political supari,” said Kunal Ghosh, a TMC spokesperson.Dhankhar shares an acrimonious relation with the TMC-led government in West Bengal and had in the past levelled serious allegations of corruption, rising crime graph and deteriorating law and order in the state.“The Governor’s statements are his own and we cannot comment on that. But I think all opposition parties in the state would agree to this. Take the example of today. A senior IPS officer resigns and joins the TMC. What can we expect?” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.Humayun Kabir, a senior IPS officer resigned as the commissioner of police of Chandannagar in Hooghly district in January 2021 and joined the TMC on Tuesday. A few days ago, he had ordered the arrest of three BJP workers for "Goli Maro... (shoot the traitors)" slogans raised at a roadshow.“I cannot allow the people of West Bengal to lose hope that elections would be held without any bloodshed or they would be free and fair. I will not tolerate if a police officer suffers from ego and thinks that he will decide everything,” the Governor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ahead-of-polls-officers-being-posted-with-political-supari-west-bengal-guv-101612889407738.html

09-02-2021||City||Mystery audio tape adds to Kerala backdoor appointment muddle||Amid allegations of backdoor appointments and nepotism in the last leg of the Left Democratic Front Government in Kerala, a purported audio tape of solar scandal accused Saritha Nair has invited more trouble to the government.In the tape, a female, allegedly sounding similar to Nair, was heard saying that the ruling CPI(M) was aware of the “job fraud” but the party was scared of her and she wanted to tap this opportunity well. She also alleged that a major portion of the money collected through these backdoor entries will be going to the party fund. After the new clip surfaced, Nair said it was fudged and blamed Congress leaders “for creating an audio tape using mimicry artists.”After this, a youth named SS Arun, one of the complainants who accused Saritha Nair of fleecing ₹14 lakh from them and promising jobs in Kerala State Beverages Corporation and Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, released details of his WhatsApp chats with her and the bank account in which the money was transferred. Though police registered a cheating case against Nair two months back, Arun said no action was taken against her. When contacted, CPI(M) leaders refused to react.Also read: Rescuers race against time to save 37 men trapped in tunnel in Chamoli’s TapovanInterestingly, last month, the government had handed over a sexual assault case related to solar scandal to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based on her petition to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The latest development invited enough embarrassment to the government which was trying to shield gold smuggling case from the sex scandal.The solar cheating case relates to a fictitious firm jointly floated by Saritha Nair and her second husband Biju Radhakrishnan. The firm, ‘Team Solar’, cheated many people promising them stakes in the firm and good returns after selling imported solar panels. They allegedly cultivated good sources in corridors of power and flaunted them to attract gullible investors.The cheating case came to light in 2014 and 60 cases were registered against the two accused. Then CM Oommen Chandy had sacked two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director when their names allegedly cropped up in the case. Later Nair had raised sexual assault charges against many Congress leaders including Chandy. This case was handed over to the CBI last month. Biju was later convicted in a murder caseThe latest incident unfolded at a time when the state was witnessing a stir against alleged backdoor appointments overlooking candidates who cleared the state public service examination. On Monday, a candidate tried to kill himself by pouring kerosene on him in the state capital but the police saved him on time.In Kannur, PSC last grade rank holders performed a ‘sayana pradakshinam (rolling on the ground) on Tuesday seeking justice to them. Five candidates scaled a high-rise building near state secretariat on Tuesday and threatened to take their lives but they were overpowered and arrested later.The government, however, denied any wrongdoing and said in some cases temporary employees working for more than 10 years have been made permanent on humanitarian grounds.The Opposition Congress and the BJP said only ruling CPI(M) sympathisers were made permanent. State finance minister Thomas Isaac said the Congress was behind the ongoing protest and candidates were misled. He said the present government created maximum job opportunities and accommodated many in service. The rank holders associations said since appointments were frozen during the pandemic, many party followers were filled in vacant posts ignoring their claims.Last week, the appointment of R Ninitha, wife of former CPIM MP MB Rajesh, as a professor in the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit in Kalady (Kochi), triggered a row after three of the subject experts on the interview board alleged norms were flouted in the selection process and she was not in the reckoning. Later, Governor Arif Mohamad Khan sought a report from the varsity. Rajesh maintained that his wife was targeted to portray the government in a bad light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mystery-audio-tape-adds-to-kerala-backdoor-appointment-muddle-101612886573296.html

It said it was an act to "suppress journalism critical of the government and its allies".The raids by the central probe agency are being undertaken to collect more evidence, the sources said.They said the probe is linked to some suspect foreign funding and the role of a "defunct company" shut for about last two years that was allegedly used to transact funds worth over ₹30 crore.The role of an activist is also under the scanner of the agency in this case, the sources claimed."DIGIPUB News India Foundation strongly condemns the raids conducted by the Enforcement Directorate at the office of Newsclick, and the homes of its directors and editor Prabir Purkayastha," the umbrella body of the digital media organisations said."Newsclick has always upheld the highest standards of journalistic integrity and speaking truth to power. Its commendable journalistic work seeking to hold power accountable speaks for itself.""DIGIPUB News India Foundation believes that the ED raids on Newsclick, its editor and directors, is a clear attempt to suppress journalism critical of the government and its allies," it said."Such use of state agencies to intimidate journalists and suppress adversarial journalism is detrimental to not only the freedom of the press, but also the very idea of democratic accountability.

Your vote should not go to the Congress, the BJP or the CPI. Your only symbol is TMC. Congress, in a bid to win a seat, will make tall statements. But they won’t be able to fight the BJP. CPIM is also BJP’s bosom friend and won’t be able to fight it.

Muslims comprise 66.2 per cent of the population in Murshidabad, 51.2 per cent in Malda and 49.92 per cent in North Dinajpur.“Bengali Muslims comprise 90 per cent of the Muslim population in the state and had been the traditional vote bank of the Congress. But the minority vote has shifted and Congress is far behind in Muslim-dominated assembly segments in all the three districts and being totally uprooted from Uttar Dinajpur,” said a senior Congress leader.According to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the TMC is ahead in 16 of the 22 assembly seats in Murshidabad and the BJP was leading in one. The Congress was ahead in five seats. In Malda, the BJP was ahead in six seats, Congress in four and TMC in two seats. In Uttar Dinajpur, the TMC and the BJP were in a neck-to-neck fight with the TMC leading in five out of the nine assembly seats.The West Bengal Congress had recently approached the high command seeking permission to form a grand alliance with the Left and the ISF, a party floated by Abbas Siddiqui - an influential Muslim cleric - to win back the lost ground. The Hyderabad-based AIMIM is also trying to forge an alliance with the ISF. The efforts to forge an alliance between the Congress, the Left and the ISF has, however, run into rough waters after the Congress and the Left said that there can't be any alliance if the ISF joins hands with the AIMIM.Most of the new branches of the AIMIM are located in Murshidabad, Malda and North Dinajpur, while Siddiqui’s followers are spread across southern Bengal.“They may threaten you and try to scare you. But don’t get frightened. Have you seen me getting frightened? I will live like a Royal Bengal Tiger till I die. They said they will implement NRC and NPR. Some states didn’t say a word but I have passed a resolution in the assembly against it. I will not let them implement NRC and NPR,” Banerjee added.Massive violence broke in Murshidabad in January 2020 which left at least two people dead and several injured. Trains and buses were burnt.Meanwhile, Humayun Kabir, the former police commissioner of Chandannagar, joined the TMC on Tuesday. He had earlier served as the superintendent of police (SP) of Murshidabad district. His wife Anindita Kabir had joined the TMC in November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/if-you-want-to-remove-bjp-mamata-banerjee-rushes-to-consolidate-muslim-votes-101612882733549.html

The association members strongly opposed the central transport ministry’s recently announced scrapping of vehicles above 15 years in age. This protest was carried away across the state in front of 53 RTO offices by various organisations and unions. “The new scrapping policy decision taken by the union transport ministry is unfair and needs to be revised as lakhs of people are going to be affected due to it. There are a large numbers of people across the country who earn their daily bread through autorickshaws, trucks, buses and other private transport vehicles. Most of them have vehicles above 15 years of age and suddenly scrapping the vehicles will impact them financially. On other hand the fuel prices have increased a lot and due to this people are struggling to survive now,” said Baba Shinde, state president of the transport association. “Already, due to the Covid-19 pandemic we have all suffered financially and even most have lost a family member. Now everyone is trying to rebuild their business and earn money. Suddenly these new policies and decisions have come. We have written letters repeatedly to the union transport minister, but no action has been taken. So a protest was held at all the RTOs in the state, and going forward if our demands are not fulfilled, then on February 13, a countrywide chakka jam protest will be held,” added Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transport-associations-protest-vehicle-scrapping-petrol-price-hikes-outside-the-rtos-across-state-101612881656674.html

Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, students have opted for various engineering diploma courses and confirmed their admissions in government polytechnic, government-aided and non-aided colleges. Also, the trend of engineering diploma admissions mostly favoured Computer Science, Information Technology and Electronics streams. There was not much demand for the traditional engineering diploma courses, like the mechanical stream, this year. This year, across the state, at least one lakh students had applied for various diploma courses like engineering, pharmacy, hotel management and surface coating technology. Of these 80,000 students filled up the option form during the process and were allocated colleges in the two main rounds held this year.“It was a tough year for everyone due to the Covid-19 pandemic and so it was for the diploma admission process. The entire admission process, right from application, documents uploading and verification, seat allotments and confirmation and fee payment, everything was done online this year. Due to the combined efforts of our officials the outcome was a 10 per cent increase in the total number of admissions for various diploma admissions in the Pune region,” said D V Jadhav joint director of state technical education Pune region. In the Pune region, there are five districts – Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur. This year for all the streams of engineering diploma a total of 38,145 seats were allotted, of which 21,177 students were admitted to institutes and colleges in the Pune region. Similarly for pharmacy, hotel management and surface coating technology diploma courses, the total intake was of 8,131 seats, for which 7,799 students confirmed their admissions. “This year we were more focused and critical about the admission in the government polytechnic colleges and government-aided colleges, as for each student we have a yearly expense of around ₹1 lakh, but we take fees of only ₹7,000 from the student. If the seat remain vacant then these funds go to waste, so we were focused to fill the admissions,” added Jadhav. Talking about this year’s trend of students taking admissions in the engineering diploma courses he said, “If we look at the overall admissions done for the engineering diploma courses, a majority of students have given their first preference to computer science, followed by information technology and electronics. There is a slight fall in the mechanical diploma admissions this year, but there is a fluctuation every year in admissions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2020-admissions-to-engineering-diploma-courses-up-by-10-over-2019-101612880336657.html

09-02-2021||Lucknow||Rosie Llewellyn-Jones: How the British re-captured Awadh in 1857!||During the start of the uprising (1857) in Awadh, when Indian sepoys in the Cantonment raised their voice, the British identified 20 ‘rebel’ sepoys and had found them guilty of plotting against the British, and they were hanged for their intent. Celebrated author Dr Rosie Llewellyn-Jones gave an insight during an online session ‘Battlefield Lucknow’ held as a part of Sanatkada Lucknow Festival. She said that the first battle was held around Chinhat (in June 30, 1857) which had 5,000 armed Indian men and they defeated British killing 120 persons. Freedom fighters had surrounded Residency where around 3,000 British, Anglo-Indians and loyal Indian soldiers and servants were living. The mutineers had brought down the Union Jack.She showcased a rare original painting of Begum Hazrat Mahal and Birjis Qadr (who was crowned king at the Qaiserbagh complex). The picture is from Wajid Ali Shah’s biography ‘Ishqnaama’, preserved at Windsor Castle, UK. In that period, the Talukdar families in Awadh had their small armies, half of Shah’s royal army (60,000 persons) was disbanded of whom many joined the rebels, and Begum Hazrat Mahal with local support, had opened a front against British.To capture Lucknow back, the British had made Alambagh their base. In September, 1857, General Havelock and James Outram made their way into the Residency. Outram in his third attempt got successful in getting inside Lucknow. Later, Havlock died of dysentery and is buried in Alambagh.Jones talked about the fiercely-fought battle at Sikanderbagh where 2,000 Indians were killed while 60-70 British were killed. “When the British swarmed in, the mutineers were shooting from the top of trees and when the British shot back an African woman, an ex-bodyguard of King, fell down. Unfortunately, we don’t know about her and she is probably one of the many unsung heroes of the time,” she said.A “second relief” on the Residency by Colin Campbell helped the British escape from the Residency through the Chattar Manzil to Dilkusha by the river in November. By March, 1858, they were in complete command. They left the main city but retained a base at Alambagh. She tells how British were able to win Lucknow. “They had firepower (canons), superior gun-power and a large number of soldiers. The mutineers did not have uniform leadership. British made inroads through buildings and bungalows – Bibiapoor Kothi, Dilkusha, La Martinere, Begum Kothi, Sabistainbad Imambara, Bank Bungalow and Qaiserbagh. Hazrat Mahal fled to Musabagh and then to Nepal, where she died and is buried, while Bijlis Qadar was poisoned later.”Jones is coming up with her new book ‘India’s Battles: A Series - Lucknow 1857) later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rosie-llewellyn-jones-how-the-british-re-captured-awadh-in-1857-101612877217352.html

The Central government should cancel the farm laws while farmers have been protesting for a long time."Lakhs of farmers are still protesting and several have lost lives in the winter season due to extreme weather conditions. Farmers have been sitting on Delhi's roads for around two and a half months. Farmers always believe in non-violence and continue their stir peacefully while the Central government has tried to remove them from the protest site forcibly," he said.Also read: Deep Sidhu main instigator, say police; court sends him to 7-day remandRahul Gandhi is coming to Rajasthan to address Kisan panchayats over farm laws to protest Union government's farm laws, said Pilot.

It is also the lone agency involved in searching the bodies of the people killed in the washing away of the two hydel power projects in Sunday's flash floods.There are five to six SDRF teams involved in scanning the river on boats and on foot to find the bodies. They have been working tirelessly in the operation but claim that the major challenges they are facing including working in muddy water and knee-deep silt and mud on the riverside.Also read: Have extended only issue-based support to BJP - KumaraswamyInspector Anirudh Bhandari, who is leading a team of about 15 SDRF personnel to find the bodies of the victims, said, "The major challenge is the thick mud and round boulders near the riverside.

Most of the bodies we have recovered were stuck under heavy boulders or roots of big trees on the riverside. Some of them were in a mutilated condition," said Bhandari.He said, "After finding the bodies, the next challenge was to get them out from all the muck and muck and then taking them one or two kilometres up on foot to the road. Some of the bodies are beyond recognition."Bhandari added that they have found some bodies in the river about 100 kilometres away from the NTPC dam site where around 120 workers are missing."We are leaving our base at 7 in the morning and work till 7-8 pm with hardly any break.

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamna, the Shiv Sena called it a misleading claim and added Shah should instead concentrate on matters like the Uttarakhand flash floods and the farmers’ agitation against three farm laws passed in September.The Sena walked out of its alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the 2019 polls following disagreements over their power-sharing agreement. It later formed the government in the state with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).Also Read | Covid in Maharashtra: MMR breaches 700K-mark, most cases in stateThe editorial cited Shah’s remark that he does everything in broad daylight. It added even the Sena believed in the same philosophy. “The Shiv Sena openly joined hands with the NCP and the Congress... how come did [BJP leader] Devendra Fadnavis secretly take an oath [in November 2019] when the party believed in doing things in the broad daylight?” the editorial asked.Fadnavis resigned three days after taking oath as the chief minister for the second time. He had formed a government with the support of a splinter group of the NCP’s Ajit Pawar, who was sworn in as his deputy. Both of them resigned a day before a trust vote ordered by the Supreme Court as they could not muster up the numbers. Ajit Pawar has since returned to NCP.The editorial alleged all attempts were being made to topple the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra and criticised Shah for saying the BJP would have finished the Sena. It added those who wished the end of the Sena vanished from the political scene.Shah on Sunday rejected reports that he had promised to share the chief minister’s post. “They [Sena] said I had promised this in a closed-door meeting... I never do anything behind [closed] doors. Everything is done in daylight,” said Shah. He questioned chief minister Uddhav Thackery for his silence over the matter during the campaigns when it was said that Fadnavis would occupy the top post.The BJP has asked the Shiv Sena to introspect instead of blaming Shah. “The Shiv Sena fought the elections in alliance with us and then went and formed government with Congress and NCP which they had attacked before. They need to introspect instead of blaming us,” said BJP spokesperson Bhalchandra Shirsat. “Amit Shah is the Union home minister who is doing a great job and he has all the right to clarify how the Sena has backstabbed us,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-criticises-shah-over-remark-denying-offer-to-share-maharashtra-cm-post-101612869836986.html
09-02-2021||Dehradun||Chamoli glacial burst: Labourers say lucky their hands did not lose grip||A whistle turned into a roar of water that trapped a dozen men in a Himalayan tunnel after a glacier burst in northern India, but Rajesh Kumar lived to tell the tale.Twenty-six people were confirmed dead but at least 170 others remained missing Monday after the glacier broke off a mountainside, triggering a flash flood through a valley in Uttarakhand state.On Sunday, floodwaters swamped a nearby hydroelectric power complex where Kumar and his colleagues were working 300 metres (nearly 1,000 feet) inside a tunnel."We didn't think we were going to make it," the 28-year-old told AFP from his hospital bed."Suddenly there was a sound of whistling... there was shouting, people were telling us to come out. We thought it was a fire. We started running but the water gushed in. It was like a Hollywood movie."The men clung to scaffolding rods in the tunnel for four hours, keeping their heads above water and debris, trying to reassure each other."We just kept telling each other -- come what may, we must not let go of the rods. Thank god our hands did not lose their grip," said Kumar.As the flood coursed down the valley, the water started to recede in the tunnel, leaving it filled with more than 1.5 metres of debris and mud."We climbed across the rock debris and forced our way to the mouth of the tunnel," said Kumar.There they found a small opening but they were not sure where it led."All we knew was that we could feel some air."Eventually, they saw some light coming through and one of the men got a phone signal and called for help.There were emotional scenes as Kumar and his colleagues were pulled out of a tiny hole at the surface.Some punched the air in joy as they saw daylight, some were put straight onto stretchers and carried away. One man put his arms in the air and then fell face-first into the mud.Despite their hours-long ordeal, they miraculously managed to escape with just minor injuries.- 'Dust and screams' -Shopkeeper Ramesh Negi from Raini village was basking in the Sunday morning sun at his home overlooking the plant when he heard a loud roar and saw a huge wall of water smash into and sweep away a bridge that led to the Chinese border.Dozens of workers building a concrete dam on the Dhouli Ganga river bed and grazers leading their cattle along the mountain slopes disappeared beneath the sudden deluge, leaving behind a wasteland of grey and brown sludge."There was dust and screams all over," the 36-year-old Negi told AFP."We tried to alert the grazers but they were blown away by the wind pressure before being consumed by the water and slush. We can only guess what happened."Mangra, another tunnel survivor, still can't sleep.On Sunday, he heard a loud, rumbling sound and the screams of other colleagues: "Run, run, run!"The 28-year-old from Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh state scrambled out of the tunnel.But six of his friends and neighbours from his village remain trapped, and Mangra can't stop thinking and praying for them."The moment the water came close, it felt like the mountain was crashing and the Earth was moving," Mangra, who goes by one name, told AFP outside the tunnel, cuts and scrapes on his hands and legs."Once the deluge of water rushed past me, there was dust and fear left behind."The glacier broke away as the power complex was in full operation, leaving scores of workers at two power plants missing. About three dozen were feared trapped in the U-shaped tunnel.Late Monday, giant floodlights lit up a tunnel entrance as teams of rescuers carefully searched through the debris with the help of an excavator for signs of life -- and human remains.Hundreds of paramilitary and emergency service workers were also scouring the valley for other survivors.ash-ja/grk/sst||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/chamoli-glacial-burst-labourers-say-lucky-their-hands-did-not-lose-grip-101612867950473.html

09-02-2021||Pune||PMPML deploys staffers on BRT route to monitor traffic||The long-awaited project of Swargate to Katraj bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor resumed service from February 5 after the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses started running on the route. Now, in order to monitor the traffic and help passengers on this newly revised bus service, the PMPML has deployed clerical and administrative staff on the route at each chowk and bus station. On the other hand, daily traffic jams are being reported on this stretch during peak hours, as all the other vehicles are taking the normal route.From the last two months, the issue of resuming service on the BRT route was in discussion. Last year, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol had announced to start the bus service by January 1, 2021, however, due to the lack of necessary safety arrangements and infrastructure, the PMPML denied starting the bus service on the scheduled date. “We have started the bus service on the BRT corridor from February 5 and gradually the public will also know about it. Initially, for a week we have deployed our staff in rotation from depots and the administrative department at each bus station and chowk to monitor the traffic. These staffers are helping passengers cross the roads, help them with the revised and new operations from the BRT bus stations and also, monitor the traffic by restricting them from entering the BRT corridor,” said Rajendra Jagtap, PMPML chairman and managing director. At each of the bus station and chowk, four to five staffers of PMPML are standing monitoring the traffic and helping out passengers. They are given duties in slots for peak hours, in the morning from 8am to 12noon and then 4pm to 8pm. “After a long period, this BRT corridor is in operation and it will take time to gain passengers in such tough situations post-Covid it is challenging to run the bus services with all necessary safety precautions. We are happy that the BRT corridor is operational now, passengers will receive fast service and accordingly our focus is on to maintain the frequency of buses on the route. We are trying to provide a bus after every 1.5 minutes from this corridor going to various other routes so that passengers get options to travel,” added Jagtap. At the same time, traffic congestion during the peak hours has increased in the last few days, as other vehicles are strictly not allowed from inside the BRT corridor. Amit Pataskar, a regular passenger on this route said, “I stay at Katraj and daily travel via Swargate to my workplace, but since the BRT corridor has closed down for other vehicles all the trucks, heavy vehicles and other private buses take the normal road. This is creating pressure and traffic jams during peak hours, earlier it used to take me 15 minutes from Katraj to Swargate on a bike which now goes up to half an hour when there is a heavy rush.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-deploys-staffers-on-brt-route-to-monitor-traffic-101612868516653.html
09-02-2021||Pune||PMC online meeting faceoff: Oppn agitates in front of mayor’s office||The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and opposition parties engaged in a war of words on Monday on the issue of organising general body (GB) meetings. The state government gave instructions to organise the general body meeting physically on February 8 and the disaster management department issued a notification for it. Responding to the criticism, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “Why were instructions only given to PMC and no other municipal corporations in the state? Ideally, they should give it permanently, but the order mentioned only one day that is February 8. Also, the PMC should get orders from the urban development department.” Though the state instructed to organise the general body meeting physically, the ruling BJP decided to organise it online and warned that they would conduct it online until the urban development department issued orders for a physical gathering. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) city unit president Chetan Tupe, opposition leader Deepali Dhumal, Congress leader Aba Bagul, Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar and other elected members took part in the agitation in the mayor’s office and condemned the ruling BJP. Opposition party members alleged that the BJP did not want to organise a physical general body meeting and given an answer to opposition parties on various issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/online-meeting-faceoff-opposition-agitates-in-front-of-mayor-s-office-101612868517199.html
09-02-2021||Pune||PMC to sell 1,250 flats, revenue to be used for project works||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to sell 1,250 flats which it acquired under various schemes, and the revenue generated will be used for project works exclusively, according to standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne. Rasne said, “The PMC is now receiving revenue only through traditional sources of taxes and grants. To generate more revenue, we are trying to sell the 1,250 flats on a pilot basis. Right now, these flats are occupied by project-affected people and they are living there. The PMC is not getting rent from these flats regularly. If these flats would be sold to the same people, it would help to get more revenue.” According to Rasne, the revenue generated after selling the flats will only be utilised for project works. “Right now, maximum funds are getting utilized only for maintenance and salaries. The revenue generated by selling these flats will not be spent on revenue expenditure.” PMC estate department head Rajendra Muthe said, “The proposal is in its last stage. The department has prepared the proposal and will put it in front of the standing committee very soon.” The civic body owns various flats in the city and acquires them through various schemes. Usually, the PMC allots these flats to those who are affected due to the road widening or other PMC related projects. The PMC collects nominal rent from them, if these flats would be sold to the same people, it would help to get additional revenue. In the future, the PMC can generate property tax through them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-sell-1-250-flats-revenue-to-be-used-for-project-works-101612868515980.html
09-02-2021||Pune||PMC spends ₹7,00,000 on online general body meeting, opposition slams BJP||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) spent ₹7,00,000 to hold an online general body meeting on Monday.Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol warned that if the urban development department does not issue instructions, PMC will continue holding online general body meetings. Though the state government on Monday instructed to organise the general body meeting physically in the presence of elected members, the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) decided to organise online meetings by using various equipment. Responding to the charge, the mayor said that the online meeting was announced as per legal provision and the civic body cannot change the meeting venue at the last moment. To facilitate a better online meeting, the PMC hired a contractor. The TV sets, cameras, LED walls, and mic were installed at various locations. The elected members were expected to sit at regional ward offices and only office bearers and elected administration would sit at the headquarters. The civic body spent ₹7 lakh for hiring this equipment. Earlier, the PMC used to conduct online meetings but it was used to be organised in the Shivaji Maharaj hall, and the elected members participated from their homes. However, after receiving complaints that the elected members did not get a chance to participate in the online meetings, PMC hired the advanced equipment where members could vote and participate in the meetings. Mohol said, “As the state government asked to organise online meetings on the background of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are following those rules. To make the general body meeting effective, a new system was introduced from Monday itself. The cost is not much for it.” Congress party leader Aba Bagul said, despite the state government’s permission to organise physical meetings, the ruling party in the civic body organised online meeting to spend money. According to Bagul, the BJP is running away from facing the elected members in a physical meeting. NCP city unit president Chetan Tupe said, “The ruling party is running from discussions. The state government had given instructions on Sunday itself but BJP remained firm on holding general body meetings online.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-spends-rs-7-00-000-on-online-general-body-meeting-opposition-slams-bjp-101612868456040.html
09-02-2021||Chandigarh||Spiti puts brakes on car rallies in snow leopard habitat||Given the threat it may cause to wildlife, particularly the state animal, snow leopard, the Lahaul-Spiti district administration has banned car rallies in the Kibber wildlife sanctuary area of Spiti valley. A notification to this effect has been issued by additional district magistrate Gian Sagar Negi. “It has come to our notice that travel agencies organise car rallies, especially in winter, through the snow leopard landscape of Kibber wildlife sanctuary in the Spiti valley. In this season, wild animals such as the snow leopard, ibex, Himalayan serow, blue sheep and other high-altitude species come down to lower elevation due to heavy snowfall in the higher reaches,” he said. February and March are also the mating season of the snow leopard. Traffic through these landscapes not only disturbs the natural habitat of these animals but also affects the procreation of the snow leopard, declared a vulnerable species by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Negi said both the state and central governments have initiated wildlife conservation projects. Snow leopard sighting is also the main attraction of winter tourism, a substantial source of income for Spiti valley residents. He said since serving notices on all stakeholders is not practical, it was necessary to proceed ex-parte under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and impose the ban. “In the larger interest of conservation of the vulnerable species of wildlife, no car rally will be allowed to pass through the snow leopard landscape of Kibber wildlife sanctuary from the road through Lidang, Demul, Komic, Hikkim to Langcha and from Rangrik bridge to Chicham via Kee-Kibber village,” he said. The snow leopard’s habitat ranges from the Kibber wildlife sanctuary in Lahaul and Spiti to Pangi in Chamba district. The cats are usually found in rugged terrain at altitudes between 9,800 feet and 17,000 feet. Last month, the forest department released a survey report that estimated the population of 73 snow leopards in the state. The survey was conducted by the wildlife wing of the forest department and the Nature Conservation Foundation, Bangalore. The population of the animals has gradually increased in the valley since the wildlife wing initiated the Snow Leopard Conservation Project and began monitoring the animals in 2006.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/spiti-sdm-puts-brakes-on-car-rallies-in-snow-leopard-habitat-101612867916916.html

The district saw 68 per cent of the targeted beneficiaries being vaccinated as 3,886 beneficiaries got vaccinated of the 5,700 registered beneficiaries. Pune city saw its first day of frontline workers (FLWs) vaccination on Monday however only 20 FLWs got vaccinated at two sites. According to PMC health chief Dr Ashish Bharti, the app did not send out the messages on time. He said, “We had sent out messages through the app to the registered frontline workers but till Monday afternoon, none of the beneficiaries turned up and so later we started calling up people who then turned up at the vaccination sites. We found out that the app had not sent out the messages even though we could see the app stated that the messages were delivered.”The PMC has vaccination for FLWs at two of its hospitals, Kamala Nehru hospital and Rajiv Gandhi hospital where the set target was for 200 beneficiaries of which only 20, 14 and six at the respective hospitals, could be vaccinated. Of the 3,886 beneficiaries vaccinated, 661 FLWs got the jab in the district.The district saw Covid-19 vaccination at 52 sites of which 21 were from the city where 1,939 beneficiaries got vaccinated of the 2,000 target beneficiaries.

09-02-2021||Pune||City crosses two lakh Covid-19 case mark||On Monday, Pune city reported 167 fresh positive Covid-19 cases which took the progressive Covid-19 case count in the city to over two lakh, 2,00,088, according to the state health department. However, no new deaths due to the infection were reported in the entire district on Monday. The city’s death toll stands at 4,553 as of Monday. While the first one lakh cases were reported in a span of 174 days in the city, the second one lakh cases took only 162 days, which indicates that a consistent viral spread is still persistent in the city, as per a former Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientist.The state health department reported that the city crossed its first one lakh mark on August 30, 2020, almost six months after it reported its first case on March 9, 2020. On August 30, the city reported 1,00,236 progressive Covid-19 cases and had reported 2,532 deaths due to the infection. Over the next 162 days, the city has now crossed another grim mark and reported the second one lakh Covid-19 cases on Monday. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “Although the number of cases maybe lower than before, but the average number is still there. Pune is reporting 400-500 fresh positive Covid-19 cases on a daily basis which is still worrisome. People cannot be caught off the guard just because the vaccine is here. The administration must first vaccinate the most vulnerable population while others should continue to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.” The spread of the infection is still prevalent and people need to continue to follow the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Former Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientist Dr Raman Gangakhedkar said, “It is time that all of us realise that we have to continue Covid-19 appropriate behaviour otherwise this strain will continue. For H1N1 it occurred only for a short period of time whereas this is a perennial kind of infection. The spread is consistent mainly and we have to remember that we do not want Covid-19 to become like H1N1 and become a perennial infection.” The state health department also reported 102 fresh positive Covid-19 cases from Pune rural which took the progressive count to 93,888 and death toll stands at 2,141 while Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) reported 65 fresh positive Covid-19 cases which took the final count to 97,793 and death toll stands at 1,318. The district’s count stands at 3,91,769 with 3,77,891 recovered cases and 8,054 deaths.

09-02-2021||Pune||Rose traders expect rise in demand during Valentine’s week||With the Valentine’s week currently underway, rose traders and farmers are expecting an increase in demand after a dull 2020 due to the Covid-19 lockdown and cyclone Nisarga.According to figures provided by the Indian Society of Floriculture Professionals (ISFP), there has been a 38 per cent decline in rose export in 2020 (see box) as compared to 2019.“The export of roses was effected badly due to the lockdown and the United Kingdom which is our major hub is still in lockdown, so it makes things worse. However, with the situation improving in India and schools and colleges reopening, it is expected that the demand of roses will rise. The trend of rose demand has also improved in the last one week,” said Praveen Sharma, president of ISFP.Rose farmers from western Maharashtra also had to deal with cyclone Nisarga in June 2020 which made the situation harder for them. In Pune district, highest production of rose happens at Pawananagar and Talegaon in Maval as on 250 hectares, rose farming is conducted.“Majority of the plants got destroyed while many farmers even stopped doing rose farming after the cyclone, as there was a shortage of money and labourers.

09-02-2021||Pune||UK delegation visits Serum Institute||On Monday, a delegation from the United Kingdom (UK) visited Pune-headquartered Serum Institute of India (SII) facility. The visit was intended to further enhance the existing relation between India and the UK on manufacturing and innovation in the healthcare space. This was also the first visit of a trade minister to the country post the Covid19 pandemic. The delegation saw UK Secretary of State for International Trade Elizabeth Truss, member of Parliament, who visited the facility and saw the manufacturing of Covishield. SII chief executive officer (CEO) Adar Poonawalla said, “It was an honour to have the Secretary of State for International Trade, UK and a delegation, visit our headquarters. We discussed how to further enhance the existing relationship between India & the UK on manufacturing & innovation in the healthcare space.” Following the visit, Truss tweeted, ‘Met Adar Poonawalla at the world’s largest vaccine producer SII on India and UK collaboration and trade. They have made 100 million doses of the Oxford-AZ vaccine. Also making some of the 1.3 billion doses as part of COVAX to help vaccinate the world. The UK is co-funding £548m.”SII in collaboration with Unicef has entered into a long-term supply agreement for Covid-19 vaccines, to access two vaccine products through technology transfer from AstraZeneca and Novavax, both of which are currently being manufactured by SII. Unicef, along with procurement partners, will have access to up to 1.1 billion doses of vaccines for around 100 countries, for approximately $3 a dose for the low- and lower middle-income countries.The MP has earlier on Saturday, paid a visit to the Minister for Commerce and Industry of India Piyush Goyal to discuss the India - UK trade and investment relationship. In a joint statement issued by both the leaders, the ministers welcomed the deepening of bilateral health cooperation between the two countries, including on vaccines, which is enabling our countries to act as a global force for good during these challenging times. They also committed to relaunch the UK-India CEO Forum and agreed on the CEO Forum meeting at the earliest.

"We told the governor that we do not have faith in the State machinery."He said the SAD delegation has demanded the deployment of paramilitary forces for ensuring a free and fair election.Videography should also be allowed inside polling stations to safeguard against malpractices, he said.The SAD also demanded re-election at all places where Congress nominees were elected unopposed after rejection of nomination papers of opposition candidates.Senior party leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal slammed the State Election Commission, saying there was no need for such a "defunct" commission which had "surrendered" to the state government."The way the SEC has surrendered to the government, the message is loud and clear that there is not going to be fair elections," said Grewal.Elections to the eight municipal corporations and 109 municipal councils and nagar panchayats in the state will be held on February 14.A total of 9,222 candidates are in the fray for the municipal polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-meets-punjab-governor-alleges-misuse-of-govt-machinery-in-civic-polls-101612865422989.html

In the video, it was alleged that she narrated the recipe and purposefully claimed that she was cooking the meat of Gomatha, to hurt the religious sentiments of the community.The High Court in the order observed that the use of the term "Gomatha" as a synonym for meat in a cookery show is prima facie likely to hurt the religious feelings of Hindus, who worship cow as a deity."Choice of the word "Gomatha Ularth" prima facie appear to be ill-motivated and purposefully made and that uploading of such a highly objectionable video for public viewing may affect the Fundamental Right of the devotees," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-hc-order-stopping-rehana-fathima-from-publishing-her-views-stayed-by-sc-101612864996981.html
09-02-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala court stays DIG’s arrest in Kapil Vij assault case||A day after the Ambala Police booked a 54-year-old deputy inspector general (DIG) of the Haryana Police for allegedly assaulting and misbehaving with state home minister Anil Vij’s brother Kapil Vij at a club in Ambala Cantonment, a court stayed the arrest of the officer till Tuesday.During a hearing on the anticipatory bail plea moved by DIG, Vigilance Bureau (Ambala Range), Ashok Kumar, the court of additional sessions judge Sundeep Singh delayed the arrest for one day for the prosecution (state) to file response to the bail application.Kumar’s counsel Satinder Singh Garg said that the case itself is false and no rules were followed by the police due to political pressure from Anil Vij.“To file an FIR against a serving IPS officer, the police have to seek permission from the central and state governments. However, in this case, due to political pressure of the state home minister, no such permission was sought. Moreover, the minister has some personal grudge against Kumar as he didn’t follow his instructions in a few investigations in the past. It was a perfect occasion for them to take revenge as they gathered in a party on Sunday,” the advocate said.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Hamid Akhtar said, “This claim wasn’t taken up during the first hearing on Monday. We’ll respond when it is contested in the next hearing.”Kapil, 61, in his police statement, said, “I went to the birthday party of Phoenix Club former chairman Rakesh Aggarwal’s grandson at Sirhind Club in the cantonment with Rajesh of Shastri Colony and Ajay Aggarwal of Guru Nanak Marg. When we were about to have lunch, Ashok Kumar, who we later found is DIG (vigilance), under the influence of alcohol and without any provocation started abusing me and my family, and also threatened me of dire consequences.”“He said that he is DIG (vigilance) and nobody could harm him. He also made obscene gestures at me while leaving,” Kapil added.Acting on his complaint, a case was registered against the DIG under Sections 294 (obscene act), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Ambala Cantt police station.Akhtar said that multiple teams are investigating the facts and the crime spot that was an open place without any CCTVs.People close to Kapil Vij said that both Vij and Kumar were sitting on separate tables, when the latter picked up an argument.“Kapil was discussing about the vaccine that his brother was administered during the trial, at his table and the officer, in an inebriated condition, intervened during lunch saying that the infection and vaccination is a fraud itself. He was told by a guest about Kapil, but he said that he is not afraid of anyone, not even Anil Vij,” a local said.Kumar, a 2006 batch IPS officer, has served at senior positions at Ambala including DCP (rural), SP and SP (railways) in the past as well. A local politician, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “It is amusing how a senior officer, who has spent so many years in Ambala couldn’t recognise the brother of the state home minister and local MLA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-court-stays-dig-s-arrest-in-kapil-vij-assault-case-101612864316638.html

He took over the leadership months after the party lost power in the state to the Congress. In an interview with Jaykishan Sharma, Poonia spoke about reports of infighting within the BJP state unit, by-polls, local elections, and the assembly’s budget session. Edited excerpts:Your statements on former chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s role in state politics have triggered speculation about divisions within the BJP in the state. How would you respond to the speculation?Our party does not run as per statements. Social media create divides. There is no conflict between us... The central leadership decides the role of senior leaders. The Congress had to remove its state president and few ministers. Being the party’s president in the state, it is my role to keep everybody together. There is no gap between leaders in the state. This is the positive side that we have many leaders. Earlier, people used to say that we do not have good leaders in the state.Also Read | Rajasthan orders removal of 20 unfit elephants from Amer FortWhat are the reasons for BJP’s dismal performance in the local elections?Local election results are always favourable to the ruling party. When the Congress was in the Opposition, it secured 25 seats, but we have won 39. Out of 48, the Congress led only in 19 boards. In the rest, they have allied with Independents. The mandate is against the state government. For the first time in the state’s history, out of 21 zila parishads, they were ahead of us only in five. It is a big failure of the government.We lost a year to Covid-19 but still raised issues like the increase in the electricity fee. The state government accused us of violating Covid norms. ...hundreds of cases were registered against our party leaders. We have planned big agitations against the government on the issues of inflation, deteriorating law and order situation, and atrocities against women.How are you preparing for by-polls to four assembly seats?The ruling party generally wins by-polls. But there is anti-incumbency against the government. By the time Congress will wake-up, we will complete half of the work. Our senior leaders are working at the grassroots level and have started booth management. I have also visited the four constituencies. Two senior leaders will be deputed for every seat. Our organizational strength is better.What is the party’s strategy for the assembly’s budget session?We will raise the issues of farm loan waiver, corruption, deteriorating law, and order situation. For the first time, 580,000 cases have been registered in the state, which shows rising crime, especially against women. Two were killed in a gang war in Churu. The Congress had promised a loan waiver for 6.9 million farmers. But nothing has happened. BJP legislators have also prepared details of regional problems and failures of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/have-no-conflict-with-vasundhara-raje-says-bjp-s-rajasthan-chief-satish-poonia-101612863416979.html

09-02-2021||Bangalore||JD(S) MLC Basavaraj Horatti elected as Karnataka Legislative Council chairman||Senior JD(S) MLC Basavaraj Horatti was on Tuesday elected as the Chairman of the Karnataka Legislative Council, amid protests by Congress over the passage of "anti cow slaughterbill" in the House. Horatti, a seven time MLC, who represents Karnataka west teachers constituency, was declared "unanimously" elected, as the opposition Congress that was protesting from the well of the house, did not propose the name of its candidate Naseer Ahmed, during the election process. Horatti(74) armed with Bachelor of Arts and Master of Physical Education qualification, began his career as a physical education teacher in Hubballi. He has been a member of the Council for nearly 40 years now, starting from 1980. He had served as the Chairman (acting) of the Council from June 22 to December 12, 2018. As the House met for the day, Congress legislators trooped into the well of the House against the passage of the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill in the council in a "hurry" through a voice vote, and alleged that it was despite them demanding for division of votes. Raising the issue as Deputy Chairman M K Pranesh was about to start today's business, Congress MLC Naseer Ahmed said the passage of the bill on Monday despite us seeking for division was against the rules. Several Congress MLCs including M Narayanaswamy, B K Hariprasad too joined, insisting that they sought for division, and demanded a ruling from the Chair. However, defending the passageof the bill, Home, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai said it was passed as per rules and no one sought a division, as he pointed out that all Congress MLCs were in the well when the bill was getting passed. "There is nothing in the records too." The Deputy Chairman said he will get the records and examine them, as he asked Congress legislators to go back to their seats and allow the House to function and cooperate during the Chairman election process. Despite this, Congress MLCs insisted that the Chair examine the CCTV and television camera footage first and adjourn the house for some time. "First a ruling should be given on this, subsequently the Chairman election can be taken up," Narayanaswamy said. As the Congress MLCs continued with their protest from the well, the Deputy Chairman took up the Chairman's election process. After JD(S) MLCs proposed Horatti's name for the Chairman post, Congress legislators did not turn up at their seats to propose their candidate Naseer Ahmed's name. Following this the Deputy Chairman declared that Basavaraj Horatti has been elected as the Chairman of the Legislative Council "unanimously". Both Horatti, supported by JD(S) and BJP, and Congress' Naseer Ahmed had filed their nominations on Monday. The election was necessitated following the resignation of Congress'K Prathapachandra Shetty as the Chairman on February 4 to preempt a no-confidence motion against him by the ruling BJP, and JD(S) extending support to it. Horratti's election was certain as BJP and JD(S) had joined hands for the Council Chairman and Deputy Chairman post. As per the arrangement BJP MLC M K Pranesh was on January 29 elected as the Deputy Chairman with the backing of JD(S), and now the ruling party returned the favour by supporting the regional party nominee, Horatti. According to JD(S) sources, party supremo H D Deve Gowda had earlier even spoken to BJP national President JP Nadda seeking support for Horatti. BJP sources said the party agreed to support Horatti as Chairman instead of seeking the post for itself in return for JD(S)' support in its move to oust Shetty and passage of certain key bills. The earlier move by both parties in December to remove Congress' Shetty as Chairman was not successful as their notice of no-confidence was rejected on technical grounds. The House had witnessed high drama that day with the BJP-JD(S) and Congress members hurling abuses and pushing each other. Amid the ruckus on December 15, the then Deputy Chairman Dharme Gowda, who is now no more, was even pulled down from the Chair. Currently the ruling BJP is the single largest party in the Council with 31 seats, followed by Congress with 29, JD(S) 13 (including Horatti), one independent and one vacant (due to death of Dharme Gowda).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/jds-mlc-basavaraj-horatti-elected-as-karnataka-legislative-council-chairman-101612861439205.html

The medical counselling committee (MCC), in a circular on February 8, announced that admissions to MBBS courses will now continue till February 11 to fill up the remaining vacant seats.As per information shared by MCC, there are a total of five seats vacant—one each across five All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and admissions for these will be conducted by AIIMS, New Delhi. Similarly, another 37 seats are currently lying vacant across five deemed institutes under non-resident Indian (NRI) and management quotas. This includes 17 vacant seats under the NRI quota at Navi Mumbai’s DY Patil Medical College. The second offline stray vacant seat round will be conducted by the Directorate General of Health Sciences (DGHS).Many have blamed seat vacancies in NRI and management quotas on the strain that a large number of families have felt financially due to Covid-19 and the eventual lockdown in 2020. As per the fee regulating authority, higher education institutes can charge up to five times the regular fees of an open category seat for 15% seats reserved under the NRI and management quotas.“Deemed as well as private medical and dental institutes charge as much as three to five times the regular fees for seats under management and NRI quotas, which many students might not be able to afford this year. This could be one of the biggest reasons for seats under these two quotas to go unclaimed this year,” said Dr T P Lahane, director, directorate of medical education & research (DMER).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/mbbs-admissions-extended-by-a-week-to-fill-up-vacant-seats-in-deemed-institutes-101612856248909.html

Prima facie, it is being claimed that the irregularities were allegedly committed under former vice chancellor professor Rajesh Singh during the varsity's first year.The office of the Lokayukta started the probe following a letter by activist Bimal Roy, alleging gross irregularities in the management of the university’s finances. “Documents related to expenditure, cash books, utility certificates and other papers are missing, pointing out serious anomalies in the PU,” officials in the Lokayukta’s office said on condition of anonymity.After the PU was established in March 2018, the then vice chancellor (VC) Prof Rajesh Singh had reportedly summoned the principals of constituent colleges and later borrowed ₹10 lakh from each of the colleges ostensibly to meet the cost of running the university. ₹1.20 crore was borrowed from 12 constituent colleges, besides several affiliated colleges were pressured to donate money, said a university official, who didn’t wish to be named.“Those, who had then raised voice against such borrowings/donations, were shunted,” the official said, adding, “Vice chancellor Prof Rajesh Singh used to act like a dictator and had amassed huge wealth in the name of shaping the new university during his three-year stint.”Lokayukta SP has alleged several irregularities in the matter and the next date of review has been fixed for May 7.Acting PU vice chancellor Prof R N Yadav said, “The matter is related to the ex VC of PU and a probe is underway.”PU registrar Prof R N Ojha said a five-member committee has been constituted on February 1 to probe the matter and it has been asked to submit its report within 15 days.Also Read: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar appeals to firm to complete PMCH facility within 5 years“The matter is of 2018 when the university was established and is related to the fund created by the then VC to meet internal expenditure to run the university,” Prof RN Ojha said.Meanwhile, officials in the university said they suspected more skeletons could tumble out of the varsity’s cupboard with the progress of the probe in the coming days.“The committee constituted to probe will have to act honestly otherwise the matter will be hushed up” a senior official of the PU said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-lokayukta-probe-points-to-financial-irregularities-in-purnea-university-101612847463049.html

09-02-2021||Delhi||#DUReopens: A library experience in Covid times||An integral part of any college student’s life is a visit to the library. “Almost every Delhi University student has spent some time visiting the university library, be it to borrow a book or just ensure witnesses when in mood to bunk a class. But now, itna aasan nahi hoga library mein jaana,” says Alka Nimesh, a PhD student of DU, who visited the Central Library in North Campus, which recently reopened for research scholars and faculty members in the first phase of reopening of DU. The library now demands that students follow certain rules and regulations, including prior online appointment since certain facilities such as the reading room is available from 10am to 4pm on week days only. Nimesh adds, “Library is a sentiment for research scholars. Visiting the Central Library, for the first time since the pandemic hit, is totally a foreign experience to me. I had to take an online appointment to visit the library. And upon entering the library premises, I couldn’t see the usual huddles of students silently discussing research papers and giggling. Instead, students were engrossed in their books while seated socially distant from each other. This has become the new normal, and I’m missing walking into the library without any hesitation and sitting there with your batch mates, discussing topics in hushed tones until the librarian issued a warning!” If earlier, a late return of book called for a scowl from the librarian, now the absence of gloves (while handling books), face masks and sanitiser can attract a disciplinary action and even cancellation of library membership! “Wearing gloves inside the library while handling books or flipping through the pages becomes difficult. While the winter does help the situation, woollen gloves makes books slip. But the upside to the new library experience is that there will be no late fine on returning books! This is absolutely the best thing to happen for students who use library facilities frequently. It’s like a golden moment in a DU student’s history who is always known to carry library cards that have been marked and charged for late returns,” says Sanjay Kataria, a Master’s student in DU.The facilities in the Central Library will also reopen in a phased manner, like the university. But, the experience won’t be like what it used to be before. “Library ka faida hi yeh tha that you could spend time in the reading room at your leisure with a book in your hand from nine in the morning to eight in the evening. I used to come back, after finishing our classes and eating momos, in the evening to study in the library because hostel room me to friends kahan hi padne dete hain... The new time constraints, though necessary, keep me anxious to finish reading within a regulated time! However, I’m thankful they’ve finally reopened the library, kuchh nahi se kuchh toh achcha hi hai,” says Bashir Shaheen, a PhD student at DU.For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dureopens-a-library-experience-in-covid-times-101612845197231.html

Since the opening, the tourists have been visiting the temple,” said Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC), secretary, N Dorjee.Another important temple in Bodh Gaya, the 80-feet Buddhist temple, also opened in the first week of February. However, the reopening has not attracted tourists as expected.On the issue of monasteries still remaining closed, Dorjee said, BTMC did not have control over them. “There are about 45 monasteries and they are controlled by their association, International Buddhist Council. However, they are facing certain constraints like maintenance cost and shortage of manpower,” he added.The situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon since the peak season of earning in Bodh Gaya is from October to February. “From February onwards, the tourists start leaving Bodh Gaya. The people, who survive directly or indirectly by earning from the tourism and hotel industries, have been badly hit, as international flights were banned and Buddhist rituals and events were cancelled,” said Kumar.Kumar said many tourist guides were on the verge of starvation while some had switched to different vocations for now. “We have collected money from the members of the tourist guide association and helped the needy guides,” he said, adding, “All our savings have dried and till October it will be a challenge for us to earn our daily bread.”International Buddhist Council general secretary Bhante Pragyadeep said the monasteries were closed as their running involved costs. “Since pilgrims are not visiting Bodh Gaya, the donations on which the monasteries run have also dried up. However, the ray of hope is that slowly they were opening up,” he said.Pragyadeep said not all monasteries were important. “The main attraction of Bodh Gaya was monasteries of Sri Lanka, Japan, Tibet, Myanmar, Thailand and International Buddhist Council and they were opening up slowly,” he said, adding, in eight to ten days almost all the monasteries would reopen.Also Read: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar appeals to firm to complete PMCH facility within 5 yearsPresident, Hotel Association of Bodh Gaya, Sanjay Singh, said most of the big hotels that had made huge investments were in poor condition. “The earnings of the hotels depend on the flow of foreign tourists, which is nil now. Unless the international flights resume, the situation will not normalize and money will not flow in Bodh Gaya,” he said.The plight of street vendors who sell antique pieces, trinkets and other articles is also intense. “The roads at Bodh Gaya, which used to remain packed with tourists, are empty now. We hope that once the monasteries reopen, the flow of domestic tourists will increase,” said Gulabchand, president, National Hawkers’ Federation, Bodh Gaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bodh-gaya-tourism-in-deep-coma-sans-international-flights-and-domestic-visitors-101612842796050.html

However, many candidates have filed duplicate applications too, so final figures we will get to know post scrutiny," a senior official said.By-elections to fill vacancies in five municipal wards in the national capital will be held with all COVID-19 safety precautions, they said.The State Election Commission of Delhi had earlier said the bypolls will be held for two wards under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and three under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC).The wards are -- Ward No. 32N, (Rohini-C); Ward No. 62N, (Shalimar Bagh North) in north Delhi and Ward No. 02-E (Trilokpuri); Ward No. 08-E (Kalyanpuri) and Ward No. 41-E (Chauhan Bangar) in east Delhi.The bypolls will be held from 7:30 am to 5:30 pm.The filling of nomination papers for municipal corporation by-elections in Delhi was marked by 'padyatra', 'puja' and claims of victory by party leaders on Monday.Four of the five wards fell vacant after sitting councillors contested assembly polls on AAP tickets last year and became MLAs.The Shalimar Bagh ward fell vacant following the death of Renu Jaju, who had won the seat on a BJP ticket in 2017.Delhi has 272 wards, and while the NDMC and South Delhi Municipal Corporation have 104 municipal wards each, the EDMC has 64 wards.The BJP has been controlling all three corporations since 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/73-nominations-filed-for-delhi-civic-bypolls-101612832015287.html

Special commissioner of police Robin Hibu had written to the DTC stating that if any untoward incident happens in Delhi, then the corporation may be held accountable and that the decision to recall all its buses would amount to obstruction in maintaining law and order.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Monday, “The Delhi Police had taken 576 DTC buses on special hire of which around 350 have been returned so far. It has been decided that no more buses will be recalled by the DTC as of now. Also, it was clarified that the DTC will not deny any bus to the police. Maintaining law and order is extremely important.”He, however, said the only difference from the previous practice will be that the DTC solely cannot release its buses to the police going forward. “Any request to deploy buses on special hire will have to be approved by the Delhi government. That means the DTC will have to take Delhi government’s approval,” the minister said.A second senior official who attended the meeting, on condition of anonymity, said a middle path was worked out during the discussion wherein the DTC said it would stagger the release of buses to avoid any inconvenience to daily commuters.Delhi currently has around 6,693 buses --3,760 DTC buses and 2,933 concessionaire-run cluster buses, as against the Supreme Court-mandated requirement of 11,000 buses.According to the socio-economic survey that was conducted between November 2018 and November 2019, the preferred mode of transport for 63.62% of Delhi residents is “public bus/school bus/chartered bus”, while only 6.18% take the Delhi Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dtc-puts-on-hold-recall-of-buses-given-to-delhi-police-101612830083388.html

Several social activists from Ambernath have planted over 6,000 trees over the past five years, especially along the roads to increase the city’s green cover. Some of these trees were also planted along the 15-km Katai-Badlapur Highway, connecting Dombivli to Karjat. Most of the them are now destroyed due to encroachments along the highway. Ambernath resident Prashant Mhatre, 38, said, “For the past few months, small establishments such as garages, eateries, tea stalls have come up along the highway. The trees we planted were either cut or trimmed to accommodate these establishments. We approached their owners and asked them to refrain from damaging the trees, but they didn’t pay any heed.” “On the stretch from Badlapur to Hajimalang, these miscreants have destroyed more than 100 such trees planted near the highway. We are going to send an official complaint to all the departments concerned. We approached the forest department who assured to ensure the safety of the trees.” Forest department officer of Badlapur, P Thakar, said, “We cannot clear the encroachments but we will communicate with the department concerned over the issue. We’ll also ensure that there is no further damage to the trees and also conduct a survey of the stretch to check if some of the trees can be saved or else, we will take up plantation of trees along the stretch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-forest-dept-assures-action-in-badlapur-tree-hacking-101612813733515.html

The accused were cutting the tree to allow a clear view of a commercial hoarding.The arrested men told police that the banyan tree was blocking the view of a commercial hoarding that they had put up, and therefore they were not able to get a due rate for the space.According to the police, the men confessed to cutting numerous trees in the city to get a clear view of their commercial hoardings and banners. A police officer said that no one suspected the accused as they used to pretend to be BMC employees. Whenever questioned, the accused would claim to have the necessary written permissions from the civic body, and always maintained that they were following the orders of their superiors. On Wednesday, a few residents noticed the men cutting the banyan tree near Girgaum Chowpatty and complained to the BMC officer concerned. A first information report (FIR) was registered at MRA Marg police station against the unidentified persons. The complaint was also shared with tourism minister Aditya Thackrey who spoke to the Mumbai Police about taking necessary action. Police tracked the men responsible for the illegal hacking and arrested them on Saturday.According to police, the two main accused have been identified as Hiralal Sevaklal Darshan, 36, and Mohammed Shafeeq, 25.“We arrested Darshan, Shafeeq and their three accomplices.

A bench of justice SK Shinde, while hearing the interim application in the appeal filed by Dr Sachin Deshpande, was informed by advocate Aniket Nikam that the trial court had failed to consider the statement of a witness who confirmed that the operation had gone well and hence, HC should set aside the conviction. Nikam further informed the court that the first accused in the case had been granted bail and hence, on the grounds of parity, his client must be granted bail while he awaited the trial at HC and his sentence suspended. According to the prosecution, the woman who was pregnant for a second time had approached a nursing home owned by the first accused. The woman was a C-section delivery, to which her family agreed. On May 1, 2012, the operation and tubectomy was conducted by Dr Deshpande. After regaining consciousness, the woman began bleeding profusely and was shifted to another hospital where she died the next day. A case was registered under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Deshpande. Last year on September 29, the trial court convicted and sentenced Deshpande and also asked him to pay Rs2.5-lakh compensation to the victim’s husband. While seeking the suspension of the sentence till his appeal was heard, Nikam submitted that the trial court had not considered all the facts placed before it and had passed the conviction order by overlooking the glaring contradiction, omission as well as admissions and improvements that were brought to the notice of the judge. Hence, the judgment/order was contrary to the principles of the Evidence Act and should be quashed. After hearing the submissions the court observed, “In the consideration of the evidence on record and as the co-accused has been released on bail and further the applicant had not misused his liberty when granted bail and further appeal is likely to be heard in near futures, pending appeal impugned sentence is suspended…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-suspends-sentence-of-ayurveda-doc-convicted-for-causing-death-by-negligence-101612813433498.html

According to BMC officials, 20-megawatt power will be generated annually from the hydro power plant, while an additional 80-megawatt power will be generated from the floating solar power plant on the dam. With this, BMC has become the first civic body in the country to take a step towards hybrid energy generation. The hydro and solar plants will generate about 208 million units of energy per year and is likely to save BMC’s ₹24 crore on electricity bills every year. The construction of the project would be completed in next two years. The power generated from the plants will be supplied to the state-run electricity body. In return, the amount will be adjusted in BMC’s electricity bill consumptions.Meanwhile, the civic body also appointed contractors to address flooding at 58 spots, for which tenders for works, such as widening of storm water drains, rivers, nullahs, worth ₹190 crore, were approved on Monday.

These centres counselled couples, without letting their differences escalate and reach courts. “We already have a help desk at every police station, based on a Supreme Court ruling, for counselling couples going through marital problems. Now these counselling centres will dedicatedly try to resolve the disputes between the couples,” said deputy commissioner of police S Chaitanya, who is Mumbai Police spokesperson. He added that after a woman files a non-cognisable complaint, she will be able to send an application on the matrimonial problem to the counselling centre. The police officers will then hold a joint meeting with the couple and try to resolve the disputes amicably, without letting it escalate any further. Currently, Mumbai Police have only one dedicated counselling centre at its headquarters in Crawford Market, which tries to reconcile differences between couples. During the Covid-19 lockdown, the centre received 187 applications from couples who wanted to approach the police for legal actions against their spouses. According to a police officer, the centre resolved the issues of 18 couples. “We had called the couples to the headquarters and tried to resolve the disputes between them to save their marriages,” said an officer from the counselling centre. Of the 187 applications that the police received, 42 couples were sent to the police stations in their jurisdictions to record their statements for further process, while 74 others were asked to go for mutual separation. “We are in the process of counselling 15 couples at present,” the officer added.

09-02-2021||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: Bombay HC rejects Gautam Navlakha’s default bail plea||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday rejected the default bail plea of Bhima-Koregaon accused Gautam Navlakha and observed that there was nothing perverse in the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court order dated July 12, 2020 by which default bail was refused to him.Navlakha had sought default bail from the special NIA court claiming the charge sheet was not filed against him within the stipulated time of 90 days since his arrest. The special court had, however, refused to accept the submission based on the fact that the Delhi HC had deemed the 34 days of house arrest as illegal and hence, the same could not be counted while computing stipulated 90 days.Navlakha then approached HC claiming that though his house arrest was termed illegal, he was still in custody and hence his application for default bail should be allowed.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the appeal, was informed by senior counsel Kapil Sibal that the house arrest in 2018 had curtailed Navlakha’s freedom to move freely, and therefore, his plea for default bail under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was valid.“Nature of custody was changed, but it was an arrest nonetheless,” Sibal had submitted.While justifying the computation, he had argued that if the 34 days of house arrest were counted, the NIA’s charge sheet has been filed beyond 90 days and therefore Navlakha was entitled to default bail. According to Sibal, Navlakha had cumulatively spent 93 days in custody by the time the charge sheet was filed.Additional solicitor general SV Raju, appearing for NIA, had opposed the plea saying the period of house arrest cannot be counted and the date of production of accused before the magistrate was relevant for computing 90 days and not the date of arrest.Raju had submitted that as the Delhi HC had deemed the period of Navlakha’s detention from August 29 to October 1, 2018 as illegal, it could not be considered while computing the period of the arrest.The bench had concluded the hearing on December 16, 2020 and reserved its ruling which was pronounced on Monday.The bench observed, “We have gone through the order passed by the special judge, NIA. We see no reason to interfere with the well-reasoned order of the learned special judge. The appeal (filed by Navlakha) stands dismissed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-bombay-hc-rejects-gautam-navlakha-s-default-bail-plea-101612812893503.html

ANC officers said they had a tip-off about the woman coming to sell marijuana at a bus stop in Goregaon. Accordingly, an ANC team laid a trap and arrested Bhave.The police said they informed her about her rights under NDPS Act and a woman constable searched her in front of independent panch witnesses. They also said that they found packets of marijuana from her bag, after which she was arrested.The defence denied the allegation that Bhave was found in possession of the contraband and claimed that the 54-year-old had nothing to do with the seized consignment. It also pointed out several discrepancies in the prosecution story.It was argued that the officer who received information, the woman constable who searched the accused and the independent woman panch witness were not examined by the prosecution.The special court, after going through the evidence, observed that the evidence of police and panch witnesses do not match in respect of appraising the accused about her right and acquitted the woman. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/special-court-acquits-mumbai-woman-caught-with-8kg-marijuana-101612812773536.html

Residents from the buildings on A, B, C, E, F and G Roads have also complained of receiving muddy water. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is carrying out the construction of the coastal road between Princess Street Flyover and Worli over the 9-km stretch that passes by the sea. BMC officials said around 50 buildings at Marine Drive are affected due to the water pipeline burst. According to assistant civic commissioner Chakrapani Alle, the pipeline is likely to be fixed by Monday night. “The burst was reported due to the piling work of the coastal road. Our water repair department is working on it. We’ve also informed the department concerned to levy penalty on the contractor.” “We are on the job [to repair the pipeline] since Saturday. The repairing took time because we could detect the source of the pipeline burst only by Monday morning. Also, there was waterlogging due to the pipeline burst. We’re now working to fix it,” an official from the water supply department said. Residents claim that BMC did not arrange for alternative water supply by providing water tankers for all buildings. “Though BMC started the work immediately, they told us that couldn’t detect the source of the damage. Now we’ve been told that the supply shall resume by Monday or Tuesday,” said Purshottam Hemdev who resides on G Road. He added, “In the past two days, we didn’t get any help from BMC. We understand that it was an unplanned maintenance work, but the least BMC could have done is arranged for alternative water supply channel. We had to arrange for water supply tankers ourselves on Monday.” Mahendra Hemdev, a resident of D Road said their corporator arranged for water by providing tankers. “The coastal road work should be smooth and no resident must be affected. We are hopeful that water supply will be restored by tomorrow [Tuesday], and no such incident takes place in the future.” Local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Akash Purohit said, “Never has there been a water supply issue at Marine Drive. My society is also not getting water since Sunday, and we hope BMC will fix the pipeline damage and handle such situations better henceforth.” Marine Drive residents had complained of facing water cuts and contaminated water in November 2020 too, owing to pipeline burst because of the coastal road work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-coastal-road-work-water-supply-in-50-buildings-affected-101612812533435.html

Police are now questioning the claims made by Dube on his death bed, in which he said he was kidnapped by three unidentified men and taken to Gholwad jungle in Palghar and burnt alive.An officer who is part of the investigative team said Dube arrived at the Chennai airport around 12.30am on January 30 and was alone. “Dube had claimed he was kidnapped immediately after he stepped outside the airport. It is questionable that Dube claimed he was kidnapped, but had the time to withdraw ₹5,000 from an ATM in Chennai,” said the officer. We are also examining Dube’s DMAT account through which he was dealing in stocks, shares. Two trading firms were looking after the said account on behalf of Dubey,” said the officer.“We have found proof of Dube taking personal loans of ₹8.43 lakh, borrowed ₹5.75 lakh from his colleague at INS Agrani, Coimbatore, and his would-be in-laws had also given him nearly ₹8.5 lakh to invest in the stock market,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/navy-sailor-seen-roaming-at-chennai-airport-before-kidnapping-palghar-police-101612811633429.html

As the funeral march proceeded towards the banks of Koel river, villagers chanted “Bharat Mata ki Jai”,” Vande Matram” and “Long live Suraj Dubey”. Army and Navy personnel and Jharkhand minister Mithilesh Thakur attended the funeral proceedings. Dubey was found with severe burn injuries in the jungles of Gholvad in Palghar district and died while being taken to a hospital in Mumbai on Friday.On his death bed, Dubey had reportedly claimed that armed men had kidnapped him and demanded a ransom of ₹10 lakh for his release. However, the Navy man’s elder brother Niraj Kumar Dubey said that they did not get any ransom calls between January 30 and February 5.Dubey was on leave from January 1 to February 1. To re-join the service, he had boarded a Hyderabad-bound flight from Ranchi at 8am on January 30. After reaching Hyderabad, he spoke to his family members. He then boarded a flight from Hyderabad to Chennai, from where he was scheduled to take a train to Coimbatore. Dubey landed in Chennai at 9pm the same day and was unreachable after that. On finding his mobile phones switched off, his family contacted INS Agrani, where Dubey was deployed as a leading seaman. A missing person’s complaint was then filed with Chainpur police station in Palamu.Amid high-pitched demand for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry by the local leaders, Jharkhand minister Mithilesh Thakur said, “There should not be any politics in the death of an Indian Navy sailor. The state government will provide financial assistance of ₹10 lakh to the bereaved family and sanction pension for the family members.”“Not only Jharkhand but the entire country is grieving the untimely demise of an Indian soldier. The government will ensure that exemplary action is taken against those involved in their heinous crime. The government will also strive for the speedy delivery of justice this son of Palamu,” the minister added.Dubey’s family members have insisted that there was a conspiracy behind his murder and have alleged that two of his colleagues were involved.

The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) conducted a trial of girder launch on the creek on Sunday and claimed that 80% of the work is completed. The girder over the creek will be launched in one month while the entire work will be completed by June this year. The bridge, which is an important link connecting Thane and Navi Mumbai, will ease the traffic congestion between the two cities along with congestion in Kalwa and Thane city areas. A number of residents from Thane take the bridge to reach various IT sector companies in Navi Mumbai. The bridge was supposed to open last monsoon, however the work was stalled due to the lockdown as labour was not available. Pravin Papalkar, deputy city engineer, said, “The work of the pillars in the 100-metre stretch over the creek is completed. On Sunday, we did a trail launch of the basket girder on this bridge. The girder is 1,000 metric tonne in weight and the structure is ready. We will launch it in a month. Once the girder is launched, we will only have to connect the missing links at two ends of the girder and at the few other stretches of the entire bridge.” “The budget allocation for the bridge this year is ₹20 crore. We have to complete the bridge and open it for the commuters this year on any account. Our plan is to complete the work by June,” he said. Atul Jadhav, 55, a commuter, said, “The work is delayed for years now. The first bridge is closed as it is unsafe, while the second bridge is very narrow. The new bridge will make the commute easy. At present, we spend hours in traffic at the Kalwa junction due to the congestion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/80-work-on-third-kalwa-creek-bridge-completed-thane-civic-body-101612811513433.html

Therefore, it is not possible to share details of the report.” Following an interim order by the Bombay high court (HC) to stop work on the proposed car shed at Kanjurmarg, the state government had formed a panel to weigh between Aarey and Kanjurmarg. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had, in October 2020, announced the government’s decision to shift the car shed from the contested Aarey Colony plot to Kanjurmarg. While officials had confirmed that the committee submitted its report backing Kanjurmarg on January 21, the report has not been released publicly. Since 2015, this is the third committee to deliberate and submit a report on the car shed for Metro-3. The government had earlier established committees under the then metropolitan commissioner UPS Madan and additional chief secretary Manoj Saunik. RTI activists, HT spoke to, on Monday said the state cannot deny information on this matter.Anil Galgali, a well-known RTI activist from Mumbai, said, “This is wrong on the state government’s part. In fact, they must state the clause under which the information is being denied.”Naseer Jahagirdar, advocate and activist said information can be denied only under section 8 of the RTI Act which looks at exemption from disclosure of information. “Information cannot be denied on the grounds that the report is under government consideration. In fact, a report like this must, by default, be made public,” Jahagirdar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-denies-to-give-details-on-metro-3-car-shed-report-101612811453426.html
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Potential vaccine beneficiaries in Mumbai provide incorrect numbers on app||To avoid getting vaccinated, many potential beneficiaries are providing incorrect mobile numbers while registering on the centralised app, Co-WIN, or not answering calls made by ward officers to inform them about their appointment, according to civic officials. Currently, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is vaccinating both healthcare workers (HCWs) and Frontline Workers (FLWs) simultaneously at 21 vaccination centres. Due to the technical glitch in the Co-WIN app, 24 ward offices individually call the shortlisted candidates for vaccination a day prior to their immunisation date. Many HCWs and FLWs are forced to register for inoculation by their supervisors, but they provide incorrect individual details to avoid the process later. The Co-WIN app doesn’t have the mechanism to check the authenticity of mobile numbers during the registration process. Civic officials say that almost 20% remain unreachable on their registered phone numbers on the Co-WIN app. “For instance, on any given day, we call 500 registered HCWs and FLWs, 10% don’t answer their phones, while another 10% numbers are incorrect,” said a senior BMC officer. “If they provide an incorrect number, the Co-WIN app can’t send the message about the date of their appointment,” said the officer. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “Our priority is people who are willing to get vaccinated. Currently, we don’t want to engage our resources for such people. We are getting very good response through walk-ins and gradually, the overall turnout is also increasing.” Two hospitals inoculate 10,000 people Meanwhile, Rajawadi hospital at Ghatkopar and Kandivali-based Bharat Ratna Babasaheb Ambedkar (BDBA) hospital (also known as Shatabdi Hospital, have set a record by inoculating over 10,000 beneficiaries in the first 16 sessions of the drive. According to BMC vaccination data, the highest, 10,695 beneficiaries, have been vaccinated at Rajawadi Hospital, followed by 10,694 at BDBA hospital, 9,783 at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital and 9,600 at BYL Nair hospital. Officials believe as most HCWs stay in the western and eastern suburbs, they prefer visiting the centres nearest to their residence. Also, they are quite close to the nearby railway stations. Thus, these two hospitals have got the most number of beneficiaries. “Initially, there were only two vaccination centres in the suburbs— Cooper hospital in Vile Parle and BDBA in Kandivli. But as BDBA was closer to them, most beneficiaries from the suburbs preferred it. Our hospital gets public from five populated zones like Jogeshwari, Goregaon, Malad, Kandivli, Borivali and Dahisar which helped us achieve the 10,000 mark,” said Dr Pratibha Patil, medical superintendent, BDBA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/potential-vaccine-beneficiaries-in-mumbai-provide-incorrect-numbers-on-app-101612811393451.html

Though it’s been difficult to do so in the Covid-19 times, foodie groups in the city remain undeterred and try to make the best use of the weather albeit with safety norms. Exploring the city’s food delights, members of these groups have been going for food walks, be it planned or impromptu.“During winters, food walks become even more fun. The appetite increases and savouring kebabs live from the tandoor or enjoying hand beaten coffee or tandoori chai or savouring a hot glass of kada hua doodh with garma garam jalebi brings much more joy now than in summer,” says Pawan Soni, founder, Gurgaon Food Freak, which has organised several food walks across Delhi-NCR to explore the hidden gems. More recently, the group went for food walks to Jama Masjid, Dilli Haat, Sector 56 in Gurugram, and Old Gurugram. Soni adds, “We suggest a place and then a member who has the most experience in that area leads everyone. We pool in the money and the leader spends from that pool. Whatever money is left, it’s either returned or if it’s a small amount then we give it as charity to the poor. Since it’s Covid time, we avoid getting more than 10 members. And everyone has to sanitise their hands and wear a face mask unless at all times, unless one is eating or posing for a group picture. We also ensure to keep a gap of minimum two weeks between each walk.”Recently on a food walk to Chawri Bazar with his fellow foodies, Prabhjot Singh, founder of Foodkars, felt how things have changed in the pandemic struck world. “Apart from walks that are planned two weeks in advance we also do impromptu meetups or foodwalks if around 10 or more people are interested to join a food walk. Initially, when the pandemic struck, many members became hesitant to move out and meet others. Our recent Chawri Bazar walk, on a Sunday, was our first food walk in the new normal. And to follow Covid-19 safety guidelines, we asked the participants to carry their own sanitisers and masks, and must keep the mask on while walking and waiting for food! Also, we went to only those outlets that assure maintaining of hygiene and are visibly following Covid-19 guidelines.”Singh’s group is now planning to visit the Andhra Bhavan canteen, whereas Gurgaon Foodie group is exploring Sector 56 Cart Market in Gurugram, Jama Masjid, and even Majnu ka Tilla. “The planning usually happens on social media platforms,” says Shivendu Mittal, from the group, adding, “We have started some impromptu food walks and restaurant explorations. Apart from a tepid response in the initial few plans, nothing much has changed... Once a restaurant refused to join tables for our large group, and we kept insisting but no luck... From our side, we’ve stopped sharing our plates during the food walks. And masks stay on till the time food is served on the table!” Many agree that stepping out with all the safety precautions is the way forward for foodie groups in Delhi-NCR. Bon appétit!

Police arrested one of the accused on Monday, while the second accused, who is the driver of the bus, is still at large. According to the police, the survivor and the accused lived in the same building. The accused had offered the woman a spiked drink during a pre-wedding celebration in the building that night. “During the celebration, the woman felt thirsty and went to have some water. The accused called her aside and suggested that she could have some soft-drink if she wanted to. Since both the accused stayed in the same building, the woman did not suspect them and had the soft drink offered by them,” said Vivek Bhoir, assistant inspector, Kharghar police station. “The bus, which belongs to the other accused, was parked at a secluded place nearby. When the survivor started to feel uneasy, they took her out and offered some more spiked drinks. At one point she was almost unconscious, following which they brought her to the bus and took turns to rape her. After committing the crime, they dumped her on the road, snatched her mobile phone and fled the spot,” he said. The woman started screaming for help after she regained consciousness. “A few people spotted her and took her to the police station.

09-02-2021||Mumbai||Poll for Maharashtra Assembly speaker: Time for another MVA-BJP fight?||The political stage in the state is likely to witness another tussle between the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition and opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, following the resignation of Nana Patole as the speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly. While there are speculations that the BJP aims to turn the election for a new speaker into an opportunity to pull down the 14-month-old Uddhav Thackeray-led government, the three-party coalition is gearing up to use the election to its advantage. The MVA leaders are strategising to get in 170-plus votes for the election, which can also end the speculation over its survival. Patole resigned as the speaker after the Congress leadership decided to appoint him as the new chief of the Maharashtra Congress. This has necessitated election for a new speaker which also means another test of strength for the MVA on the floor of the Assembly. In 2019, when it won the trust vote and Patole was elected, the MVA had managed to get 169 votes in the house of 288. While the three parties together have 154 MLAs, the coalition managed to get at least 15 votes from smaller parties and independents. Although the leaders of Shiv Sena and NCP would have preferred Patole’s resignation towards the end of the budget session after completion of presenting and passing the annual budget, the Congress chose to do it immediately. After initial reactions to convey their unhappiness with the decision of the Congress, the two partners have now accepted it and the three parties are looking at showing its strength on the floor of the house. The parties are confident that none of their 154 MLAs would vote against the MVA candidate and are now working on a plan to get support from most of the 29 MLAs from smaller parties and the independents, according to the MVA leaders HT spoke to. In the house of 288, the MVA has 154 members, while the BJP has 105. “Of the 29 MLAs from smaller parties and independents, 15 voted for us a year ago. They continue to support us. We will now try and win over some more. For instance, the Communist Party of India which has one MLA and AIMIM with two MLAs had abstained from voting during the confidence motion on November 30, 2019. We are sure in the backdrop of the changed political scenario, they will support us. We have supported the left parties during the farmers’ agitation, while AIMIM cannot politically afford to take a stand favourable to the BJP. “Rashtriya Samaj Paksha MLA Ratnakar Gutte is expected to change side after the recent Enforcement Directorate action against him,” said a senior NCP minister requesting anonymity. The leader said that though some of the BJP MLAs are in touch with the ruling parties, they are unlikely to cross over soon.“We will get about 175 votes. I do not think the BJP will go for the vote as many independents and smaller parties are on the verge of changing sides,” said NCP minister Nawab Malik.Former state Congress chief Manikarao Thakre said, “We can cross the mark of 170 MLAs as more independents are willing to support us. It is easier to garner support when you are in power. There are many incidents from the past when the ruling parties had fallen short of numbers than claimed during floor tests. The BJP did not even go for the election of speaker despite our demand after the 2014 election, when it was in minority.” The MVA leaders are also deliberating whether to hold the election immediately after the budget session of the state legislature begins on March 1 or towards the end of the session. “There is no hurry to hold the election immediately after the session begins. We have a deputy speaker to run the house. The elections will be held only after we manage to get more support,” said a Shiv Sena minister. Besides its own strength of 154 MLAs (comprising 58 Sena MLAs, NCP 56 and Congress 44), the ruling alliance garnered the support of 15 members from smaller parties and independents. Three MLAs from Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, two each from Samajwadi Party and Prahar Janashakti Paksha and one each from Swabhimani Paksha, Peasants and Workers Party, Krantikari Sanghatana and five independents had supported the government. BJP, the prime opposition party with 105 members received the support of two smaller allies and seven independents. Floor test and squabbling within the MVA However, the MVA’s plan to show strength on the floor of the assembly is easier said than done. Several MVA leaders point out they cannot take all their legislators for granted. The ruling coalition will have to first ensure that its strength of 169 which was seen in trust vote in 2019 is retained. “Any drop in this number would help the BJP to create an atmosphere that we are losing support and there is political uncertainty,” said the Shiv Sena minister. Though the confidence vote was won by MVA government in an open poll, the speaker is elected by secret ballot which could be a challenging job for the ruling parties as it gives a chance for cross-voting by MLAs. “Rule 6(3) of state legislative mandates for the secret ballots for the post of the speaker. Though we have a tradition of the unopposed election of the speaker, the opposition may ask for the poll. The poll is held on the floor of the house and the members vote on ballot paper,” said Anant Kalse, former principal secretary of state legislature. Congress’s alliance partners want a say in deciding the next speaker. To force Congress to do so, both the allies are saying that the post is open for negotiation in power-sharing formula. To counter it, the Congress is putting forth a demand for deputy chief minister’s post. NCP chief Sharad Pawar said the post has been left vacant to decide by all three ruling parties over the new speaker. Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana’s editorial last week raised the question why should Congress give a chance to BJP to play tricks. The editorial said that the chair of speaker was conceded for five years and not to leave it vacant in just one year. This prompted Congress to toss the idea of reshuffle in sharing of the power and demanded for the post of deputy chief minister by creating an extra post for them. Thakre said that there should be an additional deputy chief minister from Congress. “It has been our demand even during the talks with our ruling partners before forming the government,” Thakre said.According to Congress leaders, before appointing Patole as the new state unit chief by asking him to resign as the speaker, Congress’s interim president Sonia Gandhi spoke to Pawar and Shiv Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Patole and senior Congress leaders in the state met Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar at Sahyadri guest house before handing over his resignation to deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal on February 4. Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “The ruling parties appear confident over the past few days. The Shiv Sena had fared well in gram panchayat elections while the three-party combine emerged triumphant in legislative council elections two months ago.”There are also speculations that the ruling and opposition sides would avoid a bitter tussle and settle for election of new speaker without actual vote on the floor of the assembly. Senior BJP leader and former speaker Haribhau Bagde said: “Many a times the Speaker is appointed unopposed but it all depends on the relations between the treasury and opposition benches. Our stand on the election will be decided according to the situation at that time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/poll-for-maharashtra-assembly-speaker-time-for-another-mvabjpfight-101612811220836.html
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Protecting AI-driven technology still a challenge, say science and tech institutes||As artificial intelligence (AI) finds application in every walk of life, technology institutes in the country say that protection of AI-driven technology is a challenge. In simple terms, AI is a field of computer science that trains machines to simulate the workings of the human mind. “Modern AI typically combines a deep learning architecture with a training algorithm, which is trained on task-specific data. This training yields a model for the task, which is then able to analyse any new data point and output its predictions,” said Mausam, professor and founding head of the School of Artificial Intelligence, at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT-D). Today, AI is the driving force behind technology interventions in the various fields such as education, healthcare, security and communication. While most technology institutes have empanelled lawyers for intellectual property (IP) rights, many are now seeking help from agents and consultants to handle the application process for AI. The Foundation of Innovation and Technology Transfer (FITT) at IIT Delhi has now set up the Innovation Technology Transfer Office, which will help innovators and institutes in the field of IP. “There are many facilitators who can help in filing patents, but the quality of drafting the claims and strategising the IP protection is important which requires suitable expertise / guidance. We will be happy to help institutes with needful assessment and IP strategy through our new unit,” said Anil Wali, managing director, FITT. Collectively, IITs file the largest number of patent applications, followed by institutes under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). In a response to a question in Rajya Sabha, science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan had said that between 2009 and 2019, IITs had filed 3,751 patent applications and CSIR had filed 2,413 applications. “About 50% of patents filed in the engineering field are from the software sector of engineering; which happens to be the most contentious and most litigious space in patent technology,” said Chirag Tanna, a registered patent agent and director of the firm Ink Idee, which offers consultancy services in patents, trademarks, copyrights, and design registrations. Among the institutes Ink Idee has worked with are IIT Bombay (IITB) and College of Engineering, Pune.At IIT Delhi, around 3% of all IP applications are in the AI field. “This does not reflect the inherent strength which is substantial. Moreover, the Institute has also initiated a centre of excellence for AI and we expect increased inventive output in future,” said Wali. “At present, roughly 2-3% of all patent applications are for technologies for AI-driven innovations. However, with AI now touching all aspects of life, we are seeing an increase in innovation in this field. It is a relatively new field and protection is a challenge. When it comes to AI, innovators generally find it easier to file for intellectual property (IP) rights in the United States of America or European countries,” said Milind Atrey, dean, research and development, IITB. The European Patent Office (EPO) and US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) have a set of guidelines on how to examine patents relating to AI. “According to EPO, software and abstract mathematical models are not patentable, but if the idea is implemented, it then becomes eligible for patenting. In case of USPTO, one might be able to patent a specific implementation of an AI as long as there is a tangible effect,” said Tanna. In India, algorithms can’t be patented under the Patents Act, 1970. “However, specific applications of AI-driven technologies for specific use-cases can very well be patented,” said Mausam. “All software is abstract; so is AI – it is intangible, but its effect can be felt. Thus, it becomes very difficult to define the internal workings of IP in context of AI-driven technology. This is why many such patents get shot down early on. Secondly, computer-related inventions or software inventions have always struggled to sit within the stringent and finite definitions of law defined by Patent Acts across the world. The third is the challenge of authorship,” Tanna said. AI-driven machines have the ability to learn from data and hold the potential to become autonomous, without needing the intervention of humans. “Existing intellectual property laws do not recognise an artificially intelligent machine’s right to invent a new piece of technology that can be patented; even though the world has reached a stage where artificially intelligent machines have, in fact, come up with new pieces of patentable technology,” said Tanna. “Policy intervention needs to go hand in hand with innovation and challenges will always persist. However, rigorous testing of AI-driven technology can be a way forward. Each time the machine learns and evolves, it should be put to a careful and independent test,” said Mausam. “Technical advancements always precede policies and laws. With an equitable dialogue with stakeholders, all issues can be resolved. These policies can encompass a variety of facets such as regulations on use of AI, ethics of use of AI in terms of decision making and decision enactments, burden of law when an AI makes decisions for and, on behalf of, human beings, boundaries of patentable subject matter when it comes to AI inventions and ownership and crediting of inventions made by AI inventions,” said Tanna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/protecting-ai-driven-technology-still-a-challenge-say-science-and-tech-institutes-101612811093979.html
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Continue online classes or allow peak-hour train travel, say teachers and students||Days after the University of Mumbai (MU) released a circular with various guidelines for affiliated colleges to follow once colleges reopen from February 15, teachers and students have said resuming on-campus lectures is not feasible if they are not allowed to travel by train during peak hours. The University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines shared by MU states that first preference must be given to PhD and research candidates from science and technology departments as well as final-year students to attend lectures on campus. Online lectures will continue for the rest of the batches. Last week, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that 50% of the total staff and students would be allowed on campus at any given time, but teachers and students have pointed out that they need to be able to travel by local trains during peak hours in order to reopen campuses. An MU spokesperson said the decision to reopen colleges was taken based on assurance from the state government that train travel for staff and students will be considered. A spokesperson for Samant on Monday told HT the state is currently working on the issue and will have an answer soon. At present, the general public is allowed to avail suburban train services in the city during fixed time slots — first train service of the day till 7am; 12pm to 4pm; 9pm till last train service of the day — which do not cover peak hours in order to prevent overcrowding in trains. Teachers and students have said the train timings for the general public are inconvenient. “Our class timings vary between 1pm and 6pm, and if that continues, I might be able to take the train to reach college, but then would loiter in college till 9pm to take the train back home. It makes no sense,” said Pooja Mali, a resident of Dahisar and a Bachelor of Mass Media (BMM) student at UPG College, Vile Parle. Some students said that since they are almost midway into the current semester, they would prefer to return to campus later. “I think the focus should be on keeping people safe at home, at least till the vaccination drive is over,” said Vishwa Shah, 21, a resident of Kandivli who is pursuing her Masters in clinical psychology from RD National College, Bandra. “My parents are not very keen on sending me back to college for physical classes, which I believe is the case with most parents at present,” she said. Teachers pointed out that commuting will be challenging if they are unable to avail local trains during peak hours. “Reopening of colleges and a combination of offline and online classes means teachers will be over-worked. And to make matters worse, without the permission to travel by train, many of us will spend hours in buses and autos every day,” said a Virar-based professor who teaches at a college in Andheri. The professor added it would be “impossible” to do the 62-km commute without availing local trains. His college timings are between 10am and 4.30pm. Shruti Warrier, who lives in Dombivli and teaches at St Andrew’s College in Bandra, said “If given no choice, I might have to leave home at 5.30am and reach my college by 7am for a class that begins only at 10am. The government should think this through.” While several teachers and students have taken to social media to voice their concerns, the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU) on Monday has written to MU vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar. “The university does not understand the ground reality and takes decisions without the consent of the academic council and senate, resulting in such absurd ideas,” said a statement released by BUCTU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-continue-online-classes-or-allow-peak-hour-train-travel-say-teachers-and-students-101612811038488.html

The simulators will cost between ₹7 lakh to ₹9 lakh each and will be installed at driving training institutions across Maharashtra. The simulators will help drivers with testing and improving their skills in various conditions, including traffic, speed bumps, bad roads, pedestrians moving and heavy rainfall. The simulators will be made mandatory for people applying for a learner’s license. “Land in Mumbai and surrounding areas is scarce. We are working on the plan to approach colleges and schools to use their premises to train drivers,” said Avinash Dhakne, state transport commissioner.Further, on Saturday a special drive to inspect private buses was undertaken by the transport department throughout the state. As part of the drive, 3,062 buses were booked for violations and 213 vehicles were seized. The maximum number of irregularities in buses was witnessed at Thane with 539 cases being reported and 32 buses detained. Pune reported the second-highest with 472 buses with irregularities and 43 buses being booked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-improve-quality-of-driving-with-tracks-65-simulators-101612811038955.html

The order was issued by the state revenue department on Monday. On November 1, 1996, the then Raj Thackeray-led Shiv Udyog Sena (SUS) had organised a Michael Jackson concert in Mumbai and the then Shiv Sena-BJP led state government had granted a waiver in the entertainment duty to the organisers on the grounds that the profit is used for charity purposes. The decision was struck down by the Bombay high court and the amount and the waiver amount was deposited in the court’s treasury. It had further asked the state government to reconsider its decision in eight weeks.On January 6, the state government has decided to waive off the entertainment duty as well as the interest amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-issues-order-to-waive-entertainment-duty-for-1996-michael-jackson-concert-101612810973392.html
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra struggles with bird flu; over 209,606 poultry birds culled||Maharashtra has been struggling with bird flu or avian influenza since more than a month. It has reported deaths of over 40,213 birds in the state since January 8 and has culled over 200,000 poultry birds following confirmation of bird flu from ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, till date. The figures include around 137,305 poultry birds in Navapur tehsil of Nandurbar district in the last two days (Sunday and Monday). On Monday, 105,305 poultry birds were culled at four farms in Navapur to contain the spread. The culling process is started only after receiving a confirmation of bird flu from ICAR-NIHSAD – the central laboratory for bird flu testing. The culling is being done within a one-km radius of the poultry farm affected by the virus. This is the second time the state is dealing with bird flu in the last 15 years. In 2006, it was limited to Navapur, which was the epicentre of the disease in the Nandurbar district, but this time, the scenario is different. The zoonotic disease has spread to 45 epicentres covering 20 districts across the state. However, 41 epicentres have been issued sanitisation certificates, indicating they are free from the virus and consumption of poultry products has been allowed in these areas. These epicentres will continue to be monitored for the next three months, government officials said. Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Latur, Nanded, Pune, Solapur, Beed, Ahmednagar, Yavatmal, Satara, Nagpur, Gadchiroli and Nandurbar are among the districts where bird flu deaths were confirmed by ICAR-NIHSAD. Apart from culling poultry birds, the state has also destroyed 44,686 eggs and 63,864kg of poultry from the infected zones. On Monday, the state reported a total of 6,126 bird deaths. Of them, 6,119 poultry birds have been found dead in the state alongside numerous herons, sparrows and parrots. Their samples have been sent to ICAR-NIHSAD and the Western Region Disease Diagnosis Laboratory (WRDDL) Pune, for testing. “Though it has spread to 20 districts, most of the areas where the outbreak was reported to have recorded no bird death in the last 20 days, which is a relief. It indicates that we have been able to control the virus in the respective areas,” said Sachindra Pratap Singh, state animal husbandry commissioner. Bird flu had heavily impacted the poultry business, with sales plummeting. Vasanth Kumar Shetty, Maharashtra president, poultry farmers and breeders association said that the sale of chicken has reduced by around 25%, which has brought big losses to the industry. “This virus doesn’t transmit to humans but owing to all the misconceptions and rumours, many people have stopped consuming chicken. This has resulted in a loss of sales by around 25%. As per a rough estimation, the industry has suffered a loss of ₹75 crore to ₹80 crore in a month in the state,” said Shetty. The state government has paid compensation of ₹340,600 to the poultry farmers in the infected zone, against culling of poultry birds and disposal of eggs and poultry feed. Shetty said that the compensation offered by the state government is very nominal. “Culling of poultry birds means farmers are going out of business and their livelihood is gone for over a year, which needs to be considered while determining compensation amount. The government is not giving even the basic cost against culling one poultry bird,” he said. Bird flu cases in NavapurNavapur is in picture again after around 5,000 poultry birds were found dead in the tehsil yet were not reported to the local administration despite frequent appeals from the state government, considering rise in bird flu deaths. On Monday, the district administration culled around 105,305 poultry birds while on Sunday 31,400 poultry birds were culled. Samples from four poultry farms tested positive for bird flu on Saturday.The state animal husbandry department said that it would have to cull approximately 150,000 poultry birds in the tehsil.Navapur, which is known from layer poultry farming, has some 26 such poultry farms. The tehsildar had received a complaint that a poultry farm was concealing the deaths of its poultry birds, following which the local administration took action and a first information report (FIR) was registered against the farm owner. It FIR was lodged under the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animal Act, 2009, under which reporting unusual deaths in poultry birds is mandatory. “The poultry owner was told by a local veterinary that the deaths are because of ‘ranikhet’ [a contagious disease that causes death in poultry birds]. The police are investigating the matter now,” said Shetty, who was in Navapur to review the situation.The state government has set up 72 teams to complete the culling process in the area at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-struggles-with-bird-flu-over-209-606-poultry-birds-culled-101612810853362.html

The court was hearing a writ petition against a group of people which included lawyers who tried to forcibly take over a property.“When it comes to the conduct of the advocates, there will be zero tolerance shown by this Court and this Court has to ensure that the activities of some of the advocates do not spoil the image of the entire profession,” justice Anand Venkatesh said.He observed that it was the third time in a month that it was brought to the court’s notice about “advocates indulging themselves in criminal activities by forming part of an unlawful assembly and making attempts to grab properties.”The court said that stringent action was taken in the past by suspending advocates when the issue was prevalent and it was subsequently brought under control. “It looks like the lockdown period (due to Covid-19) has again revived this despicable practice and once again some advocates are indulging in illegal activities of grabbing properties,” the court said, vowing to bring it under control again.The petitioner, PS Kirubakaran, had approached the court as police protection wasn’t given to the property due to the presence of advocates despite disruption in law and order. In its interim order on Monday, the court directed the respondent police authority in the case to provide protection to the property.The court said that advocates' participation was evident from photographs submitted and called for the advocates to be identified. “This report will form the basis for this Court to give a complaint before the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry against the concerned advocates,” the court stated. The matter for further orders has been posted to March 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/madras-high-court-warns-advocates-against-property-grabbing-101612810029718.html
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccination drive: 3 mn Mumbaiites will qualify for phase 3, says BMC||Close to three million Mumbaiites will qualify for phase three of the Covid-19 vaccination drive (meant for senior citizens and those with co-morbidities), the civic body’s door-to-door surveys for its My Family, My Responsibility drive have revealed. Depending on whether the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) does registrations on the centralised Cowin app or citizens themselves do it, it will take 15 days or longer for registration to be completed. So far, the BMC has vaccinated 82,884 healthcare and frontline workers. Vaccination of frontline workers, that is part of phase two of the drive, was started in Mumbai last Thursday, alongside the ongoing phase one of the drive. The second dose for beneficiaries of phase one will start from February 13, which marks 28 days from the time the drive started on January 16.The BMC on Monday vaccinated 7,133 beneficiaries and recorded a turnout of 83%. Among these, 4,502 were healthcare workers and 2,631 were frontline workers.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the municipal public health department, said on Sunday, “So far we have information about so many people who will qualify as beneficiaries in the third phase, as per data collected by the municipal corporation in the My Family, My Responsibility drive. However, we will have to see if all these people have the necessary documentation to register on the app, such as Aadhaar Card.”Local governments are still awaiting the Central government’s decision about whether to merge electoral data for phase three of the drive. If government bodies are allowed to register citizens for phase three, Mumbai will complete registration of these beneficiaries within 15 days. However, if citizens themselves are required to register on the Cowin app, it will take longer, according to BMC.Vaccination has now started across 21 centres in the city — King Edward Memorial Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Cooper hospital and Sion Hospital, Bhabha at Bandra, V N Desai at Santacruz, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar hospital, Kandivali; the Covid facility at Bandra Kurla Complex, at NESCO at Goregaon, and at Dahisar, the state-run JJ Hospital in South Mumbai, the SevenHills hospital in Andheri, Maa hospital, Kasturba Hospital, Centenary Govandi Hospital, S.K. Hospital, BARC hospital, MW Desai hospital, Bhagwati Hospital, and VD Savarkar hospital.Mumbai on Monday recorded 399 new Covid-19 cases, and three deaths due to the infection, taking the total cases in the city to 312,280, and the toll to 11,395, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.6%. Mumbai, presently, has 5,338 active cases, and a recovery rate of 94%. The doubling rate of cases in the city is 574 days, at a growth rate of 0.12%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-3-mn-mumbaiites-will-qualify-for-phase-3-says-bmc-101612809895867.html

China and his wife Maina (32) had two sons - 5-year-old and 2-year-old- from their marriage and pined for a girl child. China's wife was overjoyed when he brought the baby home.However, when the local ASHA and Anganwadi workers got to know about the incident on September 2, they asked them to hand over the child before the Child Welfare Committee as per the procedure."When our ASHA and Anganwadi workers met the couple they said the did not have a girl child and thus have adopted her. But we told them to hand over the baby to us and then apply for adoption as per the Adoption Regulations 2017. She, however, was unwilling to be persuaded and said she will keep her come what may," said Mita Nayak, child development project officer of Morada block.Nayak said since September 2, the Anganwadi workers, ICDS supervisor as well as ASHA workers of the area made several visits to the couple's home trying to reason with them about the necessity to follow the adoption procedures. "As the couple don't have the financial resources and already have two children, we reasoned with them to not insist on keeping the girl. We told them that the child needs better resources to grow up to be a healthy child. The woman just kept on saying 'I won't give'," said Nayak.District child protection officer of Mayurbhanj, Mamatamayee Biswal said the couple was being instigated by other tribal people of the village. "They seem to be under some sort of a misconception that by keeping the baby girl, the couple would get some help from the government. The child has low body weight and needs vaccination. We are not sure of what kind of vaccination she has been given. The villagers are regularly misbehaving with our staff whenever we go to persuade the couple," said Biswal.Inspector of Morada police station, Kuni Besra said on Sunday, she had sent a platoon of police to rescue the baby girl from the couple. "But by the time our team could reach the village, the couple had fled home with their sons. However, I have managed to send a message to China Hembram to handover the baby girl tomorrow. We will wait for the couple," she said.Officials in charge of the adoption of children in Odisha said it takes a little more than two years for a child to be adopted. "The parents who wish to adopt a child are required to register online with the Central Adoption Resources Agency and upload the necessary documents. Once the registration is done, the parent can select a Specialised Adoption Agency for a home study that confirms the suitability of the parents for adopting a child.

The man’s wife has alleged he was stabbed by a thief, a claim the police said was suspect.Senior police officers said a couple living in an adjacent room did not hear any commotion or screams of either the man, or his wife or two children, all of whom were sleeping in the same room. The wife’s role is now being probed, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh said the police control room received a call at 2.30am, reporting that a man had been stabbed by a thief. A police team found the body of Shiv Kumar (50), on the bed with a stab wound to the neck. The caller was a security guard who claimed he was sleeping in the adjacent room when Kumar’s wife alerted them about the murder, Singh said.“Kumar’s wife claimed she was sleeping on the floor with her two children when a thief entered the house and stabbed her husband. The clothes from the cupboard were strewn on the floor. However, the guard next door heard no commotion,” he added.A case of murder was registered at the Patel Nagar police station and investigation teams have been formed. A forensic team also visited the crime scene and lifted evidence.“There are certain vital clues which the investigation has revealed and the teams are developing them. We will crack the case soon,” the DCP said.Police said Kumar worked as a manager in the office of his relative, who is into a business of vehicle spare parts. Kumar was also the caretaker of the building where he lived. The police have learnt that the woman is Kumar’s second wife and the couple have two children, aged 10 and five.“The elder child has also claimed that his father was killed by a thief. But there are discrepancies in the statements of the mother and son,” said a police officer associated with the investigation, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/50yearold-man-found-stabbed-to-death-wife-under-police-lens-101612808811592.html

She was approached by a man who showed interest in making the purchase. To check if the account details shared by her were correct, he initially transferred a minimal amount of money into her account.Subsequently, the man sent a QR code to the seller and asked her to scan it so that the amount fixed under the deal could be transferred to her account but instead, ₹20,000 got deducted from her account when she followed the instructions of the buyer, a senior police officer said.When she enquired about it, the man claimed that he had sent a wrong QR code by mistake and sent another link to her, asking her to follow the same procedure. But again an amount of ₹14,000 got deducted from the seller's account when she scanned the QR code, the officer said."Based on the complaint received, we have registered an FIR under the relevant sections of the IPC. An investigation has been initiated and we are trying to trace the suspect," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-dupes-delhi-cm-s-daughter-of-rs-34k-on-e-commerce-platform-101612804410689.html
09-02-2021||Chandigarh||Allotment of land to Flipkart in Haryana’s Manesar hits a hurdle||The allotment of 140 acres to e-commerce company, Flipkart, in Gurugram’s Manesar by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) has hit a hurdle.Flipkart was allotted a site in October last year at the warehousing and transport hub in Patli Hazipur, Manesar, close to the industrial hub of IMT, Manesar, for setting up its largest fulfilling centre in Asia, having covered an area of 3 million square feet.The land was allotted at ₹3.09 crore per acre at bare shell cost. This meant that the HSIIDC would not provide external or internal infrastructure for the site and creating it would be the responsibility of the allottee.The allotment was approved by the executive empowered committee under the chairmanship of the then principal secretary to chief minister, Rajesh Khullar.Allotment on hold after Dushyant’s interventionWhile Flipkart had deposited about ₹22 crore as earnest money, the allotment process was put on hold after deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who holds charge of industries and commerce portfolio, intervened to seek clarifications on the allotment price of ₹3.09 crore per acre.Subsequently, the Haryana Enterprise Promotion Board (HEPB) had asked the corporation to put a few more warehousing sites for e-auction to explore the market.“The minister was of view that pricing for this land was low and the HSIIDC needs to dive deeper,’’ said an official. Dushyant was not available for a comment in this regard.Zero response to newly floated sites create dilemmaWhile last month the HSIIDC had put up four warehousing sites of comparatively smaller sizes for auction, officials said that there was zero response.The last date of registration and deposit of earnest money by the bidders was February 3. “If these sites had fetched a higher price, then the allotment price for Flipkart would also have been revised. But not a single bid was registered,’’ said an official.All four sites were advertised for auction at approximately the same reserve price as Flipkart’s. The sites though were way smaller – 7.47 acre, 8.44 acre, 16.68 acre and 25.29 acre - as compared to the site allotted to Flipkart.Officials said that for the past one year, the corporation has advertised the warehousing sites four times without any success.“The first time the allotment price was about ₹6 crore per acre. This included providing internal and external infrastructure by the HSIIDC. The second time the price was reduced to about ₹4 crore per acre, but this was without any commitment to provide internal infrastructure. The third time it was decided to further reduce the price to about ₹3.09 crore at bare shell cost. This meant that internal and external infrastructure will not be provided. And the latest floatation where no one responded was also on similar lines,’’ said an official.Officials said that the HEPB, headed by the CM, will have to decide on the future course of action since there is a deadlock now.Firms cite economic restraintsOfficials said that they had held multiple rounds of meetings with companies who would be interested in buying the warehousing sites, but they cited pricing as a major restraint. That’s why, they said, it was decided to sell these sites as bare shell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/flipkart-land-allotment-hits-a-hurdle-101612801913072.html
09-02-2021||World||As impeachment trial opens, Trump and Biden keep quiet||Donald Trump's second impeachment trial may be the talk of America but a few people, at least, are mum so far, for very different reasons -- Trump himself, and his successor, President Joe Biden.The opening of the trial in the US Senate on Tuesday, which could affect the political landscape for years to come, is unprecedented: no president has ever watched his predecessor be tried before Congress.For Biden, the message is clear: three weeks after moving into the White House, he is focused on curbing the deadly coronavirus pandemic and the economic fallout that has devastated tens of millions of Americans.And the bizarre scenario should help reinforce the image of a leader who has no time to waste on the squabbling of lawyers or debates about whether the entire process is even constitutional.As the trial gets under way, the White House has scheduled a working meeting for the veteran Democrat and business leaders on how to put the world's largest economy back on track.Biden will be joined by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and a handful of CEOs from key sectors: Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase), Doug McMillon (Walmart) and Sonia Syngal (The Gap).Since taking office on January 20, the 46th president of the United States has hardly mentioned his predecessor -- and responds in the briefest terms possible to any questions about the Republican.When asked on Monday about the trial on the White House lawn, Biden did not have much to say."Let the Senate work it out," he told reporters.Trump lines up his troopsFor Trump, who has been holed up at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida since leaving Washington on January 20, discretion is also the key word.Of course, he's been deprived since the waning days of his presidency of his favorite virtual megaphone -- his Twitter account.But he could have taken advantage of other channels of communication, such as prerecorded video messages, which he used frequently at the fraught end of his term.But staying quiet and letting his attorneys do the talking has clear benefits: while his acquittal seems nearly certain, with a vast majority of Republican senators voting to try to prevent the trial from even happening, any misplaced word from Trump could throw a spanner in the works.According to Politico, citing his advisors, the 74-year-old former president has understood the value of speaking less frequently, after four years in office of wall-to-wall media exposure."He finally realizes less is more," one of them said.Watching the trial from afar at his waterfront club should afford Trump a chance to see just how much sway he still has over the Republican Party.The goal? To rally his troops and take the pulse of the Grand Old Party.The GOP has several camps: those who are steadfast in their support and wish for him to run in 2024; those ready to turn the page; and a last group -- numerous but low-profile -- ready to move on but too afraid to say it out loud for fear of losing voter support.In the end, it would be to Trump's advantage to wait for his acquittal before resurfacing, as it would allow him to leverage that moment for a fiery return to the political stage as a kingmaker for the 2022 midterm elections.A year ago, nearly to the day, following his acquittal in his first impeachment trial, he was triumphant.Holding up a copy of The Washington Post with the banner headline "Trump acquitted," he railed against the "vicious" Democrats who had pursued him.He called his appearance in the ceremonial East Room of the White House a "celebration," taking a victory lap and thanking all the Republican lawmakers who backed him.Back at the White House, while Biden is so far taking a low-key approach to the proceedings, no one doubts that his team will be closely watching the trial unfold -- and how public opinion evolves along with it.According to a CBS/YouGov poll published Tuesday a few hours before the opening of the trial, 56 percent of those surveyed said they wanted to see Trump convicted of inciting violence in connection with the January 6 riot at the US Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-impeachment-trial-opens-trump-and-biden-keep-quiet-101612894004087.html
09-02-2021||World||Myanmar military raids Suu Kyi's party offices as UN slams violence||Myanmar's military raided the Yangon headquarters of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party late Tuesday, officials said, hours after the United Nations condemned "unacceptable" violence against protesters demanding a return to democracy.The latest assault on Myanmar's civilian leadership came as anger at last week's coup and the detention of Suu Kyi by the generals has driven hundreds of thousands of people into the streets in recent days, defying a junta ban on rallies."The military dictator raided and destroyed NLD headquarters at around 9:30pm," the National League for Democracy announced on its Facebook page.The party's short statement gave no further details.The raid came after demonstrations erupted for a fourth straight day Tuesday, with police using water cannons in several cities, firing rubber bullets at protesters in the capital Naypyidaw and deploying tear gas in Mandalay.The rallies came despite a warning from the junta that it would take action against demonstrations that threatened "stability", and a new ban on gatherings of more than five people.In Naypyidaw, the remote capital purpose-built by the previous military regime, witnesses said police fired projectiles at protesters after earlier blasting them with water cannon."They fired warning shots to the sky two times, then they fired (at protesters) with rubber bullets," a resident told AFP.At least one emergency room doctor said the military were also using live rounds, leaving a 23-year-old man and 19-year-old in a critical condition in hospital."We believe they are actual bullets because of the wounds and their injuries," the doctor said."We don't operate on their wounds because they could die right away -- we are 100 percent sure they will die if we operate -- that's why we are watching their condition by treating them medically."The father of one of the victims said his son had been shot "when he tried to use the megaphone to ask people to protest peacefully after the police used water cannon to disperse them.""He got hit in the back... I'm very worried about him," the 56-year-old goldsmith told AFP.In Mandalay, the country's second-biggest city, police fired tear gas to disperse protesters.A witness, who declined to be named out of fear of the authorities, said she gave shelter to about 20 of the protesters, offering them water, towels and fresh face masks.As night fell the United Nations voiced its "strong concern" over the violence."The use of disproportionate force against demonstrators is unacceptable," said Ola Almgren, the UN resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar.'We only have one life'Earlier this week the protests by hundreds of thousands appeared to have rattled the military, with junta chief General Min Aung Hlaing making a televised speech Monday to justify seizing power, citing fraud claims.The army also announced a curfew and a ban on protest gatherings.But on Tuesday fresh demonstrations emerged in Yangon, including near the NLD's headquarters.The protesters carried placards, some of which read "We want our leader", in reference to Suu Kyi and "No dictatorship".By afternoon, thousands had gathered in neighbouring Kamayut township, carrying umbrellas and wearing raincoats as they faced off against police, who had water cannon trucks blocking protesters from marching ahead."Of course we are worried (about a crackdown)," said protester Khin Thida Nyein, a teacher. "We only have one life but we still come out.... as we are more concerned for the future of our children."Protesters dispersed by nightfall, with no reports of clashes with Yangon authorities.Meanwhile, civil aviation workers and air traffic controllers have joined a civil disobedience movement, with their strike set to impact international flights wanting to pass through Myanmar's air space.It will also hit the military government's coffers, which are set to lose overflight fees paid by airlines that could be worth up to $182,000 per day."Without us they can't get the money anymore," one air traffic controller told AFP.Military promisesThe NLD won last November's national elections by a landslide but the military never accepted the results.It has announced a one-year state of emergency and promised to hold fresh elections after that.Min Aung Hlaing on Monday insisted the military would abide by its promises and reinstall democracy. He also declared that things would be different from the army's previous 49-year reign, which ended in 2011.New Zealand on Tuesday became the first foreign government to take concrete public action, announcing the suspension of high-level military and political contacts with Myanmar.The United States has led global calls for the generals to relinquish power, and issued a fresh statement on Monday, using the country's former name as it said it stands "with the people of Burma."State Department spokesman Ned Price also said US requests to speak to Suu Kyi had been denied.The UN Human Rights Council said it would hold a relatively rare special session on Friday to discuss the crisis.Meanwhile, relatives of an Australian economic advisor to Suu Kyi said they were "distraught" over his detention.Macquarie University professor Sean Turnell was the first foreign national confirmed arrested by the new junta.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has summoned the Myanmar ambassador over the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-military-raids-suu-kyi-s-party-offices-as-un-slams-violence-101612893754427.html

Former President Donald Trump criticized the agency and halted funding."We want to underscore the commitment of the United States to multilateralism and our common cause to respond to this pandemic and improve global public health," Colin L.

WHO's Special Envoy for the ACT Accelerator, Andrew Witty, a former GlaxoSmithKline CEO, said talks on further US contributions were ongoing.A meeting document gave preliminary total estimates for how much major economies would be expected to give, showing between $6-$9 billion for the United States and about $2-$4 billion for Japan and Germany."There was general support for the burden-sharing framework," Dag Inge Ulstein, Norway's minister of international development who co-chaired the meeting, told Reuters."We got a really good response from the actors and the US coming back has created momentum."Tedros, at the same meeting, expressed fresh concerns about vaccine inequity, noting that 90% of countries rolling out Covid-19 vaccines were wealthy and that 75% of doses had been deployed to just 10 countries.South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, the other co-chair, called these "alarming and disappointing numbers which we need to change".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-changing-course-joins-who-programme-aimed-at-boosting-covid-19-fight-101612893301984.html
09-02-2021||World||Indian Americans divided on current trajectory of Indian democracy: Survey||While broadly supportive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP, Indian Americans are evenly divided on the current trajectory of Indian democracy, according to a newly published analysis of an online survey conducted last September.Asked if India is on the right track, 36% of the respondents had said it is, while 39% said it is on the wrong track, and 25% had said they do not have an opinion.The survey was conducted by YouGov for Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Johns Hopkins University and the University of Pennsylvania between September 1 and September 20, in the run up to the US elections in November 2020. It covered 1, 200 Indian Americans, a community with growing economic and political clout.The analysis released on Tuesday showed that Indian Americans were most concerned about government corruption (18%) in India, slowing economic growth (15%) and religious majoritarianism (10%).But not all Indian Americans felt the same way on the current trajectory of India. Those born in the US were more pessimistic — 39% of Indian-born believed India was on the right track compared to 32% of those born in the US, while 44% of those born in the US felt India was on the wrong track compared to 36% born in India.The analysis reaffirms, at the same time, the BJP’s continuing popularity among Indian Americans, with 32% of respondents favouring it while just 12% backed the Congress. But 40% said they do not identify with any political party, which the reports said, suggested “an arms-length relationship to everyday politics in India”. Prime Minister Modi remains broadly popular in the community — with 35% strongly approving of his job performance and 13% approving of it; 9% disapproved and 22% strongly disapproved. “This support is greatest among Republicans, Hindus, people in the engineering profession, those not born in the United States, and those who hail from North and West India,” the report said.Indian Americans were curiously more liberal when it came to issues affecting the United States than for those relating to India. “Regarding contentious issues such as the equal protection of religious minorities, immigration, and affirmative action, Indian Americans hold relatively more conservative views of Indian policies than of US policies,” the report said.The community is largely supportive of the US-India relationship and most of them hold unfavourable views of China. But, the report said, they were divided on how much help should the US extend to India against China. “Foreign-born Indian Americans and those who identify as Republicans are more supportive of US efforts to support India militarily than their US-born and Democratic counterparts.”The report concludes that while the community remains connected with India and largely supportive of it, it is not a monolith and “there are clear intergenerational differences when it comes to attitudes toward political and social changes underway in India”. The first-generation immigrants had emphasised the Indian elements of their identify. “But their children — members of the second generation—place a relatively greater emphasis on the American dimension of their identity,” the report said. “They are less engaged with India and more US-focused than their parents’ generation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-divided-on-current-trajectory-of-indian-democracy-survey-101612892997979.html

But Biden returned home to Delaware last weekend, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted that the president flies on a private plane — Air Force One — which helps reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Biden has also received both doses of his vaccine, and consistently wears a mask.Biden made Wisconsin a focus for his campaign in 2020, visiting the state three times, including in late October, when he visited Milwaukee just days before the election. Biden ultimately flipped the state back from red to blue, beating former President Donald Trump by about 20,000 votes there.The day Biden is visiting Wisconsin, Feb. 16, is also the state’s spring primary election day, with just one statewide primary — for a nonpartisan superintendent of schools position — on the ballot, along with more than 100 local primaries.Biden's CNN town hall will also overlap with a video message Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is slated to give at the same time that night delivering his two-year state budget to the GOP-controlled legislature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-visit-wisconsin-next-week-in-first-official-trip-as-us-president-101612890731339.html
09-02-2021||World||Facebook faces new UK class action after data harvesting scandal||Facebook is facing a second London High Court class action over allegations it failed to protect the personal details of about one million people in England and Wales, in the latest lawsuit to spring from a scandal over data harvesting.Journalist and writer Peter Jukes said on Tuesday he had filed a lawsuit for unspecified but "substantial" damages three years after the social media giant was fined in Britain over how third-party app "This Is Your Digital Life" gathered Facebook users' data without consent between 2013 and 2015.The lawsuit is the second to allege Facebook allowed third-party apps to harvest the data of friends without their permission or knowledge. Litigation firm Milberg London, which is advising on a similar claim filed last October, said it was surprised to hear about the rival lawsuit.The cases cast a fresh spotlight on a scandal that began with allegations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consultancy hired by former president Donald Trump's 2016 US election campaign, accessed the personal data of millions of Facebook users.The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in 2018 fined Facebook 500,000 pounds ($687,000) for processing the personal data of users unfairly by allowing app developers access to their information and that of their friends without sufficiently clear and informed consent between 2007 and 2014.A Facebook spokesperson said: "The Information Commissioner's Office investigation into these issues ... found no evidence that any UK or EU users' data was transferred by ("This Is Your Digital Life" app developer Dr Aleksandr) Kogan to Cambridge Analytica," without giving any further comment.Cambridge Analytica, which started bankruptcy proceedings in 2018, has denied that it made use of such data for the 2016 US election campaign. It has also said its pitch for work for the Leave. UK campaign for Brexit in 2016 was unsuccessful.The latest London claim is being brought on behalf of adult Facebook users who were "friends" with a user of the app before May 2015. Jukes is being advised by U.S.-based law firm Hausfeld and the claim is being funded by Balance Legal Capital.US-style "opt-out" data privacy class actions, which bind a defined group automatically into a lawsuit unless individuals opt out, are still unusual in Britain.The UK Supreme Court is expected to determine the law in April, when it hears a bellwether case against Internet giant Google over alleged unlawful tracking of iPhone users in 2011 and 2012 through third party cookies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-faces-new-uk-class-action-after-data-harvesting-scandal-101612890256699.html

Deals to supply millions of doses have been reached with Turkey, Hungary and at least eight other foreign countries.Beijing is trying to nurture relations with Central and Eastern European governments as part of efforts to expand markets for exports and for Chinese construction and other companies to operate abroad.The focus on Eastern Europe through the China-CEEC group, also known as “17 plus 1,” has prompted unease among France, Germany and other Western European governments that Beijing is trying to make political inroads into the European Union.Addressing Tuesday's meeting remotely, Polish President Andrzej Duda said the best way to help economies rebound after the pandemic would be to expand trade. Poland so far has not opted to secure the Chinese vaccines,“We have this expectation that the cooperation within our 17 1 format will start bringing measurable and bilateral benefits in the area of economy, and first of all in the form of higher exports to China of goods and services from Central and Eastern Europe and in the form of a greater inflow of Chinese greenfield investments,” Duda said.Meanwhile, Xi said China intends to import farm and other goods worth more than $170 billion from Central and Eastern Europe over the next five years, according to Xinhua.Beijing is trying to develop new trade relationships and reduce reliance on the United States following a tariff war with Washington.“We need to deepen agricultural cooperation,” Xi said, according to Xinhua.Xi also expressed support for plans by Fudan University in Shanghai to establish a university in Hungary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-open-to-vaccine-cooperation-with-eastern-europe-says-xi-jinping-101612890280674.html
09-02-2021||World||UN terms Myanmar military's use of force against protesters 'unacceptable'||The United Nations' top official in Myanmar Ola Almgren on Tuesday warned the military that the use of disproportionate force against demonstrators is "unacceptable" amid reports of people injured in anti-coup protests across the country."I call on the security forces to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression", Ola Almgren, UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Myanmar in a statement by the world body.Citing unattributed reports from Nay Pyi Taw, Mandalay and other cities, Almgren said that some demonstrators were seriously hurt by security forces in connection with the current protests."The use of disproportionate force against demonstrators is unacceptable", he added.He went on to reiterate the words of the United Nations Secretary-General urging the military leadership to respect the will of the people of Myanmar and adhere to democratic norms, with any differences to be resolved through peaceful dialogue.Days after the military coup in Myanmar, as many as 90 townships in 30 cities across the country have been placed under curfew. According to a report by The Myanmar Times, 90 townships in 30 cities, including 44 townships in Yangon, have been placed under an 8 pm to 4 am curfew since February 8. Besides, the residents have been banned from gathering in groups of more than five in public.The affected areas include -- Nay Pyi Taw, Lewe, Tatkone, Zeyar Thiri, Mandalay, Magwe, Sagaing, Monywa, Shwebo, Kalay, Waingmaw, Bamaw, Mokaung, Shweku, Monyin, Hpakant, Loikaw, Mawlamyine, Thanphyu Zayat, Ye, Kyaikhto, Kengtung and Taunggyi.As per the order issued by each town's General Administration Department, public gatherings of more than five people, delivering speeches and protests have been banned.Action can be taken against the violators under Section 144 of the Penal Code, The Myanmar Times reported.Last week, hours before the newly elected parliament was due to gather, Myanmar's military overthrew the government and declared a year-long state of emergency after accusing State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi's party of election fraud. San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint along with other top officials have been put under house arrest.However, the curfew has failed to deter the people from participating in protest marches across the country calling for the release of detainees.Earlier today, Myanmar's political parties had rejected the Tatmadaw, also known as military locally, government's invitation to take part in the Tatmadaw-formed peace talks committee. According to The Myanmar Times, the military has informed the ethnic armed groups that future peace talks will be continued only with the military-formed peace committee.Sputnik reported that demonstrators took to the streets of Myanmar, demanding that the military hand power to the elected government and release those detained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-terms-myanmar-military-s-use-of-force-against-protesters-unacceptable-101612889047179.html

During a Senate confirmation hearing, Indian-American lawyer Neera Tanden said that she deeply regrets her language where she had compared conservative leader Ted Cruz with vampires, a creature from Western folklore that survive by drinking blood, and called senator Mitch McConnell “Voldemort”, the main antagonist in JK Rowling's Harry Potter novels.Tanden’s nomination for Director of the OMB, the top position in the White House responsible for managing the administration’s budget, was heavily criticised by conservatives. In one of her tweets, she had referred McConnell as “Moscow Mitch”, implying that the Senate Republican leader was working for Russia. Rob Portman, junior senator for Ohio, grilled Tanden for her past remarks.“You wrote that Susan Collins is ‘the worst’, that Tom Cotton is a ‘fraud’, that ‘vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz’. You called leader McConnell ‘Moscow Mitch’ and ‘Voldemort’...I wonder how do you plan to mend fences and build a relationship with members of Congress you have attacked through your public statements,” asked Portman.Read | Who is Neera Tanden? Joe Biden’s Indian-American pick for budget chiefTanden said she recognises that the head of OMB is a bipartisan role and she will aggressively work to meet the concerns raised by the senator. “I deeply regret and apologise for my language and some of my past language. I recognise that this role is a bipartisan role and I knew I have to earn the trust of senators across the board.

She and relatives of the other victims also faulted the companies that owned and operated the helicopter.The brother of the pilot didn’t blame Bryant but said he knew about the risks of flying. The helicopter companies said foggy weather before the helicopter hit the ground was an act of God and blamed air traffic controllers.The federal hearing focused on the long-awaited probable cause or causes of the tragedy that unleashed worldwide grief for the retired basketball star, launched several lawsuits and prompted state and federal legislation.“I think the whole world is watching because it’s Kobe,” said Ed Coleman, an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University professor and aircraft safety science expert.Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and six other passengers were flying from Orange County to a youth basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy in Ventura County on Jan. 26, 2020, when the helicopter encountered thick fog in the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles.Pilot Ara Zobayan climbed sharply and nearly broke through the clouds when the Sikorsky S-76 helicopter banked abruptly and plunged into the Calabasas hills below, killing all nine aboard instantly before flames engulfed the wreckage.There was no sign of mechanical failure and the crash was believed to be an accident, the National Transportation Safety Board has said previously.The board on Tuesday is likely to make nonbinding recommendations to prevent future crashes when it meets remotely and announces its findings about the crash.The NTSB is an independent federal agency that investigates transportation-related crashes but has no enforcement powers.It submits suggestions to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration or the Coast Guard, which have repeatedly rejected some board safety recommendations after other disasters.One possible recommendation following the investigation into the crash that killed Bryant could be for helicopters to have Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems, devices that signal when aircraft are in danger of crashing.The helicopter Bryant was flying in did not have the system, which the NTSB has recommended as mandatory for helicopters. The FAA requires it only for air ambulances.Federal lawmakers have sponsored the Kobe Bryant and Gianna Bryant Helicopter Safety Act to mandate the devices on all helicopters carrying six or more passengers.Former NTSB Chairman James Hall said he hopes the FAA will require the systems as a result of the crash.“Historically, it has required high-profile tragedies to move the regulatory needle forward,” he said.The devices, known as TAWS, cost upward of $35,000 per helicopter and require training and maintenance.Helicopter Association International, which represents the helicopter industry, discouraged what it called a “one solution fits all” method.President and CEO James Viola said in a statement that mandating specific equipment for the entire industry would be “ineffective” and “potentially hazardous.”Even though Zobayan was flying at low altitude in a hilly area, the warning system may not have prevented the crash, Coleman said.The rugged terrain could have triggered the alarm "constantly going off” and distracted the pilot or prompted him to lower the alarm's volume or ignore it, the Embry-Riddle safety science professor said.Federal investigators said Zobayan, an experienced pilot who often flew Bryant, may have “misperceived” the angles at which he was descending and banking, which can occur when pilots become disoriented in low visibility, according to NTSB documents.The others killed in the crash were Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa; Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach his daughter’s basketball team; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton. Alyssa and Payton were Gianna’s teammates.The crash has generated lawsuits and countersuits.On the day that a massive memorial service was held at the Staples Center, where Bryant played most of his career, Vanessa Bryant sued Zobayan and the companies that owned and operated the helicopter for alleged negligence and the wrongful deaths of her husband and daughter. Families of other victims sued the helicopter companies but not the pilot.Vanessa Bryant said Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, and its owner, Island Express Holding Corp., did not properly train or supervise Zobayan. She said the pilot was careless and negligent to fly in fog and should have aborted the flight.Zobayan’s brother, Berge Zobayan, has said Kobe Bryant knew the risks of flying in a helicopter and that his survivors aren’t entitled to damages from the pilot’s estate. Island Express Helicopters Inc. denied responsibility and said the crash was “an act of God” that it could not control.The company also countersued two FAA air traffic controllers, saying the crash was caused by their “series of erroneous acts and/or omissions.”The countersuit claims one controller improperly denied Zobayan’s request for “flight following,” or radar assistance, as he proceeded in the fog. Officials have said the controller terminated service because radar could not be maintained at the altitude the aircraft was flying.According to the lawsuit, the controller said he was going to lose radar and communications shortly, but radar contact was not lost.When a second controller took over, the lawsuit said, the first controller failed to brief him about the helicopter, and because the radar services were not terminated correctly, the pilot believed he was being tracked.Vanessa Bryant also sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, accusing deputies of sharing unauthorized photos of the crash site. California now has a state law prohibiting such conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kobe-bryant-crash-pilot-disoriented-in-clouds-agency-says-101612887662417.html

It is called Amal, which is Arabic for Hope. And it will gather data on Mars’ thin atmosphere.It took several nail-biting minutes or so for the signal confirming success to reach Earth. Tensions were high: Over the years, Mars has been the graveyard for a multitude of missions from various countries.Two more unmanned spacecraft from the US and China are set to arrive at Mars over the next several days.

09-02-2021||World||As vaccines arrive, South Africa faces widespread skepticism over safety||As a nurse in a country battling deadly diseases, Rich Sicina sometimes vaccinates other South Africans, but he says there is no way he will take a Covid-19 shot - he doesn't believe it will be safe or effective.South Africa's decision on Sunday to suspend plans to roll out AstraZeneca's vaccine, after data showed it may not offer sufficient protection against the country's dominant coronavirus variant, has only added to Sicina's concerns."We do not trust these politicians," he said.Many South Africans agree. The Indaba nurses union, to which Sicina belongs, has advised its 17,000 members to boycott the vaccine.Two polls, a global one by IPSOS and a national one by South African fintech start-up CompariSure, in January suggested that half of South Africans would refuse the vaccine. A University of Johannesburg (UJ) survey, with the biggest sample size of 10,000, put the number more optimistically at a third.The stakes are high: Covid-19 has hit South Africa harder than anywhere else on the continent, infecting nearly 1.5 million and killing more than 46,000, while a more infectious variant that evolved here has spread around the world.South Africa hopes to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population, to achieve some herd immunity but has yet to administer a shot."We don't know whether to trust it or not. So, honestly, no," Bonnie Legwale, 25, a financial adviser, told Reuters TV on Monday, when asked if she would take the vaccine.THE DEVIL'S JABEfforts to eradicate certain diseases have foundered before in Africa when a section of the population rejects vaccination - often driven by religious beliefs and mistrust of Western pharmaceutical companies.In 2003, Muslim clerics instigated a boycott of polio shots in northern Nigeria. There have been similar appeals against COVID-19 shots.Tanzanian President John Magufuli told citizens to avoid the vaccines - calling them a foreign plot - and protect themselves by praying while inhaling steam.The governor of Nigeria's Kogi state, Yahaya Bello, was filmed in January saying vaccine makers "want to ... introduce the disease that will kill you, God forbid."In December, South Africa's Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng prayed that "any vaccine that is of the devil ... may it be destroyed by fire", in remarks he declined to recant despite fierce criticism.Mogoeng had no further comment, his spokesman said.Such concerns are not uncommon on a continent where sickness is often seen as resulting from supernatural forces - and where big pharmaceutical companies have run dubious clinical trials resulting in deaths.Added to the mix are conspiracy theories available online, some of which from "anti-vaxxers" in wealthier countries.South Africa's Department of Health has run a publicity campaign to counter popular myths, including that Bill Gates, whose foundation helped fund the development of Covid-19 vaccines, put a microchip in them that he plans to use for world domination.The UJ survey found that less-educated people were more willing to be vaccinated, and white South Africans, who tend to be wealthier and have access to better schools, were more hesitant than Blacks."People with ... degree-level education are often the ones very interested in their smart phones, so they have greater access to conspiracy theories" than poorer folk who get information from radio and TV, survey co-author Kate Alexander said."DISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT"Elsewhere in the world, trust in vaccines has improved since last year, with most happy to take them, and only 12% reporting no trust at all, according to a YouGov survey of 15 countries.Influential figures, such as anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, say they will take the Covid-19 shot.Yet trust in South Africa's handling of the pandemic has deteriorated, over perceived failures such as a shortage of protective equipment for medical staff and allegations of corruption in government Covid-19 relief contracts."You see people lining up to steal money and ... you've got a high level of distrust of government," said William Bird, director of Media Monitoring Africa, which fights misinformation online.A Department of Health spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on criticism of its handling of the crisis. But officials have said that governments with better resources than South Africa have struggled to respond to the pandemic.Social worker and "holistic medicine" healer Debasalam Bloom said she is wary of vaccines and will avoid the COVID-19 one."I don't believe it's been tested for long enough. So we don't really know, long term, what the side effects are," she said.Some experts favour legal measures to force compliance."If you implement a coercive policy properly, it works regardless of whether or not there is trust in government," Oxford bioethics expert Alberto Giubilini told Reuters. "We do that with taxes ... and I don't see why vaccines should be any different."He suggested lockdown restrictions on individuals who refuse the vaccine, barring them from public indoor places.Aslam Dasoo, convener of Progressive Health Forum, an advocacy group, disagrees."To win this battle, you can't do it at the expense of rights. Only the people in the end can stop the pandemic," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-vaccines-arrive-south-africa-faces-widespread-skepticism-over-safety-101612885400436.html
09-02-2021||World||Trump’s impeachment trial to begin with arguments on constitutionality||The US Senate will begin the historic second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, with arguments on its constitutionality, followed by a vote.Trump is facing trial for inciting supporters to storm the US Capitol on January 6 as Congress met in a joint session to certify President Joe Biden’s election victory. Five people, including a police officer, died in the violence.House impeachment managers and Trump’s defence team will argue the constitutionality of the trial for four hours, split evenly. After hearing them, the 100 senators — in their role as jurors in the trial — will vote to decide if the trial is constitutional. They are expected to say it is, as they had once before with all 50 Democrats joined by some Republicans.Trump’s lawyers — Bruce L. Castor and David Schoen — have called the trial unconstitutional, arguing “the Senate lacks jurisdiction to remove from office a man who does not hold office”. In a brief filed on Monday, they urged the Senate to reject the trial, calling it a “brazen political act”.House impeachment managers — all nine Democrats — said in a counter brief that the former president “has no valid excuse or defence for his actions. And his efforts to escape accountability are entirely unavailing”.The two sides will make their cases over the next days, which will be followed by questioning by senators and closing arguments by the two sides and, finally, the vote, sometime next week. A conviction — which requires two-thirds of the vote — will bar Trump from holding any federal official in future and make him the only president ever convicted in an impeachment trial. He has already made history as the only president impeached twice — last time was in December 2019.There might be more trouble in store for the former president. Georgia has started an inquiry into a phone call made by Trump Secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, also a Republican, on January 2 asking him to find him the votes needed to overturn his defeat in the state to Biden. “All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state,” Trump had told him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-impeachment-trial-to-begin-with-arguments-on-constitutionality-101612886577815.html

Israel occupied the strategic plateau in a 1967 war with Syria and annexed it in 1981.Blinken said on Monday he saw control of the Golan, which overlooks northern Israel and also borders Lebanon and Jordan, as being "of real important to Israel's security" but was circumspect about recognising Israeli sovereignty over the territory."Legal questions are something else and over time if the situation were to change in Syria, that's something we look at, but we are nowhere near that," Blinken told CNN.Briefing reporters, Netanyahu said in response: "Look, they said they are looking at it - but I have already looked at it. As far as I am concerned, the Golan Heights will remain forever part of the State of Israel, a sovereign part.""What, should we return it to Syria?" he added, noting the internal strife in Israel's long-time enemy. "Should we return the Golan to a situation where mass-slaughter is a danger?"Syria has long demanded the return of the Golan, and Israel's unilateral annexation of the area was not recognised internationally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-antony-blinken-remarks-netanyahu-says-golan-will-always-be-israels-101612882355915.html

That left Kearns’ account with a negative balance of $730,000 on a trade that he had understood would be limited to a maximum loss of less than $10,000, the lawsuit says.Kearns, desperate for answers, sent several emails to Robinhood’s customer support, but only received auto-generated replies, according to the lawsuit. Then, after 3:30 a.m., Kearns got an email from Robinhood saying he needed to deposit more than $178,000 within seven days to begin to address the negative balance, according to the lawsuit.“Tragically, Robinhood’s communications were completely misleading, because, in reality, Alex did not owe any money; he held options in his account that more than covered his obligation, and the massive negative balance would have been erased by the exercise and settlement of the” options Kearns held, according to the lawsuit.After not being able to speak with anyone from Robinhood, Kearns became more desperate and fearful of the mammoth financial obligation, according to the complaint.“This resulted in a highly distressed mental condition in Alex, an uncontrollable impulse to commit suicide as the only option he could see,” according to the lawsuit.Robinhood, which is based in Menlo Park, California, issued a statement in response to the lawsuit Monday saying it was devastated by Kearns' death and has since made improvements to its options offerings. The measures include adding more educational materials on options trading and new financial criteria and experience requirements for new customers seeking to trade some options.“In early December, we also added live voice support for customers with an open options position or recent expiration, and plan to expand to other use cases,” the company said.Robinhood has drawn criticism and regulatory scrutiny in its drive to bring more regular people into investing, not just wealthy investors already well versed in the markets.In December, regulators in Massachusetts filed an administrative complaint against the company, alleging that Robinhood violated securities laws by aggressively marketing itself to Massachusetts investors without regard for the best interest of its customers. At the time, Robinhood said it disagreed with the complaint and intended to mount a vigorous defense.Critics say Robinhood makes trading stocks and exchange-traded funds so cheap, easy and maybe even fun, it could be enabling unsophisticated investors to buy and sell too-risky investments too often.The company tells customers on its website that they can “level up with options trading,” for example. With options, investors buy a contract that gives them the possibility of buying or selling a stock or ETF in the future at a set price. Trading options allows for potentially big profits at a low initial cost, but it can also be riskier than buying a plain vanilla share of stock if the bet goes the wrong way. And if traders borrow money to juice their options trades, it raises the risk even more.Robinhood nevertheless has forced huge, ground-shaking changes for the brokerage industry. Its decision to charge zero commissions for customers trading stocks and ETFs pushed the industry’s biggest players to eventually follow suit — and to band together. Charles Schwab bought TD Ameritrade and Morgan Stanley acquired E-Trade Financial to try to be more competitive.Investors on Robinhood and other trading platforms have also influenced prices on Wall Street. Analysts credit these investors with helping drive shares sharply higher last month in GameStop and AMC Entertainment, and in Tesla and other Big Tech companies last summer while the economy struggled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-of-investor-who-killed-himself-thinking-he-lost-700-000-sue-robinhood-101612880821710.html

Liang said the joint Chinese and WHO team of 34 experts believe the virus originated in an animal, “but the reservoir host remains to be identified”.However, researchers did find evidence of wider Covid-19 circulation outside the Huanan seafood market – linked to a few of the first cases of the virus – that same month, said Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO’s food safety and animal disease specialist and chairperson of the investigation team.“The possible path from whatever original animal species all the way through to the Huanan market could have taken a very long and convoluted path involving also movements across borders,” Embarek told the nearly three-hour media briefing.The first cases of a pneumonia-like viral infection were reported in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in the central Chinese province of Hubei, in December 2019.Embarek added it was not possible yet to pinpoint the animal intermediary host for the coronavirus, describing the findings as “work in progress.”The current theory is that the virus originally circulated in bats or pangolins.Liang said the onset date of the earliest Covid-19 case had been on December 8, 2019 and the earliest case associated with the Huanan market was on December 12, 2019.The Chinese expert said: “The case with the onset date of December 8 case had no relation with Huanan seafood market”.Liang did not give a location that the December 8 case was connected to.“In terms of understanding what happened in the early days of December 2019, did we change dramatically the picture we had beforehand? I don’t think so,” Embarek said. “Did we improve our understanding? Did we add details to that story? Absolutely.” The China-WHO expert team, which reached Wuhan on January 14 and then quarantined for two weeks, subsequently visited markets, hospitals, research centres and interacted with scientists and experts.Embarek said that “four main hypotheses or groups of hypotheses” have been identified on how the Covid-19 virus might have been introduced among humans: direct zoonotic spillover; introduction through intermediary host species; food chain, frozen food products, surface transmission and a laboratory-related incident.The theory that the coronavirus was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology – China’s high-security bio-safety lab visited by the team – was not given credence by the investigators. “The laboratory incident hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus into the human population,” Ben Embarek said. “Therefore, it is not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies.”The team had reached the conclusion that a lab leak should be regarded as extremely unlikely “on the basis of a serious discussion and very diligent research,” he added.“Our initial findings suggest that introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway and one that will require more studies and more specific targeted research ... The findings suggest that a laboratory incident hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus into the human population,” the WHO expert said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-virus-lab-leak-unlikely-may-have-taken-convoluted-path-to-wuhan-who-101612880097710.html

That’s almost triple the 57,555 Covid-19 deaths in 2020 reported by the government’s virus response center.In total, 2,124,479 Russians died in 2020, nearly 324,000 more than the previous year, according to the statistics service. Deaths in December were 63% higher than in the same month in 2019.The data demonstrate that the fallout from the novel coronavirus has been far worse than officials initially reported, even as President Vladimir Putin resisted locking down the country during the second, more severe wave of infections that started in the fall. Only the U.S., Brazil and Mexico have reported higher epidemic death totals so far.December was the deadliest month for Russia in the pandemic, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said in a televised briefing Monday. Preliminary data for January show “a steady decline in mortality rates” alongside a reduction in infections, she said.Russia’s population shrank overall by nearly 700,000 people last year, the statistics service reported, more than twice the decline registered in 2019 and the worst shrinkage since 2005.The figures are a blow to Putin’s long-held goal of reversing Russia’s demographic decline. He has promoted a series of benefits aimed at increasing the birthrate and has overseen dramatic gains in life expectancy.Vaccine HopesRussia has pinned its hopes for taming the pandemic on domestically developed vaccines, with Putin ordering universal access to the inoculation in December, though take-up remains slow. He boasted at a televised meeting on science Monday that Russia is the only country in the world with three of its own Covid-19 vaccines.February or March could be the turning point after which the pandemic could begin to ease, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said Jan. 29 in northwestern Russia, according to Tass news service. The authorities aim to vaccinate about 60% of the adult population in the first half of the year, he said.Even before the vaccine is widely distributed, the infection rate has been falling. New daily cases are down by about a third from their December highs, and some regions have begun to ease restrictions intended to limit the spread of the virus.In Moscow, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has allowed restaurants and bars to stay open all night long and dropped a requirement that employers keep at least 30% of their workers home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-raises-covid-19-death-toll-in-2020-by-nearly-threefold-101612879620338.html
09-02-2021||World||US carrier groups conduct drills in South China Sea amid tensions||Two US aircraft carrier groups, comprising dozens of warships and at least 120 fighter aircraft, conducted joint exercises in the South China Sea on Tuesday, days after an American battleship sailed near Chinese-controlled islands in the disputed waters. China criticised the exercise as a “show of force” and vowed to safeguard peace in the disputed maritime zone.Ships and aircraft of the Theodore Roosevelt and the Nimitz carrier strike groups “coordinated operations in a highly trafficked area to demonstrate the US Navy’s ability to operate in challenging environments”, the US Navy said in a statement. “As a part of dual carrier operations, the strike groups conducted a multitude of exercises aimed at increasing interoperability between assets as well as command and control capabilities.”The last time the US Navy conducted dual carrier operations in the South China Sea was in July 2020, when Ronald Reagan and Nimitz carrier strike groups twice operated together in the South China Sea, it added.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the frequent moves by US warships and aircraft into the South China Sea in a “show of force” was not conducive to regional peace and stability.“China will continue to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and security and work with countries in the region to firmly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea,” Wang added.Tuesday’s exercise comes days after China condemned the sailing of the destroyer, the USS John S McCain, near the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands (Xisha in Chinese) in what Washington calls a freedom of navigation operation - the first such mission by the US Navy since President Joe Biden took office last month.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, which are disputed by several maritime neighbours including the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan, which China says is a breakaway region.“Working cooperatively alongside Carrier Strike Group Nine (CSG Theodore Roosevelt) improves our collective tactical skill while ensuring regional stability and security,” said Rear Adm Jim Kirk, commander, Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11.“We are committed to ensuring the lawful use of the sea that all nations enjoy under international law,” Kirk was quoted in the navy statement as saying.Spokesperson Wang also reacted to the French defence minister Florence Parly’s announcement that a French nuclear attack submarine was among two navy ships that recently conducted a patrol through the South China Sea.“The SNA Emeraude was accompanied by support ship BSAM Seine for the passage,” Parly said on Twitter late on Monday.“This extraordinary patrol has just completed a passage in the SCS. A striking proof of the capacity of our French Navy to deploy far away and for a long time together with our Australian, American and Japanese strategic partners,” she tweeted along with a picture of the two vessels at sea.Responding to it, Wang said there was no problem with the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. China has always respected the freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in the South China Sea in accordance with international law.However, China opposes any country’s freedom of navigation in the name of endangering China’s sovereignty and security and undermining regional peace and tranquillity, Wang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carrier-groups-conduct-drills-in-south-china-sea-amid-tensions-101612877817456.html
09-02-2021||World||WHO's Wuhan team identifies two ‘most likely' scenarios of Covid-19 transmission to humans||A team of experts investigating the origin of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan has identified two most likely scenarios that caused the transmission of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to the human population. World Health Organisation (WHO) expert Peter Ben Embarek on Tuesday told a press briefing that the team probed four hypotheses around the transmission of coronavirus to human population and narrowed down on two most likely scenarios, including the one involving intermediary host species."Our initial findings suggest that the introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway and one way that will require more studies and more specific targeted research," said Embarek.During the initial days of Covid-19 outbreak, preliminary studies had suggested that the bats could be the source since the coronavirus present in bats has a genome that is 96 per cent identical to SARS-CoV-2. An intermediary host species has been considered the most likely pathway for such viruses because the bat coronavirus cannot bind to receptors in human lung cells.Read | 'No indication of Covid-19 spread in Wuhan before Dec 2019': WHO teamEmbarek, the head of the WHO-led team in Wuhan, also highlighted the possibility of transmission through the trade of frozen products. The WHO’s food safety scientist said that virus can survive in frozen environments but added that the possibility of cold chain transmission of coronavirus warrants further investigation."We know the virus can survive in conditions that are found in these cold, frozen environments, but we don't really understand if the virus can transmit to humans," he told the briefing that lasted nearly 170 minutes.China has often pushed the hypothesis of cold chain transmission and repeatedly announced findings of coronavirus traces on imported food packaging. Embarek stressed that investigation into the second scenario would require a study to find out whether a frozen wild animal in a market setting could spread the virus under right conditions.The WHO expert said that the third hypothesis of direct transmission from an animal reservoir to a human, also known as “direct zoonotic spillover”, is a possible pathway and generating “recommendation for future studies.” He dismissed the possibility of the laboratory-related incident as the least likely scenario. "Findings suggest that the laboratory hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus to the human population," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-identifies-two-most-likely-scenarios-of-covid-19-transmission-to-humans-101612876222004.html
09-02-2021||World||EU urges governments to think green, digital before recovery plan launch||The European Commission urged governments on Tuesday to make a genuine effort to focus on digitalisation of their economies and fighting climate change in designing reforms and investments financed by EU grants as part of the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis.The European Parliament is set to approve later on Tuesday hundreds of billions of euros in EU grants and loans for Europe's recovery from the pandemic.But officials have said draft reform and investment plans submitted to the Commission show a bias towards spending, rather than structural reform, and some lack original ideas to transform economies to match the EU's ambitions to make the bloc's economy more green and digital over the coming years."We need a proper balance between reforms and investment. The plans must also match our joint ambition to accelerate the green and digital transitions," European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told parliament on Tuesday."Member States need to include genuine green and digital reforms and investments to match the targets."Under the plan, agreed by EU leaders last July, governments will jointly borrow and repay 750 billion euros for the recovery effort, on top of trillions of national fiscal stimulus.Of that unprecedented joint debt plan, 672.5 billion will be distributed among EU countries in grants and loans and the rest will go to joint EU projects to deal with the consequences of the pandemic and to prepare for future health emergencies.TAKING REFORM SERIOUSLYThe European Commission will be in charge of disbursements of the 312.5 billion euros in grants and 360 billion in loans to governments, which have to prepare plans of reforms and investment and get Commission approval.The parliamentary consent on Tuesday will pave the way for governments to start formally applying for the money later this month until the end of April, and for first disbursements around the middle of the year.Crucially, the scheme gives the Commission leverage to make governments treat more seriously its annual recommendations for reforms from pensions and public finances to labour markets, the judiciary, public administration and competitiveness."The plans should not include a patchwork of small measures with little impact," Dombrovskis said. "Instead, they should reflect a clear strategy for embracing the twin transitions and implementing reforms in line with the country-specific recommendations."Some EU parliamentarians pointed out that draft plans of the EU's biggest members Germany and France were not very ambitious on reforms, which could set a bad example for smaller countries that look up to Berlin and Paris for guidance."The German government is cutting corners by 'repackaging' investments it already announced in the summer 2020 instead of setting new impulses," German MEP Damian Boeselager said."Germany is already mimicked by France in following this strategy of minimising political risks by repackaging investments and ignoring the Commission's reform recommendations."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-urges-governments-to-think-green-digital-before-recovery-plan-launch-101612876343454.html
09-02-2021||World||Tel Aviv gives foreign nationals, asylum seekers Covid shots||Dozens of asylum seekers and foreign workers in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv lined up to receive their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday as part of an initiative to inoculate the city's foreign nationals.Tel Aviv city hall and the Sourasky Medical Center started administering vaccines free of charge to the city's foreign nationals, many of whom are undocumented asylum seekers.On its first day of operation, the vaccination center in southern Tel Aviv, which is home to a large migrant community, dispensed doses to dozens of foreign nationals who lined up outside the building. Posters provided information in English, Tigrinya, Russian and Arabic. Recipients included foreign workers from the Philippines, Moldova, and Nigeria, as well as Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers.Garipelly Srinivas Goud, an Indian national who has worked in Israel for eight years, said that some foreign workers in Israel don't have money or insurance to afford paying privately for the vaccine, and said the vaccine drive was a "very good decision. I am very happy.”Eytan Schwartz, a Tel Aviv municipality spokesman, said it was the government's responsibility “to vaccinate everybody within the nation’s borders” and that it would take the next step and start “to vaccinate the illegal or undocumented asylum seekers as well.”Israel has pushed to inoculate most of its population since late December. Last week it made vaccines available to all citizens over the age of 16.It has thus far delivered over 3.5 million first doses of the Pfizer vaccine and at least 2.1 million second doses. It has also started providing the Palestinian Authority with thousands of vaccines for healthcare workers.On Sunday, Israel started easing some of its lockdown restrictions that had been in place for over a month in an effort to clamp down on the spread of the coronavirus.Infection rates in Israel remain high. The country has recorded over 700,000 cases of the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic last year. At least 5,192 people have died of the disease, according to Health Ministry figures published on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tel-aviv-gives-foreign-nationals-asylum-seekers-covid-shots-101612875149049.html
09-02-2021||World||Biden budget nominee Neera Tanden faces two tough hearings this week||Neera Tanden, US President Joe Biden's nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), faces what will likely be two contentious confirmation hearings this week, where Senate Republicans are expected to grill her about attacks on members of their party on social media.Tanden, 50, will appear at confirmation hearings on Tuesday before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and on Wednesday before the Budget Committee.When Biden picked Tanden, chief executive of the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank, in November, Republicans pointed to her past strong comments on Twitter, such as referring to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell as "Moscow Mitch," implying that he was working for Russia, or calling Republican Senator Susan Collins "criminally ignorant."However, now that Democrats control the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break a tie, Tanden can get the 51 votes needed to become OMB director even if she wins no Republican support in the 100-member chamber.In prepared testimony, Tanden acknowledged that part of her role at the think tank was to be "an impassioned advocate," but she knew that directing the OMB would be different. "I understand, though, that the role of OMB Director calls for bipartisan action, as well as nonpartisan adherence to fact and evidence," her statement said.The Senate is also scheduled on Tuesday to begin the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, who is accused of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the US Capitol.Before her stint at the Center for American Progress, Tanden served in the administration of former Democratic President Bill Clinton. She also helped create former Democratic President Barack Obama's "Affordable Care Act" health insurance plan, which Republicans have tried repeatedly to repeal.She would be the first woman of color to serve as director of the OMB, which acts as the gatekeeper for the $4 trillion federal budget.Tanden has been viewed as Biden's most controversial nominee, attacked not just by Republicans but also criticized by some of the most left-leaning Democrats for being insufficiently progressive.Democrats scoffed at Republican concern about Tanden's past tweets - many of which have been deleted. They called such concern hypocritical in light of Republican support for former President Donald Trump, who was known for blasting not just Democrats but members of his own party - particularly women - as "nasty" or criminals who should be locked up.Democrats praised Tanden as experienced and qualified. "She understands the everyday needs of working and middle class families and has devoted her career in public service and public policy to building a better economy that works for all Americans," Senator Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement after meeting with her.Tanden also has been criticized from the left over her support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rather than Senator Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic presidential race.Sanders has not said publicly whether he will support Tanden's nomination. But the senator, who is now chairman of the Budget Committee, is unlikely to have scheduled her confirmation hearing if he were strongly opposed to her selection.A Sanders spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-budget-nominee-neera-tanden-faces-two-tough-hearings-this-week-101612873577147.html
09-02-2021||World||Does the world need new Covid-19 vaccines? 'Jury is out', Oxford's Pollard says||It is not yet clear whether the world needs a new set of vaccines to fight different variants of the novel coronavirus but scientists are working on new ones so there is no reason for alarm, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group said on Tuesday.South Africa has paused a planned rollout of AstraZeneca's vaccines after data showed it gave minimal protection against mild infection among young people from the dominant variant there, stoking fears of a much longer battle with the pathogen.AstraZeneca and Oxford University aim to produce a next generation of vaccines that will protect against variants as soon as the autumn before the Northern Hemisphere winter, AstraZeneca's research chief said this month."There are definitely new questions about variants that we're going to be addressing. And one of those is: do we need new vaccines?," Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, told BBC radio."I think the jury is out on that at the moment, but all developers are preparing new vaccines so if we do need them, we'll have them available to be able to protect people."Vaccines are seen as the swiftest path out of the Covid-19 crisis which has killed 2.33 million people and turned normal life upside down for billions.Researchers from the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Oxford said in a prior-to-peer analysis that the AstraZeneca vaccine provided minimal protection against mild or moderate infection from the South African variant among young people.Target populationProtection against moderate-severe disease, hospitalisation or death could not be assessed in the study of around 2,000 volunteers who had a median age of 31 as the target population were at such low risk, the researchers said."I think there's clearly a risk of confidence in the way that people may perceive you. But as I say I don't think that there is any reason for alarm today," Pollard said."The really important question is about severe disease and we didn't study that in South Africa, because that wasn't the point of that study, we were specifically asking questions about young adults."The so called South African variant, known by scientists as 20I/501Y.V2 or B.1.351, is the dominant one in South Africa and is circulating in 41 countries around the world including the United States.Other major variants include the so-called UK variant, or 20I/501Y.V1, and the Brazilian variant known as P.1.An analysis of infections by the South African variant showed there was only a 22% lower risk of developing mild-to-moderate COVID-19 if vaccinated with the AstraZeneca shot versus those given a placebo.If vaccines do not work as effectively as hoped against new and emerging variants, the world could be facing a much longer - and more expensive - battle against the virus than previously thought."As long as we have enough immunity to prevent severe disease, hospitalisations and death then we're going to be fine in the future in the pandemic," Pollard said.Pollard said the South African government was right to look at how it deployed the AstraZeneca vaccine because the original plan was to use it in young adults - particularly healthcare workers - who were not expected to get severe disease."It needs a relook at how best to deploy the vaccine," Pollard said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/does-the-world-need-new-covid-19-vaccines-jury-is-out-oxford-s-pollard-says-101612869992387.html
09-02-2021||World||WHO official leading Wuhan Covid-19 probe says cold-chain transmission possible||The head of the World Health Organization-led team in the central Chinese city of Wuhan probing the origins of Covid-19 said on Tuesday that cold chain transmission of the virus is a possibility and warrants further investigation.'Cold chain' refers to the transport and trade of frozen food. China has pushed the idea that the virus can be transmitted by frozen food and has repeatedly announced findings of coronavirus traces on imported food packaging.However, Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO specialist in animal diseases who leads the independent group of experts, also said the team's nearly month-long investigation in Wuhan had not dramatically changed the picture of the outbreak."We know the virus can survive in conditions that are found in these cold, frozen environments, but we don't really understand if the virus can transmit to humans" or under which conditions, he told the briefing.Embarek said it would be worthwhile to explore whether a frozen wild animal in a market setting with the right conditions could be conducive to rapid spread of the virus.He said that work to identify the origins of the coronavirus points to a natural reservoir in bats, but it is unlikely that they were in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak was first identified in late 2019.He also said investigators were looking at whether the virus was circulating earlier than first thought, and that blood samples needed to be found to conduct further research.The possibility that the virus leaked from a lab - another hypothesis - was extremely unlikely and did not require further study, Embarek told the briefing.The team arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 14 and after two weeks of quarantine, visited key sites including the Huanan seafood market, the location of the first known cluster of infections, as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has been involved in coronavirus research.Members of the team have sought to rein in expectations about the mission, with zoologist Peter Daszak telling Reuters last week that one of their aims was to "identify the next steps to fill in the gaps".Another team member, infectious disease expert Dominic Dwyer, said it would probably take years to fully understand the origins of Covid-19.The United States said China needed to be more open when it comes to sharing data and samples as well as allowing access to patients, medical staff and lab workers. Beijing subsequently accused Washington of politicizing a scientific mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-official-leading-wuhan-covid-19-probe-says-cold-chain-transmission-possible-101612870921432.html
09-02-2021||World||Explainer: Is Donald Trump's post-presidency impeachment trial constitutional?||The impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting last month's deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol will begin on Tuesday with arguments over whether the proceedings are constitutional.Trump's legal team has argued the trial is improper under the U.S. Constitution because Trump is now a private citizen, and 45 Senate Republicans cast votes to that effect on Jan. 26. But many legal experts disagree, and there are likely not enough votes in the Democratic-controlled chamber to halt the trial based on that argument.Is there a consensus on whether Trump’s post-presidency trial is legal?No, but the majority of experts say it is constitutional to have an impeachment trial after an official has left office, said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University and leading impeachment scholar.Kalt was part of a bipartisan group of roughly 150 lawyers who signed a letter arguing that Trump can still be convicted in an impeachment trial.Signatories of the letter included the co-founder and other members of the Federalist Society, a legal group that wields influence in conservative politics.“We differ from one another in our politics, and we also differ from one another on issues of constitutional interpretation,” said the Jan. 21 letter. “But despite our differences, our carefully considered views of the law lead all of us to agree that the Constitution permits the impeachment, conviction, and disqualification of former officers, including presidents.”Charles Cooper, an influential conservative lawyer in Washington, endorsed their arguments in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece.Other scholars disagree, including J. Michael Luttig, a prominent lawyer and former federal appeals court judge, and Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor.What does the Constitution say?Under the Constitution, the president “shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”In a separate clause, the Constitution says conviction can lead to “removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.”Removing an official requires a “conviction” by a two-thirds Senate majority under the Constitution. Under precedent, only a simple majority is needed for disqualification. Historically, that vote only happens after a conviction.What is the main argument for “late impeachment”?Many experts believe that presidents who commit misconduct late in their terms should not be immune from the very process the Constitution created for holding them accountable.Since the Constitution makes clear that impeachment proceedings can result in disqualification from holding future office, there is a live issue for the Senate to resolve even though Trump is no longer president, those scholars argue.What is the argument against holding the trial now?Luttig has said that the text and purpose of the Constitution make clear that the Senate’s power is limited to convicting a sitting president.Historical texts indicate that the nation’s founders saw impeachment as a way to remove officials from their jobs so they do not further harm the country, Luttig and Turley argue.Trump's lawyers made similar arguments in a pretrial brief on Monday, saying the Senate "is being asked to do something patently ridiculous: try a private citizen in a process that is designed to remove him from an office that he no longer holds."Is there historical precedent?There are two instances in which the Senate held impeachment trials for officials after they had left office — Senator William Blount in 1797 and Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. Blount’s trial was halted before the Senate could decide its verdict and Belknap was acquitted.Luttig has argued that Congress’ earlier interpretation of its power is just one factor to consider and does not have the same significance as a court decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-is-donald-trump-s-post-presidency-impeachment-trial-constitutional-101612869373788.html
09-02-2021||World||Iran may pursue nuclear weapon, intel minister warns West||Iran’s intelligence minister has warned the West that his country could push for a nuclear weapon if crippling international sanctions on Tehran remain in place, state television reported Tuesday.The remarks by Mahmoud Alavi mark a rare occasion that a government official says Iran could reverse its course on the nuclear program. Tehran has long insisted that the program is for peaceful purposes only.A 1990s fatwa, or religious edict, by the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei states that nuclear weapons are forbidden.“Our nuclear program is peaceful and the fatwa by the supreme leader has forbidden nuclear weapons, but if they push Iran in that direction, then it wouldn’t be Iran’s fault but those who pushed it,” Alavi was quoted as saying.“If a cat is cornered, it may show a kind of behavior that a free cat would not,” he said and added that Iran has no plans to move toward a nuclear weapon under current circumstances.The 81-year-old Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters of state in Iran, on Sunday urged the United States to lift all sanctions if it wants Iran to live up to commitments under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. However, President Joe Biden has said the U.S. won’t be making the first move.Following the killing last December of an Iranian scientist credited with spearheading the country’s disbanded military nuclear program, Iran’s parliament has approved a law to block international nuclear inspectors later this month — a serious violation of the accord.Alavi, the intelligence minister, was also quoted as saying that a member of the Iranian armed forces “facilitated” the killing of the scientist, which Iran has blamed on Israel.The minister did not expand on what he meant — and it was not clear if the soldier had carried out the explosion that killed the scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Israel, which has been suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists over the last decade, has repeatedly declined to comment on the attack.This was the first time that Iran acknowledged a member of its armed forces may have acted as an accomplice in the killing of Fakhrizadeh, who headed Iran’s so-called AMAD program, which Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon.The International Atomic Energy Agency — the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog — says that “structured program” ended in 2003. U.S. intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report.However, Israel insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran’s ballistic missile program and research into other technologies.In December Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani vowed to avenge Fakhrizadeh's killing, saying his country will decide time or venue of any retaliatory action.In response to former President Donald Trump’s so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, the country began to gradually violate its atomic commitments under the nuclear deal, and threatened further provocations in a bid to increase its leverage and get Biden to prioritize a return to the deal as he moves to dismantle Trump’s legacy.As part of those steps, Iran has begun enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels and said it would experiment with uranium metals, a key component of a nuclear warhead. Iran insists that all breaches of the pact are easily reversible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-may-pursue-nuclear-weapon-intel-minister-warns-west-101612868253848.html

It's stable but high...It does not call for national lockdown measures," Veran said.The number of people in France who have died from Covid-19 infections rose by 458 on Monday to 79,423 - the seventh-highest death toll globally.Unlike some of its neighbours, France has refrained from imposing a third national lockdown, hoping that a curfew in place since Dec. 15 and a vaccination programme that has now given shots to more than 2 million people will be enough to rein in the spread of the disease.Veran said he expected that between 3.5 milllion and 4 million people in France would have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of February.Some health officials have however warned about the strain being placed on the hospital system and the impact of more contagious variants of the coronavirus.Veran reiterated that the AstraZeneca's vaccine was efficient against 99% of the Covid-19 strains in France but that France was considering using vaccines other than AstraZeneca's vaccine for overseas territories."We are monitoring the progression of the South African variant, notably in {the French island of) Mayotte. We are considering increasing the protection of health workers in overseas territories," he saidSouth Africa decided to put on hold use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot in its vaccination programme after data showed it gave minimal protection against mild-to-moderate infection caused by the country's dominant coronavirus variant.Health authorities reported 4,317 new confirmed Covid-19 cases in France on Monday, down from 19,715 on Sunday and 4,347 last Monday. The number of people in hospital with the virus went up by 343, to 28,037.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-was-right-to-decide-against-new-national-lockdown-against-covid-health-minister-101612863787941.html

Once bitter foes, Cohen and Daniels were seen talking about Trump’s departure from office and sharing their experiences with each other."Both of our stories will be forever linked with Donald Trump, but also with one another," Cohen said to Daniels.Cohen also apologised to Daniels for the pain he caused her while working for Trump. "Thanks for giving me a second chance," he said.Daniels, an adult film star, was infamously paid $130,000 by Cohen before the 2016 presidential election as hush money to keep her alleged affair with Trump a secret. Federal prosecutors charged Cohen with flouting campaign contribution rules by arranging the hush-money payment to Daniels and a very similar payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal. He pleaded guilty to both of those counts as well as lying to Congress and tax evasion and was sentenced to three years in federal prison. He was released in May 2020.Now, as Cohen is no longer associated with the former president, he gave a platform to Daniels to tell her story about the alleged sexual encounter with Trump.A repentant Cohen said, “My battle is just now starting. People are really upset, and they’re just going to get more pissed off at me.”The hour-long interview included graphic descriptions by Daniels of her 2006 sexual encounter with Trump which she called "the worst 90 seconds of my life, for sure, because it just made me hate myself."Daniels also said that she regretted her links with Trump and if she had a choice to go back and change everything, she “would absolutely do that.”Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued Trump for defamation after he denied her allegations. She told Cohen, "I've already lost everything, so I'm taking it all the way."For Cohen, the remorse is different.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mea-culpa-stormy-daniels-talks-about-donald-trump-encounter-in-cohen-podcast-101612865456502.html
09-02-2021||World||Joe Biden's presidency starts with a giant bet on run-it-hot economics||Joe Biden’s administration has dedicated its first few weeks in office to spending more money on pandemic relief -- and shrugged off warnings that the economy may overheat as a result.If the president sticks to his guns, it could mark another milestone in the great policy rethink that got under way after the 2008 financial crisis.Biden’s $1.9 trillion aid plan would be the second-largest injection of federal cash in US history. Only last year’s Cares Act was bigger -- but that came at the start of the pandemic, when the deepest recession in decades lay directly ahead.The next round of fiscal support, by contrast, will flow into an economy that’s already bounced much of the way back.Millions of Americans, especially among low-income groups, are still suffering the full effects of the slump, and that’s why the government says another round of spending is vital. But aggregate numbers show that production of goods and services isn’t too far short of pre-pandemic output -- thanks in part to households still flush from the last round of checks.Vaccines may soon make it easier for Americans to spend all that cash. When they do, some form of inflation won’t be far behind, the skeptics say.It’s a prospect that, not long ago, would have set off alarm bells all over.For decades, the managers of the US economy had a cautionary bias. Central bankers worried that prices might spike at any time. Budget officials fretted that deficits would get out of hand, trigger the bond vigilantes and send interest rates soaring. Both stood permanently on guard, ready to ward off such threats with tighter policy.The result was an economy that expanded at below its potential growth rate in three-quarters of the years since 1980, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It grew steadily more unequal over that period too.Since the financial crisis and the lackluster recovery that followed it, policy makers and economists have slowly come round to a different view. In effect, they’ve decided that it makes more sense to fight today’s problems with all the firepower they have, instead of trying to pre-empt tomorrow’s.“There were a lot of people who cried wolf over the aggressive stimulus back in 2009,” even though it now looks timid with hindsight, said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. “There was a lot of worrying about much higher inflation, and maybe a run on the currency, and a number of fairly alarmist scenarios -- none of which played out.” That’s one reason US leaders were ready to “really go all out” in the pandemic, said Hatzius, who thinks the experiment has been a success and sees no reason for Biden to hit the brakes just yet. “I do think there are fiscal limits, but I don’t think we’re that close to those fiscal limits,” he said. “We have quite a lot of room to grow.”By some measures, the US economy is far from completing its virus recovery.Almost 10 million fewer Americans were working last month than in February 2020. With unemployment that high, an administration committed to fighting inequality is unlikely to withdraw budget support anytime soon, according to Morgan Stanley.‘High-Pressure Economy’The Biden administration and the Federal Reserve now share the goal of a “high-pressure economy” that pulls low-income workers back into employment, and won’t take their foot off the gas till they get there, the bank’s economists wrote last week. They contrasted that approach with the one taken a decade ago, when fiscal tightening began with a jobless rate still close to 10%.But while employment lags, production of goods and services has climbed back much closer to its pre-virus peak. Hatzius and the Morgan Stanley analysts are among those who expect output to reach that level by June -– and then power past it.Household savings surged in 2020 as expanded benefits replaced lost earnings for millions of Americans while lockdowns left consumers short of spending options.All of that makes for a combustible mix into which to throw another $1.9 trillion of stimulus, according to the overheating camp. Some worry that people who retained their jobs will get cash transfers they don’t really need, and plough the money into financial markets -- contributing to bubbles like the one in GameStop Corp. shares.Others cite a measure known as the output gap, the difference between what the economy is actually producing and the maximum it could sustainably manage. The CBO estimates a shortfall of some $700 billion through 2023.Biden is proposing to spend two to three times the amount needed to close that gap, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. It said the results could include higher inflation and an economy hooked on stimulus.Perhaps more surprisingly, Larry Summers -– a top official in the last two Democratic administrations and a longtime advocate of more active fiscal policy –- weighed in with a similar warning. Summers, who’s also a paid Bloomberg contributor, said the extra spending combined with a successful vaccine rollout could result in “an economy that is literally on fire.”Output gaps are one of those economic concepts, like full employment, that essentially involve guesswork. They’re based on projecting the economy’s potential, which nobody really knows until it’s put to the test.That point was repeatedly driven home in the years before the pandemic. Policy makers were surprised when unemployment kept falling without triggering inflation. Many economists said Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, an unorthodox effort to juice an already growing economy with fiscal stimulus, would drive interest rates and inflation higher, but they didn’t.Administration officials lined up last week to dismiss the idea that their bill could push the economy past some notional speed limit, and explain that what they’re trying to provide is more relief than stimulus.“This package was built from the ground up,” by calculating the needs of workers, families, schools and health services, said Heather Boushey of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. “There is deep unused capacity in this economy,” said another council member, Jared Bernstein.Ambitious PlansThe debate about overheating probably isn’t going away, because the virus package is just the start of Biden’s spending plans. He’s also pledged $2 trillion for clean energy, and almost $1.5 trillion for manufacturing and childcare. Those investments, unlike the transfer payments in the virus package, should expand the economy’s productive capacity -- addressing one of the concerns raised by Summers.But Biden’s Democrats hold the narrowest of Senate majorities, which could put his post-Covid-19 agenda at risk if the economy comes roaring back and enthusiasm for big-ticket spending wanes.That makes it good politics as well as good economics to pass the biggest relief package that’s possible right now, according to the high-pressure camp.“You don’t get an endless number of opportunities to do major bills,” said J.W.

They included reportedly PTI's telephone operator (Tahir Iqbal), computer operator (Muhammad Nauman Afzal), accountant (Mohammad Arshad) and PTI's office helper (Mohammad Rafiq).The decision to allow the PTI employees to collect the funds was taken at a meeting held on July 1, 2011. It was attended by Saifullah Niazi, the incumbent chief organiser and an aspirant of a PTI Senate ticket; Aamer Mahmud Kiani, present secretary-general and former health minister who was removed from the federal cabinet; Dr Humayun Mohmand, who was recently appointed chairman of the board of directors of PIMS; Sardar Azhar Tariq Khan, the party's former finance secretary and now Pakistan's Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan; Colonel Yunus Ali Raza, and Tariq R Sheikh, reported Dawn.The foreign funding case pertains to Akbar S Babar's allegations that foreign donations were illegally received in the front accounts of PTI employees through Hundi, particularly from the Middle East, and siphoned off by the senior party leadership through cheques with no trace or record. Babar was the founding member of PTI.He has repeatedly asked the scrutiny committee of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to investigate the private bank accounts of PTI employees which were illegally used as a front to collect donations.The committee continues to keep the PTI records and bank statements secret despite ECP orders. The records include 23 PTI bank accounts provided to the ECP by scheduled banks on the instructions of the State Bank of Pakistan, reported Dawn.The scrutiny committee will meet on Tuesday (today) to decide whether to keep the PTI documents secret or not. The ECP has passed more than one order against the secrecy of the PTI record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-s-party-allowed-paid-employees-to-receive-funds-reveals-document-101612864186625.html

The country also expects to receive more than 4 million doses of AstraZeneca's shot.Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has banned the health ministry from importing U.S.- and British-made vaccines, which he said were unreliable and may be used to spread the infection to other nations. Officials have refrained from referring to the Anglo-Swedish Astrazeneca’s British ties.Iran is participating in the COVAX scheme, co-led by the World Health Organization, that aims to secure fair access to vaccines for poorer countries.Iran has recorded nearly 1.5 million Covid-19 cases and 58,536 deaths, with the death toll of 67 on Monday standing at an eight-month low, according to health ministry data.Tehran launched human trials of the first of its three domestic vaccine candidates in late December, saying this could help it defeat the pandemic despite US sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-starts-covid-19-vaccination-awaits-more-vaccine-deliveries-101612861972433.html
09-02-2021||World||China witnesses 15% decline in registered newborn babies in 2020||The number of newborn babies in China registered with the police fell by double digits last year, a sign that the birthrate is continuing to decline and worsening demographic pressures in the rapidly aging nation.There were a total of 10.04 million babies registered with the government in 2020, 14.8% lower than in 2019, according to data released by the Ministry of Public Security on Monday.The figures are usually lower than the actual number of births in the country as some parents don’t immediately register their children. In 2019, there were 11.79 million babies registered and 14.65 million children born. The statistics bureau will release official birth data in April.The country’s population is aging more quickly than most of the world’s developed economies, a hangover from decades of family planning policies. China has struggled to arrest the country’s declining birthrate for years, even after easing its stringent one-child policy in 2013 and allowing each family to have two children in 2016.The Communist Party has signaled willingness to further relax birth restrictions during the 14th Five-Year Plan period that starts this year, urging an “inclusive” fertility policy at a Party conclave held in late October. The annual birthrate in 2019 dropped to the lowest level since at least 1949.“Becoming old before becoming rich, rapid aging together with a super-sized elderly population, these will be important features of China’s national conditions for a relatively long period of time to come,” Cai Fang, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in a commentary in the official Beijing Daily in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-witnesses-15-decline-in-registered-newborn-babies-in-2020-101612863378459.html

The submarine's antenna mast and other upper parts were slightly damaged but it was able to continue sailing.Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said the submarine was carrying out routine training when it saw the commercial vessel through its periscope but was unable to avoid it in time.As the submarine's communications equipment was damaged in the collision, there was an hours-long delay in reporting the incident by mobile phone, he added.The Japan Transport Safety Board said it has started a probe into the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japanese-submarine-collides-with-commercial-vessel-while-surfacing-in-pacific-101612862272520.html
09-02-2021||World||China’s CanSino Covid- 19 vaccine shows 65.7% efficacy||CanSino Biologics Inc.’s experimental coronavirus vaccine has an efficacy rate of 65.7% at preventing symptomatic cases based on an analysis from late-stage trials, adding a one-shot candidate to the world’s growing arsenal against Covid-19.The inoculation co-developed by the Chinese military and the Tianjin-based biotech company proved effective against symptomatic Covid-19, based on a multi-country analysis first posted on Twitter by Faisal Sultan, Pakistan’s health adviser, on Monday. CanSino later forwarded Sultan’s announcement in a statement. The final stage trial included 30,000 participants and was also 90.98% effective in preventing severe disease, Sultan said.A vaccine needs to afford at least a 50% protection rate to be considered effective, as mandated by the world’s leading drug regulators and the World Health Organization. While CanSino’s data seems at first glance lower than the 95% protection rate provided by shots from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., it requires just one shot, not two.That means it’s more accurately compared to Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, the only other single shot that has released final stage testing data. That vaccine was found to be 66% effective in a global trial.While their efficacy numbers are lower, single-shot vaccines offer some advantages over the cutting-edge mRNA inoculations from Pfizer and Moderna. The mRNA two-dose shots require deep-freeze storage and risk spoiling if thawed too quickly, creating distribution hurdles. CanSino and J&J’s candidates are easier to store and don’t require people to return at a set time for the second jab -- something that’s hard to guarantee especially in developing countries.“A 70% effective single-dose vaccine may be more valuable than a two-dose regimen with 90% efficacy and greater implementation challenges,” a group of experts advising the World Health Organization on vaccines wrote in an article last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.Among two-dose regimens, China’s vaccines have fallen behind western and Russian peers. The shot developed by the state-owned China National Biotec Group Co., a unit of Sinopharm, was shown to be 78% effective, while one from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. had a 50.38% rate in a trial involving high-risk medical workers. Russia’s Sputnik V showed efficacy of 91.6%, matching the stellar efficacy of the mRNA shots.Trials for AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine resulted in an average of 70% from two different dosing regimes.Efficacy ParadeThe parade of efficacy reports has resulted in a steadily growing arsenal of inoculations as drugmakers and governments have sped up the vaccine development process to fight the pandemic. CanSino adds another successful candidate from Chinese developers, who have played catch-up with Western rivals in finishing Phase III trials after an early lead in the process.As richer nations secure the first supplies and the WHO-backed Covax initiative that many developing countries were relying on for vaccines has not yet started, China is filling the void by donating its vaccines to poorer places.CanSino has agreed to supply 35 million doses to Mexico while Malaysia is in talks to get 3.5 million shots. Pakistan, where one of CanSino’s biggest trials is being conducted, will get 20 million shots. Pakistan’s efficacy at preventing symptomatic cases is 74.8%, Sultan said, adding that a tranche of vaccines had been sent by China’s army to his country’s military.The doses have “been dedicated in its entirety for use in our national vaccine drive to protect health workers in the frontline,” he said.The company is also working to get approval from the WHO so that its vaccine can be procured and distributed through the Covax program.The company is said to have reached an agreement to run another trial in Russia to see whether swapping the second dose of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine with that from CanSino would produce the same or better protection against Covid-19. Russia has faced production challenges for Sputnik’s second shot, which uses the same adenovirus vector to deliver the coronavirus antigen that CanSino does.Strong StartCanSino’s so-called viral vector vaccine, which loads an antigen from the coronavirus on a harmless cold-causing pathogen called adenovirus, was the first in the world to start human clinical trials back in March as China mobilized its drug regulators, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies in an all-out effort to develop tools against the coronavirus.CanSino got off to a strong start, outpacing western rivals including Pfizer and AstraZeneca in pushing its shot through early human testing. Yet it got caught in growing tensions between China and Canada, with a planned trial in the North American country indefinitely delayed.Meanwhile, the near elimination of the virus in China forced CanSino and other Chinese vaccine frontrunners to embark on a time-consuming search for testing sites for Phase III trials in other parts of the world.The company eventually started those tests in Pakistan, Russia, Argentine, Mexico and Chile, when Western frontrunners were already close to reporting interim results.Chinese vaccines have faced some skepticism because of confusion over efficacy rates and a lack of transparency, as the developers have disclosed less safety and testing information than western front-runners. The issues have threatened to undermine trust in shots that President Xi Jinping has promised to share with the rest of the world as a global public good.They are nonetheless being rolled out across Asia, the Middle East and South America, with endorsements from heads of state. Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to get the CanSino shot, while Indonesian President Joko Widodo received Sinovac’s vaccine in a televised ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-cansino-covid-19-vaccine-shows-65-7-efficacy-101612851279629.html

09-02-2021||World||Facebook, Twitter outpaced by smaller platforms in fight against harmful content||Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet's YouTube made smaller strides than their social media rivals including TikTok and Reddit at battling harmful content such as hate speech and misinformation during the second half of 2020, a study released on Monday showed.Advertising agency IPG Mediabrands released its "Media Responsibility Index," examining how the top social media platforms performed in 10 areas including protecting children's wellbeing, providing more transparency for advertisers and combating misinformation and disinformation.Mediabrands said the American Association of Advertising Agencies has adopted its 10 principles on media responsibility.Nine social media platforms agreed to participate in the new index. Mediabrands said it saw improvements industry-wide from the first half of 2020.Facebook showed improvements in clamping down on false and misleading content, such as removing pages and groups related to the QAnon conspiracy theory.YouTube made no significant changes to misinformation policies, leading to a lower score in the category. However the platform did focus more on efforts like improving children's wellbeing, which led to a bigger advancement in the category than peers, Mediabrands said.Short-form video app TikTok made the biggest improvements out of the nine social media platforms, taking steps like partnering with outside companies to protect advertisers from appearing next to unsuitable content, and giving users better control over the types of videos they see, said Elijah Harris, global head of social at Mediabrands agency Reprise.Mediabrands' previous report found ad placements on TikTok were at higher risk for so-called brand safety issues, but TikTok made improvements after "embracing our findings with open arms," Harris said.Pinterest suspends accounts that continuously spread misinformation and Reddit prioritizes fact-checking for categories like election and health content, which helped both companies score the largest improvements in fighting false and misleading content, Mediabrands said.Mediabrands chose not to compile a final ranking of the platforms against each other to avoid giving top-scoring companies a false sense that their work is done, said Joshua Lowcock, chief digital officer at IPG agency UM."We have a classroom of students who all need to work harder," he said. "There should be no proud parents here."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-twitter-outpaced-by-smaller-platforms-in-fight-against-harmful-content-101612846091429.html
09-02-2021||World||Clubhouse users in China say service appears to be blocked||Users of red-hot social media platform Clubhouse in China said they were unable to use the app on Monday, after an explosion of discussions over the weekend on taboo topics from Taiwan to Xinjiang.Reports of users being unable to use the invite-only, audio-based app appeared on other social media platforms such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Sina Corp.’s microblogging platform Weibo. On Twitter, which is blocked in China, users claiming to be in the country posted screenshots of Clubhouse’s home screen saying that an error had occurred and that a secure connection to the server could not be made.Clubhouse had erupted among Chinese users over the weekend, with thousands joining discussions on contentious subjects undisturbed by Beijing’s censors.On the app, where users host informal conversations, Chinese-speaking communities from around the world gathered to discuss China-Taiwan relations and the prospects of unification, and to share their knowledge and experience of Beijing’s crackdown on Muslim Uighurs in the far west region of Xinjiang.“While years ago, censors might have waited until something disruptive happened, it appears authorities would rather in this case shut down this new cross-border civic space before it becomes widely available,” said Graham Webster of the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center. “The brief, highly limited opening provided a glimpse of the on line public sphere Chinese citizens enjoyed in the late 2000s before it was gradually but steadily eroded by government-enforced controls.”Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters on Tuesday that he’s not aware of the specific situation relating to Clubhouse, adding that China’s government regulates the online space in accordance to its rules and regulations. Beijing is resolute in opposing external interference, Wang also said.The Communist Party-backed Global Times on Monday criticized the growing popularity of Clubhouse, citing some Chinese users as saying political discussions on the platform were often one-sided and that pro-Chinese voices were easily suppressed.Until mainland-based users began experiencing technical difficulties, Clubhouse was gaining traction in mainland China. The hashtag #Clubhouse attracted more than 51 million views on Weibo, while the question “Why Clubhouse is so popular” generated hundreds of answers on Zhihu, a Chinese Q&A site. The surge in interest also created a new business, as dozens of stores on Alibaba’s online marketplaces appeared to be selling invitation codes to the app for as much as 288 yuan ($44.60) each.The company did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clubhouse-users-in-china-say-service-appears-to-be-blocked-101612859795724.html
09-02-2021||World||Polish pride, free speech at stake in Holocaust libel case||A Warsaw court is due to deliver a verdict Tuesday in a closely watched libel case in which one side sees Polish national pride at stake and the other the future independence of Holocaust research.Two prominent Polish scholars, Barbara Engelking and Jan Grabowski, are being sued by the 81-year-old niece of a wartime village elder who argues a book they co-edited defames her deceased uncle's memory by suggesting he had a role in the death of Jews. The uncle is mentioned in a brief passage of a 1,600-page historical work, "Night Without End: The Fate of Jews in Selected Counties of Occupied Poland.”The woman, Filomena Leszczynska, is backed by the Polish League Against Defamation, a group that fights harmful and untruthful depictions of Poland. It argues the woman’s uncle, Edward Malinowski, was a hero who helped save Jews during World War II and accuses the scholars of research errors that resulted in Malinowski appearing as someone who betrayed Jews to the Germans.Malinowski was acquitted in 1950 of being an accomplice to the killing by Germans of 18 Jews in a forest near the village of Malinowo in 1943.The anti-defamation group says the authors slandered an innocent man and deprived the niece of her rights, including the right to pride and national identity. The plaintiffs are suing Grabowski and Engelking for 100,000 zlotys ($27,000) in damages and a published apology.Grabowski, a Polish-Canadian history professor at the University of Ottawa, and Engelking, founder and director of the Polish Center for Holocaust Research in Warsaw, are among Poland's most prominent Holocaust researchers. They were among several who researched and wrote parts of the two-volume work.They view the case as an attempt to discredit their overall findings and discourage other researchers from investigating the truth about Polish involvement in the German mass murder of Jews.The plaintiffs' lawyer, Monika Brzozowska-Pasieka, denied there was any attempt to stifle research or speech. She said it was a civil case brought by people who feel they or their families have been defamed.“The ruling will determine whether the researchers properly examined the sources, made a correct assessment of these sources and applied an appropriate research methodology,” Brzozowska-Pasieka said in a statement to The Associated Press.Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany during the war and its population subjected to mass murder and slave labor. While 3 million of the country's 3.3 million Jews were murdered, so were more than 2 million mostly Christian Poles. Poles resisted the Nazis at home and abroad and never collaborated as a state with the Third Reich. Thousands of Poles have been recognized by Yad Vashem in Israel for risking their own lives to save Jews.Yet amid the more than five years of occupation, there were also some Poles who betrayed Jews to the Germans. The topic was taboo during the communist era and each new revelation of Polish wrongdoing in recent years has sparked a backlash.The libel case has raised concerns internationally because it comes amid a broader state-backed historical offensive.Last week, a journalist, Katarzyna Markusz, was questioned by police on suspicions she slandered the Polish nation, a crime with a penalty of up to three years in prison, for an article that mentioned “Polish participation in the Holocaust.”Jewish leaders in Poland issued a statement Monday saying they have seen an intensification of attempts to “repress historians and journalists ... who are trying to honestly present the fate of Polish Jews under the occupation."Poland's conservative authorities don't deny that some Poles harmed Jews, but they believe the focus on Polish wrongdoing obscures the fact that most of these killings occurred under German orders and terror. The government's pushback against what it calls a “pedagogy of shame” is popular with many Poles.The Polish League Against Defamation is ideologically aligned with the country’s ruling party, and the scholars see that as an indication the case is part of a government-backed effort to promote its historical narrative.“Night Without End” focuses of the fates of Jews who escaped as the Nazis were “liquidating” ghettos and sending inhabitants to extermination camps. It documents cases of Jews who tried to hide, with those who survived doing so thanks to the help of Poles. It also presents extensive evidence of individual Poles who collaborated in betraying Jews to the Nazis.At the center of the case is testimony given in 1996 by a Jewish woman, born Estera Siemiatycka, to the USC Shoah Foundation, a Los Angeles-based group that collects Holocaust-era oral histories. When she spoke, she had changed her name to Maria Wiltgren.Wiltgren, who is no longer alive, described Malinowski, the elder of the village of Malinowo, as someone who helped her to survive under an assumed “Aryan" identity by putting her in a group of Poles sent to work in Germany after she had purchased false papers. But she also said he cheated her out of money and possessions. Two of her sons testified that she considered him a “bad man.”The book states that Wiltgren "realized that he was an accomplice in the deaths of several dozen Jews who had been hiding in the woods and had been turned over to the Germans, yet she gave false testimony in his defense at his trial after the war.”Engelking, who wrote the chapter, acknowledged one error. In the book she mentioned that when Wiltgren was in Germany during the war, she traded with Malinowski. The book didn't make clear that was a different man with the same name. Engelking argued the mistake had no bearing on the larger question of the village elder's behavior toward Jews.The plaintiff's lawyer, Brzozowska-Pasieka, also pointed to other details that she believes the authors got wrong, including the discrepancy between 18 Jews killed and Engelking's reference to several dozen deaths. Engelking says she believes they aren't major issues, and they mean her critics could find no other real fault in the book.___Associated Press researcher Randy Herschaft in New York, and AP writer Monika Scislowska in Warsaw, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polish-pride-free-speech-at-stake-in-holocaust-libel-case-101612860715624.html
09-02-2021||World||Syrian who fled to Germany 5 years ago runs for parliament||Five years ago, Tareq Alaows crossed the Mediterranean in a flimsy rubber dinghy and trekked north through the Balkans toward Germany, fleeing the civil war in his homeland of Syria to seek a safe haven.Since then, the 31-year-old has learned fluent German, found a steady job — and has just launched a campaign to run for a seat in Parliament in September.“I am running for national parliament as the first refugee from Syria,” the soft-spoken Alaows told The Associated Press at a rally in support of asylum-seekers outside the Reichstag building in Berlin, where Parliament sits. “I want to give a voice to refugees and migrants in Germany and fight for a diverse and fair society for all.”Alaows joined the Green Party last year and is running as their candidate in the Oberhausen-Dinslaken parliamentary constituency in western Germany.With his beard and long black hair pulled into a bun, he has the informal look of a Greens politician, and also shares the party's focus on human rights and social justice.In Syria, he participated in peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad's goverment while studying law at the University of Aleppo. He also volunteered for the Red Crescent relief group during the civil war and helped register internally displaced refugees.In 2015, as the war in Syria became increasingly brutal and he was facing conscription into military service after graduation, Alaows decided to escape to “a place when I can live in safety and with dignity,” he said.After his arrival in Dortmund in western Germany on Sept. 3, 2015, he soon became active again after being confronted with a system overwhelmed by the more than 1 million migrants who arrived that year.After being crammed into a gym with 60 other people, “where nobody could sleep at night if just one child was crying," he helped organize protests against the conditions.Alaows now works as a legal counselor for asylum-seekers at a nongovernmental organization in Berlin and splits his time between the capital and the city of Oberhausen, in his constituency.“I really want to help improve the living conditions of refugees in Germany,” Alaows said. “It's not OK that they are lingering on the outer borders of the European Union in precarious conditions, drown in the Mediterranean and have to live in huge camps in Germany, all while European interior ministers are getting together to find ways how to keep them out or deport them.”By the end of 2020, 818,460 Syrians were living in Germany. Most of them haven't yet applied for German citizenship. Alaows is one of the first to have fulfilled the prerequisites to apply for citizenship, which he is confident will be approved before election day on Sept. 26.Overall, around 21.2 million of Germany's 83 million people have migrant roots, primarily from Turkey, as well as the Balkans, the former Soviet Union and Poland. Recent arrivals from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, and other refugees who came much earlier, account for about 1.8 million of those.But people of non-German backgrounds continue to be severely underrepresented in many sectors of society, including Parliament.Of the 709 lawmakers who took office in the last federal election in 2017, only 58, or 8.2% had migrant roots, according to the Mediendienst Integration group that tracks migrant issues in Germany.That is all the greater reason Alaows has found a home with the Greens, a party that lobbies for better integration of migrants in addition to environmental issues, and boasts that almost 15% of their lawmakers are from migrant backgrounds.“Tareq is a candidate who advocates social justice and equality for all human beings as well as inclusive politics,” said Beate Stock-Schroer, a spokeswoman for the Greens in Alaows' district of Oberhausen-Dinslaken, as he launched his campaign last week.Germany has a complex electoral system that gives its citizens two votes each — one for a directly elected constituency representative and another for a party list. Alaows faces an uphill struggle to win the first-past-the-post race to become a directly elected lawmaker — Germany’s traditional big parties win most of those — but could still enter Parliament if he gets a prominent spot on the party’s regional list.That means he needs the party to vote to put him high enough on its list of delegates from the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia, where his constituency is located, when it decides on candidates for national Parliament in the spring.His current campaign team is working hard to help him get there.A handful of volunteers, mostly young and engaged like himself, field questions from the media, keep his social media accounts active and put out regular video and photos.On Saturday, Alaows joined a protest in front of the Reichstag against the deportation of rejected asylum-seekers to their home countries.Reggae music blared from loudspeakers across the snowy lawn as around 200 people held banners with slogans saying “Nobody is illegal" and speakers demanded open borders for refugees.“I want to bring a political change to parliament,” said Alaows, gazing past the protesters at the Reichstag building, whose facade carries the slogan “To the German people” chiseled into the stone beneath its iconic glass dome.“I want to bring the perspective of the people to Parliament who aren't represented there," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-who-fled-to-germany-5-years-ago-runs-for-parliament-101612859826470.html

09-02-2021||World||Two US carrier groups conduct exercises in South China Sea||Two US carrier groups conducted joint exercises in the South China Sea on Tuesday, days after a US warship sailed near Chinese-controlled islands in the disputed waters, as China denounced the United States for damaging peace and stability.The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group and the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group "conducted a multitude of exercises aimed at increasing interoperability between assets as well as command and control capabilities", the US Navy said, marking the first dual carrier operations in the busy waterway since July 2020.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the frequent moves by US warships and aircraft into the South China Sea in a "show of force" was not conducive to regional peace and stability."China will continue to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and security and work with countries in the region to firmly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea," he said.The exercise comes days after China condemned the sailing of the destroyer, the USS John S. McCain, near the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in what the United States calls a freedom of navigation operation - the first such mission by the US navy since President Joe Biden took office.Last month, the US military said Chinese military flights over the South China Sea fit a pattern of destabilising and aggressive behaviour but posed no threat to a US Navy aircraft carrier strike group in the region.The United States has contested China's extensive territorial claims in the region, accusing it of militarising the South China Sea and trying to intimidate neighbours such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, who have claims that overlap with China's in the resource-rich area."We are committed to ensuring the lawful use of the sea that all nations enjoy under international law," Rear Admiral Jim Kirk, commander of the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group, said in a statement.China has been infuriated by repeated US sailings near the islands it occupies and controls in the South China Sea. China says it has irrefutable sovereignty and has accused the United States of deliberately stoking tension.China has also been angered by US warships sailing through the Taiwan Strait, including one last week, also the first such operation under the Biden administration.Speaking in Taipei, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said US ships and aircraft carrying out freedom of navigation operations was reassuring."This demonstrates the clear US attitude towards challenges to the security status quo in the Indo-Pacific region," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-us-carrier-groups-conduct-exercises-in-south-china-sea-101612859683801.html

09-02-2021||World||WHO warns against dismissing AstraZeneca vaccine after setbacks||The World Health Organization and its Covax partners cautioned Monday against dismissing AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine after several setbacks, insisting it remained an important, life-saving tool.The AstraZeneca vaccine is currently a vital part of Covax, which was set up to procure Covid-19 vaccines and ensure their equitable distribution around the world.It accounts for almost all of the 337.2 million vaccine doses Covax is preparing to begin shipping to some 145 countries during the first half of the year, once it receives WHO authorisation, which is expected next week.But the vaccine has run into several setbacks."It is vastly too early to be dismissing this vaccine," said Richard Hatchett, who heads the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which co-leads the Covax vaccine facility with the WHO and Gavi."It is absolutely crucial to use the tools that we have as effectively as we possibly can," he said, speaking at the WHO's regular bi-weekly press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic.Regulatory authorities in several European nations have refused to authorise the vaccine for use among the over-65s -- by far the most vulnerable age group for serious Covid-19 disease -- due to a lack of data proving its efficacy among older people.And South Africa said Sunday it would suspend the start of its Covid-19 vaccinations with the AstraZeneca jab after a study showed the jab failed to prevent mild and moderate cases of the virus variant that has appeared in the country.- 'Concerning news' -WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters that the study's findings were "clearly concerning news."But he stressed that there were "some important caveats", pointing in particular to the small size of the study with only 2,000 participants, urging more research.Other WHO experts also pointed out that the interval used between the two doses of the vaccine in the study was just a month -- far shorter than what has been deemed to be optimal to enhance its efficacy.WHO's vaccines chief Kate O'Brien pointed to other studies showing the vaccine could have a "meaningful impact against severe disease", including with the B.1.351 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first detected in South Africa.She said the organisation's vaccine expert group, which met earlier Monday to discuss its recommendations on the use of the jab, had appeared optimistic about its prospects against the variant.The 15-member Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) is due to render its verdict later this week.However O'Brien said the experts had expressed "a very positive view on proceeding with the use of the vaccine including in settings where variants are circulating".Gavi chief Seth Berkley agreed that current evidence indicated the jab "is an efficacious vaccine."At the same time, he underscored the need to continue monitoring all the Covid vaccines, and possibly adapting them to better battle new variants "if found to be scientifically necessary."The WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan meanwhile said it was vital to use the tools available now to save lives."The primary job of vaccines right now is to reduce hospitalisations and deaths, and right now... they are working to do that," he said."We may need better vaccines to do more than just stop deaths and hospitalisations."But "in emergency management you have got to do what you can do now," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-against-dismissing-astrazeneca-vaccine-after-setbacks-101612858917514.html
09-02-2021||World||Australian journalist Cheng Lei's arrest in China causes concern||Former colleagues and press freedom advocates have expressed concern for the well-being of Chinese-Australian journalist Cheng Lei who was arrested on Friday on suspicion of 'supplying state secrets' by China, reported South China Morning Post.Eric Olander, who worked with her in Singapore in 2003, said it was "heartbreaking to see what she's now having to endure".Tech podcaster Elliott Zaagman, who once shared an apartment building with Cheng and appeared on her show, said her arrest "hit very close to home" among the expatriate community in Beijing."It's distressing to think of the conditions she is under, and what sort of emotional and physical trauma she may be enduring," said Zaagman. "My thoughts are with her family, particularly her two young children."The Alliance for Journalists' Freedom, an Australia-based advocacy group, on Monday called for Cheng's immediate release."China's record on press freedom is already deeply troubling," said spokesman Peter Greste. "In the absence of evidence, Cheng's arrest only adds to the impression that Beijing does not care about the freedom of the press. Her case stands as a clear warning to other journalists to support the government or risk being imprisoned, too."John Power, in his opinion piece in SCMP, wrote that Cheng's former colleagues, family members and press freedom advocates have expressed concern about the well-being of the Australian journalist.Amid deteriorating Australia-China relations, Cheng, an anchor with Chinese state-run CGTN was formally arrested by the Chinese government on suspicion of "illegally supplying state secrets overseas", six months after she was detained, said Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Monday.In a statement, Payne said Canberra had raised "serious concerns" about Cheng's detention during the previous six months."We expect basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment to be met, in accordance with international norms," she said.Cheng's detention in August placed a strain on Canberra's already fraught relations with Beijing, which have sunk to their lowest ebb in decades amid disputes spanning trade, territorial issues, alleged espionage and Covid-19, reported SCMP.Before her detention, Cheng had written a number of posts on Facebook criticising Chinese President Xi Jinping and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-journalist-cheng-lei-s-arrest-in-china-causes-concern-101612854558197.html
09-02-2021||World||Forget 5G, the US and China are already fighting for 6G dominance||Most of the world is yet to experience the benefits of a 5G network, but the geopolitical race for the next big thing in telecommunications technology is already heating up.For companies and governments, the stakes couldn’t be higher. The first to develop and patent 6G will be the biggest winners in what some call the next industrial revolution. Though still at least a decade away from becoming reality, 6G — which could be up to 100 times faster than the peak speed of 5G — could deliver the kind of technology that’s long been the stuff of science fiction, from real-time holograms to flying taxis and internet-connected human bodies and brains.The scrum for 6G is already intensifying even as it remains a theoretical proposition, and underscores how geopolitics is fueling technological rivalries, particularly between the U.S. and China.“This endeavor is so important that it’s become an arms race to some extent,” said Peter Vetter, head of access and devices at Nokia Oyj’s research arm Bell Labs. “It will require an army of researchers on it to remain competitive.”Years of acrimony under the Trump administration have hit Chinese technology companies hard, but that hasn’t stopped the country from emerging as the leader in 5G. It has the world’s largest 5G footprint, and — despite multiple attempts by the U.S. to take it on — Huawei Technologies Co. towers over rival 5G vendors globally, mostly by offering attractive prices.The development of 6G could give the U.S. the opportunity to regain lost ground in wireless technology.“Unlike 5G, North America will not let the opportunity for a generational leadership slide by so easily this time,” said Vikrant Gandhi, senior industry director of information and communications technologies at consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan in the U.S. “It is likely that the competition for 6G leadership will be fiercer than that for 5G.”It’s clear that 6G is already on the minds of policy makers in both Washington and Beijing. Former President Donald Trump tweeted in early 2019, for example, that he wanted 6G “as soon as possible.”China is already moving ahead. The country launched a satellite in November to test airwaves for potential 6G transmission, and Huawei has a 6G research center in Canada, according to Canadian media reports. Telecommunications equipment manufacturer ZTE Corp. has also teamed up with China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. to develop the technology.The U.S. has demonstrated that it has the ability to seriously handicap Chinese companies, as in the case of ZTE, which almost collapsed after the Commerce Department banned it for three months in 2018 from buying American technology. Similar moves could hamper Huawei’s 6G ambitions.Washington has already started to sketch out the 6G battle lines. The Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions, a U.S. telecom standards developer known as ATIS, launched the Next G Alliance in October to “advance North American leadership in 6G.” The alliance’s members include technology giants like Apple Inc., AT&T Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Google and Samsung Electronics Co., but not Huawei.The alliance mirrors the way that the world has been fractured into opposing camps as a result of 5G rivalry. Led by the U.S, which identified Huawei as an espionage risk — an allegation the Chinese giant denies — countries including Japan, Australia, Sweden and the U.K. have shut the firm out of their 5G networks. However, Huawei is welcomed in Russia, the Philippines, Thailand, and other countries in Africa and the Middle East.The European Union in December also unveiled a 6G wireless project led by Nokia, which includes companies like Ericsson AB and Telefonica SA, as well as universities.The lack of trust in Chinese companies like Huawei is unlikely to abate with 6G. Democracies are growing increasingly worried about how 5G technology is being used by authoritarian regimes, with fears that 6G could enable technologies such as mass drone surveillance. China is already using surveillance cameras, AI, facial recognition and biometrics such as voice samples and DNA to track and control citizens.“Currently China seems to be doing everything in terms of surveillance and suppression to make sure that they lose future markets in the U.S. and Europe,” said Paul Timmers, a senior adviser at Brussels-based think tank European Policy Centre and former director of digital society and cybersecurity at the European Commission. “This indicates that the technical approach to 6G cannot be trusted to be decoupled from state ideological objectives.”While commercial 5G was introduced around 2019, countries are still rolling out networks and developing applications that could attract businesses and turn the technology profitable. Likewise, 6G may not reach its potential at least 15 years from now, said Gandhi of Frost & Sullivan. Only about 100 wireless carriers worldwide offer 5G services in limited areas right now.But researchers have an ambitious vision for what the next-generation network could offer. At a potential rate of 1 terabyte per second, 6G is not only much faster, but also promises a latency — which causes lags — of 0.1 millisecond, compared to 1 millisecond, or the minimum for 5G. To achieve that, scientists are focusing on the super high frequency terahertz waves that could meet those speed and latency requirements, though there is not yet a chip capable of transmitting so much data in a second.It still remains too early to tell whether the envisioned futuristic world defined by 6G will eventually materialize. In that theoretical world, everything in our environment will be connected to the 6G networks — not only can people communicate with things like furniture and clothes, but those gadgets can also communicate among themselves.Major scientific obstacles abound — for example, researchers must solve the question of how airwaves traveling extremely short distances can easily penetrate materials such as water vapor or even a sheet of paper. Networks may need to be ultra-dense, with multiple base stations installed not only on every street, but also in each building or even each device people use to receive and transmit signals. That’s set to raise serious questions over health, privacy and urban design.“Technological advances, especially those as futuristic and complex such as 6G radio communication should be developed carefully,” said Gandhi. “We believe that countries cannot start soon enough. The private sector cannot start soon enough. And that is why we already have initiatives such as the Next G Alliance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forget-5g-the-us-and-china-are-already-fighting-for-6g-dominance-101612856666342.html
09-02-2021||World||Myanmar coup opponents vow to continue protest action||Opponents of Myanmar's military coup vowed to continue non-violent action on Tuesday in the face of bans on big gatherings, night curfews and road closures after the biggest demonstrations in more than a decade.The Feb. 1 coup and detention of elected civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi brought three days of protests across the Southeast Asian country of 53 million and a growing civil disobedience movement affecting hospitals, schools and government offices.Promises on Monday from junta leader Min Aung Hlaing to eventually hold a new election in his first address since seizing power drew scorn. He repeated unproven accusations of fraud in last November's election, won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) in a landslide."We will continue to fight," said a statement from youth activist Maung Saungkha, calling for the release of political prisoners and the "complete collapse of dictatorship" as well as the abolition of a constitution that gave the army a veto in parliament and for federalism in ethnically-divided Myanmar.An older generation of activists formed during bloodily supressed protests in 1988 called for the continuation of the strike action by government workers for another three weeks."We also request the protesters in the whole nation to be united and systematically help each other," said the statement from Min Ko Naing on behalf of the 88 Generation group.After tens of thousands of people took to the streets across Myanmar, local orders banning gatherings of more than four people were imposed. The U.S. Embassy said it had received reports of an 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. local time curfew in the two biggest cities, Yangon and Mandalay.Bridges connecting central Yangon to populous districts outside were shut on Tuesday, residents said.There was no further comment from authorities on the measures to stop protesters.Some coup opponents suggested on social media that people should meet in groups of four to protest to get around the ban on large gatherings.ELECTION PROMISEIn his first televised address as junta leader on Monday, Min Aung Hlaing said the junta would form a "true and disciplined democracy," different to previous eras of military rule which left Myanmar in isolation and poverty."We will have a multiparty election and we will hand the power to the one who wins in that election, according to the rules of democracy," he said. The electoral commission had dismissed his accusations of fraud in last year's ballot.Min Aung Hlaing gave no time frame but the junta has said a state of emergency will last one year.The comments brought angry responses on social media, with some people posting pictures of themselves putting one finger up at the television as he spoke.Western governments have widely condemned the coup, although there has been little concrete action so far to put pressure on the generals.The U.N. Security Council has called for the release of SuuKyi and other detainees. The U.N. Human Rights Council will hold a special session on Friday to discuss the crisis at the behest of Britain and the European Union.The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said it is considering targeted sanctions. It said on Monday it was "moving quickly" to form its response.In a letter on Monday, a senior member of Suu Kyi's NLD asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to "use all available means...to ensure a swift reversal of the coup".Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigningfor democracy and spent nearly 15 years under house arrest as she struggled to end almost half a century of army rule.The 75-year-old has been kept incommunicado since her arrest. She faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkies and is being held in police detention until Feb. 15.Her lawyer said he has not been allowed to see her. The U.S. State Department said it had made both formal and informal efforts to reach her, but was denied.Suu Kyi remains hugely popular at home despitedamage to her international reputation over the plight of theMuslim Rohingya minority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-opponents-vow-to-continue-protest-action-101612837100144.html
09-02-2021||World||Taiwan wishes China happy new year, but says won't yield to pressure||Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen wished China a happy Lunar New Year on Tuesday, but said she will not yield to Chinese pressure and reiterated a call for dialogue to resume with Beijing.China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has increased its military activity around the island in recent months, responding to what Beijing calls "collusion" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's most important international backer.Speaking after a meeting with senior security officials, Tsai said Taiwan was in close contact with "relevant countries" about the situation in the Taiwan Strait, which separates the island from its huge neighbour.Chinese military aircraft and warships operating around Taiwan are not conducive to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, she added."I would like to reiterate that Taiwan's consistent position on cross-strait relations is neither to succumb to pressure nor to advance rashly when we get support," Tsai said.Taiwan wants "meaningful talks" with China on the basis of equality and mutual respect, as long as Beijing wants to ease the stand-off, she added."Cross-strait peace is not a unilateral issue for Taiwan. The key lies in China's hands. Historical experience has proven that verbal attacks and military threats against Taiwan will not help cross-strait relations."Taiwan and China this week both mark the Lunar New Year, traditionally the most important holiday of the year for both, marking the arrival of spring."We would also like to wish the people on the other side of the strait a happy new year and hope to jointly promote peace and stability on both sides of the strait," Tsai said.There was no immediate response from China, which has rebuffed previous calls from Tsai for dialogue, believing she is a separatist bent on Taiwan's independence.In January, China said Taiwan was engaging in a "cheap trick" after Tsai again called for talks.Tsai has repeatedly said Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-wishes-china-happy-new-year-but-says-won-t-yield-to-pressure-101612854292800.html
09-02-2021||World||China blocks Clubhouse, app used for political discussion||Chinese authorities are blocking access to Clubhouse, a social media app that allowed users in China to discuss sensitive topics with people abroad including Taiwan and treatment of the country’s Muslim minority.The move adds Clubhouse to thousands of websites and social media apps to which the ruling Communist Party blocks access in an effort to control what China’s public sees and reads.Service to users in China was interrupted at about 7 p.m. Monday in Beijing, according to GreatFire.org, a nonprofit group in the United States that monitors Chinese internet filtering and tries to help users circumvent it.President Xi Jinping’s government refuses to acknowledge the existence of its internet filters, but researchers abroad trace blockages to servers within state-owned China Telecom Ltd. through which internet traffic into and out of China is required to pass.Xi’s government promotes what it calls “internet sovereignty,” or the right of political leaders to limit what their publics see online.Clubhouse temporarily gave Chinese users an uncensored forum to talk about politically sensitive issues. Unlike many other social media apps, it uses oral conversation, which allowed users in China to talk directly to people in Taiwan, the self-ruled island claimed by the Communist Party as part of its territory, and others abroad.Topics for recent discussions included Xinjiang region in China's northwest, where the Communist Party has interned more than 1 million ethnic Muslims.The service requires users to be invited to join and to give their names and phone numbers. That prompted warnings Chinese users might face official retaliation. There has been no indication whether anyone in China has been punished for using the service.The ruling party also blocks access to Facebook, Twitter and other global social media services and thousands of websites run by news organizations and human rights, Tibet, pro-democracy and other activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blocks-clubhouse-app-used-for-political-discussion-101612853780747.html
09-02-2021||World||Donald Trump was right to take tougher approach on China: Tony Blinken||Former US president Donald Trump was right to take a tougher approach on China, newly-appointed Secretary of State Tony Blinken has said, reiterating the Biden administration’s policy of engaging Beijing from a position of strength.Blinken, in an interview to CNN, commented on Trump’s tough approach on China, saying the way Trump went about it, in his judgment, was wrong across the board, but the basic principle was the right one.“I think in fairness to President Trump he was right to take a tougher approach to China. That was the right thing to do.“But what does this require of us? We have to engage China from a position of strength. And whether it’s the adversarial aspects of the relationship, the competitive ones, or the cooperative ones which are there in our mutual interest, we have to deal with it from a position of strength,” he said on Sunday.Blinken explained that this means having strong alliances.“That’s a source of advantage for us – not denigrating our alliances. It means, as we were talking about earlier, showing up again in the world, engaging. Because if we don’t, when we pull back, China fills in," he said.During his tenure, Trump, a Republican, pushed aggressively on all aspects of US-China ties, including with his relentless trade war, challenging China's military hold on the disputed South China Sea, its constant threats to Taiwan, the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, branding coronavirus as "China virus" after it emerged from Wuhan in December 2019 and the Tibet issue.“It means standing up for our values, not abdicating them, when we see the abuse of the rights of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang or democracy in Hong Kong. It means making sure that we’re postured militarily to deter aggression, and it means investing in our own people so that they can compete effectively,” Blinken said.“If we do all of these things, and all of these things are within our control, we can engage China from a position of strength,” he asserted.Responding to a question, Blinken said that President Joe Biden has been very clear that he wants to put, will put and is putting human rights and democracy back at the center of America’s foreign policy.“Whether it’s China or any other country where we have deep and serious concerns, this will be something that is front and center, and I think you’ve already seen that play out.“We have these deep concerns that we will act on but also act on in concert with other countries, with allies and partners who share the concerns that we have, particularly, again, about the abuse of human rights of the Uyghurs, but also the abuse of democracy in Hong Kong. China made commitments during the handover from the United Kingdom to China about Hong Kong, about the rights of its people. Those commitments have not been upheld,” Blinken added.Last week, in its first contact with the Biden administration, China asked the US to rectify the "mistakes" of former president Trump's aggressive policies towards Beijing and flagged Taiwan as the most important and sensitive core issue for it.On Friday, Blinken spoke to his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi.China's official media reported that Yang told Blinken that the US should "rectify its mistakes" made over a period of time and work with Beijing to uphold the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, focus on cooperation and manage differences, so as to push forward the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations.Biden, a Democrat, has described China as the most serious competitor to the US and vowed to confront Beijing on various fronts, including human rights, intellectual property and economic policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-was-right-to-take-tougher-approach-on-china-tony-blinken-101612853129622.html
09-02-2021||World||UN experts say North Korea still modernizing nuclear arsenal||North Korea has modernized its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles by flaunting United Nations sanctions and continues to seek material and technology overseas for its arsenal, UN experts said.The panel of experts monitoring sanctions on the northeast Asian nation said in a report sent to Security Council members Monday that Kim Jong Un’s government has also produced fissile material — an essential ingredient for producing nuclear weapons — and maintained its nuclear facilities.“It displayed new short-range, medium-range, submarine-launched and intercontinental ballistic missile systems at military parades,“ the experts said. “It announced preparation for testing and production of new ballistic missile warheads and, development of tactical nuclear weapons ... and upgraded its ballistic missile infrastructure.“The Security Council has imposed increasingly tough sanctions on North Korea since its first test explosion of a nuclear device in 2006. It has banned most of the country's exports and severely limited its imports, trying to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.But the report’s summary, obtained by The Associated Press, makes clear North Korea remains able to evade sanctions and develop its weapons with the illicitly import of refined petroleum, access to international banking channels and “malicious cyber activities.”The arsenal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un escalated to a major threat to the United States following tests in 2017 that included a detonation of a purported thermonuclear warhead and flight tests demonstrating its ICBMs could reach deep in the American mainland.A year later, Kim initiated diplomacy with South Korea and then-President Donald Trump that derailed in 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a piecemeal deal partially surrendering its nuclear weapons capabilities.Last year, North Korea’s already battered economy decayed further amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which led Kim to close the country's borders. That severely limited the legal and illegal transfer of goods and movement of people, according to the experts.At a North Korean political conference, Kim sharply criticized his government's economic agencies for unspecified passiveness and “self-protecting tendencies,” the North's state media reported Tuesday. His remarks follow a ruling party congress last month where Kim called for greater state control over the economy while also vowing to continue all-out efforts to boost his nuclear program, which North Korea sees as a deterrent to the U.S. and thus an assurance of the Kim dynasty's continued existence.With his diplomatic efforts stalemated, Kim must start all over again with President Joe Biden, who previously called him a “thug” and criticized Trump for summit spectacles instead of significant nuclear reductions.The U.N. panel said North Korea's “malicious cyber activities” have illegally obtained proceeds “estimated at up to $2 billion” to fund its weapons programs. The Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency on the U.N. sanctions blacklist, engaged in “the targeting of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, and attacks on defense companies," the panel said.The experts said they also investigated attempted violations of the U.N. arms embargo, including illegal actions of blacklisted companies. They cited the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation, alleged military cooperation by North Korea, and the use of the country’s overseas diplomatic missions for commercial purposes.The panel said it also investigated “the country’s continued illicit import of refined petroleum, via direct deliveries and ship-to-ship transfers, using elaborate subterfuge.“It cited images, data and calculations from an unidentified country showing that between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 last year North Korea received shipments of refined petroleum products exceeding the annual ceiling of 500,000 barrels set by the Security Council “by several times.”U.N. sanctions ban North Korean coal exports, and the panel said shipments of coal appear to have been largely suspended since late July 2020.It said that last year, North Korea continued to transfer fishing rights in violation of sanctions, which earned the country $120 million in 2018, according to an unnamed member state.Under a 2017 sanctions resolution, all North Korean nationals working overseas were to be repatriated by Dec. 22, 2019. The experts said they investigated North Korean workers earning income in sub-Saharan Africa as well as information technology workers dispatched by the Munitions Industry Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-say-north-korea-still-modernizing-nuclear-arsenal-101612844803476.html
09-02-2021||World||Myanmar protesters march again, defying ban on gatherings||Demonstrators against Myanmar's military takeover took to the streets again Tuesday in defiance of new rules that make their protests illegal.Police were arresting protesters and using water cannons to try to disperse the crowd in Mandalay, and a crowd also gathered in Yangon despite a heightened security presence.The decrees issued Monday night for some areas of the two cities banned rallies and gatherings of more than five people, along with motorized processions, while also imposing a 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew.Yangon is Myanmar's biggest city and Mandalay its second, where thousands of people have been demonstrating since Saturday. It was not immediately clear if regulations have been imposed for other areas.The protesters are demanding that power be restored to the deposed civilian government and seek freedom for the nation's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other ruling party members detained when the military blocked the new session of Parliament from convening on Feb. 1.In addition to the crowds in Yangon and Mandalay, demonstrations were also held in other cities, including Bago and Dawei, and in northern Shan state.The growing defiance was striking in a country where past demonstrations have been met with deadly force and are a reminder of previous movements in the Southeast Asian country’s long and bloody struggle for democracy.On Sunday, tens of thousands of protesters rallied at Yangon’s Sule Pagoda, which was a focal point of demonstrations against military rule during a massive 1988 uprising and again during a 2007 revolt led by Buddhist monks. The military used deadly force to end both of those uprisings.State media for the first time on Monday referred to the protests, claiming they were endangering the country’s stability.“Democracy can be destroyed if there is no discipline,” declared a statement from the Ministry of Information, read on state television station MRTV. “We will have to take legal actions to prevent acts that are violating state stability, public safety and the rule of law.”However, the military commander who led the coup and is now Myanmar’s leader made no mention of the unrest in a 20-minute televised speech Monday night, his first to the public since the takeover.Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing instead repeated the claims about voting fraud that have been the justification for the military’s takeover, allegations that were refuted by the state election commission. He added that his junta would hold new elections as promised in a year and hand over power to the winners, and explained the junta’s intended policies for Covid-19 control and the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-march-again-defying-ban-on-gatherings-101612847767528.html
09-02-2021||World||Thailand targets 30% electric-car production to tackle pollution||Thailand will target having electric vehicles account for 30% of car production by the end of the decade, as part of efforts to tackle toxic air pollution.The government wants to “accelerate the use and production of electric vehicles, with national strategies focusing on the environment and air pollution solutions,” Industry Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit said in an interview. Thailand already has an advantage by being a car-production hub and it’s now time to focus on EVs, he said.While the overall contribution from vehicles to pollution is much smaller than other sources like crop burning or forest fires, a survey commissioned by Nissan Motor Co. showed that 91% of Thais would buy an EV because of the environmental impact. The survey found 43% of Thai non-EV owners would consider an EV for their next car purchase within the next three years.Some of the measures to stimulate the domestic market and achieve the 2030 goal include encouraging the use of electric vehicles by state agencies, tax benefits and parking discounts for buyers, more investment incentives for companies, and developing charging infrastructure across the country, Suriya said. The 30% target will include cars, motorbikes and buses, he added.Such initiatives would support continued growth of EV sales in Thailand, Allen Abraham, an analyst at BloombergNEF, wrote in a Feb. 4 report. While the Thai EV market is still small, it showed “great resilience” last year despite the pandemic denting overall auto sales, Abraham said. EV car sales increased 1.4% in 2020, while regular auto sales slumped 26%.Thailand’s Board of Investment has already granted EV privileges to more than a dozen companies, including Nissan, Toyota Motor Corp., Mercedes-Benz AG, BMW AG, and Energy Absolute Pcl’s Mine Mobility. In November, the government approved new incentives to boost production of EVs and its supply chain, including a three-year tax holiday for manufacturers of plug-in hybrid vehicles, and an eight-year corporate income tax waiver for battery electric vehicle makers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-targets-30-electric-car-production-to-tackle-pollution-101612848068538.html

Huawei has repeatedly denied it is a risk.That effectively banned U.S.-based firms from selling Huawei essential U.S. technology and last August, the ban was extended to foreign firms with U.S. business, reaching chief suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) which effectively cut off Huawei's access to chip supplies.Ren, however, said he believe it would still be "extremely difficult" for Huawei to be taken off the U.S. entity list, but stressed that they continued to hope to buy "large volumes" of U.S. equipment and materials."We hope the new administration will harbour an open policy for the benefit of the American firms and also the economic development of the U.S.," he told reporters on the sidelines of a 5G mining project Huawei was launching in the northern Chinese city of Taiyuan.He also added that he was confident of the company's ability to survive even as its mobile business remains under pressure. The company achieved positive growth for both 2020 revenue and net profit, and that it continued to see significant levels of confidence from its customers, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-founder-says-hopes-biden-administration-will-have-open-policy-101612850106790.html

However, Oli has not visited the Office of the poll body since the dispute arose in the party.Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the Lower House on Oli's recommendation on December 20. After dissolving the Parliament, the Prime Minister also proposed elections on April 30 and May 10, 2021.Meanwhile, the decision of dissolution of Parliament is being challenged in court with over a dozen cases filed in Nepal's Supreme Court whose verdicts are expected by the end of this month.Elected in 2017 after a landslide victory, Oli became the first Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Nepal after the communist alliance of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) secured nearly two-third majorities in the lower house.The alliance which turned into a new party under name of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) headed for a split within 2 years of unity. The party has practically split into two after Oli decided to dissolve the lower house on December 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-to-visit-election-commission-to-hold-talks-on-upcoming-polls-today-101612849494334.html
09-02-2021||World||UK Covid surge testing not effective, government adviser warns||The U.K.’s plan for “surge testing” to detect and suppress new variants of coronavirus is unlikely to work unless it is done on a larger scale, a scientific adviser to the government said.Mike Tildesley, an academic at the University of Warwick who advises Boris Johnson’s government on pandemic modeling, said authorities should “cast their net slightly wider” to pick up cases and make sure people with the virus are staying home.Surge testing is being extended to areas around Manchester, northwest England, in a bid to control the spread of new variants which could prove resistant to vaccines, the health department said Monday. That’s in addition to eight other areas in England, which have seen more mobile testing sites and door-to-door visits by health officials.Johnson insisted he is “very confident” the vaccines being used in the U.K. are effective against the South African variant of the disease. But early data found the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot has limited efficacy against mild and moderate cases. There were no clear results on more serious illness.U.K. Officials Fear South Africa Strain Could Risk Recovery While only 147 confirmed cases of the South Africa mutation have been identified in the U.K., the true number is likely to be far higher because until last week fewer than 10% of positive coronavirus tests were sequenced to find the variant.Tildesley said surge testing needs to be on a bigger scale, not least because many cases are only coming to light several days after infection. “I fear it’s not going to be effective,” he said in an interview. “Unless you do slightly larger-scale blanket testing, it’s very hard to capture.”“If you’re going to do surge testing, cast your net slightly wider than you think you might need to,” he added. “Why not do it over slightly larger geographical area than postcode areas? It would significantly increase the chances of detecting more cases and putting in the necessary isolation protocols.”Self-isolationAttention is turning to the U.K.’s 22 billion-pound ($30 billion) test and trace system as infections continue to fall across the country as a result of the third national lockdown. As increasing numbers of Britons are vaccinated, effective mass testing is crucial so officials can pinpoint fresh outbreaks, trace the contacts of positive cases and ensure they stay home.Tildesley said the key is to ensure people self-isolate properly. Dido Harding, the head of the test and trace program, told Parliament last week that at least 20,000 a day were failing to do so.“We know that’s been a problem throughout, that only a relatively small proportion of people are seeing out their full 10-day isolation period,” Tildesley said. “We really need to get that message out, that that’s extremely important. It comes down to really clear government messaging.”He said the government needs to incentivize people to isolate. Some on low incomes may be taking the 500-pound payment from the state for isolating but “still not be adhering because actually they still can’t afford to not be in work for 10 days,” he said.Test and trace works best when infections come down to a manageable level and ministers need to make sure the system is effective when that happens, Tildesley said. “That’s when we need to put in the resources to make sure we’ve got as much capacity as possible to make that effective.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-surge-testing-not-effective-government-adviser-warns-101612848879668.html
09-02-2021||World||CDC director says Pre-flight Covid tests may ease spread||The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that testing people for the coronavirus before U.S. domestic flights could help reduce transmission, as she urged state and local leaders to maintain steps to limit Covid-19’s spread.Requiring air travelers to receive a negative coronavirus test before boarding could be “another mitigation measure,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Monday during a press briefing. She didn’t say whether the CDC would move forward with the policy, which the Biden administration is actively considering.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told Axios the discussion is ongoing and the decision will be “guided by data, by science, by medicine, and by the input of the people who are actually going to have to carry this out.”In an interview with CNN on Monday night he said, “I would say that the CDC is looking at all its options.”“What we know is that it’s the appropriate medicine for international travel, people traveling into the U.S. given some of those considerations. I’d say the domestic picture is very different, but you know the CDC is always evaluating what can best be done to keep the American people safe.”Walensky’s comments came as federal health officials watch for more evidence that a variant of the coronavirus widespread in the U.K. will become the dominant strain in the U.S. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that could happen by the end of March.So far, 699 variant cases have been identified, 690 of which are the U.K. strain. Walensky said the U.S. expects to at least triple its sequencing in the next several weeks, giving it a better snapshot of how widely the variants may have already spread on U.S. soil.“Once we have more sequencing that’s happening, we’ll have a better idea as to how many variants there are and what proportion are out there,” she said.Covid RestrictionsWalensky advised state and local officials against loosening restrictions despite a decline in Covid cases. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds over the weekend lifted that state’s mask mandate and other guidelines implemented amid a crush of cases in the fall.“I’m asking everyone to please keep your guard up. The continued proliferation of variants remains a great concern,” Walensky said.The administration plans to release guidance on reopening schools in coming days, she said.Officials also urged patience as Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out.More than 17 million vaccine doses have been administered to people 65 and older, said Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the Biden administration’s coronavirus response team. A federal initiative to vaccinate residents and employees of long-term care facilities has delivered 4.8 million doses to 3.7 million people so far, he said.Dozens of states are redistributing doses that were meant for the program and are going unused. Slavitt did not say how many total doses were earmarked for it.Fauci pushed back on the idea of administering just one of two required vaccine doses to expand capacity. Trial data indicates the immune response is far greater after someone receives both doses and cutting it to one could inadvertently create new mutant strains, he said.Buttigieg said in the CNN interview that the Biden administration is not considering requiring airline passengers to provide proof of vaccinations before flights.“That’s not a step that has been taken and, again, the CDC is really in the lead on deciding what the right measures will be,” he said. “I think right now the focus, especially at a time when most Americans haven’t had a vaccine, haven’t had access to vaccine, is to make sure while we’re getting those vaccinations out to everybody we possibly can, that we are also maintaining those measures that we also know work, like masks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-director-says-pre-flight-covid-tests-may-ease-spread-101612847174550.html
09-02-2021||World||Justice Dept. seeks resignations of Trump-era US attorneys||The Justice Department will ask U.S. attorneys who were appointed by former President Donald Trump to resign from their posts, as the Biden administration moves to transition to its own nominees, a senior Justice Department official said Monday.But the U.S. attorney overseeing the federal tax probe involving Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, will remain in place. The acting attorney general, Monty Wilkinson, called U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who runs the federal prosecutor’s office in Delaware, and asked him to remain on the job, the official said.The Justice Department has been investigating the finances of Hunter Biden, including scrutinizing some of his Chinese business dealings and other transactions. The tax investigation was launched in 2018, the year before the elder Biden announced his candidacy for president. Hunter Biden confirmed the existence of the investigation in December after a round of subpoenas was issued in the case.The Associated Press has reported that the subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden in December asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma.Separately, U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was appointed in October by then-Attorney General William Barr as a special counsel to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, will remain in that capacity, the senior Justice Department official said, but is expected to resign from his other position as the U.S. attorney in Connecticut.The official could not publicly discuss the internal deliberations and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The transition process, which happens routinely between administrations, is expected to take weeks and would apply to a few dozen U.S. attorneys who were appointed by Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Many of the federal prosecutors who were nominated by Trump have already left their positions, some in recent weeks.It’s fairly customary for the U.S. attorneys to leave their positions after a new president is in office, but the departures are not automatic and don’t necessarily happen all at once. In 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked for the resignations of 46 U.S. attorneys who were holdovers from the Obama administration.The U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president and are generally nominated with a recommendation from a home-state senator. The 93 U.S. attorneys are responsible for overseeing offices of federal prosecutors and charged with prosecuting federal crimes in their jurisdictions.The Senate has yet to schedule a confirmation hearing for Biden’s attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge who in 2016 was snubbed by Republicans for a seat on the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justice-dept-seeks-resignations-of-trump-era-us-attorneys-101612845243954.html
09-02-2021||World||Pfizer vaccine can neutralise coronavirus variants first reported in UK, South Africa: Study||The Covid-19 vaccine co-developed by the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the German biotechnology company BioNTech can neutralise variants of the novel coronavirus that were first reported in the UK and South Africa, a new study suggests.The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, noted that the vaccine is effective against coronavirus variants carrying the N501Y and E484K mutations.According to the scientists, including those from the University of Texas in the US, these variants have a substitution of the amino acid building blocks that make up the viral spike protein -- the part of the virus which enables it to enter human cells.They said these mutations in the 501st and 484th positions of the protein's amino acid molecule chain appeared in the UK and the South African variants, and could potentially increase the affinity of the viral spike for the receptor on the human cell through which the virus enters cells.In particular, they said the N501Y mutation may also expand the range of hosts the virus can infect to include mice.In the current study, the scientists, Pei-Yong Shi and his colleagues engineered combinations of mutations found in these circulating variants and tested a panel of human sera from 20 participants.They said the sera were obtained from their clinical trial of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine obtained two or four weeks after immunisation with two doses spaced three weeks apart.When they tested the serum against the coronavirus strains, the authors found evidence of neutralisation of the mutant viruses by the sera panel, with slight variation.According to the scientists, neutralisation against the E484K mutation was slightly lower than that against the N501Y mutation.Commenting on the research, virologist Lawrence Young from the University of Warwick in the UK, said the findings confirm previous studies indicating that the Pfizer vaccine is very likely to be effective against the UK variant."It shows that the mutations found in the South African variant reduced the efficiency of virus neutralisation by 50 per cent but only in six out of the 20 sera examined," said Young, who was not related to the study.Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham in the UK, also noted that the findings are promising."This is important work and provides reassurance that the antibody response generated by the Pfizer vaccine is able to neutralise coronavirus genetically engineered to carry some of the mutations seen in the variants of concern first identified in the UK and South Africa," Ball, who was also unrelated to the study, said in a statement."However, we suspect that the effects of these mutations can be influenced by mutations occurring in other parts of the spike protein, so it will be important to validate these promising findings using viruses engineered to carry all of the mutations found in each variant," he added.Due to the ongoing evolution of the coronavirus, the study authors called for continuous monitoring of vaccine efficacy for emerging variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-can-neutralise-coronavirus-variants-first-reported-in-uk-south-africa-study-101612847326703.html

09-02-2021||World||Hong Kong denies bail for opposition publisher Jimmy Lai||A Hong Kong court on Tuesday denied bail for government critic and newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai who is facing charges under a sweeping new national security law.The ruling by the Court of Final Appeal comes amid heavy pressure from the Chinese government and state media to keep Lai in custody, arguing that Lai's crimes against the state are particularly egregious and that he possesses the means to flee the semi-autonomous southern Chinese city.Lai was arrested in a December sweep against pro-democracy activists accused over their involvement in 2019 anti-government protests. First refused bail, Lai was later released on appeal, leading to editorials attacking Hong Kong’s judiciary in the pages of the ruling Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily. He was returned to jail on New Year’s Eve ahead of a new hearing.Lai, an outspoken advocate for democracy in Hong Kong, had been charged with fraud on Dec. 3 for allegedly violating the lease terms for office space for his media company, Next Digital. He was later charged again on Dec. 12 under the national security law, on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security.The law states that a defendant will not get bail unless the judge is sure the suspected crime will not be committed again, a break with Hong Kong’s common law system inherited from Britain.As at his previous hearings, Lai stepped from the prison van into an inflatable tunnel connecting with the court entrance, in an apparent attempt to minimize his exposure to the numerous journalists waiting outside.The move keeps Lai in custody at least until the beginning of his trial scheduled for April and underscores his status as one of the most high-profile critics of China's growing intolerance for political opposition in Hong Kong. Participation in anti-government protests has become a focus of law enforcement in the city and the basis on which several pro-democracy activists have been jailed in recent months, including student protest leaders Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow.The national security law was imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing after the city’s local legislature was unable to overcome local opposition to its enactment. Backers say it has returned calm to the city's streets while opponents consider it a betrayal of China’s pledge to maintain the city’s legal, civil and human rights for 50 years after its handover from British colonial rule in 1997.The law effectively curbs most opposition political activity by giving authorities broad powers to prosecute critics on loosely defined charges of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers while subjecting private speech and social media postings to possible criminal punishment. Serious offenders could face up to life imprisonment.Lai, 72, made his fortune in the retail clothing trade before branching out into media. He stepped down as publisher of the Apple Daily newspaper but the publication remains a popular forum for opposition views in a media landscape dominated by Beijing-backed outlets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-denies-bail-for-opposition-publisher-jimmy-lai-101612844867523.html
09-02-2021||World||What's ahead as Trump impeachment trial begins||Former President Donald Trump’s historic second impeachment trial begins Tuesday, forcing the Senate to decide whether to convict him of incitement of insurrection after a violent mob of his supporters laid siege to the US Capitol on Jan. 6.While Trump’s acquittal is expected, Democrats hope to gain at least some Senate Republican votes by linking Trump's actions to a vivid description of the violence, which resulted in five deaths and sent lawmakers fleeing for safety. The House impeached Trump on Jan. 13, one week later.Trump's lawyers say the trial should not be held at all because the former president is now a private citizen. They argue that he did not incite the violence when he told his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat.A look at the basics of the upcoming impeachment trial:HOW DOES THE TRIAL WORK?As laid out by the Constitution, the House votes to impeach and the Senate then holds a trial on the charge or charges. Two thirds of senators present can convict.The House appointed nine impeachment managers who will present the case against Trump on the Senate floor. Trump's defense team will have equal time to argue against conviction.The chief justice of the United States normally presides over the trial of a president, but because Trump has left office, the presiding officer will be Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who is the ceremonial head of the Senate as the longest-serving member of the majority party.Once the senators reach a final vote on the impeachment charge — this time there is just one, incitement of insurrection — each lawmaker will stand up and cast their vote: guilty or not guilty.HOW LONG WILL THE TRIAL LAST?Likely more than a week. The agreement between Senate leaders provides for up to 16 hours for both prosecutors and the defense to make their arguments, starting Wednesday, with no more than eight hours of arguments per day. Later, there will be time for senators to ask questions, and there could be additional procedural votes.Under the agreement, the trial will open Tuesday with four hours of debate on whether the trial is constitutional. The Senate will then vote on whether to dismiss the charge against Trump. If that vote fails, as expected, the House managers will begin their arguments Wednesday and continue into Thursday.Trump's lawyers are likely to begin their arguments Friday and finish Saturday. That almost certainly means a final vote on Trump's conviction won't happen until next week.Trump’s first impeachment trial, in which he was acquitted on charges that he abused power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate now-President Joe Biden, lasted almost three weeks. But this one is expected to be shorter, as the case is less complicated and the senators know many of the details already, having been in the Capitol during the insurrection.And while the Democrats want to ensure they have enough time to make their case, they do not want to tie up the Senate for long. The Senate cannot confirm Biden’s Cabinet nominees and move forward with their legislative priorities, such as Covid-19 relief, until the trial is complete.WILL THERE BE WITNESSES?It appears unlikely, for now, though that could change as the trial proceeds. Trump himself has declined a request from the impeachment managers to testify.While Democrats argued vociferously for witnesses in the last impeachment trial, they were not allowed to call them after the GOP-controlled Senate voted against doing so. This time, Democrats feel they don't need witnesses because they can rely on the graphic images of the insurrection that played out on live television. They also argue that the senators were witnesses themselves.If the managers do decide they want to call witnesses, the bipartisan agreement for the trial allows them to ask for a vote. The Senate would have to approve subpoenaing any witnesses for the trial.WHY TRY TRUMP WHEN HE IS OUT OF OFFICE?Republicans and Trump’s lawyers argue that the trial is unnecessary, and even unconstitutional, because Trump is no longer president and cannot be removed from office. Democrats disagree, pointing to opinions of many legal scholars and the impeachment of a former secretary of war, William Belknap, who resigned in 1876 just hours before he was impeached over a kickback scheme.While Belknap was eventually acquitted, the Senate held a full trial. And this time, the House impeached Trump while he was still president, seven days before Biden’s inauguration.If Trump were convicted, the Senate would take a second vote to bar him from holding office again, Schumer said Monday. Democrats feel that would be an appropriate punishment.In response to GOP efforts to dismiss the trial, Democrats argue that there should not be a “January exception” for presidents who commit impeachable offenses just before they leave office. They say the trial is necessary not only to hold Trump properly accountable but also so they can deal with what happened and move forward.“You cannot go forward until you have justice,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week. “If we were not to follow up with this, we might as well remove any penalty from the Constitution of impeachment.”HOW IS THIS TRIAL DIFFERENT FROM TRUMP’S FIRST TRIAL?Trump’s first trial was based on evidence uncovered over several months by the House about a private phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, as well as closed-door meetings that happened before and afterward. Democrats held a lengthy investigation and then compiled a report of their findings.In contrast, the second trial will be based almost entirely on the visceral experience of a riot that targeted the senators themselves, in the Capitol building. The insurrectionists even breached the Senate chamber, where the trial will be held.The fresh memories of Jan. 6 could make it easier for the House impeachment managers to make their case, but it doesn’t mean the outcome will be any different. Trump was acquitted in his first trial a year ago Friday with only one Republican, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, voting to convict, and there may not be many more guilty votes this time around.In a test vote Jan. 26, only five Senate Republicans voted against an effort to dismiss the trial — an early indication that Trump is likely to be acquitted again.WHAT WILL TRUMP’S LAWYERS ARGUE?In a brief filed Monday, they argued that the trial is unconstitutional, that Trump did nothing wrong and that he did not incite the insurrection during his Jan. 6 speech to supporters.While the House impeachment managers say Trump is “singularly” responsible for the attack on the Capitol, Trump’s lawyers say the rioters acted on their own accord. They suggest that Trump was simply exercising his First Amendment rights when he falsely disputed the election results and told his supporters to fight — a term they note is often used in political speeches.The brief goes after the impeachment managers personally, charging that the Democrats have “Trump derangement syndrome,” are “selfish” and are only trying to impeach Trump for political gain.There was no widespread fraud in the election, as Trump claimed falsely over several months and again to his supporters just before the insurrection. Election officials across the country, and even former Attorney General William Barr, contradicted his claims, and dozens of legal challenges to the election put forth by Trump and his allies were dismissed.WHAT WOULD ACQUITTAL MEAN FOR TRUMP?A second impeachment acquittal by the Senate would be a victory for Trump — and would prove he retains considerable sway over his party, despite his efforts to subvert democracy and widespread condemnation from his GOP colleagues after Jan. 6.Still, acquittal may not be the end of attempts to hold him accountable. Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, floated a censure resolution after last month’s vote made clear that Trump was unlikely to be convicted.While they haven’t said yet if they will push for a censure vote after the impeachment trial, Kaine said last week that “the idea is out there on the table and it may become a useful idea down the road.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whats-ahead-as-trump-impeachment-trial-begins-101612834726023.html

Such claims are already prohibited in ads on the platform.Facebook said it would remove groups, pages and accounts that repeatedly share the debunked claims.The company has introduced more stringent policies to combat Covid-19 vaccine misinformation during the pandemic, but has had a more hands-off approach to misinformation about other vaccines, which has rarely been removed and only when it was considered to risk "imminent harm".In December, Facebook announced it would remove false claims about Covid-19 vaccines that had been debunked by public health experts, though in recent weeks news reports have identified Facebook pages, groups and Instagram accounts still spreading these false claims.Facebook also said it would help users find out where and when they can receive the coronavirus vaccine.It will partner with Johns Hopkins and the AARP to reach Black, Latinx, Native Americans and people over 50 with educational content that addresses concerns those groups may have about the new vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-says-it-will-take-down-false-covid-19-vaccine-claims-101612846141593.html

09-02-2021||World||United States court seeks joint status report on H4 visas||A US court has asked for a joint status report on the prospects of work authorisation for H4 visas, in view of the decision of the Biden Administration to withdraw the move of Trump-era to rescind work authorisation to certain categories of spouses of foreign professional on H-1B visa.Judge Tanya S Chutkan has asked for the joint status report by March 5.An H-4 visa is issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa holders, most of whom are Indian IT professionals.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The H-4 visa is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status in the US.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has earlier said that the proposed rule titled, 'Removing H-4 Dependent Spouses from the Class of Aliens Eligible for Employment Authorisation,' was being withdrawn.The Court has asked for the joint status report by March 5"In light of recent Executive and Administrative actions, the parties shall meet, confer and file a joint status report by 3/5/21 advising the court: 1) whether the current dispute has been mooted or the parties anticipate that it will be mooted; 2) whether the parties wish to stay this action for any reason, including the parties' negotiations over resolving this dispute; or 3) whether the parties agree that this litigation should continue as anticipated pursuant to the federal rules, local rules or a scheduling order,” the judge said.The report shall be accompanied by a proposed order as appropriate; wrote Judge Chutkan in the US Court of Appeals for District of Columbia Circuit.In 2015, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rule allowing certain H4 dependent spouses of H-1B visa holders to legally seek employment in the US, the letter said.This rule presented an important step towards rectifying gender disparities in our immigration system, as around 95 per cent of H4 visa holders who have secured work authorisations are women.An H-4 visa is issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa holders, most of whom are Indian IT professionals.It is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status.As of December 2017, USCIS had approved 1,26,853 applications for employment authorisation for H-4 visa holders.According to a 2018 report by Congressional Research Service (CRS) 93 per cent of approved applications for H-4 employment authorisation were issued to individuals born in India, and five per cent were issued to individuals born in China.The 2015 rule was challenged by Save Jobs USA in a federal court.During its four years, the Trump Administration had told the court that it plans to rescind the order that gives work authorisation to spouses of H-1B visas. However, it did not rescind the rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-court-seeks-joint-status-report-on-h4-visas-101612840887229.html

09-02-2021||World||UN Chief Guterres welcomes US decision to re-engage with Human Rights Council||UN Secretary General António Guterres has welcomed the decision of the United States to re-engage with the United Nations Human Rights Council, saying the world organisation looks forward to hearing Washington’s crucial voice across the Council’s urgent work."The Human Rights Council is the world’s leading forum for addressing the full range of human rights challenges. The Council’s mechanisms and special procedures are vital tools for ensuring action and accountability," a statement issued by the UN Chief’s spokesperson said Monday."The United Nations looks forward to hearing the crucial voice of the United States across the Council’s urgent work,” the statement said.Under the Trump administration, the US had withdrawn from the United Nations Human Rights Council, condemning the "hypocrisy" of its members and its alleged "unrelenting bias" against Israel."As Secretary Blinken said, effective use of multilateral tools is an important part of the Biden administration's recommitment to a US foreign policy centered on democracy, human rights, and equality,” the US Mission to the UN said in a statement Monday, adding that the “best way” to realise this commitment is through “our continued engagement with allies, partners, non-governmental organisations, civil society, and multilateral organisations, including within the UN system.”Secretary of State Antony Blinken said President Joe Biden has instructed the Department of State to reengage “immediately and robustly” with the UN Human Rights Council.“We recognise that the Human Rights Council is a flawed body, in need of reform to its agenda, membership, and focus, including its disproportionate focus on Israel. However, our withdrawal in June 2018 did nothing to encourage meaningful change, but instead created a vacuum of US leadership, which countries with authoritarian agendas have used to their advantage,” Blinken said.The US Mission to the UN added that Washington recognises the UN Human Rights Council has its flaws, “but we also believe it can help promote fundamental freedoms around the world.“The only way we can ensure the Human Rights Council fulfills this important mandate is by being at the table as an observer and working with our partners and allies in a principled fashion to make it better.”The Mission added that through Washington’s leadership on the UN Security Council and by reengaging with the Human Rights Council, “the United States will continue to fight for global peace and security, and to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.”Blinken said in the immediate term, the United States will engage with the Council as an observer, and in that capacity will have the "opportunity to speak in the Council, participate in negotiations, and partner with others to introduce resolutions.It is our view that the best way to improve the Council is to engage with it and its members in a principled fashion. We strongly believe that when the United States engages constructively with the Council, in concert with our allies and friends, positive change is within reach."Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said that the Human Rights Council is a poor defender of human rights.“Worse than that, the Human Rights Council has become an exercise in shameless hypocrisy – with many of the world’s worst human rights abuses going ignored, and some of the world’s most serious offenders sitting on the council itself,” he had said as the US quit the Council.Former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley had said the Council has been a protector of human rights abusers and a cesspool of political bias.She said she had made it clear to the Human Rights Council that the US will remain a part of it if essential reforms were achieved, reforms that were needed in order to make the council a serious advocate for human rights.“Human rights abusers continue to serve on and be elected to the council. The world’s most inhumane regimes continue to escape scrutiny, and the council continues politicising and scapegoating of countries with positive human rights records in an attempt to distract from the abusers in their ranks,” she had said.In remarks at the Human Rights Council Organisational Meeting in Geneva, US Chargé d’Affaires Mark Cassayre said the Biden administration “believes in a foreign policy centered on democracy, human rights, and equality…Effective use of multilateral tools is an important element of that vision.”Cassayre added that “while recognising the Council’s flaws, we know that this body has the potential to be an important forum for those fighting tyranny and injustice around the world.By being present at the table, we seek to ensure it can live up to that potential.”The Human Rights Council was created by the United Nations General Assembly in March 2006. The Council is made of 47 Member States, which are elected by the majority of members of the General Assembly of the United Nations through direct and secret ballot.Members of the Council serve for a period of three years and are not eligible for immediate re-election after serving two consecutive terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-guterres-welcomes-us-decision-to-re-engage-with-human-rights-council-101612836047773.html
09-02-2021||World||Brazilian Prez Bolsonaro confirms new emergency aid package being discussed||Brazil is preparing a fresh round of emergency cash transfers to millions of poor and vulnerable people, President Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday, adding that any package will also take into account investor concerns over the government's fragile finances.Bolsonaro's remarks came after a government source involved in the negotiations told Reuters that the program would be smaller than last year's, which expired on Dec. 31, and would come with more strings attached."I think there will be an extension," Bolsonaro said in an interview with the TV program Brasil Urgente."We are not going to run away from the issue of emergency aid. A large part of the population is in difficulty," Bolsonaro said, warning that further fiscal stimulus must be done in a responsible manner.If not, financial markets could be spooked and the real could weaken to as low as 6 per dollar, Bolsonaro warned.Earlier on Monday, a government source said the proposal is for three monthly installments of 200 reais ($37) aimed at millions of informal workers not already signed up for the "Bolsa Familia" benefit scheme, at a cost of around 6 billion reais ($1.1 bln) a month.Arthur Lira, the newly-elected speaker of the lower house, tweeted on Monday morning that both chambers and the executive branch must draw up a viable program "for those who need it most," while "always respecting the spending cap."Senate leader Rodrigo Pacheco told GloboNews he was very optimistic that a package could be put together this week, but also stressed it must be compatible with keeping the public finances under control.The government's constitutional spending ceiling limits the growth in public spending to the previous year's rate of inflation. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes insists it is the government's fiscal "super anchor" and must not be breached.Last year's emergency spending was approved under a "state of calamity" budget and was not subject to the usual budget rules, which meant the cap was not officially broken.Financial markets have become unnerved that the cap could break this year if the government revives emergency pandemic stimulus, pushing up market-based interest rates and pushing down the currency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-confirms-new-emergency-aid-package-being-discussed-101612831334277.html
09-02-2021||World||Trump's second impeachment trial: 'Grievous crime' or just 'theater'?||The Senate launches Donald Trump’s historic second impeachment trial on Tuesday, with lawyers for the former president insisting he is not guilty of inciting mob violence at the Capitol to overturn the election while prosecutors say he must be convicted of the “most grievous constitutional crime” even though he’s gone from the White House.Trump faces a sole charge of incitement to insurrection over the Jan. 6 Capitol siege, an attack that stunned the nation and the world after he encouraged a rally crowd to “fight like hell” for his presidency. Rioters stormed the building trying to stop the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.No witnesses are expected to be called, in part because the senators sworn as jurors will be presented with graphic videos of the scenes they witnessed that day, forced to flee for safety. Under COVID-19 protocols senators will distance for the trial, some even using the visitors' galleries. Holed up at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump has declined a request to testify.The first president to face charges after leaving office and the first to be twice impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, Trump continues to challenge the nation's civic norms and traditions even in defeat. Security remains extremely tight at the Capitol. While acquittal is likely, the trial will test the nation's attitude toward his brand of presidential power, the Democrats' resolve in pursuing him and the loyalty of Trump's Republican allies defending him.“In trying to make sense of a second Trump trial, the public should keep in mind that Donald Trump was the first president ever to refuse to accept his defeat,” said Timothy Naftali, a clinical associate professor at New York University and an expert on Richard Nixon's impeachment saga.“This trial is one way of having that difficult national conversation about the difference between dissent and insurrection," he said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that Biden will be busy with the the business of the presidency and won't spend much time watching the televised proceedings. “He’ll leave it to his former colleagues in the Senate,” she said.In filings Monday, lawyers for the former president lobbed a wide-ranging attack against the House case, dismissing the trial as “political theater" on the same Senate floor that was invaded by the mob.Trump's defenders are preparing to challenge both the constitutionality of the trial and any suggestion that he was to blame for the insurrection. They suggest that Trump was simply exercising his First Amendment rights when he encouraged his supporters to protest at the Capitol, and they argue the Senate is not entitled to try Trump now that he has left office.“While never willing to allow a ‘good crisis’ to go to waste, the Democratic leadership is incapable of understanding that not everything can always be blamed on their political adversaries," the Trump lawyers say.House impeachment managers filed their own document Monday, asserting that Trump had “betrayed the American people” and there is no valid excuse or defense.“His incitement of insurrection against the United States government — which disrupted the peaceful transfer of power — is the most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a president," the Democrats said.The trial will begin Tuesday with a debate and vote on whether it's constitutionally permissible to prosecute the former president, an argument that could resonate with Republicans keen on voting to acquit Trump without being seen as condoning his behavior.Under an agreement between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican leader Mitch McConnell, the opening arguments would begin Wednesday at noon, with up to 16 hours per side for presentations.The trial will break Friday evening for the Jewish Sabbath at the request of Trump's defense team. The proceedings will resume on Sunday.A presidential impeachment trial is among the most serious of Senate proceedings, conducted only three times before, leading to acquittals for Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and then Trump last year.Typically senators sit at their desks for such occasions, but the COVID-19 crisis has upended even this tradition. Instead, senators will be allowed to spread out, in the “marble room” just off the Senate floor, where proceedings will be shown on TV, and in the public galleries above the chamber, to accommodate social distancing, according to a person familiar with the discussions.Trump's second impeachment trial is expected to diverge from the lengthy, complicated affair of a year ago. In that case, Trump was charged with having privately pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, then a Democratic rival for the presidency.This time, Trump's “stop the steal” rally rhetoric and the storming of the Capitol played out for the world to see. The trial could be over in half the time.The Democratic-led House impeached the president swiftly, one week after the most violent attack on Congress in more than 200 years. Five people died, including a woman shot by police inside the building and a police officer who died the next day of his injuries.House prosecutors are expected to rely on videos from the siege, along with Trump's incendiary rhetoric refusing to concede the election, to make their case. His new defense team has said it plans to counter with its own cache of videos of Democratic politicians making fiery speeches.Initially repulsed by the graphic images of the attack, a number of Republican senators have cooled their criticism as the intervening weeks have provided some distance.Senators were sworn in as jurors late last month, shortly after Biden was inaugurated, but the trial was delayed as Democrats focused on confirming the new president's initial Cabinet picks and Republicans sought to stall.At the time, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky forced a vote to set aside the trial as unconstitutional because Trump is no longer in office.The 45 Republican votes in favor of Paul's measure suggest the near impossibility of reaching a conviction in a Senate where Democrats hold 50 seats but a two-thirds vote — or 67 senators — would be needed to convict Trump. Only five Republicans joined with Democrats to reject Paul’s motion: Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.___Associated Press writer Hope Yen contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-second-impeachment-trial-grievous-crime-or-just-theater-101612830774988.html
09-02-2021||World||UK tech entrepreneur Lynch starts fights against extradition to US||British tech billionaire Michael Lynch begins his fight against extradition to the United States to face charges over the sale of the software company he co-founded on Tuesday, in a test of an extradition treaty critics say is lopsided.U.S. prosecutors want Lynch to stand trial on 17 counts, including securities fraud, connected to the sale of Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard (HP) in a $11 billion deal in 2011.Lynch categorically denies the charges.HP has already sued Lynch and Autonomy's former finance chief, Sushovan Hussain, in London for $5 billion, claiming they fraudulently inflated the company's value before the sale.Judgment in the civil trial, during which Lynch took the stand to argue that HP mismanagement destroyed Autonomy's value, is awaited.U.S. prosecutors added more charges to their indictment days before the civil case started in 2019.Lynch's lawyer, Alex Bailin, has said the U.S. claim of jurisdiction is unwarranted."These matters concern a British citizen, UK-based conduct, a UK-listed plc, culminating in a UK civil trial in which judgment is pending – these matters unquestionably belong here in the UK," he has said.He is expected to use a provision called the "forum bar" to argue against the request. It gives courts the power to refuse extradition if it is more appropriate to hear the case in Britain."The forum bar exists to provide real protection against this interventionist type of action and this, we will say, is a paradigm forum bar case," Bailin said.The case raises questions about Britain's extradition treaty with the United States, an agreement that Prime Minster Boris Johnson has previously said is "imbalanced".Five former British cabinet ministers, including four from the ruling Conservative Party, signed a letter to the Times newspaper last month arguing that Lynch must not be extradited."The government cannot stand by as another Briton risks being delivered like this to the U.S. justice system," the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-tech-entrepreneur-lynch-starts-fights-against-extradition-to-us-101612830418450.html

It would also provide health care subsidies for some unemployed workers.Spending by Ways and Means, one of Congress' most powerful committees, is expected to exceed USD 900 billion, nearly half of Biden's overall plan.The House Education and Labour Committee also previewed its plans on Monday, a roughly USD 350 billion package that includes USD 130 billion to help schools reopen safely, USD 40 billion for colleges battered by the pandemic and gradually raising the federal minimum wage to USD 15 an hour.Top Democrats hope the House will approve the complete bill later this month and send a final House-Senate version to Biden for his signature before mid-March, when crucial emergency unemployment benefits will otherwise expire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-propose-usd-1-400-payments-as-part-of-biden-covid-19-relief-101612830399609.html
09-02-2021||World||United States forces not protecting Syrian oil fields: Pentagon||US forces in Syria are focused on fighting the remnants of the Islamic State group and are not guarding oil fields as previously ordered by ex-president Donald Trump, a US defense official said Monday.Since a US firm contracted last year with the Kurds in northern Syria to help exploit northeastern Syria oil reserves, US troops are not involved, said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.The 900 US military personnel and contractors in the region "are not authorized to provide assistance to any other private company, including its employees or agents, seeking to develop oil resources in Syria," said Kirby.The only exception is when US troops in Syria are operating under existing authorizations to protect civilians, he said, which could explain the continuing presence of US forces around the area of the oil fields."It's important to remember that our mission there remains to enable the enduring defeat of ISIS," he said, referring to the Islamic State.The shift is more a change in tone by the new US President Joe Biden from Trump's policy for the decade-old Syrian civil war.The main oil fields are in territory in the country's northeast, a region where the US-allied Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces hold sway and depend on the oil for income.In 2019, after the Syria-Iraq Islamic State "caliphate" was crushed by US and allied forces, Trump declared that US troops would mostly withdraw from the country, leaving behind a residual force to "protect" the oil.US officials said at the time that they were there to prevent the oil fields from falling into the hands of extremists.The next year a previously unknown US oil company, Delta Crescent Energy, signed a deal with the Kurds to exploit the oil deposits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-forces-not-protecting-syrian-oil-fields-pentagon-101612830176196.html
09-02-2021||World||Iran and North Korea resumed cooperation on missiles, says United Nations||Iran and North Korea cooperated on long-range missile development projects last year, according to a confidential United Nations report that may pressure the Biden administration to respond to one of its first major geopolitical crises.“This resumed cooperation is said to have included the transfer of critical parts, with the most recent shipment associated with this relationship taking place in 2020,” an independent panel of experts monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in the report, citing a member state.Frequently on the fringes of international diplomacy, North Korea and Iran have long had a secretive, mutually beneficial relationship. The UN panel received information showing that Iran’s Shahid Haj Ali Movahed Research Center received “support and assistance” from North Korean missile specialists for a space launch vehicle, and that North Korea was involved in certain shipments to Iran.It wasn’t immediately clear what was in those shipments or how significant the cooperation was for either nation. But renewed cooperation between Iran and North Korea would likely represent a shortcoming of the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against both countries, as well as prompt the Biden administration to accelerate its strategy toward two nations it views as state sponsors of terror.In response to the allegations, Iran told the panel members that a “preliminary review of the information provided to us by the panel indicates that false information and fabricated data may have been used in investigations and analyzes of the panel,” according to the report, which was seen by Bloomberg.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the administration is reviewing former President Donald Trump’s diplomacy toward North Korea. He’s also said that Iran has to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal the Trump administration withdrew from before the U.S. considers sanctions relief against Tehran.Kim Shows Off Huge Mobile MissileKim Jong Un’s regime has rolled out several new models of ballistic missiles in recent months that are either bigger and more powerful or easier to move and fire. At an October military parade in Pyongyang, he debuted a huge ICBM that appeared to be the world’s largest road-mobile missile and capable of carrying multiple warheads.The panel cited an assessment by a member state that “it is highly likely that a nuclear device can be mounted on the ICBMs, and it is also likely that a nuclear device can be mounted on,” the shorter range missiles. “The member state, however, stated it is uncertain whether the DPRK had developed ballistic missiles resistant to the heat generated during re-entry,” the panel said, referring to the official name of North Korea.The panel also looked into the drones displayed by North Korea during the October parade, identifying them as a “Mavic 2 Pro type” manufactured by China’s SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd. The company has “yet to respond to the panel’s inquiry,” the panel added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-and-north-korea-resumed-cooperation-on-missiles-says-united-nations-101612830006768.html
09-02-2021||World||Blinken stops short of endorsing Trump recognition of Golan Heights as Israel||U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday stopped short of endorsing the Trump administration's recognition of the occupied Golan Heights as part of Israel, instead noting that the territory was important for Israel's security.Former President Donald Trump officially granted U.S. recognition of the Golan as Israeli territory in 2019 - a dramatic shift from decades of U.S. policy. Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981 in a move that is not recognized internationally."As a practical matter, the control of the Golan in that situation I think remains of real importance to Israel’s security," Blinken told CNN. "Legal questions are something else and over time if the situation were to change in Syria, that's something we look at, but we are nowhere near that."He added that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government as well as the presence of militia groups backed by Iran pose a 'significant security threat' to Israel.Biden’s advisers had said previously that he would not withdraw U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan.Blinken also reiterated the Biden administration's commitment to keep the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, after the Trump administration recognized the city as the capital of Israel, reversing previous U.S. policy.Trump was broadly in lockstep on Middle East policy with his closest ally in the region, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Biden and his team have said they will restore ties with the Palestinians that were cut by Trump, resume aid and reject unilateral actions, such as construction of Israeli settlements on occupied territory.Biden’s failure to speak with Netanyahu so far among his calls with foreign leaders has raised eyebrows in Israel and among Middle East experts. Obama and Trump both spoke to him within days of taking office.When asked why Biden has not spoken with Netanyahu, Blinken said: "I'm sure that they'll have occasion to speak in the near future."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-stops-short-of-endorsing-trump-recognition-of-golan-heights-as-israel-101612829589427.html
09-02-2021||World||Georgia probes Trump phone call that 'pressured' election official||Georgia officials have launched an investigation into Donald Trump’s telephone call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which the then-president pressured the elections official to overturn the November election results.The Georgia Secretary of State’s office said Monday such investigations are routine in response to complaints. “The investigations are fact-finding and administrative in nature,” spokesman Walter Jones said. “Any further legal efforts will be left to the attorney general.”Georgia’s attorney general, Chris Carr, was appointed by the state’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp, but the Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, could also have jurisdiction. She is a Democrat.Trump’s efforts to overturn the Georgia election results culminated in an extraordinary phone call to Raffensperger and other officials on Jan. 2 seeking to have them overturn President Joe Biden’s win there. A recording of the call was leaked and published by the Washington Post and NPR.In the call, Trump asked Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes” -- the number needed to switch winners in the state -- and said failing to do so could bring criminal charges and “a big risk to you.”Criminal solicitation of election fraud is a felony punishable by up to three years in prison in Georgia. It’s defined as whenever someone “solicits, requests, commands, importunes, or otherwise attempts” to get someone to commit election fraud, regardless of whether it’s successful.The Georgia investigation comes on the eve of Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate on a charge that he incited an insurrection by telling supporters to go to the U.S. Capitol and “fight like hell.”The melee that followed forced members of Congress to evacuate their chambers and left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.House Democrats have cited Trump’s threats to Raffensperger, saying they show he “would resort to any means necessary to reverse the election outcome.”Trump’s lawyers don’t dispute the accuracy of that recording, but denied that Trump threatened Raffensperger and said there was nothing inappropriate in the president asking Georgia to “find” more votes. The former president meant that if officials examined the evidence, they would find fraud, the lawyers said.The Georgia investigation was first reported by the New York Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-probes-trump-phone-call-that-pressured-election-official-101612829275460.html

Chinese media does not cover it,” Singh said, according to The Hindu newspaper.“Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done it at least 50 times,” he was quoted as saying.The Chinese foreign ministry was asked to comment on Singh’s statement after the regular press briefing was over.According to the statement published on the foreign ministry website, spokesperson Wang Wenbin was quick to latch on to it, and blame India for the ongoing border conflict along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.It is the root cause of the tension, he said.“This is an unwitting confession by the Indian side. For a long time, the Indian side has conducted frequent acts of trespass in the border area in an attempt to encroach on China’s territory and constantly created disputes and frictions, which is the root cause of the tensions at the China-India border,” Wang added.“We urge the Indian side to follow through on the consensus, agreements and treaties it reached with China, and uphold peace and stability in the border region with concrete actions,” he added.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson’s comments.The Indian government has repeatedly said that China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) PLA troops were the first to provoke, transgress across the LAC and, subsequently, not ready to disengage.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had earlier spelt out the Indian government’s position on the tension and the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.Several rounds of diplomatic and military have yielded no result as the standoff continues in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vksinghs-remark-on-border-unwitting-confession-china-101612813620171.html

We have decided to unite all farmers in the country by holding mahapanchayats in every state. We will organise such panchayats in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, and bring 40 lakh [four million] tractors to the agitation,” Tikait said while addressing a gathering at Gumthla Garhu in Haryana’s Kurukshetra.The farm leader also targeted the PM for his remarks warning the country against “aandolanjeevis” (those who live off protests), and the influence of FDI (“foreign destructive ideology”). “This government has lost its conscience. They are terming us as parjeevi (parasites) and andolanjeevi. I want to ask them whether freedom fighter Bhagat Singh was also a parjeevi for he led the andolan for the freedom of this country,” Tikait said. Addressing mediapersons later in the day, Tikait said, “Hum andolankari hai, par jumlebaaz nahi [We are agitators, not those who make false promises].”Responding to the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha on Monday, the PM said, “We are familiar with shramjivi (those who labour), and buddhijivis (intellectuals). But I see that a new group has emerged in this country... The country must be saved from these ‘andolanjeevis’…They are ‘parijeevis’ (parasites)…”At the gathering in Haryana, Tikait also urged the farmers to stay united during the agitation. “They are trying to divide us on the basis of religion, region and size of land holdings. But a farmer is a farmer and we all are united against these laws,” he said, adding that the agitation will go on till October 2 and beyond if required. “This movement needs your support and you have to ensure that one member of every family stays on the Delhi borders so that one day we can return from Delhi with dignity,” he said. Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-mahapanchayats-across-the-country-says-tikait-in-haryana-101612895037534.html
09-02-2021||India||Bengal BJP MLAs offered state security day after meeting Mamata Banerjee||Sunil Singh and Biswajit Das, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators who met chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her chamber at the state assembly on Monday afternoon, sparking speculations of their return to the old party, made news again on Tuesday when the government offered them personal security cover.Though no Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader or government official commented on the development, Singh and Das, who represent Noapara and Bongaon North constituencies of North 24 Parganas district respectively, said police personnel went to their residences on Tuesday morning but they refused the security cover.Singh is the brother-in-law of Arjun Singh, the BJP’s heavyweight Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore, who left the TMC prior to the Lok Sabha polls and wrested the seat by defeating the ruling party’s then sitting MP Dinesh Trivedi.“Two policemen from Noapara police station came to me and said they had been sent to provide security. I sent them back. Central paramilitary forces are already deployed for me. Why should I need state police personnel?” said Sunil Singh.Dismissing the speculations, he said, “I am very much in the BJP. Has any TMC leader said on record that I am returning to their party? We met the chief minister and had talks on some ongoing projects.”Das gave a similar reaction. “I do not need security from the state government. People are reading too much into our meeting with the chief minister,” he said.With turncoats from TMC boosting the BJP ahead of the assembly election in April-May, Banerjee’s meeting with the legislators made news.Singh and Das were welcomed into the BJP at the party’s headquarters in Delhi in June 2019, a month after the BJP set a record by winning 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats.Banerjee went to the assembly to attend the budget session. Das was seen touching her feet to seek her blessings. Urban development minister Firhad Hakim and food and supplies minister Jyoti Priyo Mullick were present during the 20-minute meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-mlas-offered-state-security-day-after-meeting-mamata-banerjee-101612892905215.html
09-02-2021||India||Unease in AIADMK as Sasikala returns to Tamil Nadu||There is unease in AIADMK as VK Sasikala returned to Chennai from Bengaluru after a 23-hour road-show early on Tuesday morning amid some party leaders saying that keeping her out could be detrimental for party prospects in forthcoming elections.There is also criticism within the party the way chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his deputy O Paneerselvam dealt with her return.“We should have just ignored her,” said a veteran AIADMK leader on condition of anonymity. “Going to the police, closing the memorial ended up giving her unnecessary attention. Our advantage is that the public has a good perception of the present regime especially after how we handled the Covid-19 crisis.”Another narrative building in the party is that public sentiment is against Sasikala. “We had celebrated you as ‘Chinamma’ (mother’s younger sister) after ‘Amma’ (how cadres addressed Jayalalithaa), but the people didn’t accept you,” said spokesperson Vaigaichelvan during a public speech in Sivaganga district on Tuesday.Also read: Xi Jinping was testing Biden admin. The answer is 2 American aircraft carriersPalaniswami on Tuesday said, “some people are plotting to split the AIADMK to help the evil force of the DMK” during his campaign at Vellore Tuesday night. “Some people are trying to split the AIADMK... TTV Dhinakaran has not been in the party for ten years. Amma had expelled him from basic membership. After her death, he announced that he’s joining the party. Then he took away our 18 MLAs and left them in the lurch. Those who believe him will be left in the middle of the road,” he said.Earlier, he had ruled out her return to the party. Some other party leaders said such open actions were important to send a clear message to people.A divided AIADMK, where unspoken tensions continue between Palaniswami-Paneerselvam, works to the advantage of the DMK (in alliance with the Congress) which has been out of power since 2011.“Sasikala isn't a charismatic leader to make an impact," said political analyst TN Gopalan. “There is a possibility she may capture the party if it's wiped out in the elections but then the bigger question would be what is left of the party if it loses?”On Tuesday, Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran reiterated that Sasikala would continue her legal battle to reclaim the AIADMK. He said that actor Rajinikanth, who recently ditched his political entry, had enquired about Sasikala’s health to send a message that she was still relevant in Tamil Nadu. Dinakaran had floated Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) in 2018, having the support of several Sasikala sympathizers.A key question is whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a junior ally of AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, would negotiate for an amicable solution between the AIADMK and Dinakaran-floated AMMK.“If the AIADMK and the AMMK issue could have been resolved, it may have been smooth but they are at each other throats wasting time when we should be focusing on election preparedness,” said a BJP state leader on condition of anonymity.However, political commentator, Sriram Seshadri, said, “It’s a no loss or gain polls for the BJP so they may choose to mediate between the factions or sit it out because they can strengthen themselves even if one of the kazhagams (party) breaks down.”A lot has changed in the AIADMK since Sasikala surrendered at Bengaluru court on February 15 2017, convicted in the disproportionate assets case. While she was in prison, Palaniswami and Paneerselvam buried their rivalries and expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran.While the present AIADMK has fortified its stand to not allow Sasikala back, her political ambitions have not weaned either despite serving a four-year jail sentence and recovering from a Covid-19 infection. It was clear on Monday when she announced her willingness to enter state politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unease-in-aiadmk-as-sasikala-returns-to-tamil-nadu-101612892970378.html
09-02-2021||India||Treatment meted out to farmers should be extended to Chinese aggressors: Owaisi||Asking the government to withdraw the three farm laws, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM) on Tuesday accused the Centre of treating farmers the way it should be treating China on the borders of the country.Participating in a discussion in Lok Sabha on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address, Owaisi said the "infrastructure" that should have been created at the borders to check Chinese troops was erected at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders to prevent farmers from entering Delhi.He wanted to know why Prime Minister Narendra Modi was "shying" away from taking the name of China which is responsible for the killing of Indian soldiers and constructing a village in Arunachal Pradesh.Owaisi hoped that during his reply to the debate, PM Modi will blame China for its actions against India.He said the government should rescind the three controversial farm laws and contended that Parliament was not competent to legislate on agriculture which is a state subject.He also wondered as to how the government decided to suspend the three farm laws for one-and-half years once they have been passed by Parliament.Owaisi also came down heavily on the government for not filing an appeal against the court judgement in the Babri demolition case acquitting all the accused.It is a signal to the cadre to repeat similar kinds of activities at Mathura and Kashi, he allegedReferring to the 'andolanjivi' remark of Modi, Owaisi said that he was an 'andolanjivi' as it was the right of people to protest against the policies of the government.India is a democracy and not a monarchy, he added.Hanuman Beniwal (RLP) said that he had left the NDA because of the farm laws and will not hesitate to quit Lok Sabha in support of the demands of the farmers who are protesting at the borders of Delhi.He claimed that even BJP members privately admit that they will have to face problems in the next general elections on account of the farm laws.Meenakshi Lekhi (BJP) said that there was an international conspiracy to destabilise and defame India over the farmers' protest issue.She said that protests were organised at the time of the visit of the then US President Donald Trump and now on January 26 to catch the attention of global media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treatment-meted-out-to-farmers-should-be-extended-to-chinese-aggressors-owaisi-101612891543372.html
09-02-2021||India||S Jaishankar, Antony Blinken discuss situation in Myanmar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Tuesday discussed the situation in Myanmar following the military coup and reviewed developments across the Indo-Pacific region.These issues came up in the second phone conversation between Jaishankar and Blinken in a little more than a week. The new secretary of state made his introductory call to Jaishankar on January 29, when Blinken described India as a “preeminent US partner in the Indo-Pacific” and discussed working together in the region, including through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.“Welcomed the comprehensive discussion today with @SecBlinken. Reviewed Indo-Pacific developments and the Quad cooperation. Exchanged views on the situation in Myanmar. Look forward to remaining in touch,” Jaishankar tweeted on Tuesday night.There was no official word from either side on the conversation.A readout from the White House after a phone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden on Monday had said the two leaders had “resolved that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld” in Myanmar.Shortly after Myanmar’s military ejected the elected government and assumed power for a year on February 1, Biden had said the US would review its sanction laws and take “appropriate action” against the country. He described the coup and the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi as “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law”.India has adopted a more nuanced position in view of its relations with both the military and civilian leadership of Myanmar and called for the democratic process to be upheld.During their earlier phone conversation, Jaishankar and Blinken had pledged to expand the India-US strategic partnership and to work for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific. They had also discussed efforts by both sides to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has also spoken to defence minister Rajnath Singh and US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has talked to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, with the two sides committing themselves to enhanced cooperation on defence and security issues and in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/s-jaishankar-antony-blinken-discuss-situation-in-myanmar-101612892061475.html

The party has become backward oriented. Why should forwards vote for it?” asked Gyanu, who claimed that he has the support of 15 MLAs. “Many more MLAs are angry and we will decide our future course of action,” he added ominously.Criticizing the party’s decision to give new faces a chance in the cabinet he said, “The party has ignored old, experienced and dedicated leaders.” He denied that he was riled for not getting a cabinet berth. “Nobody from Magadh region has been accommodated,” he contended.The BJP leader alleged that some party leaders were presenting a wrong picture to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. “Almost all forward caste MLAs are angry,” claimed GyanuThe Barh MLA also took a swipe at the two deputy CMs. “Lobbying is on in the party. The deputy CM’s chair has been given to a leader who doesn’t know anything. Some leaders have made the party their pocket organisation.“Only those candidates who lobby actively have been made ministers Forward classes have been ignored. Neither the regional nor the social equations have been taken into account,” said Gyanu, a Rajput.However, out of the 17 ministers sworn in on Tuesday, four are from Rajput community, two each are Muslims, Brahmins and Kushwaha while three are from EBC, two are Dalits, one is OBC and one from Kayastha.The JD (U) on the other hand, seemingly cold-shouldered the demand of other alliance partners, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) (HAM-S) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) of one more ministerial berth each for their respective MLAs. The HAM-S and VIP both have a strength of four MLAs each in the 243-member Bihar Assembly.BJP unit chief in Bihar Dr Sanay Jaiswal denied that there was any dissent in the party. “I was in the party office during the day. I did not see any dissent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-now-backward-oriented-says-mla-overlooked-for-ministerial-post-in-bihar-101612889815303.html

But it can change," said Chowdhury, the party's floor leader. The budget on debate is likely to take place after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reply to motion of thanks to President's address.Gandhi has been attacking the central government on various issues, ranging from the standoff on Line of Actual Control (LAC) to Union Budget.The Congress MP from Wayanad in Kerala accused the Centre of reducing the pension of soldiers in the budget and ignoring the farmers and youth of the nation.Sharpening his attack further, he also said that the Centre has only three to four industrialist friends who are 'God' for them."Mr Modi’s ‘Vikas’- PSUs to be shrunk to one-tenth.

09-02-2021||India||PM Modi's reply to motion of thanks to President's address likely in Lok Sabha tomorrow||Prime Minister Narendra Modi may reply to the motion of thanks to the President's address in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. According to the list of business uploaded on the Lok Sabha website, there will be no Question Hour tomorrow.News agency ANI reported that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has issued three-line whip to all its MPs for Wednesday, asking them to be present in the House throughout the day to support government's stand.Lok Sabha has been witnessing repeated disruptions in the first part of the budget session over the opposition's demand for discussion on contentious farm laws. Farmers have been protesting near Delhi since November 26 last year, demanding withdrawal of the three laws.The discussion on President's motion of thanks was taken up by the Lok Sabha on Monday.PM Modi had delivered his reply to the President's address in the Rajya Sabha on Monday where he quoted his predecessor Manmohan Singh on the need for reforms in the farm sector and also cautioned the nation about a new form of "FDI" which he referred to as "foreign destructive ideology" after international attention on the protest."I am quoting former PM Manmohan Singh ji as the opposition may not listen to me but may listen to what Manmohan Singh ji has said. 'There are other rigidities because of marketing regime set up in the 1930s which prevent our farmers from selling their produce where they get the highest rate of return. It is our intention to remove all those handicaps which come in the way of India realising its vast potential as one large common market,' Manmohan Singh had said. But now there is clear U-turn of the Congress," the Prime Minister had said.PM Modi also sought to allay the fears of the protesting farmers over minimum support price (MSP). "The system will always be there, as it is and has been in the past. We should not spread misinformation about this."The protesting farmers say that the laws will take away the MSP arrangement, putting them at the mercy of big corporate house.The Centre has said that these laws are historic and urged the farmers to not listen to misinformation being spread. Eleven rounds of talks have taken place so far, but no resolution has come out. The government has again invited the farmers for talks, which they have agreed to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-reply-to-president-s-address-may-take-place-in-ls-tomorrow-101612887658595.html
09-02-2021||India||Govt looking to double farmers' income by 2022, says Agriculture Minister||The government has been pursuing the target of doubling farmers' income by 2022 and several interventions taken are showing a "positive impact", Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told Parliament on Tuesday.In 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government had set a highly ambitious target of doubling farmers incomes by 2022. An inter-ministerial committee on "Doubling of Farmers' Income" was set up in April 2016 to recommend strategies to achieve this goal.In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Tomar said the committee submitted its report in September 2018. After acceptance of the panel's recommendations, the government has set up an 'Empowered Body' to review and monitor the progress.Responding to a query whether the target fixed for the year 2022 can be achieved at the present annual growth, the minister said, "The government has been pursuing the target of doubling farmers' income."He said the implementation of various recommendations of the committee and comprehensive interventions of the government are "having a positive impact on growth of agriculture and income of farmers".The government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for the farmers, the minister said responding to a separate query on the same topic.All these policies and programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating corpus funds, and supplementary income transfers under PM-KISAN.The latest major intervention includes the 'Atma Nirbhar Bharat- Agriculture package' which includes comprehensive market reforms and creation of 'Agricultural Infrastructure Fund' worth ₹1 lakh crore.The minister was also asked about state-wise details of the income/wages earned per year by farmers from the base year till date and the annual growth percentage required to achieve the targets fixed for the year 2022. He replied that the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) during its 70th round had conducted 'Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households' in rural areas in the crop year 2012-13 (July-June)."There has been no further assessment of the farmers' income thereafter," he said.As per the NSO survey results, the average monthly income per agricultural household from all sources was estimated to be ₹6,426, he added.The minister also mentioned that the committee on doubling farmers' income recommended seven sources of income growth.These include improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; and increase in the cropping intensity. Diversification towards high value crops, improvement in real prices received by farmers, and shift from farm to non-farm occupations are also included, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looking-to-double-farmers-income-by-2022-says-agriculture-minister-101612887140200.html

It is an optional programme in any case. Secondly, the first time Centre sent the Covishield vaccine, which was absolutely fine but subsequently it sent some Covaxin along with Covishield after which I sent a letter opposing it but the Centre again sent another installment of Covaxin. Hence I sent a letter again a few days ago,” the minister said.Claiming that the government is not in position to tell the people of Chhattisgarh to use the vaccine because the trials have not been completed yet, Singhdeo said , “Covaxin is not being given freely and given only after each individual fills a form .. When you are taking Covishield vaccine the government has not prescribed any form to be filled. This clearly indicates that phase three trials are not complete.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-send-covaxin-till-trials-are-complete-chhattisgarh-minister-tells-centre-101612886752969.html
09-02-2021||India||TMC is mother of corruption, prepare to atone, JP Nadda tells Mamata Banerjee||Flagging off two more rath yatras or roadshows rechristened Parivartan Yatra (journey for change) in poll-bound West Bengal on Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) national president J P Nadda launched another scathing attack on chief minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of insulting the state’s rich culture and presiding over corruption.“The culture once nurtured by icons such as Rabindranath Tagore, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Shyama Prasad Mookerjee can be revived only after you (Banerjee) are ousted,” Nadda said at a rally at Lalgarh, an erstwhile Maoist stronghold in Jhargram district, where he launched a roadshow.In the afternoon, Nadda flagged off the day’s first roadshow in Birbhum district after offering prayers at Tarapith temple, one of the most popular destinations among Hindu pilgrims.With these, the BJP launched three roadshows since February 6. Two more have been planned. The roadshows will cover Bengal’s 294 assembly constituencies. The BJP insists that it will win at least 200 seats in the assembly polls due in April-May.Though the roadshows Nadda flagged off on Tuesday started without any hitch, the first one he launched in Nadia district on February 6 was stopped for the second consecutive day in the adjoining Murshidabad district.On Tuesday morning, BJP leaders had to alter plans for the roadshow in Murshidabad because of the chief minister’s election rally. She started her tour of Murshidabad, Malda, North Dinajpur and East Burdwan, the districts having the highest Muslim populations in the state.Police stopped the roadshow’s main vehicle, referred to as the rath (chariot) in Berhampore soon after it rolled out from the Madhupur area. The administration allowed it only after imposing conditions.On Monday, BJP workers held a demonstration for almost two hours in Murshidabad’s Beldanga after the police stopped the roadshow saying there could be unrest if it passed through Beldanga, Nowda and Hariharpara where the Muslims are in majority.Nadda sharpened the poll rhetoric at his rallies in Birbhum and Jhargram, accusing Banerjee of indulging in appeasement. “She stops processions during Saraswati Puja and Durga Puja but allows the same during Muharram. Curfew is ordered in Bengal when the foundation stone of the Ram Mandir is laid. This is appeasement,” Nadda said in Jhargram.Alleging that Bengal was worse than other states in crimes such as rape, human trafficking, acid attack, attempted murder and domestic violence, Nadda said, “Rising crime, theft of calamity relief fund sent by the Centre, corruption et al prove that Mamata Banerjee has insulted the culture of Bengal. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) is the mother of corruption and you are the party’s leader. Come to your senses and prepare for atonement.”Nadda’s plane landed in the morning at Andal airport in West Burdwan district from where he took a chopper to Birbhum district and later to Jhargram.TMC’s top leaders did not comment on Nadda’s speeches. However, the ruling party’s Birbhum district unit president Anubrata Mondal, whose cryptic slogan “khela hobe” (let’s play) has become popular across Bengal, said, “The crowd was thin at Nadda’s rally because we have played well. There will be more play in the coming days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-is-mother-of-corruption-prepare-to-atone-jp-nadda-tells-mamata-banerjee-101612885443940.html

09-02-2021||India||India, China hold consultations on agenda of UN Security Council||India and China on Thursday held bilateral consultations on issues on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council, a rare meeting between the two sides amid the dragging military standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The Indian delegation used video conferencing to brief the Chinese side “on India’s priorities during its UNSC tenure,” the external affairs ministry said in a brief statement without giving details.“Both sides discussed a wide range of issues on the UNSC agenda,” the statement said. The two sides also “agreed to continue their engagement on key issues” on the Security Council’s agenda, the statement added.India began a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the Security Council earlier this month.Also read: Rescuers race against time to save 37 men trapped in tunnel in Chamoli’s TapovanLast year, the Indian side listed an effective response to global terrorism, reforming the multilateral system, a comprehensive approach to international peace and security, and promoting technology with a human touch among its priorities for its stint in the Security Council.Prakash Gupta, joint secretary (UNP and summits) in the external affairs ministry, led the Indian delegation that included officials from the East Asia and UN economic and social divisions, the permanent mission of India in New York and the embassy in Beijing.The Chinese delegation was led by Yang Tao, director-general of the department of international organisations in China’s foreign ministry.Since the standoff in Ladakh sector of the LAC emerged in the open in May last year, the main interactions between the two countries have been meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs and senior military commanders that focused on taking forward disengagement and de-escalation along the disputed border.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh met their Chinese counterparts on the margins of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings in Moscow last September. The Special Representatives on the border issue have also held consultations, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping have participated in several virtual meetings of multilateral organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-hold-consultations-on-agenda-of-un-security-council-101612884189992.html

As part of their decision, the Congress would start a one-month long recruitment drive throughout the state at the earliest."We have decided to recruit 100 people from total 60 Assembly constituencies each and 1,000 people from two Lok Sabha seats each for our party's social media cell.

09-02-2021||India||Rescuers race against time to save 37 men trapped in tunnel in Chamoli’s Tapovan||Rescuers on Tuesday used excavators to remove slush, drones to gauge the situation inside and rappelled inside a tunnel at NTPC's hydroelectric plant in Tapovan in Uttarakhand where at least 37 men are trapped since Sunday morning, but failed to reach any of them.There was no contact with the trapped men till the evening amid fears that time could be running out. The 37 men include engineers and casual labourers who were working inside the tunnel when a glacier burst and triggered a flash food."We have been able to clear about 110 metres of the slush from the tunnel, but we may have not covered even half of the distance. The drones didn't help much. We can't say how long the rescue operation will go on," said Benudhar Nayak, commandant of the ITBP's First Battalion, who is overseeing the operations along with teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the Indian Army.According to a map available with the authorities, the 37 trapped men were stranded around a point in the 1.7-km long main tunnel where it is joined by a 240-metre long subsidiary tunnel. Rescuers, who are currently trying to enter through the subsidiary tunnel will have to first make their way through 240 metres then probably some more on either sides of the main tunnel before they can find the trapped men.At the other end of the tunnel, the ITBP on Sunday evening successfully rescued 12 men who were trapped for seven hours.Rescuers have learnt that a bulldozer and two multi-utility vehicles (MUVs) too are trapped around the 37 men.Officers saw a silver lining in this information. "We see that as good news. The vehicles could possibly have stopped slush from drowning the trapped men. They could also have served as a safe space for them," said Major General Rajiv Chhibber, one of the officers overseeing the rescue operations.At the other end of the same tunnel, an excavator available with the 12 trapped men -- who were eventually rescued -- served them well.Rescuers said that removing each scoop of slush from inside the tunnel was a time consuming task. "Only one vehicle is able to go in. When it returns to dump the slush, much of it falls along the way. Each round takes several minutes," said Jagdish Uniyal, an ITBP officer.The slush along the route has also made it difficult for rescuers to walk. General Chhibber said that rescuers were using wooden planks to negate this hurdle.Rescuers even tried to rappel into the tunnel by fixing hooks to the roof, but they were unable to make much progress. "We tried to push in our men, but there isn't enough working space inside. Also, as we go deeper, we are facing a barrage of slush and debris hurtling towards us," said an army lieutenant colonel who did not wish to be namedWhile officers weren't able to give a likely timeframe in which the trapped men could be accessed, the families of those trapped continued to wait in hope despite no immediate breakthrough in sight. "I couldn't bear the cold at night. I don't know how my brother will survive inside. I am just hoping he has found a space inside one of the vehicles stranded inside," said Sunil Pal, whose brother Amit Pal is among those sti inside the tunnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescuers-race-against-time-to-save-37-men-trapped-in-tunnel-in-chamoli-s-tapovan-101612883293456.html

The reference to the place I sat is a window and anyone can sit there," Shah said.Shah said that "a former president of the country, (another former President) Pranab Mukherjee, (former Prime Minister) Rajiv Gandhi...and even I sat there (window)"."And when Bangladesh's Prime Minister paid a visit, she also sat at the same place and penned her comments," Shah said.Chowdhury had on Monday claimed in the House that Shah during his visit to Shantiniketan sat on Tagore's chair.Shah said before speaking in the House, members should ascertain the facts."It hurts the dignity of the House if something lifted from the social media is stated here," he said, adding the member who made the remarks committed the mistake due to the background of his party."I did not sit there. But Jawaharlal Nehru sat on the same seat where Tagore used to sit. This is on record and the second photograph is of Rajiv Gandhi who is sitting on Tagore's sofa having tea," Shah said with photographs to support his rebuttal.Shah also rejected certain claims made by Chowdhury against BJP president J P Nadda. He said since Nadda is not a member of the House, he should not have been named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-didn-t-sit-there-shah-clarifies-in-lok-sabha-on-tagore-s-seat-row-101612882181826.html

The maximum increase was witnessed in Laokhowa-Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary where the number of birds increased from 9244 to 71902,” said a KNPTR release.The rise in the number of birds visiting Kaziranga has been attributed to improved habitat management and water conservation measures carried out by the KNPTR authority.A total of 36 birders were involved in the exercise which had the objectives to record and estimate waterfowl and winter migratory birds and to monitor and assess the health of wetlands.The highest number of species (26) was found from family Anatidae, which form the family of ducks and geese. The top three species counted by number are Eurasian Coot (50,432), Bar-headed Geese (7860) and Common Teal (4667).Of the 112 waterfowl species found in Kaizranga, 58 are migratory species visiting the area from different parts of the world including Europe, Central Asia and East Asia.On a negative note, the area under wetlands (beels) in the KNPTR has reduced from 8.5% of the total area to 6.7% from 1967 to 1997. The third waterfowl census carried out last week found siltation, erosion, fragmentation of 'beels' and presence of invasive species in the wetlands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/175-rise-in-waterfowls-in-kaziranga-national-park-in-new-census-101612881476788.html

09-02-2021||India||Astronauts on Gaganyaan mission to carry biryani, khichdi, pickle||When India’s first crewed spaceflight, Gaganyaan, lifts off next year kicking off a new era of space exploration, the astronauts onboard will carry a selection of special foods developed by a military laboratory after experimenting with ingredients for almost two years, people familiar with the development said.The menu will offer Indian astronauts – hand-picked fighter pilots from the Indian Air Force who are undergoing training in Russia – a variety of options to suit their palate during the seven-day mission: Chicken biryani, chicken korma, shahi paneer, dal-chawal, aloo paratha, preserved chapatis, dal makhni, khichdi and beans in sauce.Even the humble mango pickle figures on the menu prepared by Mysuru-based Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) that comes under the Defence Research and Development Organisation.The DFRL’s Space Food and Logistics wing, which showcased its products at Aero India-2021 held at Yelahanka air base last week, has catered to the sweet tooth too with offerings such as moong dal halwa, sooji halwa, dried apricot and a range of flavoured energy bars, the people said.“We have focused on nutrient adequacy and wholesomeness. Low fragmentation is equally critical in the zero-gravity environment. The astronauts will eat three meals a day, with the diet adding up to 2,500 calories,” said a senior scientist with the DFRL.The laboratory has prepared the menu in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) that is conducting the crewed mission to space. “American astronauts carry food that suits their taste. So do the Russians. We Indians like saying ‘it tastes just like home food.’ And home food is what our astronauts will carry,” said a second scientist.The foods (essentially paste products) carried by Indian astronauts will be packed in 100gm/200 packets. The contents of the food kits for the spaceflight will vary with the individual preferences of the astronauts.“The final composition of the spaceflight is not known yet but four Indian astronauts are being trained in Russia. The idea is to give them balanced meals that are lightweight, low volume and easy to consume. The packaging aspect is quite technical as liquids can’t be used,” said the first scientist.The kits carried by the astronauts will include special straws (or what the DFRL calls liquid delivery system) for drinking water and instant coffee/tea, food warmers and waste restraining bags.The pilots from the IAF are being trained at the Yuri Gagarin Research and Test Cosmonaut Training Center at Star City near Moscow. They began their training in Russia in February 2020 but some activities at the Russian facility were temporarily suspended last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Indians have made good progress in the training so far and cleared some crucial tests, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The training programme for the Indian pilots, who were chosen from among hundreds of applicants, will conclude this year. It focuses on both basic astronaut training and issues specific to the Gaganyaan mission.The Human Space Flight Centre of ISRO and Russia’s state-run Glavkosmos signed a contract for the training programme in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/astronauts-on-gaganyaan-mission-to-carry-biryani-khichdi-pickle-101612880038344.html

Yadav said that inspite of the country achieving countless rights through agitation, those who carry on the tradition are being earmarked as "andolanjivis".“The nation attained Independence through agitation. Innumerable rights were received through agitation. Women received the right to vote through agitation. Mahatma Gandhi became the father of the nation because he agitated for Africa, the world and the nation.” Yadav said in Lok Sabha.“What is being said about the agitations? That people are 'aandolan jivi'. What should I call the people who go out to collect donations? Are they not members of 'chanda jivi sangathan'?” he further said.Yadav took on the Centre over the new farm laws asking why they are not being repealed when the farmers themselves are against it, citing the allegations of corporate houses getting powerful.“If the government says that laws are for farmers, why is it not taking it back if farmers aren't accepting it? People, for whom it has been formed, don't want it. Who is stopping the government? Are allegations that you rolled out carpet for corporates and brought these laws not right?” Yadav asked in the Lok SabhaCommenting on the Prime Minister’s words on the continuation of minimum support price (MSP) in Parliament, the SP chief said that farmers have not been getting MSP for their crops for a long time. He praised the protesting farmers for awakening all farmers across India through their agitation.“Yesterday I heard 'MSP tha, MSP hai, MSP rahega'. It's just in speech but not on ground. Farmers aren't getting it, had they been getting, they wouldn't have been sitting in Delhi. I congratulate agitating farmers that they have awakened farmers across India,” said Yadav.Yadav has also been constantly tweeting in support of the protesting farmers. He took to Twitter on Monday to criticise the PM's ‘andolanjivis’ remark saying it as an insult to the country’s martyrs and revolutionaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-nation-attained-independence-through-agitation-akhilesh-yadav-on-pm-modi-s-andolanjivi-remarks-101612879114325.html

Last month, 36 vultures had died in Dhulijan village of the same district after eating a poisoned carcass of a cow that was dumped in a padd field to target stray dogs.“Preliminary investigation suggests that a cow had been poisoned and kept in a paddy field. The vultures ate its meat and died as a result,” Atikur Rahman, divisional forest officer, Doomdooma, said.While 13 of the dead vultures are from the Himalayan Griffon species, seven are White Rumped, listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).All the vultures were buried at the spot after taking samples for tests. The forest department has filed an FIR in the local police station and investigation is underway to nab those involved in poisoning the cow's carcass.Ten sick vultures, eight Himalayan Griffons and two Slender Billed (also listed as critically endangered by IUCN) were rescued by veterinarians and are being treated at a Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) facility.“A cow had died in the village a few days back leaving a small calf, which was later killed by stray dogs. In order to target the dogs, the cow’s carcass was poisoned by the villagers.

Hindustan Times first reported this story on February 4."Since the events at our Narasapura facility in December, we have been working hard on improvements across the board to raise standards and fix the issues. All employees have been promptly and fully paid, and we implemented new hiring and payroll systems to ensure everyone is paid correctly and provided the correct documentation going forward," Wistron said in a statement on Tuesday.The Taiwanese manufacturing giant produces Apple's iPhone-7 and iPhone-SE among other products at its plant in Narasapura.The manufacturing operations at the plant have been shut since December 12 when a protest by contract workers over non-payment of wages, unexplained salary cuts and long work hours among other reasons, took a violent turn.Videos of hundreds of people setting fire to company vehicles, damaging property and screaming profanities against Wistron flooded social media and made global headlines. The incident threatened to dent Karnataka's pro-investor friendly image and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship 'make in India' campaign.At least two Karnataka government commissioned reports pointed out serious irregularities by the company and its workforce contractors who were blamed for taking a lion's share of workers wages that eventually led to the crisis."We will be delivering enhanced training programs for all workers, and have put in a place a new system for workers to get information and raise any concerns they may have, anonymously. We are looking forward to restarting our operations and welcoming back team members and we thank them for their patience and support as we worked through corrective actions," Wistron said in its statement.Apple had also suspended new businesses to Wistron after its own preliminary investigation potined to lapses and violation of its supplier code of conduct guidelines.Apple on Tuesday said that for the last eight weeks it has tried to ensure all necessary systems were in place at the Narasapura facility."A comprehensive set of corrective actions has now been completed and Wistron has restructured their recruiting team and enhanced training and support for workers," Apple said in its statement.The Cupertino, California-based company added that its employees and independent auditors will remain on site to validate that the new processes are effective."Wistron remains on probation and we will monitor their progress closely," Apple said.Senior government officials in the Karnataka industries department said that police verification of around 6000 employees was complete and updated licences had been issued to the company.The suspension of new business had given an unexpected lift to rival suppliers Foxconn and Pegatron, who are angling to capture a larger share of Apple's business orders in India as well as from other companies.The development has also come as a relief to the contract workers, as many were in hiding after Wistron made a police complaint against over 7000 people for the violence, arson and loot."I submitted all my documents 15 days ago and my verification was also done. But we are yet to receive any date of joining," said one contract worker of Wistron, requesting not to be named. The worker, who has been with the company for around six months, said that she was paid her wage dues.The worker's sibling, who was jailed for his suspected role in the violence, was not so fortunate. The father, a daily wage labourer, had to pledge his land with the court and bailed his son who claims to be innocent."I was added to a WhatsApp group and the police suspected that whoever was in that group was involved in the violence. I had gone there for my first shift and left when the violence started," said the 21-year-old contract worker."I went to work due to our problem and now I don’t even want to be part of the company," the worker added.Several others were also jailed and later let go either on bail or were let off after an investigation by the police.Though Wistron had initially pegged damages at ₹437 crore, including over ₹400 crore in stolen products, it revised the loss estimate between ₹26-52 crore after the company's share went into a free fall in the Taiwan Stock Exchange.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apple-manufacturing-partner-wistron-may-restart-karnataka-plant-next-week-101612878249594.html
09-02-2021||India||SC dismisses plea challenging colonial era provision of sedition||The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed a plea which challenged the Constitutional validity of colonial era provision of sedition under the Indian Penal Code, on the ground that it is being used to stifle freedom of speech and expression of citizens.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian dismissed the plea saying that there was no cause of action and the petitioners are not the affected parties.During the brief hearing, senior advocate Anoop George Chaudhary, appearing for the petitioners who are advocates, said that this is a public interest matter and people are being charged under the provision.The bench observed that a law cannot be challenged without appropriate cause of action.“You are not facing any prosecution under the Section. What is the cause of the action? We don't have any case before us right now. We don't have any case in front of us where somebody is rotting in jail. If someone is in jail then we will consider. Dismissed”, the bench told Chaudhary.The plea filed by three advocates Aditya Ranjan, Varun Thakur, V Elanchezhiyan said that section 124-A of IPC (sedition), the provision which was used by the British against Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak is still stifling the freedom of speech and expression in the country if they choose to express dissent against policies of the Governments in power.“It is submitted that under the continuously expanding scope of the fundamental rights, a colonial provision like section 124-A which was intended to subjugate the subjects of British crown should not be permitted to continue in a democratic republic,” the plea said.It said that a constitution bench of the top court had in 1962 upheld the validity of section 124-A of IPC in Kedar Nath Singh versus State of Bihar by reading down the provision and preferring a narrow interpretation of 'sedition' to save the provision from unconstitutionality.“However, after six decades of experience with the sedition law, it is clear that the said judgment requires reconsideration especially in the light of spate of sedition charges imposed against various persons speaking out against the governments of the day and their policies. Section 124-A has a chilling effect on any dissenting free speech and/or criticism of the government which is an essence of democracy,” it said.The plea sought declaring of section 124-A as ultra-vires of the constitution and alternatively direction to DGPs to ensure that top court's 1962 verdict is strictly followed.The lawyers in their plea submitted that the continuance of a draconian colonial provision like section 124-A in the penal code without corresponding safeguards as provided under the UAPA is “unreasonable and unwarranted”.“Neither there is any institutional responsibility on the Police in case of misuse of section 124-A of IPC nor are any procedural safeguards provided in code of Criminal Procedure unlike UAPA. Therefore, now section 124-A needs to be examined under the changed facts and circumstances and also on the anvil of ever evolving tests of necessity, proportionality and arbitrariness,” the plea said.They said that despite the interpretation of law of sedition to save it from unconstitutionality, the provision of sedition is being “grossly abused” across the geographical spectrum of this country.“Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code instils a certain chilling effect on the general public at large inasmuch as it recognises 'sedition' as a criminal offence and the consequence of committing 'sedition' are excessive damages and penalties which are substantial punishments,” the plea said.The plea said that mere slapping of charge of sedition against a citizen endangers the right to live with dignity of the person and his family members forever.It said that the media portrays the person charged as "Deshdrohi" (anti-national) whereas the seditious activities are imputed against the Government and in Hindi it may translate into "Raj Droh" (anti-government) which is not the same as "Deshdroh" and cannot be equated.“It causes chilling effect on other citizens and prevents them from exercising their fundamental right to criticize the Government and its policies through legitimate means. Our freedom fighters were charged by the Britishers under section 124-A but they were not "anti-national". The social and political stigma attached to a person charged under section 124-A is irreparable,” the plea said.It referred to the decision of top court in decriminalising section 377 of IPC in 2018 and scrapping of section 66A of IT Act in 2015, where constitutional provisions were given a re-look.“It is, therefore, imperative and the need of the hour that a colonial provision like section 124-A which is very severe and actually being misused frequently in contravention of the law laid down by this court may be tested on the anvil of the expanding scope of fundamental rights in the twenty first century,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-plea-challenging-colonial-era-provision-of-sedition-101612876579412.html

There is a shortage of 76.37 MLD water for drinking purpose," the CM told reporters.He said some areas, especially Bardez taluka which comprises North Goa tourism belt, are experiencing the shortage of drinking water.When asked about the measures being undertaken to mitigate the water crisis, Sawant said engineers of PWD have been asked to prepare a micro plan."An additional 10 MLD of water would be treated and provided to residents by March 31, which includes partial commissioning of a water treatment plant at Porvorim (near Panaji). A plan is also afoot to pump out water from abandoned pits, which were earlier used to mine iron ore in the state," the chief minister said.Lobo said the tourism belt is facing the acute shortage of drinking water as new commercial establishments have come up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-government-proposes-new-measures-to-tackle-shortage-of-drinking-water-101612876532989.html
09-02-2021||India||India backs AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot despite South Africa halt||India said on Tuesday it had no concerns over the efficacy of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine despite South Africa putting it on hold, and ordered 10 million more doses of the shot for its own huge immunisation campaign.South Africa delayed use of the vaccine after researchers found it offered minimal protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 disease caused by the country's dominant coronavirus variant.India, with the highest number of infections after the United States, has yet to detect the South African variant and will continue to use the vaccine in an inoculation drive that has covered 6.3 million front-line workers since Jan. 16."Our vaccination programme is robust and valid, and I assure you that we are going ahead with it, not worried at the moment," Vinod Kumar Paul, a top Indian vaccine official, told a news conference."We will intensify our surveillance and we will be watching other developments in due course."The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, has licenced the vaccine from AstraZeneca and Oxford University and markets it as COVISHIELD for low-and middle-income countries.India has ordered 10 million more doses of COVISHIELD on top of 11 million supplied earlier, an SII spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday. SII has agreed to sell at least 100 million doses to the government at a discounted price of 200 rupees ($2.74) each, though the government says firm orders will be staggered based on its needs, and also on vaccine shelf-life.COVISHIELD is about 72% effective, based on late-stage trials done abroad, India's drug regulator says.The country is also using the COVAXIN shot developed at home by Bharat Biotech with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Bharat Biotech has supplied 5.5 million doses to the government and is selling 4.5 million more, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.The government wants to cover 300 million people by August, reaching the elderly and those with existing conditions by March.India has reported 10.85 million infections and more than 155,000 deaths - though cases have fallen sharply since September.MAKE IN INDIAPaul said Johnson & Johnson could manufacture its shot in India. He also said many more vaccines, including Russia's Sputnik V, Cadila Healthcare's ZyCov-D and a Novavax product, were in the queue."India is fortunate to have two great made-in-India vaccines, and as many as six-seven vaccines in the pipeline and perhaps many more," he said, days after Pfizer Inc pulled an application seeking emergency-use authorisation in the country.The U.S. company had declined to immediately do a small local safety study for its shot and produce it in India, unlike the other vaccine developers.New Delhi, meanwhile, is aggressively pushing the SII and Bharat Biotech vaccines abroad as part of a diplomatic campaign to recoup ground lost to China.Bharat Biotech told Reuters it could export its vaccine to Brazil and the United Arab Emirates this week, a major success for the shot approved at home for emergency use without efficacy data from a late-stage trial.The company expects results from an ongoing trial involving 25,800 participants in India only by March, though the country's drug regulator has called the vaccine safe and effective amid criticism from doctors and health experts. A study on 26 participants has found COVAXIN effective against the UK strain of the coronavirus.Bharat Biotech has also applied to conduct a Phase III trial for COVAXIN in Brazil, which plans to import 8 million doses in February and another 12 million in March.Bharat Biotech has also sought emergency use authorisation in the Philippines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-backs-astrazeneca-covid-19-shot-despite-south-africa-halt-101612876379401.html

09-02-2021||India||India has more than 10,000 glaciers but less than 30 being monitored: Experts||Sunday's disaster in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district has put spotlight on the lack of monitoring of glaciers in the Indian Himalayan region due to various challenges.Scientists from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) Dehradun said that 25-30 glaciers are being monitored across the country which has around 10,000-15,000 glaciers.SK Rai, senior scientist with glaciology and hydrology department with WIHG said, “Of the total 10,000-15,000 glaciers that are situated in India, intense and regular monitoring is done for maximum 25 glaciers across the Indian Himalayan Region. A minuscule percentage of total glaciers are studied but there is constant effort to increase this number.”In Uttarakhand which has approximately 1,400 glaciers, less than ten are being monitored. The glaciers being monitored in Uttarakhand by scientists from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology include Gangotri, Chorabari, Dunagiri, Dokriyani and Pindari.Listing the challenges in studying and monitoring glaciers, Rai said that there are issues like lack of resource and good quality equipment which include proper snow kits for scientists which cost up to lakhs of rupees, automatic weather systems, good infrastructure like huts, good quality ropes; logistical issues like proper drivers and vehicles. He also said that regular permissions from departments concerned like forests or border areas for studying the glaciers are few of the major problems.“Only after meeting these challenges fulfilling departmental requirements can we visit the areas and stay for 15-20 days to collect data. Another very important reason for the lack of studies on glaciers is that our country has very less institutes where glaciology is taught. Other topics of sciences may be taught in 500 or more institutes but glaciology is taught in barely five institutes. As glaciers are the main source of fresh water, more research is needed in this field,” said Rai.Kalachand Sain, director of WIHG said that inaccessibility to the glacial regions is another important reason due to which not many studies are conducted.“All mapping of glaciers has been done through satellite data, but glaciers are all in high-altitude and inaccessible regions, so monitoring those areas automatically becomes difficult. Even if we have large manpower it is difficult to monitor them,” said Sain.The director further said that the area where the disaster took place in Chamoli district, there are 25 glaciers of which only a few are being monitored.“It is true that all glaciers are not covered and very few are being monitored. We are in touch with our scientists and departments concerned to increase the capacity, generate more knowledge about the glaciers, future consequences (if any) in down streams,” he added.Speaking on the importance of studying glaciers, geologist Navin Juyal, scientist who has retired from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad said that glaciers are like umbilical cords for all climate processes, especially monsoon.“Glaciers are the major drivers of climate change. Any climate variability on this planet, whether it has happened in the past or happening at present, is dictated by the movement of the glaciers. The expansion and contraction of glaciers affect monsoon, hydrological changes in the river system and many other climate variabilities. Glaciers are like umbilical cords of the climate system, as everything is linked,” said Juyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-more-than-10-000-glaciers-but-less-than-30-being-monitored-experts-101612874601355.html

09-02-2021||India||Scientists suggest early Indian monsoon forecasts could benefit farmers||Farmers in India should be provided with early forecasts of expected variations in the monsoon season in order to reduce crop losses, said a team of scientists.Researchers at the University of Reading and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) led the first-ever in-depth study into how accurately ECMWF's latest long-term global weather forecasting system can predict when the summer monsoon will start, and how much rainfall it will bring.They found the model provided accurate forecasts a month in advance for the timing of the monsoon in India's major agricultural regions. Providing this information to farmers could help them prepare earlier for unexpected heavy rainfall or extended dry periods, both of which regularly destroy crops in India.Dr Amulya Chevuturi, a monsoon researcher at the University of Reading and lead author of the study said, "The Indian monsoon brings around 80 per cent of India's annual rainfall, so even small variations in the timing of its arrival can have a huge impact on agriculture. Accurately predicting these year-to-year variations is challenging, but could be the difference between prosperity or poverty for many families."Dr Chevuturi added, "The forecasting accuracy we identified in India's main agricultural regions provides a clear opportunity for this system to make a positive difference to people's lives. A month's warning of drought or deluge is a valuable time to understand the likely impact on water availability and for farmers to make provisions to reduce the threat to food supplies.""Better forecasts save lives, and this kind of in-depth global analysis is only possible when the best scientists and leading research institutes work together for the benefit of the whole planet," Dr Chevuturi noted.The Indian monsoon season starts around 1 June every year, beginning in southwest India before spreading across the whole subcontinent. Scientists looked at 36 years' worth of monsoon data to evaluate for the first time the effectiveness of the ECMWF's latest seasonal forecasting system - SEAS5 - in predicting how the Indian monsoon would differ from the long-term average.The team compared forecasts from 1 May each year from 1981-2016 with actual observations of the monsoons that followed.Their study, published in 'Climate Dynamics', found the forecasts were accurate for the large-scale processes, like temperature and winds, that drives the monsoon rainfall across India. The study also found that SEAS5 was good at predicting early or late monsoon arrival over the important agricultural regions along the river Ganges plains and the eastern and western coasts of India.It also identified deficiencies in the system that could pave the way for model improvements, potentially providing more detailed and accurate seasonal long-term monsoon forecasts.The study showed the forecasts tended to overestimate rainfall over the mountainous Western Ghats and Himalayan regions and underestimated rainfall along the plains of the river Ganges in the north of the country and its delta at the Bay of Bengal.However, the forecasts were correct for the monsoon rainfall pattern across India, making them useful for planning purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-suggest-early-indian-monsoon-forecasts-could-benefit-farmers-101612874879530.html

I am confident of bringing the glory back to the state,” Sharmila told the reporters, after interacting with her supporters at her residence in Hyderabad.Sharmila (47), who briefly helmed the YSR Congress when her brother was in jail for 16 months after his arrest in May 2012, said the feedback she had received from her supporters was very encouraging. “Everybody felt that there is definitely a space in Telangana and scope to establish Rajanna Rayam. I will continue to interact with my followers and supporters of late YSR in all the districts of Telangana one after the other and announce my decision,” she said.Sharmila hinted at undertaking a padayatra. “We shall work out all the details in the coming days. I shall confine myself to the issues concerning Telangana,” she said.Asked whether she had the support of her brother Jagan Mohan Reddy, Sharmila said she hoped so. “He is my elder brother and I am sure he will support me in my endeavours,” she said.The ruling Telangana Rashtiya Samithi (TRS) which has an overwhelming majority of 102 lawmakers in the 119-member assembly dismissed any possible threat from a new party.Telangana food and civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar said there was absolutely no space for any other regional party in the state as long as the TRS was there. “The people won’t own up a political party launched by an Andhra leader,” he said.Earlier, addressing her followers from Nalgonda, Sharmila said the absence of her father was clearly visible in Telangana.“During his regime, the farmer lived the life of a king. His dream was to provide housing to every poor family, to see every poor student to go in for higher studies, access to and better medical facilities for every person in the state through Arogya Sri scheme in the state. I want all his dreams fulfilled,” she said.Stating that only she could bring back the golden period of her father, Sharmila said she had taken the first step in this direction. “You are aware of the ground realities and based on your feedback, I will make further moves,” she said.More than 3,000 people gathered at her residence and cheered her as she came out. They burst crackers and danced as she announced her political plans. Flex boards were erected at her residence welcoming YSR fans to strengthen her handsSenior YSR Congress party leader and advisor (public affairs) to Andhra Pradesh government Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said Sharmila had chosen to launch her own party in Telangana without paying heed to the appeals of her brother Jagan Mohan Reddy.“We were aware of her plans to launch a new political party in Telangana for the last three months. Jagan tried to convince her to drop her plans, because it will ruin our relations with Telangana. But she might have thought there was a need for a party like YSR Congress in Telangana, too,” Reddy told reporters in Amaravati.He, however, denied the rumours that there were serious differences between Jagan and his sister. “There could only be different opinions between the two on launching the new party,” he said.Reddy acknowledged that Sharmila had shouldered the responsibility of the YSRC when her brother was in jail and had undertaken a padayatra but underlined that it was because of the YSRC that she got recognition.“Jagan could have given her enough opportunities in the party, but it would have led to criticism that he was encouraging family rule,” he said.Political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said there could be a bigger force behind Sharmila’s plan to launch a new party. “I don’t think she alone can take such a big decision. There are other forces behind it definitely. It is too early to predict whether she will succeed in her attempts,” he said.Asked whether there is any space for her party in the crowded political scenario in Telangana, Nageshwar said it was too early to predict. “But one thing is certain. YSR was from Andhra Pradesh and so his family is also viewed as a Andhra family. That is precisely why YSR Congress could not succeed in expanding its footprints in Telangana. So, I doubt whether Sharmila’s party will get a different result,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-s-sister-sharmila-to-launch-new-party-in-telangana-101612870106639.html
09-02-2021||India||Farm laws: SC-appointed panel holds consultations with agro-processing industries||The Supreme Court-appointed committee on farms laws issue on Tuesday said it held consultations with agro-processing industries including ITC and Amul on the legislations.This is the sixth meeting the panel has held so far. The three-member committee is holding consultations with stakeholders both through the online mode and in person.In a statement, the committee said it held interactions with various agro-processing industries, associations and procurement agencies on Tuesday.Amid the agitation by farmers who are camping on Delhi's borders since November end, the Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws for two months and asked the committee to submit a report after consulting the stakeholders during this period.In total, 18 different stakeholder organisations participated through video conference in the detailed deliberation with the committee members, the panel said.These stakeholders included Amul, ITC, Suguna Foods, Venkateshwara Hatcheries, industry bodies CII and FICCI, as well as state-run Food Corporation of India, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA)Among sector-specific associations, Horticulture Produce Exporters Association, Seafood Exporters Association, All India Rice Miller Association, All India Rice Exporters Association, Tractor Manufacture Association, Cotton Association of India, Fertiliser Association of India, India Pulses and Grain Association and All India Poultry Feed Manufacturer Association participated in the deliberations.Representatives of the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) participated in the meeting in person."All the stakeholder participants gave their detailed views and valuable suggestions on the three farm laws," the committee said in the statement.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for over two months now seeking the repeal of the new laws introduced by the Centre last year, claiming they were pro-corporate and could weaken the mandi system.The 11 rounds of the talks between the Centre and 41 protesting farmer unions have failed to end the deadlock even though the former has offered concessions including suspension of the legislations for 18 months which the unions have rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-sc-appointed-panel-holds-consultations-with-agro-processing-industries-101612872711947.html

09-02-2021||India||India, Afghanistan ink deal for new dam, PM Modi calls for immediate ceasefire||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday called for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in Afghanistan to end a spike in violence, as the two countries signed an agreement for building a dam to supply water to Kabul city. Modi expressed concern over a surge in violence in Afghanistan at a virtual meeting with President Ashraf Ghani, saying both countries want a region free of terrorism. Ghani sought guarantees for a stable Afghanistan and, in an apparent reference to Pakistan, said the world must ask all stakeholders to “stop giving sanctuaries and stop interfering in the affairs of their neighbours”. External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Afghan counterpart Haneef Atmar signed the memorandum of understanding for building Lalandar or Shatoot dam, which will meet the drinking water needs of two million people in Kabul, provide irrigation water to nearby areas and rejuvenate irrigation and drainage networks. Also Read | Bomb attack on security outpost in Afghan’s Nangarhar, 1 cop killed, two injuredThe project is a sign of India’s continuing commitment to Afghanistan against the backdrop of the troubled peace process with the Taliban and a sustained wave of violence targeting officials, civil society activists and journalists in cities across the war-torn country. The agreement was signed on a day when eight people were killed in four targeted attacks in Kabul. “We are concerned by the increasing violence in Afghanistan. Innocent citizens, journalists and activists are being targeted in a cowardly manner. We have called for an immediate end to violence and we support an immediate comprehensive ceasefire. Violence and peace counteract each other and both cannot co-exist,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi. “From Badakhshan to Nimroz and from Herat to Kandahar, I want to assure all Afghan brothers and sisters that India is standing with you. On every step of your journey of patience, courage and resolve, India will stay with you. No external force can stop Afghanistan’s development or India-Afghanistan friendship,” he said. Modi said the two countries, as close neighbours and strategic partners, “want to see a region free from the problems of terrorism and extremism”, and New Delhi backs a peace process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. Ghani referred to India’s role in efforts to usher in peace in Afghanistan and said: “We are in an open moment of history, a moment of great opportunity and simultaneously and unfortunately, [of] great threat...” India, he added, has provided “principled support for the end state of a sovereign, democratic, united Afghanistan”. Regional and international consensus on guarantees for a stable and prosperous Afghanistan is essential, Ghani said. “We must ask the world to ask all stakeholders to respect the rules of sovereignty in international relations, stop giving sanctuaries and stop interfering in the affairs of their neighbours,” he said, in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s role in the region. He added, “Peace in Afghanistan is within grasp if parties and their backers in the Taliban embrace a true political solution, but Afghans will not submit to surrender. It must be understood that our heroic security forces are not defeated and neither have we lost our will or capacity for serving our people.” If Afghanistan is plunged into uncertainty, the “consequences for the region and the world will be dire”, Ghani warned. The Taliban have been blamed for the violence across Afghanistan. The group’s top leadership lives in Pakistan and a recent video featured top Taliban negotiator Abdul Ghani Baradar saying that the group makes all decisions regarding the peace process after consulting the leadership in Pakistan. Shahtoot dam is the second major dam being built by India in Afghanistan, after the Friendship Dam or Salma dam, inaugurated by Modi and Ghani in June 2016. The MoU on the dam reflects “India’s strong and long-term commitment towards the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and the enduring partnership between our two countries”, the external affairs ministry said. Pakistan has in the past opposed plans to build the dam on a tributary of the Kabul river that flows into its Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, saying the project will reduce the flow of water.India has completed more than 400 projects in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, and its pledges totalling $3 billion make it largest donor in the region. Last year, India shipped 75,000 tonnes of wheat as aid to Afghanistan via Iran’s Chabahar port, and it supplied 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccine on Sunday. Ghani described the donation of vaccines as “an act of exceptional generosity” and thanked India for the “gift of water” that will flow from Shahtoot dam. The new reservoir will help restore the natural beauty of Kabul that “captivated the imagination of [Mughal emperor] Babur and generations of renowned poets”, he said. Both Modi and Ghani cited author Rabindranath Tagore’s short story Kabuliwala while referring to ancient ties between the two sides and the Afghan president said: “Today, on behalf of Kabuliwalas, I would like to say a great thank you to you.” Ghani said India-backed projects – including Salma dam, the Parliament building, 1,000 annual scholarships and power transmission lines – have changed the lives of people, while an air corridor with India has been extended to more than 50 countries, and the land corridor from Chabahar to Zaranj is a “symbol of great fortitude”. Modi said these projects had strengthened India-Afghanistan friendship. “The same friendship was seen during the Covid-19 epidemic. Whether it is medicines and PPEs, or the supply of made-in-India vaccines, Afghanistan’s needs have always been important to us and will remain important,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-afghanistan-ink-deal-for-new-dam-pm-modi-calls-for-immediate-ceasefire-101612870741697.html

Gandhi said in a tweet that the Singh is "helping China make a case against India"."Why is a BJP minister helping China make a case against India? He should’ve been sacked. Not sacking him means insulting every Indian Jawan," Gandhi tweeted.Why is a BJP minister helping China make a case against India?He should’ve been sacked.Not sacking him means insulting every Indian Jawan. pic.twitter.com/8NK5nCJTG4Singh, the minister of state for transport and highways and a former four-star general, had told the media in Madurai on Sunday that the border with China has never been demarcated. He also said that both countries have crossed their perceptions of the undemarcated LAC many times.“...none of you come to know how many times we have transgressed as per our perception. Chinese media does not cover it,” Singh said, according to The Hindu newspaper.“Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done it at least 50 times,” he was quoted as saying.The Chinese foreign ministry quickly jumped on to the statement and blamed India for the ongoing border conflict along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. "It is the root cause of the tension," the spokesperson of China's foreign ministry Wang Wenbin said.“This is an unwitting confession by the Indian side. For a long time, the Indian side has conducted frequent acts of trespass in the border area in an attempt to encroach on China’s territory and constantly created disputes and frictions, which is the root cause of the tensions at the China-India border,” he said.“We urge the Indian side to follow through on the consensus, agreements and treaties it reached with China, and uphold peace and stability... with concrete actions,” he added.India has repeatedly blamed China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of provoking and transgressing across the LAC.Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs (MEA), had earlier spelt out the Indian government’s position on the tension and the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.India and China are enganed in a standoff in eastern Ladakh along the LAC, following aggressive actions by the Chinese army. The two sides have held nine rounds of commander-level talks. Twenty Indian soldiers had laid down their lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed during a clash in the Galwan Valley in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-attacks-vk-singh-for-lac-statement-says-he-should-ve-been-sacked-101612868568835.html

The government has also aggressively pushed locally-made vaccines abroad as part of a diplomatic campaign."Mostly yes," a Bharat Biotech spokeswoman told Reuters when asked if exports to the two countries could begin this week as reported by local media.The company expects results from an ongoing trial involving 25,800 participants in India only by March, though the country's drug regulator has called the vaccine safe and effective amid criticism from doctors and health experts. A study on 26 participants has found COVAXIN effective against the UK strain of the coronavirus.Bharat Biotech has also applied to conduct a Phase III trial for COVAXIN in Brazil, which plans to import 8 million doses of it in February and another 12 million in March.Bharat Biotech has also sought emergency use authorisation in the Philippines.The company has supplied 5.5 million doses to the Indian government and is selling 4.5 million more, the spokeswoman added.India has also ordered 10 million more doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India (SII), a company spokesman told Reuters. SII is mainly manufacturing the shot for low-and middle-income countries.INDIA CAMPAIGNThe two shots have been used in what India calls the world's biggest immunisation programme to cover 300 million people by August, starting with healthcare and other workers to reach the elderly and those with existing conditions by March.SII, the world's biggest vaccine maker, had supplied 11 million doses for the inoculation drive, which has covered 6.3 million front-line workers since it began on Jan. 16."The second order is already in place, it's for 10 million doses," an SII spokesman said, adding that the figure was part of the 100 million doses the company has agreed to sell to the government for 200 rupees ($2.74) each.India's drug regulator says SII's COVISHIELD vaccine is about 72% effective.The regulator is expected to approve Russia's Sputnik V and Cadila Healthcare's ZyCov-D vaccines in the next few months.India's infections rose 9,110 in the last 24 hours to stand at 10.85 million, the world's highest tally after the United States, though they have fallen sharply from a mid-September peak of nearly 100,000.The health ministry said a daily toll of less than 100 deaths over the last four days took the total to more than 155,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-exports-of-country-s-homegrown-bharat-biotech-covid-shot-likely-this-week-101612867031275.html
09-02-2021||India||Have extended only issue-based support to BJP: Kumaraswamy||The Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S), on Tuesday allied with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to have its leader Basavaraj Horatti elected as the chairman of Karnataka Legislative Council. JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy spoke to Sharan Poovanna about the development two years after he lost power to the BJP in the state, the implications of the anti-cattle slaughter legislation, and the way forward for the regional party. Edited excerpts: Why did you ally with the BJP for the chairmanship?Horatti is the senior-most MLC [member of the legislative council] and has won elections for 42 years straight. When I was chief minister, we requested the Congress to give the chairmanship to our party since they had the Speaker’s post. The Congress did not accept the request. Later, we had the same discussion with the BJP, and it agreed that Horatti should be made the chairman. He has one year left [in his tenure] and will carry out the duties efficiently.Will this alliance extend beyond the council?There is no question of any other alliance... We supported them for the deputy chairman’s post, and they backed us for the chairman. We have extended only issue-based support. We will back any government scheme or programme that benefits the people and will oppose anything that harms the state. We will continue to oppose bills that are not for the people’s benefit. This alliance is non-binding.The alliance helped the passage of the anti-cattle slaughter bill...We were not soft on this bill and opposed it from the beginning. We wanted to bring in an amendment, but Congress...protested and created a ruckus, and the deputy chairman took up the bill and passed it through a voice vote.Also Read | Kannada has been ignored: Kumaraswamy accuses ShahHow will you oppose the anti-cattle slaughter legislation now?The reasons given by the government cannot be believed. They say that the cost of maintaining one cow in a shelter is Rs17.50. Is this believable? It costs over Rs150-200 per cow per day. The promises made by the BJP that it will build more shelters and make allocations in the budget is a way for them to make money. Nothing else. This bill will have a big impact on the farming community. We will see the reactions coming in from the farming community. When a new government comes in, they can repeal this legislation.How will you justify the alliance ahead of the local and assembly by-polls?Make no mistake. It is still a triangular fight in Karnataka. We also know that Congress is our main rival where we are present and not the BJP. There is no question of an alliance for seats. We will fight on our own. But there are places where the BJP and Congress are in alliance and places where the BJP and JD(S) are in the alliance... Such local alliances have existed based on local equations.The Congress has called yours a “party of convenience”. How would you respond?Why does not this apply to Congress? When the state delivered a fractured verdict [in 2018], the Congress asked for an alliance. We did not go to them. They are a national party, who allied with a regional party for their own convenience to keep the BJP out. We also went along for our own reasons.In 2018, you said the Congress is more dangerous than the BJP. Do you still stand by this statement?I continue to endorse this view.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-extended-only-issue-based-support-to-bjp-kumaraswamy-101612866656672.html

These people were trapped in the 12-ft-high and about 2.5-km-long 'head race tunnel' (HRT) after the water came rushing in following a glacier burst.Also Read: 31 bodies recovered in Uttarakhand, 175 still missingThe tunnel has become the focal point of rescue operations.Teams of the Army, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and Uttarakhand Police are trying to clear the pathway of the tunnel so that these people can be taken out safely."Clearing of debris and slush continued the whole night. About 120 metres of the tunnel entrance stretch is now clear," ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said in Delhi on Tuesday.Also Watch: CM meets affected villagers, undertakes aerial surveyGiving details about the ongoing rescue operation near the tunnel, Uttarakhand Police chief Ashok Kumar said that they are taking help of technology."A Hyderabad-based team has got a remote sensing device that can detect debris up to 500 metres deep in the ground. We are using the device with the help of a chopper," said Kumar."We can't estimate exact time to remove debris as there's 90-degrees turn in the tunnel. We've asked project engineers to make alternative entry to reach through. We'll attempt this today," he added.The Director general of Police also ruled out that there is a decrease in the oxygen level. "I don't think there'll be insufficient oxygen and water as the tunnel is 2.5 kilometre long," said Kumar.The missing people include those working at NTPC's 480 MW Tapovan-Vishnugad project and the 13.2 MW Rishiganga Hydel Project and villagers whose homes nearby were washed away."93 NTPC workers are missing, 39 are still stuck in the tunnel.

Here's a list of probables||With the tenure of Ghulam Nabi Azad in Rajya Sabha nearing an end, the Congress party is busy in deciding who is going to be the next Leader of Opposition (LoP). Azad's term is ending on February 15.According to Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan, former finance minister P Chidambaram and former Railway minister Mallikarjun Khadge are the frontrunners. Khadge has held the position of LoP in the Lok Sabha and been the party's voice on many issues in the Lower House.Deputy Leader of Opposition Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal are the other senior leaders who might be considered for the post, but they have raised voice in the past suggesting overhaul of the party and that could be an issue, Livehindustan reported.The Congress, however, is keen to bring Azad back to the Upper House. A senior party leader, who did not wish to be named, earlier told HT that Azad could be nominated from Kerala in April when three members from the state retire.Azad was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Jammu and Kashmir in 2015. But now that it has turned into a union territory, there's a possibility that Azad will have to leave his home state in order to come back to Rajya Sabha.Meanwhile, in his farewell speech on Tuesday, Azad said that he is proud to be and Indian Muslim. "I am among those fortunate people who never went to Pakistan. When I read about circumstances in Pakistan, I feel proud to be a Hindustani Muslim."Watch: ‘Proud to be a Hindustani Muslim’, says Azad"If any Muslim should feel proud in the world, it should be the Indian Muslim. Over the years, we have seen how Muslims countries from Afghanistan to Iraq getting destroyed. There are no Hindus or Christians there - they are fighting amongst themselves," he added.The 71-year-old summed up his more than four-decade-old political career in few Urdu couplets and a brief speech.Before his speech, an emotional Prime Minister Narendra Modi bid adieu to Azad, recalling his contribution to the country, the House and also his party.PM Modi also said that the person who will replace Azad as Leader of Opposition "will have difficulty matching his work because he was not only concerned about his party but also about the country and the House".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-could-replace-azad-as-leader-of-opposition-in-rs-list-of-probables-101612862440112.html

Trans fats are largely present in partially hydrogenated vegetable fats/oils, vanaspati, margarine and bakery shortenings, and can be found in baked and fried foods.Research has shown that higher intakes of industrially produced trans fatty acids are associated with increased risk of high cholesterol and heart diseases. According to 2017 estimates, every year at least 1.5 million deaths in India are due to coronary heart disease, of which nearly 5% (71,000) are due to trans fats intake.The regulation excludes trans-fatty acids from dairy, meat, fish and their products.World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2018, had also called for elimination of industrially-produced trans-fat from the food supply by 2023.“To facilitate the transition towards a Trans Fatty Acids free food supply, FSSAI is also building capacities of the industry and in this regard, recently concluded a series of webinars on trans fats. Each webinar was planned to target specific stakeholders focusing on challenges faced by them towards making a shift to trans-fat-free products and suggesting practical technological solutions through talks delivered by national and international experts,” FSSAI said.The webinars were attended by nearly 3,700 participants from the edible oil industry, food businesses, bakers, chefs, restaurateur and hoteliers, sweet and namkeen manufacturers, food analysts from food analytical laboratories and academic institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aim-to-limit-use-of-industrial-trans-fats-by-2022-says-fssai-101612862276623.html

A Bharat Biotech spokeswoman said it was selling 4.5 million more.India's drug regulator says SII's COVISHIELD vaccine is about 72% effective, while Bharat Biotech says COVAXIN’s last-stage trial results are expected by March.The regulator is expected to approve Russia's Sputnik V and Cadila Healthcare's ZyCov-D vaccines in the next few months.India's infections rose 9,110 in the last 24 hours to stand at 10.85 million, the world's highest tally after the United States, though they have fallen sharply from a mid-September peak of nearly 100,000.The health ministry said a daily toll of less than 100 deaths over the last four days took the total to more than 155,000.

09-02-2021||India||SC issues notice to Centre on transfer plea seeking minority status for Hindus in 6 states and 2 UTs||The Supreme Court Tuesday sought government's reply on a plea, seeking transfer of cases from several high courts to it against the Centre's notification to declare five communities — Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsees — as minorities even in those states and UTs where they are in majority.A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notices to ministry of home affairs, ministry of law and justice, and ministry of minority affairs.The high courts at Delhi, Meghalaya and Guwahati are seized of the petitions challenging the Constitutional validity of section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, under which the notification was issued on October 23, 1993.The notification had declared the five communities as minorities across the country, leading to a situation where majority population of Sikhs in Punjab and Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir are availing of the benefits meant for minorities, the transfer petition alleged.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by lawyer and BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay seeking transfer of all cases from high courts to the apex court for an authoritative pronouncement on the issue.Senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan appeared for Upadhyay in the matter.The petition, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, said that in order to avoid multiplicity of litigations and conflicting views, the transfer plea has been moved before the apex court.Arbitrary and irrational disbursement of minority benefits to majority infringes upon the fundamental right to the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, the plea said.The petition said the Hindus, who are a majority community according to national data, are a minority in several north-eastern states besides Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. However, the Hindu community is deprived of the benefits that are available to the minority communities in these states, the plea said, adding that the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) should reconsider the definition of minority in this context.The plea has sought to declare section 2(c) of the NCM Act 1992 void and inoperative for being arbitrary, unreasonable and offending.The definition of minority, according to Article 29-30 of the Constitution, has left leakages in the hands of the State, which shall be misused and are being misused for political benefits, the petition said, adding that the minority status be granted to Hindus in states where the number of the community members has decreased.The plea has sought the minority status for Hindus in six states and two Union territories, where the number of the community members has fallen according to Census 2011. The petition has stated that according to the 2011 Census, Hindus are a minority in six states — Mizoram (2.75 per cent), Nagaland (8.75 per cent), Meghalaya (11.53 per cent), Arunachal Pradesh (29 per cent), Manipur (31.39 per cent), Punjab (38.40 per cent) — and in the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir (28.44 per cent) and Lakshadweep (2.5 per cent).Their minority rights are being siphoned off illegally and arbitrarily to the majority population because neither the Centre nor the state governments have notified Hindus as a ''minority'' under the National Commission for Minorities Act.Therefore, Hindus are being deprived of their basic rights, the plea has said. It has pointed out that Christians are in majority in Mizoram, Meghalaya, and Nagaland and there is a significant Christian population in Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Kerala, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, but they are treated as a minority community.Likewise, Sikhs are in majority in Punjab and there is a significant Sikh population in Delhi, Chandigarh and Haryana, but they are treated as a minority community, it said. Muslims are a majority in Lakshadweep (96.20 per cent), Jammu and Kashmir (68.30 per cent) and there is a significant representation of the community in Assam (34.20 per cent), West Bengal (27.5 per cent), Kerala (26.60 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (19.30 per cent) and Bihar (18 per cent).However, they are enjoying the minority status and communities, which are real minorities, are not getting their legitimate share, jeopardising their basic rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, the petition has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-transfer-plea-seeking-minority-status-for-hindus-in-6-states-and-2-uts-101612860307008.html

The worst disaster to hit the region in eight years struck when a glacier breach under the Nanda Devi, the country’s second-highest peak, sent a torrent of water, rock, and dust down a valley into the Rishiganga river, where workers were building a dam.Officials said earlier on Monday night, 26 bodies were recovered. Out of 206 missing persons, mostly workers from two dam projects sites, about 175 remain untraceable.Also Read | Central agencies and state monitoring situation in Uttarakhand: Amit ShahPraveen Alok, an SDRF spokesman, said, “Till Tuesday noon, 31 bodies were recovered including five from the river on Tuesday morning.

They include 173 workers from the dam sites, mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, 12 villagers, and two policemen.On Tuesday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat visited the 13 villages and also met the injured in the army hospital in Joshimath near the disaster site.The government is providing ration packets and other relief material to 2,500 people of these villages by air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-glacier-burst-31-bodies-recovered-175-still-missing-101612860179536.html
09-02-2021||India||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar expands Cabinet, 17 new ministers inducted today||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar expanded his Cabinet on Tuesday ahead of the Budget session with the induction of 17 new ministers. This takes the total number of ministers in the state Cabinet to 30, with six more berths remaining vacant. Governor Phagu Chouhan administered the oath of office to the new ministers – nine from the BJP and eight from the JD(U) – at a function at the Raj Bhavan. Former Union minister and national spokesperson of the BJP Shahnawaz Hussain, who was recently elected to the legislative council, was the first to take oath. He was followed by JD(U)’s Shravan Kumar and Madan Sahni. Apart from the chief minister, others gracing the occasion included deputy CMs Tar Kishore Prasad and Renu Devi, Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, legislative council chairman Avadhesh Narayan Singh, and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi. Leader of the Opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav could not make it as he is reportedly in Delhi. What is significant about the expansion is that several new faces, especially from the BJP, have found their way in the Cabinet. Leaders like Prem Kumar and Nand Kishore Yadav, who were part of all previous NDA governments, have not found a place this time, while Sushil Kumar Modi has been sent to the Rajya Sabha. From the last Cabinet, BJP has retained only two ministers this time – Mangal Pandey and Pramod Kumar. On the other hand, JD(U) has retained several old guards. Also Read | Bihar CM Nitish Kumar appeals to firm to complete PMCH facility within 5 yearsJD(U) has accommodated two new faces, Sumit Singh, who won from Chakai as an independent candidate and extended support, and Jama Khan, who won on the BSP ticket from Chainpur but recently joined the party. Khan is the lone Muslim face from the JD(U) in the Cabinet, while Singh is the youngest. The party has also given an opportunity to first-time MLAs --former DG Sunil Kumar and Jayant Raj. Bihar BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal said the Cabinet expansion was done with a view to give pace to Bihar’s development, in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s expectations and plans for the eastern region. “Talent has been given preference and social and regional balance have been kept in mind. Generational change is quite natural,” he added. BJP insiders admit the gradual generational shift in the party, with more room for new and younger leaders, started soon after the Lok Sabha election with the surprise elevation of Dr Sanjay Jaiswal as the Bihar party president. After the expansion, all eyes will now be on the nomination on 12 seats of the state legislative council from the Governor’s quota, which has remained vacant since May 2020. BJP has also inducted former MP Janak Ram in the Cabinet. Ram is not a member of any House and would need to be accommodated in the council. JD(U)’s Ashok Choudhary is not a member of any House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-expands-cabinet-17-new-ministers-inducted-today-101612859456487.html

The process of elections was not followed since the Congress did not participate. Deputy chairman MK Pranesh said Horatti was elected unanimously since the Congress did not even field a candidate. The developments come days after the BJP and JD(S) formalised their alliance in the Upper House of the legislature to first elect Pranesh as deputy chairman and then remove Congress’s Pratapchandra Shetty to take control of the council where they do not have a majority on their own. The BJP has 31 members in the council, JD(S) has 11 and the Congress has 28 members in the Upper House. The BJP had allied with the JD(S) with whom it has shared a tempestuous relationship to muster support for easy passage of bills and retain a majority in both the Houses of the legislature.Also Read | PM Modi offered me chief ministership for 5 years if JD(S) allied with BJP: KumaraswamyThe contentious anti-cattle slaughter bill was passed on Monday amid ruckus in the council. Though the JD(S) were also protesting against the bill, the deputy chairman passed the bill through a voice vote and rejected demands for a division of votes. However, people aware of the developments said that the JD(S) would not object to the bill due to the new alliance with which the two parties hope to gain against their common rival, the Congress. The JD(S) has tried to maintain that the party had only extended an “issue-based support”. Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led JD(S) is the only major political outfit in the state that has allied with both the Congress and BJP in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jds-leader-elected-chairperson-of-karnataka-legislative-council-101612857476487.html

Azad had earlier received a wholehearted adieu from leaders across the political spectrum with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that the Congress leader had distinguished himself in Parliament and was not only concerned about the party but also cared about the country.“I am among those fortunate people who never went to Pakistan. When I read about circumstances in Pakistan, I feel proud to be a Hindustani Muslim,” Azad said during his farewell speech in the Rajya Sabha. The veteran Congress leader is set to retire from the Upper House on February 15 along with three other leaders from Jammu and Kashmir - Shamsher Singh, Nazir Ahmed Laway and Mohammad Fayaz.Also Read| A salute, effusive praise in PM's emotional farewell to Ghulam Nabi AzadTalking about his first public meeting in Sopore as Jammu and Kashmir’s chief minister, the 71-year old Azad cited his remarks where he stated that his government would be for the people and he would feel ashamed if any of his ministers did justice on the basis of religion, caste or the political party. Azad also thanked former prime minister late Indira Gandhi and politician late Sanjay Gandhi in his speech, saying he was able to reach this platform because of them.PM Modi during his farewell to Azad got emotional as he remembered a terrorist attack in which some people from Gujarat were stuck in J-K. He said that Azad constantly followed up and was concerned about the people. “I will never forget Shri Azad’s efforts and Shri Pranab Mukherjee’s efforts when people from Gujarat were stuck in Kashmir due to a terror attack. Ghulam Nabi Ji was constantly following up, he sounded as concerned as if those stuck were his own family member,” the Prime Minister said.Requesting the Congress leader to remain in the house, Union minister and Republican Party of India (RPI) chief Ramdas Athawale said that he was ready to bring Azad back if the Congress party wouldn’t do it. “You should return to the House. If Congress doesn’t bring you back, then, we are ready to do it.

09-02-2021||India||Misinformation may hit vaccination drive: Study||Misinformation about vaccines could threaten the goal of herd immunity to Covid-19, according to the findings of a first-of-its-kind experiment in which thousands of people in the US and UK became less willing to take doses once they were exposed to myths about vaccine safety and potential harm.The researchers carried out a randomised controlled trial with 8,001 people, of which 6,001 (split into groups of 3,000 in the UK and 3,001 in the US) were exposed to misinformation and their willingness to take a vaccine was recorded before and after the exposure. They found that willingness to take a vaccine dropped by an aggregate of 6.2 percentage points in the UK and 6.4 points in the US. “The most crucial takeaway is that we need to be cautious about the role of misinformation on uptake rates. While it’s unlikely to have an overwhelming impact, it might serve to lower immunisation rates enough to threaten herd immunity goals,” Alex de Figueiredo, one of the lead authors, told HT over email. Figueiredo is the statistics lead on the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).Vaccine scepticism has been a persistent problem in several countries for years, but it is now a centre-stage issue since widespread inoculation at present is the only way to beat back the pandemic. The study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour on Friday, is the first to use a randomised controlled trial to quantify how misinformation can make this worse.The authors found that while willingness decreased across all groups – whether split by age, gender, or educational qualifications – there were some differences among groups. “Some groups in the US appear to be more vulnerable to Covid-19 vaccine misinformation, such as women and high-income groups; while Jewish respondents are more robust than Christians in the UK,” said Imperial College London researcher Sahil Loomba, who also led the study.“Also, while there is no evidence that individuals who trust health authorities or scientists are any more or less likely to be impacted by misinformation, trust in non-expert sources of info seemed to be relevant. In particular, trust in celebrities in the UK is associated with robustness, whereas trust in family and friends in the US is associated with susceptibility to misinformation,” Loomba said to HT in an interaction over email.Misinformation on online media has arisen as a growing threat on multiple aspects, including politics and law and order. In 2017. Misinformation spread through communication tools triggered a spate of lynchings in Indian villages when people were falsely led to believe that gangs were out to abduct children. Similarly, targeted falsified information, or disinformation, is believed to have manipulated to some extent the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016.“There has been widely circulating false information about the pandemic on social media platforms, such as that 5G mobile networks are linked with the virus, that vaccine trial participants have died after taking a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, and that the pandemic is a conspiracy or a bioweapon,” the researchers note in their paper.The problem appears to be less acute in India, but the effects still demonstrate the risks. “Indeed, India also seems to have high confidence in a Covid-19 vaccine. We recently analysed data from a 32 country survey on intent to accept a vaccine and India ranked second with 90.7% (95% credible interval, 88.1 to 93.2) of respondents stating that they would “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine. India was only behind Vietnam (96.8%),” said Figueiredo.In India, the average turnout during the coronavirus vaccination that began on January 16 has hovered around 50% of the targets. Health ministry data from February 7 showed there had been 5.8 million vaccinations in 116,478 sessions. This translates to roughly 50 people turning up for each session on average, against a target of 100.Loomba said that effect of misinformation appeared to be correlated to the message seeming scientific. “For example, the image with the largest impact on UK respondents had shared the following: “scientists have expressed doubts over the effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine that has been rushed to human trials, after all the monkeys used in initial testing later contracted coronavirus,” which espouses concerns of vaccine safety upon “rushed” procedures.” This, he said, could be similar to a case where the approval of some vaccines may have appeared rushed, or the conversations around them focussed on serious side-effects. “It is crucial that any vaccine candidate must prove safe and efficacious as per established standards of scientific scrutiny before receiving regulatory approval, else it may induce undue vaccine hesitancy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misinformation-may-hit-vaccination-drive-study-101612855795529.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued a notice on the petitions filed by Tharoor, Sardesai and five other journalists to quash the multiple first information reports (FIRs) pending against them in several states.The top court said the stay on the arrest will continue till the next date of hearing, after two weeks, and also issued notices to Delhi Police and Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Haryana.Also read | 'Can't condone': Tharoor says farmers' flag on Red Fort is 'unfortunate'The Delhi Police opposed the stay. "We will show the horrendous effect these tweets have had. These Twitter handles have lakhs of followers," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for Delhi Police, said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was representing Tharoor, said that interim protection was needed as the Congress leader is in Delhi and the charge is serious. "The investigating agency can arrest me anytime," Sibal said.The top court bench asked Mehta, "We will hear you. But are you going to arrest him?" Mehta replied, "We know our responsibility." He assured that he will convey the assurance to other states.But the bench noted that Mehta was representing just the Delhi Police. "Issue notice. Stay of arrest in the meantime. List after two weeks," said the bench also comprising Justice AS Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian.Mrinal Pande, Zafar Agha, Paresh Nath, Anant Nath and Vinod Jose are among the other journalists.The Delhi Police lodged a case on January 30 against Tharoor, Sardesai and several others for alleged misreporting and spreading disharmony. Simultaneously, cases were lodged at Gurugram in Haryana and in Madhya Pradesh under serious charges of sedition besides provisions of promoting enmity, making assertions prejudicial to national integration under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), among other provisions under the Information Technology Act.Tharoor and Sardesai had petitioned the top court challenging the registration of FIRs against him in several states and for quashing of the criminal cases against them. They had sought protection of their fundamental right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. They had stated that the multiple FIRs against them were a malafide exercise that was politically motivated as the contents of the FIRs were identical. The other people who have been named in these FIRs also have reportedly approached the top court seeking similar relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-arrest-of-shashi-tharoor-rajdeep-and-5-other-journalists-101612853461913.html
09-02-2021||India||Japanese PM Suga and Abe to be invited for launch of Kashi convention centre||Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga and his predecessor Shinzo Abe will be invited for the inauguration of Kashi’s International Cooperation and Convention Centre, also known as Varanasi convention centre Rudraksha, said officials.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the Rudraksha Convention Centre after March 2021, said Deepak Agarwal, divisional commissioner, Varanasi, however, a date for the inauguration is yet to be fixed by the prime minister’s office (PMO), he said.Invitation to attend the inaugural ceremony will be sent to Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga and his predecessor Abe by the government of India. The inauguration of the Varanasi convention centre is most likely in April this year.Construction work of the Rudraksha centre will be completed by the end of February. Thereafter, its trial will be done in March. The trial has to be completed by March 31, said divisional commissioner.Varanasi Municipal Commissioner Gaurang Rathi said that an agreement has been signed with ISWHC to operate the convention centre for 10 years. It has been given a target to generate ₹one crore revenue from the convention centre annually.The Kashi convention centre project was worth over ₹182 crore and was designed by Japanese architect Yoko Saka. It has a seating capacity of 1,200 and is equipped with state of the art facilities including high-tech parking. The convention centre has been built near Varanasi Nagar Nigam office.Shinzo Abe gifted Rudraksha Convention Centre to Kashi during his visit to the ancient city in December 2015 as the Japanese Prime Minister.Later in September 2017, Modi named the centre as Rudraksh, the symbol of love and ‘prasad’ of Lord Shiva.PM Narendra Modi and the then Japanese PM Abe conceived the centre during their visit to the holy city in December 2015, a fact revealed by PM Modi at the September 2017 launch of the convention centre’s design in Ahmedabad.“You know that the ancient and holy city of Varanasi is my second home. The project of Varanasi Convention Centre is a symbol of cultural co-operation between Kyoto city of Japan and Varanasi. It was conceived by Prime Minister Abe and I, when we visited Varanasi together in 2015,” PM Modi had said at that time.Also Read: PM Modi talks to health workers to dispel fears over vaccines“I have named it Rudraksh – the symbol of love, and the Prasad of Lord Shiva to humanity.

It held a live demonstration on Monday to show how it is possible.The dogs were trained on specific biomarkers emanating from urine and sweat samples of Covid-19 positive patients.“Scientifically, it is evident that affected body tissues release unique volatile metabolic biomarkers which are used as disease signatures for detection of disease by the medical detection dogs,” said the Army in a statement.“Various countries like Britain, Finland, Russia, France, UAE, Germany, Lebanon have started training dogs for Covid-19 detection by screening passengers at airports and railway stations.”Also Read | Indian military sees threefold increase in women personnel in 6 yearsTaking a leaf out of the global trends of using medical detection dogs for diseases like cancer, malaria, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, etc, the Army has undertaken trials for the detection of Covid-19 using dogs in controlled conditions, it said.Positive and suspected samples were obtained from Military Hospital, Meerut Cantonment, and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Subharti Medical College, Meerut, for the purpose of training.According to Army vets, a concerted effort was made to train an indigenous Chippiparai and a Cocker Spaniel dog to detect the volatilome of Covid-19 disease by comparatory method.“The sensitivity and specificity of both the dogs obtained from the screening of 279 urine and 267 sweat samples during the initial trial procedure were found to be very high,” the statement said.After training, the dogs were deployed at a Transit Camp in Delhi for the screening of transients moving to the operational areas through the transit camp.At least 3,000 samples have been screened so far. To date, 18 samples have been found positive by detection dogs.“From the trials and operational deployment, it has been inferred that Covid-19 volatile metabolic biomarkers are within the threshold limit of olfactory detection capability of trained dog and can help in quick and real-time detection of disease. Keeping in mind the success of the trial, more dogs have been incorporated in training for Covid-19 detection,” the statement said.It is probably the first time that the olfactory capability of canines has been exploited to detect tissues infected with pathogens releasing volatile metabolic biomarkers.“The use of such canines in the detection of Covid-19 can assist in quick and real-time detection of the disease. The effort will turn out to be the part of detectable disease signatures, thereby paving the way forward for real-time detection of various medical diseases by use of trained medical detection dog,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-trains-dogs-to-detect-covid19-101612853876168.html

Speaking about Azad, the Prime Minister said that he was ‘worried’ that whoever succeeds the senior Congress MP will have big boots to fill. “Whoever succeeds Ghulam Nabi Ji will face great difficulties in matching up to him. This is because while Azad Ji was concerned about his party, he was equally concerned about the House and the country,” PM Modi said, adding that he also places the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who is also a member of the Upper House, in this ‘category.’Azad is currently the Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House.The Prime Minister then recalled a meeting of floor leaders he was to chair during the coronavirus crisis. The same day, PM Modi recalled, he got a call from Azad and quoted the Congress leader as saying, “It’s good what you are doing Modi Ji, but please also call a meeting of leaders of all parties.” “I did what he advised me to do,” he said.

The summit between Modi and Ghani will be held at 1.15pm and an agreement on building Shahtoot Dam in the Kabul river basin is on the agenda, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The dam was part of new development initiatives unveiled by India last November. India is also taking up 150 community projects worth $80 million in Afghanistan, part of measures to take development to small communities through schemes that have a direct impact on the lives of the people. Also Read | Pakistani Taliban reunified splinter groups in Afghanistan, poses threat: UNShahtoot Dam will provide drinking water to two million residents of Kabul city and also feed irrigation projects. It will build on the 202-km Pul-e-Khumri electricity transmission line built in 2009 to provide power to Kabul. These initiatives come against the backdrop of mounting global concern over increased attacks by the Taliban even as it engages the Afghan government in talks in Qatar. The new Biden administration in the US has said it is reviewing an agreement signed with the Taliban last year, and a final decision is yet to be made on completing the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan by May. While announcing India’s commitment to build the dam last November, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told a virtual international pledging conference that India is committed to a long-term role for the development of Afghanistan. India’s development portfolio for Afghanistan is worth more than $3 billion, with officials saying much of the funds are aimed at building the capabilities of the Afghan people and institutions in order to improve governance. India has so far completed more than 400 projects across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. India is also among the countries that have expressed concern at the spike in violence in Afghanistan, much of it targeting officials, civil society activists and journalists. Cities across Afghanistan have witnessed a wave of targeted bombings and assassinations. New Delhi has backed a peace process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled, while calling for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure peace and stability in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modighani-virtual-meet-today-india-afghanistan-to-sign-agreement-on-new-dam-101612852796351.html
09-02-2021||India||Belong to the family of leaders like ex-VP: Mukhtar Ansari to SC||Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari has, in the Supreme Court, accused the Uttar Pradesh government of conspiring to kill him in a “state-sponsored encounter”, while emphasising that he was part of a family that contributed immensely to India’s freedom struggle and gave leaders such as former vice-president Hamid Ansari. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Mau in the UP assembly also opposed the Yogi Adityanath government’s plea in the top court to shift him back to the state for trial in 14 criminal cases from a jail in Punjab, where he is presently lodged in connection with an extortion case.“There is a grave threat and impending danger to the life of the respondent in the state of UP under the present political regime. The present petition is merely to seek a death warrant on the life of the respondent (Ansari),” Ansari’s affidavit read.Invoking his pedigree, Ansari said that he was a “part of a family that has made immense contribution to the Indian freedom movement and has given India many leaders in the form of Shri Muhammad Hamid Ansari who was the vice president of India, Shri Shaukatullah Ansari who served as the governor of Odisha, Justice Asif Ansari who was the judge of the Allahabad high court, and his own father Subhanullah Ansari who was a freedom fighter and social worker.”Contending that a free and fair trial was not possible in UP where various BJP leaders have issued open threats to his life in complicity with the state government, Ansari said that his “personal custody is being sought only with the intent of killing him” since trials could go on through video-conferencing as well.“The respondent ought not be brought physically to the state of UP as it will amount to being a death warrant for him,” the affidavit read. “The petitioner’s (UP’s) insistence on personal appearance of the respondent in the state of UP itself gives credence to the fact that his life is in grave danger and he will be killed if he is physically produced there,” he said, naming BJP MLAs Brijesh Singh and his nephew Sushil Singh from UP as the ones who had been reportedly trying to eliminate him. The court fixed the matter for a detailed hearing on February 24 and asked the UP government to submit its replies to the affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/belong-to-the-family-of-leaders-like-ex-vp-mukhtar-ansari-to-sc-101612852418439.html

She repeatedly stopped to greet her supporters, who had gathered in large numbers to welcome her along the route that normally takes six hours to cover.Sasikala announced her return to politics during the journey after serving a four-year jail sentence in a disproportionate assets case and recovering from Covid-19. She called for a united AIADMK to challenge a common rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which has been out of power since 2011. The AIADMK has maintained she will not be re-inducted into the party. The AIADMK expelled Sasikala, who was a close aide to late former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, while she was in prison.AIADMK’s breakaway faction, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), and her loyalists within the party she cultivated over her three-decade association with Jayalalithaa organised the reception for her. Seven AIADMK members, including the one who lent his car to Sasikala, were expelled from the party on Monday night for the reception.

Among those with the syndrome, 90% needed oxygen support with one in three needing mechanical ventilators, according to a recently published study from the hospital in the Journal of Tropical Medicine. This is much higher compared to just 4.16% of the patients with Covid-19 who needed mechanical ventilation as per data shared by the Union health ministry in June, when the pandemic was still spreading in India. Also Read | India records 9,110 new Covid-19 cases, 78 deaths; tally over 10.8 millionMIS-C is a serious condition that appears to be linked to the Covid-19 infection; it results in various severe inflammation of organs and tissues, such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes. The study followed the trajectory of infection and symptoms of 41 children between the ages of 0 and 12 years admitted to Safdarjung Hospital between April and July with coronavirus disease. The study shows that almost half of them developed the severe inflammatory condition. According to experts, this is surprising as the condition is thought to be rare. The study found that mortality was also higher in children who developed the syndrome. As per the study, around 60% of the children died in comparison to just one of the children without MIS-C dying due to Covid-19. The researchers stated, “Delay in diagnosis and referral may have adversely affected the prognosis and outcome.” The researchers had started collecting data on MIS-C to address the paucity of data on the condition from India, with most of the data so far coming from Europe, USA or China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-1-in-3-kids-with-inflammatory-syndrome-needed-ventilator-says-study-101612846495740.html

He also pointed out there will be changes in the final rules.The Union labour ministry is in the process to finalise the rules under the four labour codes, Code on Wages, Industrial Relations, Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSH) and Social Security Codes. “The rule making process is already underway and likely to complete in the coming week. All stakeholders are also consulted in the framing of rules.

09-02-2021||India||Indian military sees threefold increase in women personnel in 6 years||The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened for them at a steady pace, latest government figures showed. There are 9,118 women currently serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government told Parliament on Monday. The headcount of women officers in the armed forces hovered around 3,000 in 2014-15. Since then, the government has taken a raft of measures to empower women, including allowing them to fly fighter planes, naval aircraft and giving them permanent commission in different branches. Excluding the medical wing in which women have been serving for decades, the army accounts for 6,807 women officers, the air force 1,607 and the navy 704 women officers. In percentage terms, women still form a small part of the military—0.56% of the army, 1.08% of the air force and 6.5% of the navy. Also Read | Army prepared to take on the security challenges, says top generalThere has been an increase in the number of women personnel in the armed forces (excluding medical, dental and nursing cadres) in 2020 compared to the previous year, minister of state for defence Shripad Naik told Rajya Sabha. He added that the government has sanctioned 1,700 posts for women in Corps of Military Police (CMP) in the non-officer cadre. The CMP is the first cadre to induct women in the non-officer rank. One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. The navy has also opened more avenues for women in recent years—the first naval women were inducted as pilots of maritime reconnaissance aircraft in 2016. Warships, tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992. The armed forces began inducting women by granting them short-service commission for five to 10 years before the government came out with a new policy in 2008 to give them permanent commission in a few arms and services. The number of arms and services in which women are now being granted permanent commission has gone up. Last November, almost 70% of women officers who were considered for permanent commission in the army by a special selection board were selected to serve a full term in the army. Of the 615 women considered for permanent commission, 422 were found fit for the role. The board was convened months after the government issued a formal order in July 2020 granting permanent commission to women following a Supreme Court verdict. The government’s July 23, 2020 order specified grant of permanent commission to women officers in 10 streams—Army Air Defence (AAD), Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps (AOC), and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General (JAG) and Army Educational Corps (AEC). The Supreme Court in February 2020 ruled that women be considered for command roles and that all women officers were entitled to permanent commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-military-sees-threefold-increase-in-women-personnel-in-6-years-101612843615626.html

09-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand: Underground glacial lake led to flash floods, says IISc analysis||The Divecha Centre for Climate Change at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, has found clues to the origin of the flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Rishiganga valley on Sunday. The team has concluded that release of water from an underground glacial lake led to flash floods and inundation in the valley.Using a tool to map depression in the bedrock below glacier ice in northern Nanda Devi, the team said images suggest a depression of 25ha upstream of the glacier terminus.Also Read | Uttarakhand glacier burst: What we know about region’s worst disaster in 8 yearsThis underground lake has a capacity to store 4.5 million cubic metres of water. The lower part of the ablation zone (zone of the glacier which has melted or calved and formed a lake) is also receiving a significant amount of water from a tributary glacier located at the northern side of the Nanda Devi glacier. “If this depression filled with water develops appropriate hydrostatic pressure, it can accelerate the lower part of the ablation zone, possibly releasing water from the underground lake. It could be the potential reason for the flash flood,” a note prepared by the IISC team said.“This is a new tool developed in IISc by our team which can be very useful to study such disasters. The tool is based on Laminar flow equation and surface slope; known as Himalayan Glacier Thickness Mapper (HIGHTHIM). The tool was used successfully to map depressions below South Lhonak lake in Sikkim and further estimate the future expansion of the lake,” said Professor Anil Kulkarni, distinguished scientist, Divecha Center for Climate Change.Responding to some US-based scientists who had suggested that a landslide had triggered the flash floods based on satellite data, Kulkarni said “It appears to me that they looked at the adjacent valley. Initial reports suggest that flash flood was caused due to breaking of Nanda Devi glacier. The observation was widely published by numerous news media and also supported by reconnaissance survey carried out by the Indian Air Force. We went deeper to see what happened under the surface.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-underground-glacial-lake-led-to-flash-floods-says-iisc-analysis-101612842535639.html

Here is what we know so far about the worst disaster to hit the region in eight years:• The toll from the tragedy on Monday climbed to 26 with 171 people still missing even as at least 1,000 disaster response, military and paramilitary personnel worked to clear a 1.7-km tunnel in the badly hit hydroelectric power project of Tapovan.Also Read | ‘Had lost all hope’: Survivors recall horror tales of Chamoli disaster• At least 35 people are still stranded in waist-deep muck at the project site.• The surging waters on Sunday washed away homes, damaged two major dams, cut off 13 villages, and snapped crucial road links and bridges that connect far-flung areas in the Himalayan region.• The missing include 11 villagers, two police personnel and workers from the two dam sites. • Rescue workers were scanning the Alaknanda river to find bodies and visiting the affected villages to provide them relief. • US-based scientists, who looked at satellite images, suggested the tragedy was caused by a landslide onto a glacier which led to debris flooding the river.• But a group of Indian scientists said there was no landslide or avalanche but pointed at the possibility of a glacial lake that led to the breach. They said the release of water from an underground glacial lake led to flash floods and inundation in the valley.• Many flood victims in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand blamed unchecked construction and environmental damage for the tragedy. • The disaster is the worst to hit Uttarakhand since the 2013 Kedarnath floods killed 5,700 people and highlighted the impact of the climate crisis and degradation of the fragile ecology.• The disaster on Sunday struck at 9.30am when a glacier breach under the Nanda Devi, the country’s second-highest peak, sent a torrent of water, rock and dust down a valley into the Rishiganga river, where workers were building a dam.Also Read | Uttarakhand flash flood: Rescuers struggle to reach trapped men• Visuals showed the muddy floodwaters smashing most of the plant and inundating bridges before roaring downstream into the Dhauliganga and partially damaging the National Thermal Power Corporation’s 530 MW Tapovan Vishnugad project, roughly 8 km away.• Columns of slush and debris have been strewn across at least 30km area, where authorities have airdropped ration packets to stranded villagers.• Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Union ministers RK Sinha and Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank have been among the politicians who visited the site.• Sinha said Tapovan suffered a loss of about ₹1,500 crore, but ruled out the possibility of scrapping the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-glacier-burst-what-we-know-about-region-s-worst-disaster-in-8-yrs-101612842175828.html

He is one of the experts who are a part of government’s outreach initiative to address concerns regarding Covid-19 vaccination. Also Read | Covid-19 vaccination drive: 3 mn Mumbaiites will qualify for phase 3, says BMC“If there is any specific doubt, potential beneficiaries with comorbidities can consult their doctor before taking the shot. It is important to complete the full course of vaccination as antibodies against the virus develop only 15 days after having taken the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine, and we are fully protected,” he added.It is also important for those persons to take the shot who have had Covid-19 in the past.“We have seen that one third of those with Covid-19 do not develop neutralising antibodies, and there is no definitive answer to how long these antibodies last among Indians. As a result it is important for everyone to take the vaccine for us to prevent getting the disease,” he said.India started the Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16 this year, with the aim of vaccinating close to 10 million healthcare workers in the initial phases.As states began scaling up the vaccination sessions, the Centre directed states to also begin vaccinating their frontline workers simultaneously. On February 2, the states began to do so. As on Monday, February 8, more than 6 million beneficiaries (60,35,660) were vaccinated that included 54,12,270 health care workers and 6,23,390 frontline workers in the country.India has become the fastest country to vaccinate 6 million beneficiaries countrywide.“This feat was achieved in just 24 days. USA took 26 days to reach this mark whereas the UK achieved this in 46 days. Till Monday, 8,257 vaccination sessions were held,” said Union health ministry in a statement.Eleven states have already vaccinated at least 65% of the registered healthcare workers.“Eleven States/UTs have reported less than 40% coverage of vaccinating healthcare workers. These are—Delhi, J&K, Ladakh, Punjab, D&NH (Dadar and Nagar Haveli), Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, and Puducherry. Ten States account for 75.12% of the total beneficiaries vaccinated today (Monday),” the statement further read.A total of 29 persons who were given the shot have been hospitalised so far, which comprises 0.0005% of the total vaccinations.Of the 29 cases of hospitalisations, 19 were discharged after treatment, while nine persons died, according to the health ministry data.The most recent hospitalisation is of a person who is suffering from bilateral facial palsy, and has been admitted at Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences, Thiruvananathpuram. The patient is stable. A total of 23 deaths have been recorded to date, which comprise 0.0004% of the total vaccinations. Of the 23, nine persons died in the hospital while 14 deaths have been recorded outside the hospital. In last 24 hours, one death has been reported of a 29-year-old female, a resident of Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh.

The second such mahapanchayat would be held in Fatehpur district in Prayagraj division on February 23.The Fatehpur mahapanchayat would be followed by similar gatherings in Gorakhpur, Basti and Mirzapur, the BKU leader said.“Kisan leaders were getting demands (for widening the protests) from farmers and other organisations in Purvanchal after successfully mobilising protests for the Raj Bhavan ‘gherao’ programme on January 23,” said Digamber Singh, BKU’s youth wing state president.He said the issue was discussed in meetings of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and it was unanimously decided to hold kisan mahapanchayat in Purvanchal to mobilise farmers for the ongoing movement against the three agriculture reform laws.BKU’s Lucknow divisional president Harnam Singh Verma said he was confident that these maha panchayats would draw large crowds though farmers in Purvanchal had limited resources in comparison to their western UP counterparts.Verma said, “Procurement of crops at MSP (minimum support price) has always been a major issue for farmers in Purvanchal. It was a major demand of SKM, too. Therefore, farmers would come out in large numbers and join the movement.”Also Read: Several Delhi borders remain closed due to farmers’ protest, traffic divertedVerma said a large section of people from different castes and communities could also join the farmers’ movement through the maha panchayats to voice their concerns. Farmer leaders said that SKM’s call for a protest at the Raj Bhavan in Lucknow on January 23 saw an overwhelming response with the participation of around 600 tractors at a short notice of four days. “This shows people are annoyed and they would show their strength through the maha panchayats in Purvanchal,” said Verma.Meanwhile, people familiar with the developments said BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, BKU chief Naresh Tikait and his son Gaurav Tikait (national president of BKU’s youth wing) would be present at some of these maha panchayats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-unions-to-widen-protest-against-farm-laws-with-panchayats-in-purvanchal-101612840835271.html

CAs have particularly been asked to verify whether the associations are eligible to receive foreign contribution; ensure whether it is using the designated bank account for the same and assist in properly preparing and maintaining the prescribed books of accounts. “Since the FCRA deals with the national security, associations are required to exercise extreme care and caution in utilising foreign contribution. CAs examine and audit all relevant books of accounts and bills and vouchers of FCRA associations and then present audited accounts which are submitted/uploaded online to the government. Therefore they are obliged to conduct performance as well as forensic audits to ensure that receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution has happened within the four corners of law,” the Charter issued by MHA states. “Hence, they are expected to provide proper guidance to the associations in maintaining proper accounts and utilising foreign contribution only as provided under the FCRA law,” it added. The Centre has, last year, made FCRA stringent by barring public servants from receiving any funds from abroad. It also made Aadhar registration mandatory for NGOs; prohibited transfer of foreign funds to another person and designated State Bank of India, New Delhi, as the only bank where such funds can be received.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/get-acquainted-with-foreign-funding-act-to-help-ngos-home-ministry-to-cas-101612840075877.html

Both were killed on the suspicion of being police informers and were relatives of panchayat representatives.“We have issued an advisory, not a notice to panchayat representatives who are on target of Maoists. We have urged them to move to some relative’s place or safer places because Maoists’ activity has increased. We are not forcing anyone, they can do whatever they want but they should take precautions about their security,” said additional superintendent of police Jayprakash Badai.“The aim is to make the panchayat representatives aware of the situation, nothing more than that. We have told them to take precautions because of the increase in Maoist activity and the recent killings of tribals,” said Rajnandgaon superintendent of police (SP), D Shravan.Also Read: CoBRA jawan, two Maoists injured in encounter in JharkhandOther senior police officers said the language of the notice was not correct.“The SHO might have given the notice thinking about the inability to provide security to the panchayat representatives but this is not the correct way.

He was taken into custody and was later released on bail on May 25, 2012.He was also suspended from service on May 24, 2020 in accordance with the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, (CCS Rules, 1965). The suspension was subsequently revoked on March 10, 2015 on the recommendations of the Suspension Review Committee.Both the CBI and the departmental enquiry against the man have not attained finality. During this time, he filed an RTI application on Sep 5, 2016 posing 25 queries seeking details of the officer conducting the information and related documents to his case.However, it was dismissed by the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) and later the CIC stating that the case is pending trial.On Feb 5, the high court, while deciding his challenge to the CIC’s order said that no attempt has been made by CIC to show as to how giving the information sought for would hamper the investigation and the on-going disciplinary proceedings.“The impugned order concludes that a charge-sheet has been filed in the criminal case by the CBI but in the disciplinary proceedings the matter is still pending. … No reasons are spelt out as to how the investigation or prosecution will be hampered,” the judge said in his 12-page order.Also Read: 73 nominations filed for Delhi civic bypollsThe court also noted that the RTI application given by the man is “vague” and “confusing”. It said that the entire focus of the application is on the name of the officer who has been directed to support the probe of the investigating agency.“Numerous queries are raised regarding the said alleged officer who has been directed to support the investigation of the investigating agency,” it said.It quashed the order of CIC and remanded the matter back to it for fresh consideration in terms of the noted legal position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-give-cogent-reasons-for-denying-information-under-rti-in-ongoing-case-101612836668294.html
09-02-2021||India||PM Modi's speech offered no solution: Opposition||Minutes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the farm issue in his reply on the President’s speech in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress criticised his speech on Monday and said that the address did not offer any solution to farmers protesting against three contentious agri laws.Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said: “We expected that the PM, looking at the ongoing agitations across the country, will withdraw the three black laws and take all stakeholders into confidence to review the laws. He spoke in his own style but didn’t say a word about relief to farmers.”Congress leaders also said that the PM tried to suggest that no one knows the contents of the three laws. “Is it possible? There are experts among the farmers and entire opposition leaders know about the laws. The first law promoted black market, the second one helps the rich people and the third one helps hoarding,” Kharge said.Another Congress MP, Deepender Hooda, alleged that “the PM disappointed the farmers. The government is unable to understand the seriousness of the situation.” Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh said: “PM Modi said that FDI is also ‘Foreign Destructive Ideology’. This from someone whose governance has been based solely on FDI — Fear, Deception, Intimidation.” Reacting to PM’s speech in the Rajya Sabha, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) senior vice president Prem Singh Chandumajra said that it appeared that the country’s backbone peasantry has a bigger test to prove the genuineness of their cause. He added that it was expected from the PM to make a big announcement but by criticising the farmers who are protesting on the borders of Delhi, he denied them the legitimate right.According to Chandumajra, the PM did not give clarity on MSP, despite his party leaders making announcements on the public forum that the new farm laws will not impact the MSP. “He (PM) has made no commitment to make MSP a legal right,” added the former MPBJP president J P Nadda asserted on Monday that PM Narendra Modi’s address in Rajya Sabha has dispelled the web of confusion being created over a host of issues and laid out a clear direction for the country.Modi has made it clear that the government is taking all necessary steps for farmers’ welfare, which is its priority, Nadda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-speech-offered-no-solution-opposition-101612834006582.html

Singh appealed to the Opposition not to break the longstanding tradition of the House to debate the President’s speech before anything else.Locket Chatterjee, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member from Bengal, initiated the debate and focused entirely on attacking the eastern state’s ruling Trinamool Congress, with an eye on the upcoming assembly polls.Speaking in Hindi, Bengali and English, Chatterjee said Trinamool stole ration provided by the Centre during the pandemic, tents during the Amphan cyclone and even Covid-19 vaccines. She said the BJP will not allow anyone to make Bengal into “East Pakistan”.“Mamata (Banerjee) government insults Ram and Sita. They (Bengal government) practise appeasement politics. They practice politics of 30%. We will not allow making Bengal into East Pakistan,” she said. Bengal is scheduled to go to the polls in April-May.Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) into the Republic Day vandalism in Delhi’s Red Fort and alleged it was the government that sent “vandals” to defame the farmers agitation. He demanded another parliamentary investigation into the alleged TRP (target rating point) scam.“How can some people reach the Red Fort, that too on January 26 when the highest level of security was in place in Delhi?” he asked.“Why isn’t there a proper investigation into it,” he alleged.Chowdhury alleged the government “trapped” farmers and criticised the government for what he saw as a bid to “create a rift between Punjab and other states,” referring to the government’s stand that only one state had a problem with the new farm laws.He also wondered why the government is making “Greta a persona non grata”, referring to climate activist Greta Thunberg’s support for the farm stir and the consequent backlash.The second speaker, BJP’s Virendra Kumar, maintained that the Narendra Modi government was committed to the welfare of farmers and was trying to double the their income through various measures.Trinamool’s Mahua Moitra lashed out at the BJP and alleged that the ruling dispensation was making “hate and bigotry” a part of its narrative.The government’s decision to impose a nationwide lockdown following the outbreak of Covid-19 inflicted “untold misery” on people with “lakhs of people” forced to walk to their homes, she alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-stir-bengal-polls-dominate-lok-sabha-debate-on-president-speech-101612833427524.html
09-02-2021||India||Lok Sabha begins work as logjam finally ends||After Lok Sabha proceedings were blocked for four consecutive days last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh stepped in on Monday for intense negotiations to salvage the debate on the President’s speech in the Lower House.Though the Lok Sabha started on Monday afternoon with the usual disruptions as the Opposition again demanded a separate debate on the farm laws -- some leaders, including Congress MPs Manish Tewari and Jasbir Gill and CPI(M)’s AM Ariff, pushed adjournment motion notices demanding the repealing of three laws -- but the matter was eventually resolved in a closed-door meeting.Singh, along with ministers Piyush Goyal and Prahlad Joshi invited the Opposition for talks to the Speaker’s chamber, to find a resolution. According to people familiar with the matter, Singh said that the week’s agenda is already decided (debates on President speech and general budget) and appealed to the MPs that the House has a long tradition of passing the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address, urging them not to break this tradition.The Congress floor leader Adhir Chowdhury said that they don’t want to disrespect the President, but were voicing concern over a serious issue. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that if both sides can find a solution, he will give as much time as required to debate all issues including the farmers’ protests.With Congress agreeing to this, other Opposition parties too decided to join the debate. The only party that expressed serious reservation was the Shiromani Akali Dal. Its leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal refused to budge, and Rajnath once again, spoke to her separately.It was decided that Singh will make an appeal in the House, following which the debate will start. Minutes later, after the House convened at 5pm, Singh said the tradition of thanking the President has been continuing for long and it should not be broken in a healthy democracy. He also said that Rajya Sabha has already passed the Motion of Thanks after PM Narendra Modi’s reply and “I appeal to members not to break this tradition in the Lok Sabha”.Congress leader Chowdhury, too, said that this tradition has been continuing since 1921 and should not be broken. “Our demand was to discuss the issue of farmers who have been sitting in the cold on the borders of Delhi in protest against farm laws. It is regrettable that they are being stopped from entering the capital by sharp nails and barbed wires,” he said referring to the reinforced barricading at the farmers’ protest sites. He added the Opposition wanted an assurance from the government for a standalone discussion on the farmers’ issue.Birla also appealed to the members to allow the House to function and not indulge in sloganeering. Acknowledging Singh’s role, Birla said, “I want to thank Rajnath Singh, deputy leader of the House, for participating in the meeting and helping us resolve the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-begins-work-as-logjam-finally-ends-101612833118860.html
09-02-2021||India||Delhiwale: Like an ascetic, but with a family||His face exudes immense calm, and sitting beside him is somewhat relaxing. He has the vibes of a fakir, an ascetic, which is nothing surprising when you know that he spends his days sitting in one of the courtyards of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya’s sufi shrine, in central Delhi.“I’ve been a khidmatgar in the dargah for decades,” says Muhammed Naeem Khan, referring to himself as a server of the shrine. It is a pleasantly cool evening. The worst part of winter is gone. The brilliantly blue sky has receded into hues of darkness. Mr Khan is sitting by a grave, alone. The shrine houses the grave of the aforementioned mystic as well as of other historical figures, famous and obscure, including a Mughal emperor.Lighting up a beedi, Mr Khan recalls his past—“when we were seven brothers and three sisters... now we are two brothers and two sisters.” In his 60s, he says that his father was from Amroha in UP, and worked in Delhi as a cook in the bungalow of a certain “Mr Kelly”, who lived in what was then known as Aurangzeb Road. “Father lived here in the ‘basti’, and cycled to work every day”—by basti, he means the village surrounding this shrine.Pondering on how he ended as a shrine server, or khidmatgar, Mr Khan confesses that he had no idea that this is what he would become. The circumstances pushed him in this direction. “Father died when I was in the 10th standard.” The loss forced him and his brothers to immediately launch into an active working life, and to give up all hopes of education. Mr Khan worked for many years in a local meat shop, but later, when his six sons began earning for themselves, he gave up his job and started spending more time in the shrine—his home is very close. He would take care of select visitors, and receive token money from the shrine’s caretakers for his services. “This money is important... my children are very caring but I don’t want to depend on them,” he says in a voice so full of kindness that it feels like being offered a piece of blanket in the sharpest cold.But it’s almost seven in the evening, and Mr Khan arrived in the dargah some 12 hours ago. He shall now walk back home, a few lanes away, to wife, Aamna Khatoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-like-an-ascetic-but-with-a-family-101612832464819.html
09-02-2021||India||Allahabad high court dismisses plea against allotment of land for mosque||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Monday dismissed a petition challenging the allotment of five acres of land in Dhannipur village of Ayodhya district for the construction of a mosque after the Delhi-based sisters who challenged the move withdrew their plea.The Uttar Pradesh government allotted the land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) for construction of a mosque in compliance with the Supreme Court’s November 2019 order that allotted the site, where the Babi mosque once stood, to the Hindu claimants. The court order ended a decades-old dispute between Hindu and Muslim claimants to the land.A two-judge bench of justices Devendra Kumar Upadhyay and justice Manish Kumar of the high court passed Monday’s order after the petitioners agreed to withdraw the plea. The high court also gave the petitioners permission to file a fresh plea after ascertaining facts.Delhi-based sisters Rani Kapoor Punjabi alias Rani Baluja and Rama Rani Punjabi filed the petition on February 3, claiming ownership of the five-acre land.“After arguing at some length, the learned senior advocate appearing for the petitioners stated that he be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to the petitioner to file afresh petition,” the court said.“In view of the aforesaid, the writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn with the aforesaid liberty,” the court added.Senior advocate HGS Parihar appeared on behalf of the petitioners, assisted by advocate Meenakshi Singh. Additional advocate general RK Singh appeared before the court on behalf of the state government.Opposing the writ petition, Singh told the court that the plot numbers allotted for the construction of the mosque were different from those mentioned in the petition.The state presented a letter before the HC on behalf of the Ayodhya administration, stating that the land being disputed by the petitioners was in the adjoining village of Sheikhpur Jafar, and not in Dhannipur village.The two sisters claimed in their petition that their father Gyan Chand Punjabi was allotted 28 acres in Dhannipur village by the Nazul department (responsible for government land allotments) for five years for ₹1,560 when the family moved to Faizabad district (now Ayodhya) from Punjab in Pakistan after Partition in 1947. They said their father remained in possession of the land beyond that period. Later, his name was included in the revenue records, the petitioners added. Subsequently, when his name was removed, their father filed an appeal before the additional commissioner, Ayodhya, which was allowed, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-high-court-dismisses-plea-against-allotment-of-land-for-mosque-101612831936775.html
09-02-2021||India||Farm laws: Elderly protesters recount ’88 stir, stare at a long haul||On a bright February morning, 101-year-old Layak Ram makes for a picture of steely resolve as he speaks about the ongoing farmers’ protests against three laws enacted by the Centre in September to open up the country’s agricultural markets.“ I am not going anywhere till the farm laws are repealed,” said the centenarian, clad in a white kurta-pyjama and a grey jacket, resting against a pile of blankets inside a yellow tarpaulin tent pitched under the Delhi-Meerut expressway at the Ghazipur border.The Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border is one of the epicentres of the farmers’ 75-day-old campaign against the agricultural laws they say would erode their bargaining power, put them at the mercy of powerful agribusinesses and could lead to the dismantling of the system of minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce.Ram, who arrived at the Ghazipur site from Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, in November, is one of the oldest protesters in the agitation and one of the few who also participated in the late Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Mahendra Singh Tikait’s movement that brought Delhi to a halt in 1988.About half-a-million farmers from western Uttar Pradesh arrived in Delhi in October 1988 and took over the Boat Club lawns in the heart of the Capital, close to Parliament, with demands ranging from more remunerative prices for farm produce to cuts in power and water tariffs.Ram remembers that protest well. “The place had turned into a village panchayat, with charpoys, hookahs, bullock carts and buffaloes all around. That is where we cooked, ate and slept,” he said.“The difference is that then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi conceded our demands, but this government seems adamant and is just not listening to us,” added Ram, who often wags a finger in the air to make a point. A passionate storyteller, Ram lets you know that his “tryst with history” goes beyond his participation in farmers’ agitations.“I do not remember the date, but I was born in 1919, the year of the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre. Our farmers’ leader Mahendra Singh Tikait was 16 years younger to me, but he was a visionary and knew the pulse of the farmers, ”said Ram, who these days wakes up at 6 am and eats at the community kitchen set up at the protest site. “I eat my dinner at 7pm and go to bed by 8pm; it is too cold here in Delhi under the highway.”He is visibly upset at what he calls the government’s unreasonable stance. “I witnessed the struggle for the independence of this country. We have won against the British and against our own governments in the past. But today’s government is very adamant and this is going to be a long struggle.”Ram has not been in touch with his family since he arrived. He suffers from an old injury and wears a bandage around his head, which he has been told, has turned cancerous. “I have lived up to 101 years; and now I do not care if I if I die here.”Two tents ahead is another tarpaulin tent where Ram Kumar Singh, a 90-year-old farmer from Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, is camping. Unlike Ram, Singh, joined the agitation recently, after the Republic Day.Singh too was a part of the farmers’ movement led by Tikait. And he too has many stories to share.“The then government did not use force on us to drive us out of the city like it happened on Republic Day; it bowed before the country’s farmers respecting their demands,” said Singh, his voice firm and his lips covered by a thick, drooping moustache.Singh, who suffers from blurred vision in one eye, contends that the ongoing fight is tough, but reckoned that Rakesh Tikait, the son of Mahendra Singh Tikait and the BKU’s national spokesperson, who has emerged as the face of the farmers’ campaign, will eventually lead farmers to victory. “He is determined, tenacious and tactful like his father,” said Singh.While Singh and Ram have many memories of their participation in the 1988 farmers’ agitation, Dharm Pal, a 73-year-old farmer from Baghpat, UP, proudly shows off a picture with Mahendra Singh Tikait, set as the wallpaper of his mobile phone. “It is from one of the farmers’ rallies 1994 or 1995,” he said, showing his phone screen.Pal, who is camping in Ghazipur, said he was shot with a rubber bullet during the 1988 protest. “It took me and many others days to be able to walk properly, but we are here again. Tikait was like my elder brother. He also attended my son’s wedding. This is the reason why I am here today to support his son, who is fighting for our rights,” he said.“ I was born in 1948, a year after the country got Independence. Even after so many years, the farmers of this country are forced to sit on the roads to be heard,” said the septuagenarian, smoking a hookah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-elderly-protesters-recount-88-stir-stare-at-a-long-haul-101612831691108.html
09-02-2021||India||Twitter says seeking dialogue with minister, safety of staff key||Social media company Twitter said on Monday that it has reached out to electronics and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for a formal dialogue and that it had shared an update with the government after it was sent a notice for not complying with an order to restrict access to some accounts.Last week, the company restored access to 257 profiles it had temporarily blocked after an order from the government, setting up a rare confrontation with the ministry. The government later sent a notice saying Twitter was not in a position to judge the order and that it was an intermediary liable to follow directions as per the law, which could include penal provisions.“Safety of our employees is a top priority for us at Twitter. We continue to be engaged with the government of India from a position of respect and have reached out to the honourable minister for a formal dialogue. An acknowledgement to the receipt of the non-compliance notice has also been formally communicated,” a spokesperson said.It also indicated that its position on the government’s request has not changed. “We strongly believe that the open and free exchange of information has a positive global impact, and that the Tweets must continue to flow,” the spokesperson added.“We review every report we receive from the government as expeditiously as possible, and take appropriate action regarding such reports while making sure we hold firm to our fundamental values and commitment to protecting the public conversation.”People familiar with discussions at Twitter said the company was concerned of “undue penal action against its employees”. “There have been indications of possible penal action and Twitter makes its employees its top priority,” the person said, asking not to be named.A government official said that no communication had been received so far from Twitter. “We are giving them time to take action. Otherwise, the government will have to consider its options.”Last week’s confrontation began over an order to block accounts the government stated were alluding to the occurrence of a “farmer genocide”. The ministry of electronics and information technology asked the company to take down an additional 1,178 accounts that may “foment trouble” on February 4.People familiar with Twitter’s policy said that that some of the accounts mentioned by the government may draw action for being in violation of the company’s rules and such requests are routinely received by the microblogging site. “Others will get an alert that a legal demand against their account, then the company will analyse if there’s been a violation,” this person said. The alerts were likely to be issued over Monday.According to the Twitter transparency report released last month, the company received 2,800 legal demands from January 2020 to June 2020. Demands were made against 13,200 accounts, of which the company withheld only 17, while 1,200 others were found to be violating Twitter rules.The directions to block the 1,178 accounts were sent to the microblogging site at least three days ago; a second official familiar with the matter said on Monday. “Similar kinds of accounts, as the 257 flagged earlier, were identified,” this official said, asking not to be named.“Some of these seem to bots, some propped by other countries. They all aim to foment trouble and unsettle the situation.”The directions have been issued under section 69 (A) of the IT Act that allows the government to take action against posts and accounts that may pose a threat to public order.A third official stated that the accounts were flagged by security agencies as “accounts of Khalistan sympathizers or backed by Pakistan and operating from foreign territories and causing threat to public order in view of the ongoing farmers protests in some parts of India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-says-seeking-dialogue-with-minister-safety-of-staff-key-101612831078525.html
09-02-2021||India||PM slams ‘andolanjeevi’ in Rajya Sabha farm laws defence||While warning the country against “andolanjeevis” (those who live off protests), and the influence of FDI (“foreign destructive ideology”), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday strongly defended the recent farm laws, touted their benefits, particularly for small and marginal farmers, and reiterated the government’s commitment to modernising agricultural markets (mandis) and retaining the minimum support price (MSP)-based procurement regime.At the same time, the PM appealed to agitating farm groups to call off their protests, said all doors for suggestions and improvement remain open, and invited them for continued discussions.Responding to the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, Modi cited the history of political backing for agricultural reforms, including by former PM Manmohan Singh, and criticised the Opposition for their “U-turn” on the issue.At a time when there is increasing criticism about India’s democratic record, the PM also called India the “mother of democracy”, and at a time when some have labelled protesting Sikh farmers as extremists, he hailed the contribution of Sikhs to nation-building and underscored the sensitivity of Punjab given its history.Modi also praised the manner in which Indian citizens battled Covid-19, spoke of the immense goodwill generated for India with its supply of medicines and now vaccines to other countries, and highlighted India’s post-Covid-19 economic recovery. On the continued stand-off with China at the Line of Actual Control, he said that India’s position was clear and there was no question of any relaxation in India’s commitment to “border security”and “border infrastructure”.Highlighting the urgency of agri reforms, which formed the core of his speech in the House, the PM said: “This is the time to make agriculture prosperous... Give the reforms a chance and see whether we benefit from it. If there is any weakness, we will remedy it..the doors are not closed... If we delay this, if we get caught up in our political calculations, we will push farmers to darkness. I pray to all of you to think about this.”The PM also warned against those he termed “andolanjeevis”. “We are familiar with shramjivi (those who labour), and buddhijivis (intellectuals). But I see that a new group has emerged in this country. If there is a lawyers movement, a students movement, a workers movement, they will be there — either in the front or behind the scenes. They cannot live without andolans (movements). They get to all places, give an ideological stand, mislead and show new ways. The country must be saved from these ‘andolanjeevis’. The interesting thing is they cannot do anything on their own but if something is happening, they will be there. They are ‘parijeevis’ (parasites).”He added that even as the country was talking about foreign direct investment (FDI), another form of FDI had emerged. “This is foreign destructive ideology. To save the country from this FDI, we need to be more aware.” The PM’s comments come in the wake of tweets by global figures — including pop icon Rihanna and environmental activist Greta Thunberg — in solidarity with farm protests, which triggered an official government response blaming “vested interests” for propaganda. At the same time, Modi emphasised the importance of Punjab. “There are people who are making constant efforts to weaken and destabilise India. Don’t forget what happened with Punjab. During Partition, Punjab suffered the worst. During 1984, the maximum tears were shed in Punjab. The most horrific incidents happened in Punjab... all governments have known who was behind it.”He also sent out a message on the Sikh community. “Some people are trying to mislead the minds of Sikhs in particular. This country is proud of every Sikh. What have they not done for this country? However much we respect them, it will be less.”Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said Modi’s speech did not offer any solution for the protesting farmers but tried to divert the issue. “He spoke in his own style but didn’t say a word about relief to farmers,” he said. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of farmers unions, condemned the Prime Minister’s ‘”andolanjivi” remark and said it was an insult to the farmers. “Farmers would like to remind the PM that it is ‘andolans’ that have liberated India from colonial rulers and that is why we are proud to be ‘Andolan-jivi’,” a statement from the organisation said.On the laws, Modi first spoke about the scale and marginalisation of small farmers in India and cited the late farm leader and former prime minister, Chaudhary Charan Singh — this was symbolic, for it is Singh’s community, the Jats, who are currently at the forefront of the protests in Singh’s geographical base, western Uttar Pradesh. The PM said that Singh, citing the 1971 farm census, had often spoken of how 51% of Indian farmers had less than a hectare of land. This figure was now 68%, while 86% of farmers in India were small and marginal. Modi claimed that this large segment had been neglected — while big farmers got the benefits of bank loans, bank loan waivers, insurance schemes, irrigation, free power. It was his government, Modi claimed, which had expanded benefits to small and marginal farmers — through direct income assistance, expansion of Kisan credit cards and insurance scheme and initiatives such as Kisan rail and Kisan udan to enable them to reach distant markets. The PM then spoke about increasing land fragmentation and the need to generate livelihoods for members of farming families. He gave the example of the dairy sector — which contributes 28% of India’s agri economy — and said that milk and vegetable producers were able to directly get better rates from the market. “Why should foodgrain and lentil producers not have the same freedom as those who produce milk and vegetables?”Citing Manmohan Singh as having said that Indian farmers must be allowed to sell their produce where they can get higher rates of return and there should be a common agricultural market, the PM said, “Maybe those making U-turns won’t accept my view but accept his views...You should be proud that Manmohan Singh said it and Modi is doing it.” The entire discussion on the subject in the House, the PM claimed, had not been about the law but had revolved around complaints about the method and that it was hurried or there wasn’t enough consultation. “This happens. Even when there is a wedding in the family, a relative may say she was not called... this happens in such large families.” The PM also spoke about the resistance to any change as being natural — and claimed that even during the Green Revolution, the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri had to face opposition from his Planning Commission, from members of his cabinet including the finance minister, from Left forces (“they are using the same language today they used then”), and appointed C Subramanian as agriculture minister when other politicians feared that taking over the portfolio would antagonise farmers and jeopardise their political careers. “But the result is that from seeking food under the PL-480 (an American aid programme), our farmers did record production domestically.” Modi projected the reforms as inevitable, claiming that those parties opposing the reforms at the moment had done similar, even if partial, reforms, in their states. “We will have to explain to protesters that whoever is here will have to do it, if not today, then tomorrow. Today I have done it, tomorrow you will have to do it. Attribute the negative to me, take the credit yourself. But let us move forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-slams-andolanjeevi-in-rajya-sabha-farm-laws-defence-101612830718006.html
09-02-2021||India||75% pedestrian facilities unsafe, in violation of norms: Study||At least 75% of Delhi’s pedestrian facilities do not follow international standards of road safety, according to a survey by independent researchers which found that spaces meant for pedestrians were either encroached by people to feed birds or by the authorities to plant trees and place other obstructive installations.The researchers, who are alumni from IIT-Bombay, School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) and IIT-Kanpur, studied 60 traffic refuge islands in Delhi and NCR towns. They found that 57 of them were not safe for pedestrians.Traffic refuge islands are large platforms constructed at big intersections where pedestrians do not get enough time to cross over to the other side while the signal is green for them. The islands provide a safe space for pedestrians as they wait between carriageways for the traffic to clear.To be sure, in 2019, nearly 46% of the total 1,463 road accident deaths in Delhi were that of pedestrians, according to data provided by Delhi traffic police. There are over 10 million registered vehicles in Delhi.“These spaces are made in a triangular pattern so that it can hold maximum number of pedestrians. If you look at international standards of road safety, road owning agencies are not permitted to use any space. But here, we have found that these open spaces have been wrongly used for road beautification,” said Sumukhi Surendran, an independent researcher who works on traffic and road safety issues and led the survey in Delhi.The researchers studied pedestrian infrastructure in Delhi, Noida, Gurugram and Ghaziabad between October 15 and December 31.The survey found that at least 12 traffic refuge islands in central Delhi were beautified with saplings, statues or other installations, leaving little space for pedestrians to wait while the traffic signal was green for the vehicles.The safety report also found that in cases where the traffic islands were not encroached, the space was being used by local residents to feed birds and street animals.Globally, the urban design guidelines mandate that every large intersection where the time taken by pedestrians to take a complete round of the intersection is greater than three minutes, requires agencies to have refuge islands. These islands are meant to hold maximum number of pedestrians safe from the fast moving traffic. For instance, in China’s Beijing these traffic refuge islands have slopes so that pedestrians standing on the traffic island don’t face the risk of suddenly falling onto the moving traffic.In Delhi, traffic refuge islands in areas such Govindpuri, Nehru Place, CR Park and Connaught Place were found “unfit for use” because grains and bits of food was laid out for birds.Also, 32 of 50 road dividers and 12 out of 25 zebra crossings in Delhi were found in violation of the international road safety norms.“Large trees were planted on dividers in areas near Dilshad Garden, Vivek Vihar, Uttam Nagar, Greater Kailash and Jasola Vihar...which were turning out to be safety hazards for pedestrians and motorists as it blocked the view of the incoming traffic and signals. Zebra crossing in many areas was ending in Metro pillars or encroachments,” the report read.The report highlights that when a pedestrian is crossing the road, the view of the traffic signal and the incoming traffic should be clearly visible to them.“No installation or plantation should be made over or around the traffic signal. While planting saplings on the road dividers, the agencies must ensure that the canopies of the trees, once it attains the adult age, should not block the view of incoming traffic,” the report read.Maximum of these problems were found on roads under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The civic body did not respond to repeated requests for a comment on the matter. The Public Works Department which also maintains large stretches of roads also refused to comment on the findings of the study.Delhi traffic police said it conducted a similar survey in 2014, listing out inaccessible pedestrian facilities and conducted a series of meetings with road maintaining agencies asking them to fix the faults.“We conduct regular meetings with local authorities to ensure that public spaces remain accessible to commuters, especially pedestrians. If trees are not pruned and posters are found blocking the view of traffic signals, such information is also shared with the civic agencies,” the traffic police said in a text response.Raghu Shaurya, a resident of south Delhi’s CR Park, who has been wheelchair-bound for over a decade, said even in upscale neighbourhoods of the city, the public facilities are not designed for people.“Road dividers and footpaths here are so high that even a normal healthy person will find it difficult to access it. Their solution for everything is to create footover bridges. Why should those on foot risk their lives and sweat extra only so that the cars can zoom faster? Every developed economy is now moving towards developing facilities that put pedestrians first,” Shaurya.Experts also agree that civic agencies need a better understanding of safe urban designs.“The problem is that there are so many agencies and even within an agency there are several departments that have little coordination among them. Aesthetics are important but so is the purpose of traffic refuge islands, zebra crossings and dividers. You cannot in the name of beautification defeat the whole purpose of a public facility. Experts need to be more actively roped in by the civic and road owning authorities before making such decisions,” said Sewa Ram, from School of Planning and Architecture.Gurugram-based urban design and infrastructure expert Khushbu Prasad said a thorough audit of road infrastructure and public spaces should be conducted. “In 2012, when the Delhi Metro construction was on, we conducted a survey for the Delhi government and found that many zebra crossings were ending with Metro pillars. Our public spaces are designed only for cars, pedestrians feature way down in the hierarchy,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-pedestrian-facilities-unsafe-in-violation-of-norms-study-101612830137371.html

The court said that stringent action was taken in the past by suspending advocates when the issue was prevalent and it was subsequently brought under control. “It looks like the lockdown period (due to Covid-19), has again revived this despicable practice and once again some advocates are indulging in illegal activities of grabbing properties,” the court said, vowing to bring it under control again.The petitioner, PS Kirubakaran, approached the court as the plea said police protection wasn’t given to the property due to the presence of advocates despite a disruption in law and order. In its interim order on Monday, the court directed the police authority to provide protection to the property. The court said that advocates’ participation was evident from photographs submitted and called for the advocates to be identified. “This report will form the basis for this Court to give a complaint before the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry against the concerned advocates,” the court stated.

Stalin’s Dravida Munnetra Kaqzhagam (DMK) in upcoming assembly elections.Sasikala, who last month finished serving a four-year prison term in Bengaluru after her conviction in a disproportionate assets case and was treated for Covid-19, read aloud from notes she had prepared on a stopover in the Tamil Nadu town of Vaniyambadi.“My intention is that everyone must work in unity and not let the common enemy capture the throne,” she told reporters and hundreds of supporters who greeted her, referring to the DMK. “The party has faced several struggles and risen like a phoenix in the past,” she said referring to the work done by founder MG Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa, who died in December 2016.Sasikala’s release from prison and her return to Chennai ahead of the assembly elections adds an intriguing new factor to the political dynamics of Tamil Nadu, where the DMK and the Congress are preparing to take on the AIADMK and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), While she was in prison, the AIADMK expelled her from the party, and said she wouldn’t be taken back into the party’s fold.Sasikala left Bengaluru on Monday morning and received a rousing reception on her way by car to Chennai. She made several pit stops to greet thousands of her supporters and cadre of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) a breakaway faction of the AIADMK formed by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. Supporters played music, drones carried banners greeting her and her car was garlanded.Sasikala isn’t a political novice although she has never contested or campaigned in elections and the Representation of People’s Act, 1951 bars her from contesting or holding any constitutional post for the next six years. In her three-decade-long association with Jayalalithaa, Sasikala cultivated her own constituency within the AIADMK, particularly among the Thevar community, which remains a loyal vote bank of the party.She quoted a song from MGR’s 1977 Tamil film to say that she is enslaved by the people’s affection but will not yield to oppression. Clad in a green saree-- a colour Jayalalithaa often wore-- Sasikala sat inside her car, bearing an AIADMK flag undeterred by police complaints by AIADMK leaders against her, for using the party flag.Sasikala switched two cars during her journey- one reportedly belonging to an AIADMK functionary. Responding to a question by reporter, AIADMK spokesperson and minister D Jayakumar said: “There will be a few betrayers; it is negligible. It will not affect the party.” AIADMK has announced multiple times that it won’t take Sasikala back nor will it merge with AMMK.Sasaikala briefly held the reins of the AIADMK, between Jayalalithaa’s death and her imprisonment in the disproportionate assets case in February 2017. Her former loyalists-- chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and his deputy O Paneerselvam -- turned against her at different points of time and buried their own factional rivalries to unite against Sasikala.Since her release, Dhinakaran has insisted that Sasikala remains the general secretary and her supporters will help her reclaim the AIADMK. Dhinakaran, who is an independent MLA, led the AMMK in the 2019 parliamentary polls with a 4% vote share.AIADMK ministers have filed two complaints with the director general of police’s office against Sasikala for using the party flag and of her supposed plans to disrupt law and order. On Sunday night, the government took ownership of six properties belonging to J Ilavarasi and VN Sudhakaran, Sasikala’s relatives and co-accused in the disproportionate assets case. Security has bee tightened at the AIADMK headquarters in Chennai, Jayalalithaa’s Veda Nilayam residence which the government has converted into a memorial and her burial place on the Marina beach is closed to the public to keep Sasikala from places associated with Jayalalithaa. AIADMK on Monday night expelled seven party functionaries for ‘anti-party activities’. They reportedly participated in welcome rallies and Sasikala had even travelled in car belonging to one of the members, D Dakshinamurthy from Thiruvallur district.“AIADMK has overreacted,” said political commentator Sriram Seshadri. “They should have let Sasikala pitch for herself first. Or they could have said that she is welcome to work like any other cadre for the party. That would have put her in a spot and public perception of Palaniswami would have been elevated. But now their fear has been exposed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-announces-return-to-tamil-nadu-politics-101612828746555.html
09-02-2021||India||Delhi riots: Police seeks report on plea seeking FIR against Kapil Mishra||A Delhi court has directed the city police to file a report on a plea, seeking registration of FIR against BJP leader Kapil Mishra for allegedly delivering hate speeches ahead of the communal riots in north east Delhi.On January 29, metropolitan magistrate Himanshu Raman Singh asked the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) concerned to file an Action Taken Report (ATR) on the plea by social activist Harsh Mandar who had alleged that Mishra gave inflammatory speeches in December 2019, January and February 2020, and also took out processions in several places that fuelled riots.“Since the matter has already once gone to the high court, this court deems it appropriate to call a report from the concerned DCP,” the judge said in his order of Jan 29.On February 23, 2020, Mishra visited the Jafrabad Metro station and held protests against those who blocked the road (anti-Citizenship Amendment Act, or anti-CAA, demonstrators) that runs underneath the metro station. Mishra demanded that the police remove anti-CAA protesters within three days. The Delhi Police, in their charge sheets, have acknowledged that two groups of pro-CAA and anti-CAA protesters clashed at Jafrabad at the start of the riots. They did not mention Mishra’s name.The matter will be heard next on March 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-police-seeks-report-on-plea-seeking-fir-against-kapil-mishra-101612828789374.html

To start with, 2,000 ex-forces personnel will be posted at 13 PSUs (public sector undertakings) across the country, including thermal power plants and coal fields.An order, dated February 5, 2021, issued from the office of the director-general of the CISF, said the ministry of home affairs has directed the deployment of ex-servicemen in the CISF in the ratio of 75:25 (75% CISF staff and 25% contractual staff) at selected units by engaging 2,000 ex-forces personnel in different posts on an experimental basis.The order, seen by HT, mentions 13 PSUs at which these veterans are to be posted. The locations include South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh; Anpara thermal power plant in Uttar Pradesh; Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in Nazira, Assam; and Raichur Thermal Power Station in Karnataka. So far, none of the 13 selected locations is in Delhi.The order further states, “The deployment in these selected units in the above ratio will be reviewed by MHA after six months and 12 months for considering further expansion of such deployment at other units.” The force is also inviting applications from eligible candidates.Deputy inspector general (operations) Anil Kumar Pandey said these personnel will be used for “non-core” duties.“They will be unarmed and assist our men. They will be deployed at places that are not sensitive from the security point of view,” Pandey said.However, an officer who is not authorized to speak to the media, said the appointments of ex-servicemen will be done on four posts – constable, head constable, assistant sub inspector and sub-inspector. Only those below the age of 50 years will be considered for appointment, based on their fitness, and provided they match the physical requirement, the officer said.“For the post of sub-inspector, ex-servicemen who have served in the rank of subedar or above will be considered. Similarly, naib subedar and above will be considered for the post of assistant sub-inspector and havildar and above will be eligible for the post of head constable. Sepoys will be considered for constables,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exservicemen-to-help-cisf-secure-sensitive-installations-101612828798377.html
09-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand flash flood: Rescuers struggle to reach trapped men||Luck played a part in the timely rescue of 12 workers from one end of the 1.7km-long tunnel of NTPC Limited’s hydropower project in Uttarakhand’s Tapovan in the immediate aftermath of the flash flood on Sunday. The rescuers toiled for at least four hours to remove the waist-deep slush from the tunnel’s exit; then an engineer employed at the project alerted the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) about an escape door located about 300 feet away from the exit that could serve as an extraction point for the workers.Thereafter, it took ITBP men just about 90 minutes to rescue the dozen workers, three of whom were unconscious, and all of suffering from hypothermia. Importantly, all were alive.But as the sun set over the snow-capped mountain peaks, so did the luck of the rescuers. When it came to saving workers -- at least 37 of them -- trapped at the other end of the tunnel, the rescuers continued to labour till well into the day on Monday, in an effort to reach them.“We believe the workers are trapped at least 200 metres inside the tunnel. The only choice we have is to use an earth mover to remove the slush, one scoop at a time. We have been able to move 50 metres (into the tunnel) so far (until Monday afternoon). Unlike the other end of the tunnel, there is no safety valve on this side,” said Benudhar Nayak, commandant of ITBP first Batallion, who is overseeing the operations along with teams of NDRF and the Indian Army.About 8km from this spot, in Raini village, another group of rescuers is removing slush in front of a smaller hydropower project that was completely washed away by the flash flood, but their progress has been slow. “There is no rescue going on here. We are just hoping to recover bodies that may be trapped in the gates of the power plant,” said Sumit Kalkhudiya, an Indian Army officer.That the floods happened on a Sunday helped save lives.On Sundays, just about half the staff work at the two project sites. At the Tapovan site, about 150 workers were on duty and at Raini site, about 50.At Tapovan, around 50 men were working in the tunnel; the others were deployed elsewhere. But when the water and debris came gushing down the Dhauli Ganga river around 10.45am, all workers, in the tunnel and out of it, were all under water level.As the flash flood roared, many workers tried to run up the hill. Some succeeded. Others were washed away within seconds. And some others were trapped in the tunnel.THE TUNNEL According to rescuers and workers, the 1.7 km-long slanting tunnel under construction is about 20 feet high and 15 feet wide. “Inside, the main tunnel is joined by another tunnel about 300 metres long,” said Harinder Singh, a welder at the project who helplessly watched from the road above as many of his friends and colleagues were washed away or trapped inside.When the flood hit, the tunnel was quickly filled with water, mud and debris. The rescuers, who arrived at the scene a little after noon, and began by focusing on the tunnel’s exit as it was down the slope and had much less slush than at the entrance. At that time, the rescuers weren’t sure how many workers were trapped at that end.“Since this end of the tunnel was difficult to access with our machines, we used wooden planks and steel sheets to reach the entrance. Then we used basic tools to keep removing the slush. We weren’t making much progress when an engineer walked up to us and mentioned an escape door, about 8 by 8 feet, on the side of the tunnel,” said Nayak.The rescue was briefly halted as villagers used whistle to warn about the water level rising again, but the operation resumed soon.THE BREAKTHROUGH “In the next 45 minutes, we were able to locate the escape door amid the slush, broke it open, and removed the iron mesh,” Nayak added.The rescuers found the workers trapped just about 30-40 feet away from the valve. “Many of them had lost their shoes, and three of them were waist deep in the slush, but they had all held on to iron grills inside,” said Kalam Singh Negi, head constable with ITBP.The rescuers threw ropes to the trapped workers, but they were so weak, tired and affected by the cold that they couldn’t grab them.“One of our officers then entered the tunnel to tie each of them with ropes before we pulled them out,” said Negi. By the time the last of the men inside was brought out, it was 5.45pm on Sunday.Three of the rescued men were unconscious. The others were suffering from hypothermia. Some raised their arms to celebrate their rescue.“They were all shivering. Some of them begged us for hot water. We washed them with warm water, gave them necessary injections, dressed them in ITBP uniforms and used our phones to help them make video calls to their families,” said Maneesh Chandra, an ITBP constable.BACK TO DESPAIR The other end of the tunnel, meanwhile, remained inaccessible despite the use of earth movers.Initially, three earth movers of various types worked to remove the slush at the entrance of the tunnel, but once the entrance was breached, the progress slowed since only one machine could work at once.ITBP officers estimated that the workers trapped on this side were about 200 metres into the tunnel. The workers, however, estimated that they were trapped at least 500 metres inside. “At the rate the work is going on, it could take up to a week to rescue them. It is so cold even out in the sun, I don’t know if my brother will make it,” said Joginder Tamta, whose brother, a worker at the site, is trapped inside. The two are from Chamoli.Every now and then, Tamta dialled his brother’s phone number. “Often it is switched off. But sometimes the number comes across as busy. That is the only thing that has kept me hopeful,” said Tamta, squatting in anticipation a few hundred metres from the rescue site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-flash-flood-rescuers-struggle-to-reach-trapped-men-101612828805472.html
09-02-2021||India||Farm protests: Additional deployment at Delhi borders withdrawn||Additional deployment of Delhi Police personnel at the three borders points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, where farmers are camping for over two months to protest against the three farm laws,was withdrawn from Monday evening. The security arrangements in these places will now be taken care of by personnel belonging to the police districts concerned, senior police officers privy to the development said.Hundreds of personnel from various Delhi Police units such as crime, police control room (PCR), railways, vigilance, economic offences wing (EOW), licensing, headquarters, and police training college (PTC), were mobilised to the three borders points on security duty during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 and the chakka jam call on February 6.On Monday, special commissioner of police (operations and licensing) Muktesh Chandra issued a message, referred to as TPM, to all the units and their heads regarding the withdrawal of the internal mobilisation done for the farmers’ rally and law and order duty.The entire staff have been told to return to their respective units from Tuesday.“The available resources in the districts concerned will now be used to maintain law and order and security at the farmers’ agitation sites. They will be assisted by personnel from the paramilitary forces,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Rajeev Ranjan said, “The situation at the Singhu border is under control and peaceful. We have adequate force deployed round-the-clock at the border to deal with any contingency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-protests-additional-deployment-at-delhi-borders-withdrawn-101612828812409.html
09-02-2021||India||Ascertain whereabouts of man who went missing during tractor rally: HC to police||The Delhi high court on Monday asked the Delhi Police to ascertain the whereabouts of a 27-year-old man, who had allegedly gone missing from the Nangloi area during the tractor rally on Republic Day, held by farmers protesting against the Centres three farm laws.A bench of justice Siddharth Mridul and justice Anup J Bhambhani directed the police to update it about the whereabouts of the missing man, Bajinder, on a plea filed by his cousin Baljeet.Baljeet in his complaint said his brother was missing since January 26 when he had participated in the rally. He also raised the suspicion that the police had “illegally detained” Bajinder since they were deliberately putting off the registering of a missing person complaint.Baljeet said he had tried searching for his brother in the neighbouring areas and have also contacted all relatives and friends, but Bajinder could not be found nor traced. Baljeet said he went to the Nangloi police station multiple times for registration of a missing person complaint.“…however to his complete shock, the police refused to register any missing person complaint and further failed to take any action on his plea.“The inaction and negligent attitude have led to the apprehension that the brother of the petitioner (Bajinder) has been illegally detained by the police and therefore, they are deliberately resisting the writing of any official complaint / FIR and providing any information…,”the plea said.The court listed the matter for February 9.The tractor parade on January 26, which was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions currently sitting on a protest at Delhi’s borders, had resulted in violence in the national capital. Thousands of protesters had allegedly broke through barriers, and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ascertain-whereabouts-of-man-who-went-missing-during-tractor-rally-hc-to-police-101612828033671.html
09-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand flash floods: At least 26 dead, 171 still missing amid rescue ops||Rescue workers dug through a mountain of mud and slush on Monday to free people trapped under debris of devastating flash floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli as the toll of the worst disaster to hit the Himalayan region in eight years climbed to 26, with 171 still missing.At least 1,000 disaster response, military and paramilitary personnel worked to clear a 1.7-km tunnel in the badly hit hydroelectric power project of Tapovan, where at least 35 people are still stranded in waist-deep muck.The surging waters washed away homes, damaged two major dams, cut off 13 villages, and snapped crucial road links and bridges that connect far-flung areas in the mountainous region.“The rescue workers have recovered total 26 bodies with about 171 still missing, which includes 11 villagers and two cops, while remaining ones are workers from the two dam sites,” said state director general of police Ashok Kumar, who is monitoring the rescue operation.The disaster is the worst to hit the state since the 2013 Kedarnath floods killed 5,700 people and highlighted the impact of the climate crisis and degradation of the fragile ecology.It struck at 9.30am on Sunday when a glacier breach under the Nanda Devi, the country’s second-highest peak, sent a torrent of water, rock and dust down a valley into the Rishiganga river, where workers were building a dam.Visuals showed the muddy floodwaters smashing most of the plant and inundating bridges before roaring downstream into the Dhauliganga and partially damaging the National Thermal Power Corporation’s 530 MW Tapovan Vishnugrad project, roughly 8 km away.Manish Kumar, a worker in Tapovan, was standing outside the tunnel that would later trap most of his colleagues, but sprinted up a hill when he noticed a dense plume of smoke and rumbling waters. “Those who turned around to see were washed away,” he said on Monday.The tragedy left columns of slush and debris in its wake, strewn across at least 30km downstream, where authorities had to airdrop ration packets to stranded villagers.“There was a very loud and scary noise. I turned around to see water and debris gushing towards us. It was as if the mountains were crumbling,” said Godambari Devi, a resident of Raini village who was tending to her apple trees when the tragedy struck.Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Union power minister RK Sinha, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, and other senior politicians visited the site.“The rescue work is going on at all possible speed. We will leave no stone unturned to help the needy ones with the Centre also assuring all the help needed,” said Rawat.In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met a delegation of state MPs and assured them that the Centre was working to strengthen infrastructure there to deal with any natural disaster in the future.According to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Anil Baluni, a Rajya Sabha member from the state, Modi said the central government stood with Uttarkhand’s people and was monitoring ongoing rescue operations. Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda were present at the meeting.At Dehradun, Sinha said Tapovan suffered a loss of about ₹1,500 crore but ruled out the possibility of scrapping the project.“It (NTPC Tapovan project) was supposed to be commissioned by 2023 but now it is obvious that the target year would be pushed ahead. However, we have no intention to scrap the project with the main focus right now on the rescue operation,” said Sinha.The rescue operation was helmed by 300 personnel of the state and national disaster response force, and 700 personnel from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), and army. On Sunday, they had rescued 12 people stuck in a small tunnel at the NTPC dam site.“Of about 120 workers missing from NTPC dam, the labour contractor is unable to inform us about the identities of 100 labourers. Right now, we are focusing on clearing muck from the tunnel where about 35 workers are feared to be trapped inside,” said Kumar. On Sunday, 12 workers were rescued from one end of the tunnel with authorities saying far fewer workers were on duty because it was a Sunday.He said rescue workers were scanning the Alaknanda river to find bodies and visiting the affected villages to provide them relief. “The SDRF teams are scanning the river on motorboat and walking on the riverside to find bodies,” Kumar added.At the 13.2 MW Rishiganga dam site, rescuers were more sombre as they cut slowly through the slush. “There is no rescue going on here. We are just hoping to recover bodies that may be trapped in the gates of the power plant,” said Sumit Kalkhudiya, an army officer.Experts differed on what triggered the disastrous flash floods. US-based scientists who looked at satellite images suggested it was caused by a landslide onto a glacier which led to debris flooding the river.But a group of Indian scientists said there was no landslide or avalanche but pointed at the possibility of a glacial lake that led to the breach. They said release of water from an underground glacial lake led to flash floods and inundation in the valley.The landslide theory was backed by Rawat, who told reporters that scientists of Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) revealed to him that the tragedy was caused by a mix of snow and rock avalanche and that satellite images have shown no glacier breakage.“It was due to lakhs of metric tonnes of snow sliding down abruptly from a trigger point on top of a naked hill,” he said.Still, many flood victims in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand blamed unchecked construction and environmental damage for the tragedy. “When you dig all around and use gunpowder to shake the mountains, this is what happens. No one in these villages was infected by coronavirus, but a man-made tragedy has left six villagers dead,” said Rajni Bhandari, the Chamoli Zilla Parishad president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-flash-floods-at-least-26-dead-171-still-missing-amid-rescue-ops-101612828040432.html
09-02-2021||India||Survivors recall striking rarity of floods in winter||The first sign of trouble at NTPC Limited’s hydropower project in Tapovan on Sunday morning was a power failure that forced all machines to come to a halt .Exactly five minutes later, 27-year-old Manish Kumar, a workman at the site, heard people shout “baadh, baadh (flood, flood)”. Even as he was thinking about the improbability of a flood striking in winters, he noticed something that resembled dense smoke.Kumar was standing right outside the entrance of a tunnel that would later emerge to be a trap for many of his friends and colleagues.Without another thought, Kumar sprinted up the unpaved and slushy path that led uphill. He didn’t turn around until he was at a safe spot up the hill. Two others who were right behind him weren’t as lucky.“Those who turned around to see the situation were washed away. People behind me were shouting for help, but they couldn’t have been helped,” said Kumar on Monday afternoon as he waited in hope for his roommate, Mahendra, to be rescued from the tunnel.Sunday was supposed to be a holiday for most workers. Many of them would visit the Joshimath market, about 25 km away, to shop, eat , or simply walk around. But there were quite a few who were called in to put in an extra day of work. Kumar and Mahendra were among such workers.While the workers at the hydropower plants along the stretch of the Dhauli Ganga river, anticipate trouble during the monsoons, they let their guard down in the winter months.So, when the tragedy struck, none of was prepared.“There was a group of workers sitting on an excavator and a truck right next to the dam. When the water and debris came gushing down, most were immediately swept away, but two of them managed to escape,” said Harinder Singh, a welder who watched the tragedy unfold from a safe distance on his day off.“Both of them managed to catch hold of thick cables dangling near them. As the water rose up, the two men climbed higher and swung themselves onto the hill nearby. They both survived,” said Singh.Then there were a few workers who tried to save themselves by holding each other to form chains.“There were seven-eight of them holding on to each other. In about 30 seconds, each of them was swept away,” said Manish Pant, who too survived, thanks to his weekly off.The Tapovan hydropower plant was totally destroyed. Many workers have left for their homes, while others have stayed on hoping to see their friends rescued or to help recover their bodies.Those working that day included engineers overseeing operations, specialists and casual labourers hired for odd-jobs and to do the heavy lifting.Downstream up the Tapovan site is Raini village where at least six residents are believed to have died. One of them was 76-year-old Amrita Devi, who was tending to her apple trees along with her grandson and daughter-in-law, Godambari Devi, near a 90-metre0long bridge when the tragedy struck.“There was a very loud and scary noise. I turned around to see water and debris gushing towards us. It was as if the mountains were crumbling,” Godambari said.As her 15-year-old son sprinted to safety, Godambari turned towards her mother-in-law to warn her. “I had just stretched out my hand towards her when the strong wind accompanying the flood threw me away. The next moment, I saw my mother-in-law covered by the debris from all sides,” she said.By the time Godambari regained her senses, there was no sign of the hydropower plant towering above her moments ago. Also missing was the bridge that connected the Niti Valley, near the Indo-China border, to the rest of India. A pillar with a few broken rods at one end of the bridge was all that remained.Raini village was the first point where the severity of the flash floods was first noticed on Sunday. “Since the river gets very narrow here, the impact was much higher,” said Shobha Rana, the village chief.Residents of Raini village, which played an important role during the Chipko Movement in 1973, blamed the “ched-chaad” (meddling) with the environment for the tragedy. “When you dig all around and use gunpowder to shake the mountains, this is what happens. No one in these villages was infected by Coronavirus, but a man-made tragedy has left six villagers dead,” said Rajni Bhandari, the Chamoli Zilla Parishad president.Devaki Devi, a homemaker, blamed the demolition of a Kali temple in the village during the construction of the power project last year for the flash floods. “We’ll have to rebuild the temple.”While the flow of water to the river has returned to normal, it has completely changed the lay of the land.“There was a boulder the size of a large truck in the river below,” said Birju Singh, a restaurant owner in Hailang, about 30 km downstream from Tapovan“I can’t find it today.” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survivors-recall-striking-rarity-of-floods-in-winter-101612811190420.html
09-02-2021||India||Path to a just transition to lower CO2 emissions||Data released last month by Carbon Monitor, a global collaboration of research groups, showed that global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production fell 4.4% in 2020 compared to 2019. This was likely a result of global lockdowns imposed to control the Covid-19 pandemic. Even at the time these lockdowns were imposed, an improvement in indicators of air quality raised hopes that a world with lower emissions from burning of fossil fuels was not an unachievable target. Continuing this trend of lower CO2 emissions, however, will also have socio-economic consequences, such as workers in fossil-fuel based power plants or in coal mines falling out of the workforce. An HT analysis of various data sets shows what such a path will entail for India.1. Which sectors contribute the most to CO2 emissions?Preparing for the socio-economic impact of CO2 emissions requires an understanding of which sector will be affected the most. The reduction in CO2 emissions in India in 2020 compared to 2019 was 8.3%, according to the Carbon Monitor dataset. Electricity generation played an important role in that reduction. The decline in CO2 emissions from the sector was a quarter (24.5%) of the total decline. It is also the sector that contributes most to such emissions in India; the daily average share being 46.6% in 2019. As India makes a transition to cleaner fuels, it will likely be the sector where a large share of workers will be impacted directly.2. Which states will have to work hardest to shift fossil fuel jobs?The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) gives six sub-classes of industries that are directly related to electric power generation. Of these, two are based on fossil fuels: coal and non-coal (diesel, gas, for instance) based thermal power plants. Coal and lignite mining can also be considered to be part of this, although parts of it also fuel industries other than those related to electric power generation. Power generation industries listed in the PLFS that do not rely on fossil fuels are those related to hydroelectric power generation, solar energy and other non-conventional sources.The fossil-fuel based power generation industries had a three-fourth share (73.8%) in the total number of jobs in all the power generation industries listed above in 2018-19, according to PLFS. These jobs, however, were not equally distributed across the country. Workers of the industry had a higher share among workers of states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Telangana and a very low share in states such as Haryana, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan. States with a higher share of such workers will have to make the most effort to transfer them to other jobs.States such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand have an incentive for making this transition. They are likely to face a big decline in living standards (measured by per capita consumption expenditure) due to the climate crisis by 2050 itself, as per data from a World Bank report on climate crisis hot spots. Others such as Telangana, West Bengal, or Karnataka may not have to contend with such problems. So they will need other kinds of incentives to bear the pain of job losses.3. Can clean energy jobs replace coal jobs?A way in which job losses can be avoided is by shifting workers from coal-based power plants to industries related to power generation from cleaner energy. The current educational level of workers suggests that such a shift will require a massive re-training exercise.Compared to industries that generate electricity without fossil fuels, a much larger proportion of workers in fossil-fuel based power generation industries are either illiterate or literate below primary level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/path-to-a-just-transition-to-lower-co2-emissions-101612819859591.html
09-02-2021||India||Supreme Court says society must learn to accept intercaste, interfaith marriages||The Supreme Court on Monday underscored the right of the adults to choose their life partner, and added that it is time society learns to accept inter-caste and inter-faith marriages without hounding the couples.A Supreme Court bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy further noted that it would “hardly be a desirable social exercise” for parents to shun their children only because they decided to marry outside their caste or community.The judges, in their order, also emphasised the need for specific guidelines and a training module for policemen to deal with such “socially sensitive cases”, so that couples can get due protection available to them under the law should the parents lodge criminal cases against them.It took note that “educated young boys and girls are increasingly choosing their life partner on their own”, which might be viewed as a deviation by the society and the parents, but the police authorities were duty-bound to keep such couples out of harm’s way if there was no violation of the law.The apex court’s comments are significant because they come in the wake of controversial ordinances passed by Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh that can be misused to obstruct inter-faith marriages.The bench was hearing a case of an inter-caste marriage from Karnataka; the couple approached the top court, seeking protection from a criminal case lodged by the woman’s father.The woman, 28, is from Karnataka while the man, 26, is from Uttar Pradesh. They fell in love while being trained for their jobs as assistant professor and lecturer in a college, and decided to get married. The woman’s parents strongly opposed this alliance. Her father filed a missing persons complaint lodged; this was converted into an FIR at Belagavi in Karnataka.The couple rushed to the Supreme Court for protection, which stayed the first information report (FIR) by an order in December last year, and sought a response from the Karnataka government.On Monday, advocate Subhranshu Padhi, appearing for the state government, informed the bench that the woman was yet to record her statement before at the concerned police station in Belagavi about her consensual relationship with the man concerned, and hence the investigation into the father’s complaint was still underway.But the bench questioned Padhi as to why the investigating officer did not accept the woman’s request to record her statement at a place of her choice so that she could feel safe.Advocate Prabhat Kumar Rai, who represented the couple, referred to the woman’s letter to the investigating officer and various other senior police officials in Karnataka. These letters disclosed that the couple were married in October 2020; and she also sent a copy of her marriage certificate. “The woman feared for her safety if she were to go to Belagavi for recording her statement. The right to marry a person of (one’s) own choice is an integral part of Article 21 (right to life and liberty),” added Rai.Lamenting the attitude of the police officer, the court said the investigating officer should receive counselling and that the Karnataka government must consider conducting a training programme for all its police officers to sensitise them about such cases. The bench observed that it was desirable for all the police departments to lay down guidelines for handling such cases.It regretted that the parents of the woman opposed the choice of their daughter even though both the man and the woman were highly qualified, independent professionals and Hindus, but not of the same caste and not from the same state.Quashing the FIR, the bench stated that once two adults chose to be with each other and had a consensual relationship, they could not be made accused in a criminal case only on account of their parents’ refusal to accept their relationship.“We hope that the parents of the petitioner no.1 (woman) will have better sense and accept the marriage to re-establish social ties with their daughter and her husband. That, we think, is the only way forward,” recorded the court in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-says-society-must-learn-to-accept-intercaste-interfaith-marriages-101612813613037.html
09-02-2021||India||Work on Anand Vihar RRTS station begins; it will be a multimodal hub: Officials||The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has started construction of the Anand Vihar station on the Regional Rapid Transit System’s Delhi-Meerut corridor with the NCRTC officials stating that the station will be developed as a multimodal hub.On the 82km Delhi-Meerut corridor, there will be 22 RRTS stations, of which four will be in Delhi, including the one at Anand Vihar.A NCRTC spokesperson said, “We have commenced the construction work on Anand Vihar RRTS station. Activities such as soil investigation, identification and diversion of utilities are underway. Tunnel boring work is expected to start in the second half of the year.”Anand Vihar is an important transit point in the national capital as it already has a railway station, an interstate bus terminal, and two metro corridors ---the Blue Line (Vaishali to Dwarka) and the Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar).Another NCRTC official, on condition of anonymity, said, “We have started the work to construct the RRTS station at Anand Vihar which will be developed as a multimodal hub. The station will be connected to the railway station, the two metro stations and the interstate bus terminal to provide seamless connectivity to users.”Officials said the Anand Vihar RRTS station has been designed to seamlessly integrate with Delhi Metro corridors. “The construction of this station will be technologically complex as RRTS trains will pass underneath the DMRC’s line 4 (Blue Line). Anand Vihar RRTS station’s concourse level entry will be adjoining the Delhi Metro entry. Further, the RRTS station will have multimodal integration with Anand Vihar railway station, the Anand Vihar ISBT and the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation’s Kaushambi bus adda,” said the official.Apart from Anand Vihar, NCRTC has also started construction of stations at Sarai Kale Khan and New Ashok Nagar, both part of the 82km corridor to Meerut.The agency is also constructing a 1.35km long bridge over the Yamuna in Delhi, which will be almost parallel to the existing Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway. “That bridge will connect the Sarai Kale Khan and New Ashok Nagar RRTS stations,” the official said.The section over the river will be around 626 metres long. “The bridge will be constructed using box girders. It will have 32 piers and each span over these piers will be 44m long. The work on the well foundation, for the construction of piers, has started,” the official added.“All construction activities are being carried out following the prescribed guidelines to avoid any adverse impact on the floodplains. Various eco-friendly measures will also be taken during the construction. The muck and debris generated would be disposed of systematically and no dumping will be done on the floodplains,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-on-anand-vihar-rrts-station-begins-it-will-be-a-multimodal-hub-officials-101612811174378.html
09-02-2021||India||DDA, NHAI working to expedite work on Delhi’s third Ring Road||New Delhi: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) are working to expedite construction work on the Urban Extension Road-II, also termed as the third Ring Road, which will connect four national highways ( NH-1, 10, 8 and 2) and provide seamless access between north, northwest Delhi and IGI airport and Gurugram, officials aware of the development said.The over ₹7,700 crore-project, which was conceived by DDA in 2016 but later handed over to NHAI in 2018, failed to take off due to financial issues. NHAI, which invited bids for the project in December 2019, asked the DDA to pay for the viability gap funding worth ₹4,000 crore, as the project was turning out to be costly. A senior DDA official said the solution to the financial viability has been worked out.A senior NHAI official said, “It is an expensive project. We are exploring possibilities to make it financially viable.” However, a senior DDA official said, “The financial viability issue has been resolved.”The NCT of Delhi is a massive metropolitan area where five national highways ( NH-1, 2, 38, 310 and 324) converge. Delhi has over 10 million registered vehicles and faces a major challenge to curb severe traffic congestion and rising air pollution.Of the total 75.71-kms, 43kms (approx) will be constructed in Delhi. The total cost of the project has been estimated at ₹7,715.6 crore. This includes the cost of constructing highways towards Sonipat and Bahadurgarh from UER-II.UER-II was proposed in the Master Plan of Delhi 2021. The DDA, which had planned the initial project, couldn’t implement it due to land acquisition-related issues mainly in Khanjhawla, Najafgarh and other rural villages.The road will start from NH-1 near Mukarba intersection, cross NH-10, Rohini, Dwarka, NH-8 near Rajokri and end on NH-2, as per DDA’s initial plan. Later, NHAI added two highways towards Sonipat and Bahadurgarh.The Sonipat road link will connect UER-II with Barwasni bypass (near Sonipat). An NHAI official said this road will help reduce traffic load on NH-1, as this will provide an alternative route between Delhi and Sonipat.The road towards Bahadurgarh bypass will be an additional road link connecting Delhi, Bahadurgarh and Rohtak. An NHAI official said, it will help in decongesting the NH 10 section between Outer Ring Road and Mundka. Currently, the only road link connecting west Delhi, Dwarka, Gurgaon, IGI Airport, Dhaula Kuan and South Delhi is NH 10 section between Peeragrahi (Outer Ring Road) and Bahadurgarh bypass.To decongest the city, especially the Ring Road and Outer Ring Road, experts say that it is important to develop road infrastructure in urban extensions so that traffic coming from north and northwest Delhi doesn’t have to take Ring Road to reach south Delhi or the Delhi airport.Transport expert S Velmurugan, the chief scientist at CSIR-Central Road Research Institute, said, “The Eastern and Western peripheral expressways act as a broad buffer, as Delhi-bound traffic doesn’t have to enter Delhi now. The third ring road will just add one more layer of buffer and ease traffic on Ring Road and Outer Ring road, as traffic from north and northwest Delhi need not come to Dhaula Kuan to go to IGI airport or Gurugram.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dda-nhai-working-to-expedite-work-on-delhi-s-third-ring-road-101612810232492.html
09-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand: Breach, avalanche? Cause of flood divides scientists||There was no consensus till Monday evening on what exactly may have triggered the disastrous flash flood in the Rishiganga valley on Sunday. At least 26 people have died and 171 were still missing till the time of going to print.US-based scientists who looked at satellite images suggested it was caused by a landslide onto a glacier which led to debris flooding the river, while Dan Shugar of the University of Calgary suggested a landslide triggered an ice avalanche.Not everyone agrees. Jimmy Kansal, deputy director, The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, said: “There was no landslide or avalanche. There could be a glacial lake which led to the breach, but we are still investigating that.”The glacial lake theory (which means the flooding was what is called a glacial lake outburst flood, or Glof) is supported by scientists at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, who say they have found clues to the origin of the flash floods. The team has concluded that release of water from an underground glacial lake led to flash floods and inundation in the valley.Glacial lakes are typically formed when a glacier retreats, with the water collecting in the area where the glacier used to be, and dammed by the moraine (or material such as rocks left behind by the glacier). There are also instances of glacial lakes being damned by ice. When the dam bursts, it causes a Glof, resulting in flooding downstream, which is exactly what happened in this case.The team at Divecha Centre used a tool to map the depression in the bedrock below the north Nanda Devi glacier and said the data suggests a depression of 25 ha upstream of the glacier terminus.This underground lake has a capacity to store 4.5 million cubic metres of water. The lower part of the ablation zone (zone of the glacier which has melted or calved and formed a lake), the scientists added, receives a significant amount of water from a tributary glacier located at the northern side of the Nanda Devi glacier. “If this depression filled with water develops appropriate hydrostatic pressure, it can accelerate the lower part of the ablation zone, possibly releasing water from the underground lake. It could be the potential reason for the flash flood,” a note prepared by the IISc team said.“This is a new tool developed in IISc by our team which can be very useful to study such disasters. The tool is based on Laminar flow equation and surface slope; known as Himalayan Glacier Thickness Mapper (Highthim). The tool was used successfully to map depressions below South Lhonak lake in Sikkim and further estimate the future expansion of the lake,” said Professor Anil Kulkarni, distinguished scientist, Divecha Center for Climate Change.Responding to the US-based scientists who said the floods may have been triggered by a landslide, Kulkarni said “It appears to me that they looked at the adjacent valley. Initial reports suggest that flash flood was caused due to breaking of Nanda Devi glacier. The observation was widely published by numerous news media and also supported by reconnaissance survey carried out by the Indian Air Force. We went deeper to see what happened under the surface.”But the landslide theory has other subscribers.Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that scientists of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have revealed to him that the Chamoli tragedy was caused by a mix of snow and rock avalanche and that satellite images have shown no glacier breakage.A glacial break usually means a piece of the glacier breaking off as a large piece of ice (quite simply, an iceberg). That does not seem to have happened in this case.Rawat spoke to reporters on Monday after chairing a meeting of senior government functionaries, senior officers of Army, ITBP and ISRO scientists.Rawat said ISRO scientists told him that a few days back there was snowfall in the affected area. “And from one trigger point due to rockfall at the top, it all slid downwards. Due to all this, lakhs of tonnes of snow came gushing down which led to the tragedy. The ISRO scientists said the satellite imagery doesn’t show any glacier breakage and that this area is not avalanche-prone.”Pradeep Srivastava, scientist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology Dehradun said that preliminary data suggests the Chamoli tragedy was not caused by any glacial outburst, but due to sliding of the rock mass exposed on the top of the glacier and an avalanche.“Due to freezing and thawing, a rock mass broke away and slid down. Data suggests a 0.2km-long rock mass broke away and slid down, adding to the debris accumulated on the glacier. This created a melting layer near debris. An avalanche was evident from the huge clouds of dust that came down with the flowing muck and debris,” he said.Srivastava added that on February 6 there was snow in the area and on February 7, the average temperature was 5 to 6 degrees Celsius, enough to melt the snow.“Satellite imagery is showing snow on February 6 and no snow on the slopes on February 7. So it seems that it was mix of snow avalanche and rock avalanche which led to the disaster,” he concludedAs for the water, it can “can come from surface snow, from big cavities in glaciers or that trapped in cervices. Besides water also melts due to pressure from the base of the glacier”.Srivastava said a team from Wadia Institute is inspecting the area to find out “what exactly happened.”Interestingly, the breach of dams, especially moraine ones, has been known to be caused by rockslides, avalanches, rain, or a glacier break that causes a large piece of ice to fall into the glacial lake -- so it is possible that both theories hold in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-breach-avalanche-cause-of-flood-divides-scientists-101612810224493.html
09-02-2021||India||'Andolan gave India freedom': Farm leaders slam PM Modi’s speech in Rajya Sabha||Protesters camped at the Capital’s borders against three new farm laws reiterated their demand that Minimum Support Prices (MSP) be legally guaranteed, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the Rajya Sabha sought to assure farmers that the procurement regime would continue to exist, and urged them to call off their agitation and continue discussions.Responding to the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, Modi on Monday also spoke of people he termed “aandolanjeevis” (those who live off protests) and warned against the alleged influence of FDI (“foreign destructive ideology”)Farmer leaders condemned Modi’s statements, calling it an “insult of farmers”, and said they are ready for fresh talks, but with the condition that the “prime minister holds the meeting with the farmers”.“Farmers of this country respect the Constitution, the elected government and the PM’s rank and dignity. If the PM wants the next round of talks, we are ready for it. But we urge the PM that he should hold the meeting with us, understand the concerns of the farmers, and end this deadlock. Multiple rounds of meetings with the Union agriculture minister have yielded no results so far,” said Satnam Singh Sahni, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Doaba group), at the Singhu border.Speaking in Rajya Sabha, Modi said the farm laws should be given a chance, while reiterating that MSP will continue and doubling down on the government’s commitment to modernise agricultural markets. “MSP was there. MSP is there. MSP will remain in the future,” the PM said.However, protesters and prominent farm leaders were unmoved by the assurances and demanded that the government ensure legal provisions to “protect farmers from businesspersons.”BKU (Tikait) faction national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said, “There are no laws now, so businesspersons loot farmers. Authorities have tried to taint the movement by various means. The movement is not led by political leaders, but farmers who demand the repeal of these laws. There will be no business over hunger, and this is what we are fighting against,” said Tikait, who has been leading the farmers’ agitation at Ghazipur border.A farmer from Punjab’s Moga Sadhu Singh said, “Nobody knowingly consumes poison. When we know that the new farm laws are poisonous, why is Modi ji asking us to consume it. We (farmers) know what is good for us and we are fighting for our rights. We will leave only when the laws are repealed”On Monday evening, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of the 40 farmers’ unions, issued a press statement, condemning the Prime Minister’s “aandolanjeevi” remark.“SKM condemns the insulting of farmers by prime minister. Farmers would like to remind the PM that it is andolans that have liberated India from colonial rulers, which is why we are proud to be aandolanjeevi,” the statement read.“The PM’s FDI approach is dangerous too, even as we distance ourselves from any Foreign Destructive Ideology,” the statement continued.“SKM stands with constructive democratic processes, which uphold basic human rights anywhere in the world and expects similar reciprocation from all likeminded citizens all over the world because “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” the farmer group said in their statement.Avtar Singh, another farmer leader from Uttarakhand camping at the Ghazipur border, said, “We had voted for this government for ‘acche din’ and jobs. But we got these laws in return. There was no need to pass these laws during the pandemic with no consultation and we will continue the agitation till the laws are repealed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andolan-gave-india-freedom-farm-leaders-slam-pm-modi-s-speech-in-rajya-sabha-101612808820570.html

09-02-2021||India||Separate trade deals with UK, EU in India plan||India is aiming at concluding separate investment and “early harvest” trade deals with the UK and the European Union (EU) while continuing negotiations on all-encompassing free trade agreements (FTAs) that may take more time, officials and diplomats aware of the developments said.There have been “positive” and “definite” talks in this direction with both the the UK and the EU, which are eager to resolve immediate trade and investment-related issues while working towards comprehensive FTAs, two officials said, requesting anonymity.There is growing realisation among the stakeholders that investment agreements and an “early harvest” trade package could be easier to pull off than over-arching trade pacts, the negotiations for which usually drag on for years.India’s investment agreements with most of the 27 members of EU expired during 2017-18, leading to higher costs of investment and some uncertainty among European investors, the diplomats pointed out.“A clear intent in this direction has emerged after two separate meetings with EU and UK, held by the [Indian] commerce and finance ministers on Friday,” the first official said.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal met European Commission executive vice-president and trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis on Friday, while finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman met her UK counterpart Liz Truss the same day.India has certain pressing trade issues with the UK and EU, while the two European economies have trade and investment issues with India and these matters can be resolved for mutual gains, the officials said.“For example, Indian apparel exporters struggle in the UK and European markets because of higher duty, compared to those for Pakistan, Bangladesh and Cambodia. Similarly, the UK and EU have some trade and investment-related issues with India that can be addressed quickly,” the second official said.The Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) has sought an early solution to the issue of duty disadvantage, the trade body’s spokesperson said. “In a letter to the government, APEC chairman A Sakthivel said India’s apparel export is falling behind several competitors like Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan due to duty disadvantage of 9.6% while exporting to the UK,” he said.Indian exporters have suggested the government could either initiate discussions for fast-track FTAs or urgently conclude comprehensive economic partnership agreements (CEPAs) with the two major economies, the second official said. Indian exporters are also at a disadvantage because of the continued Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) to 47 least developed countries (LDCs) even after Brexit.Both officials said that during the first high level virtual dialogue on the proposed India-EU bilateral trade and investment agreement on February 5, Goyal stressed the importance of an “early harvest deal” followed by a time-bound FTA that can serve the interests of both sides and help revive economies in the post-Covid era.“In a significant step forward, both sides agreed on a monthly progress review of discussions by senior officials and quarterly review by the ministers for providing guidance,” the second official said.On the European side, there is a keenness to move forward with at least the investment agreement by the time of the India-EU Summit in Portugal on May 8. The diplomats acknowledged that it may be difficult to conclude over-arching free trade agreements in the post-Covid scenario when many countries are focused on increasing self-reliance.“There should be some forward movement on investment protection and facilitation. It is important to have dialogue and move forward from the standstill we have witnessed since 2013,” a senior diplomat from a EU state said, referring to the breakdown of India-EU trade talks more than seven years ago.A second diplomat from an EU state expressed understanding for India’s moves to build up domestic manufacturing and other structures but said questions remained about the self-reliance drive. “To address concerns about whether this move is aimed at keeping foreigners out, India must keep engaging and show more pro-activeness,” the second diplomat said.The diplomats said an investment agreement would address concerns of European investors, who are upbeat on India but are reluctant to pump in funds due to the perceived lack of protection for investments.Dombrovskis told Goyal that EU-India relations are a top priority, the second official said, adding both leaders agreed to meet within the next three months before the India-EU Summit. “The meeting will serve as a final push for quick deliverables before the meeting of the leaders,” he said.“The objective is to take forward any of the possible deliverables in the summit, such as launching an investment facilitation mechanism, working on regulatory cooperation, removing trade barriers, deepening research and promoting innovation, addressing multilateral issues of mutual interest, continuing the IPR dialogue and sharing experience in building resilient value chains,” he said.At the meeting, Goyal also said the COVAX initiative, without a TRIPS waiver, wouldn’t help in ending the pandemic and EU’s support is essential in this crucial endeavour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/separate-trade-deals-with-uk-eu-in-india-plan-101612743386543.html
09-02-2021||Today's||How social media has changed the way we see ourselves||As social media becomes all-pervasive, it has had a significant impact on society. Almost everybody is on social media today.As more people join Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and other networking sites, there is far greater sharing of information, content, thoughts and ideas than ever before. Social media helps build online communities, connect audiences, and generate revenue.However, the downside to these activities is the desire to stay in the spotlight. This can consequently lead to low self-esteem and create a negative perception of one’s “body image”.Body image is how people think about their appearance and how they perceive themselves. A negative body image harms individuals who are affected by the impractical, often absurd, manner in which they view themselves.The assumption that a person must always look good on social media has become a disorder in itself.There is a strong connection between social media and body image issues. While, on the one hand, social media has opened up many avenues for networking, it has brought with it, the pressure to look good, get thousands of likes and positive comments on various platforms. This can affect the mental health of many young people. Validation from the online community has become something of an addiction.Everyone likes to be complimented on their looks. But when this happens on social media, its effect is often amplified. People often seek approval and appreciation from strangers who they meet online. But if, despite their best efforts, the comments they receive are negative, it can lead to sadness and depression.A majority of those who have body image issues are people who compare their pictures with those posted by others. If they perceive that they fall short, they feel dejected. Low self-esteem has become something of a norm among social media users and can be detrimental to their mental well-being.According to the Mental Health Foundation, low self-esteem affects people of all ages, not just the young. They get affected by things such as weight issues, which then can be a catalyst that forces them into depression and alcohol or substance abuse. Similar findings were revealed in a poll of 4,505 adults by YouGov in the United Kingdom. The study revealed that 57% of people aged 18 to 24 years admitted to having anxiety over their body image, compared with 30% in the age group of 45 to 54 years, and 20% for those over the age of 55.Global statistics show that at least 91% of women are not happy with how they look and end up following trendy diets to achieve an “ideal body”. These statistics apply across race, marital status, gender and age. Almost half of the population that uses social media has admitted to having had low self-esteem.Negative body image and low self-esteem can lead to anxiety, nervousness, depression, jealousy, eating disorders, alcohol abuse, and living in a make-believe world where social media perfection has a disproportionate influence on people.However, with some effort, society can overcome body image issues. There should be a culture of inclusivity and the promotion of a positive body image. Parents should be more careful and look for signs of negative body image among children and seek timely help. Parents can help their children by promoting a positive body image, making their children understand the implications of unnecessary social media use. They can seek help from trained counsellors and psychiatrists.Social media is both a blessing and a curse. It is up to us how we use it.Sasha Raikhy Sain is a consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist, and director and founder, Possitive VibesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-social-media-has-changed-the-way-we-see-ourselves-101612888198151.html
