13-02-2021||Other||MU colleges in Mumbai will stay online till February 22||Two days before colleges were scheduled to reopen, the University of Mumbai (MU) on Saturday released a circular informing its affiliated colleges to continue online classes till February 22. MU in its latest circular said, “Based on our discussion with BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) officials, it is being clarified that colleges should not reopen for physical classes before February 22.”University officials said another circular will be thereafter released with confirmation from civic authorities to inform colleges about the reopening protocols. MU’s circular follows a letter by BMC denying MU’s request to reopen colleges from Monday. “We had a meeting with BMC officials on Friday and they shared their concerns. As trains services resumed for all citizens from February 1, BMC wants to first study if the restarting of locals for general public made any difference to the Covid-19 case count,” said Baliram Gaikwad, in-charge registrar, MU. He added that BMC has therefore asked to postpone college reopening by another week until further clarification. In February first week, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced the decision to reopen colleges from February 15 with 50% attendance on campus. On February 5, a circular by the university stated that the reopening of institutes will depend on the final call taken by the local civic authorities. “We’ve been working on sanitisation of the college for a while now and are ready to bring students back but not before we get an official word. As at least 30% of our students reside outside Mumbai (region), we need to be very sure before calling them back to the city,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College, Churchgate. He added that contradictory circulars from different authorities are not helping the students who are already anxious. “We will wait for an official word on reopening before announcing about it,” he said. A senior BMC official said the decision on reopening colleges will entirely depend on Covid-19 cases recorded in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) over the next one week. “We have to ensure that restarting of locals for all does not bring a spike in cases. Only after that can we allow reopening of colleges. Students, too, would have to travel by train, and we need to take all necessary precautions before allowing colleges to reopen,” said the official. Meanwhile, MU-affiliated colleges in Raigad and Palghar will begin physical classes from Monday. “Civic bodies in Raigad and Palghar have given the go-ahead for colleges to reopen. The civic body in Mumbai is being cautious, but we agree with their decision,” said a senior official from the University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mu-colleges-in-mumbai-will-stay-online-till-february-22-101613240074900.html

According to officials, Thackeray appreciated the works being undertaken even during the pandemic. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is executing the 22km MTHL connecting Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, has completed 35.29% of the overall works on the sea link. Aaditya Thackeray, state environment minister, who also visited the site on Saturday tweeted, “This is India’s longest bridge and longest sea bridge. The @MMRDAOfficial is committed to complete it by 2023 mid. We are ensuring they have no hurdles in its completion.” MMRDA had earlier estimated the project to be completed by September 2022, however, officials said that the project faced delays owing to the pandemic. The 3+3 lane project starts from Sewri in Mumbai and lands at Nhava Sheva in Navi Mumbai with interchanges at Sewri, Shivaji Nagar and Chirle. Of the 22km, 16.5km will be constructed on the sea. The entire corridor is divided into three packages and the project is being funded by the Japanese International Co-operation Agency (JICA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cm-thackeray-makes-2nd-visit-to-mthl-35-works-completed-101613239714160.html
13-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: It’s mission Vidarbha for Shiv Sena and NCP||Considered a stronghold of national parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, Vidarbha is likely to witness a political battle soon, as the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) look to expand their base in the region that sees 62 MLAs and 10 MPs. Traditionally, the Congress and BJP have held sway over Vidarbha. The national parties kept a chunk of the seats in the alliance during the elections, stunting the growth of regional parties. Once a citadel of the Congress, the BJP, however, made significant gains in the vast region— spread over two revenue divisions of Nagpur and Amravati and 11 districts– over two decades. It swept the region in the 2014 Lok Sabha as well as Assembly elections and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. However, in the 2019 Assembly election, the BJP’s numbers came down to 29 from 44.The Congress-NCP together got 21 seats, a gain of 10 seats. The NCP alone increased its tally from one to six. With the altering political dynamic in the face of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi—alliance of the Sena, NCP and Congress—the region has been has become a point of focus for two regional parties. Sena attack In the past two months, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has made visits to the region, while NCP state president Jayant Patil, too, has toured Vidarbha. The Shiv Sena is focused on gaining foothold in western Vidarbha, covering districts of Nagpur, Yavatmal, Amravati, Wardha, Washim and Akola. A Shiv Sena functionary from Vidarbha said the party’s target is to win at least 15 of the 30 Assembly seats in western Vidarbha. Arvind Nerkar, Vidarbha’s sampark pramukh for Sena in western Vidarbha, said the Sena has admitted that it ignored the region in the alliance. “In the 2019 election, the Shiv Sena got only 12 seats, that too the ones we didn’t want. The BJP tried to defeat us in these seats, as it did not want us to grow,” Nerkar said. He added the Sena’s performance in the gram panchayat elections in the region has given a boost to the organisation. “Of the 2,450-odd gram panchayats, we have won 700-750. We will have our sarpanch in another 200 gram panchayats too. This is the best performance of the party in these village elections,” Nerkar said. The Shiv Sena’s attention to Vidarbha also comes as a reaction to the BJP’s thrust on the coastal Konkan region, which is seen as the Shiv Sena’s stronghold. Last week, senior BJP leader and Union home minister Amit Shah visited Sindhudurg in Konkan and also addressed a public meeting organised by ex-chief minister Narayan Rane, a former Shiv Sena leader. So far, the BJP was limited to a few pockets, but as the Sena is not its ally, the party is eyeing the coastal area, even as Sena is wooing it with a slew of projects, including boost to tourism, pushing industry, and improving road connectivity. Even before the 2019 elections, it inducted Rane into its fold. Despite the Sena’s objections, the party fielded Rane’s son Nitesh in Assembly elections. NCP’s strategy Two weeks ago, Patil started touring Vidarbha and Khandesh or north Maharashtra. The NCP is eyeing growing in eastern Vidarbha districts of Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Bhandara and Gondia, covering 15 Assembly constituencies. “We have had MLAs from Gadchiroli, Bhandara Gondia, Wardha, Buldhana and Nagpur. But in an alliance with the Congress, we got fewer seats. The party has enough organisational presence in the region. All political parties have the right to strengthen their bases. The Shiv Sena is also doing so. Wherever the party is weak, the organisation is working towards strengthening it,” NCP minister and spokesperson Nawab Malik said. He said the party will see inflow of former MPs and MLAs in the coming days. Former Congress leader Abha Pande from Nagpur is expected to join the NCP soon. Region watch The once-simmering Vidarbha statehood movement appears to have lost steam as all major political parties have sidestepped the issue, leaving only a bunch of small local parties to adopt the cause. The Shiv Sena and NCP have been against the division of the state, the Congress on the fence, while the BJP, which campaigned for statehood for the region in 2013-14, too, has kept it on the backburner. Dr Srinivas Khandewale, economist and political analyst from Nagpur, said, “The 2019 election has showed the BJP’s presence has weakened in the region. Devendra Fadnavis’s winning margin reduced in 2019 [compared to 2014]. The Congress’s leadership in the region is zero. [Former Maharashtra Congress chief] Balasaheb Thorat never visited Nagpur. We need to see what Patole does.” “The region has been neglected by those in power for over 60 years. The youth are tired of their false promises. The Congress base went to the BJP over the past two decades. After becoming the CM why would Devendra Fadnavis speak of a separate small state? The BJP’s base too is shaky now,” said Khandewale, who is also the core committee member of the Vidarbha Rajya Andolan Samiti. BJP, Cong speak Former state minister and state BJP president Sudhir Mungantiwar said regional parties are unlikely to become major players in Vidarbha. “They are unlikely to get electoral success, as their actions have not matched their ambition. The region has been neglected. The BJP lost some seats in 2019, most of which went to the Congress. Both the parties (Sena and NCP) can try expanding, there is no harm in dreaming,” said Mungantiwar, who represents Ballarpur assembly seat from Vidarbha’s Chandrapur district.Newly elected Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said the MVA allies are united. “The Congress has traditionally held sway in Vidarbha region. If not BJP, the alternative for the people is going to be the Congress [in Vidarbha]. The Congress has gained seats in 2019 elections here,” Patole, who represents Sakoli Assembly seat from Vidarbha’s Bhandara district, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-it-s-mission-vidarbha-for-shiv-sena-and-ncp-101613239474025.html
13-02-2021||City||'Sheer abuse of law': Jammu HC quashes FIR against Kargil Congress councillor||The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Thursday quashed a sedition case filed against Councillor of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Kargil, (LAHDC-K), Zakir Hussain, for his comments on the Indian Army following clashes with People’s Liberation Army of China at Galwan Valley in Ladakh last year.Justice Sanjeev Kumar of J-K High Court, Srinagar Wing, quashed the FIR against Hussain. He was booked by the police after his “highly objectionable” audio clip, mocking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian Army in the wake of the recent face-off between India and China, went viral on social media.While quashing the FIR, Justice Sanjeev Kumar observed that that the offences charged against the petitioner are not made out and, therefore, the registration of FIR, which has culminated into the filing of the final police report without previous sanction from the competent authority before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kargil, is sheer abuse of the process of law.Also read: 2 years of Pulwama terror attack - The day when India lost 40 CRPF men﻿“This Court, therefore, finds it a fit case to invoke its inherent powers vested by Section 482 CrPC and quash all the criminal proceedings pending against the petitioner including the impugned FIR with regard to the audio clip, which allegedly contains a conversation between the petitioner and one Nissar Ahmed Khan,” Justice Kumar observed.On June 18 last year, the Kargil police received information through reliable sources that an audio clip containing objectionable conversation, demeaning the armed forces, in the backdrop of clashes between Indian Army and armed forces of China that took place in Galwan Valley of Ladakh region, has gone viral on social media.Taking cognisance of the information received, the police registered the subject FIR and set the investigation into motion. During the investigation, it was established that the audio clip of 6.3 minutes duration that had gone viral on social media contained a conversation between the petitioner and one Nissar Ahmad Khan.The Court ruled that to make out the offence of sedition, it is necessary to demonstrate that alleged acts have the tendency or intention to create public disorder or disturb public peace.Justice Sanjeev Kumar ruled that the controversial comments made by Hussain, though unsavoury and detestable, did not constitute sedition under Section 124A, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or attract the offences under Sections 153-A, 153-B, 505(2) and 120-B of the IPC."Undoubtedly, in the conversation, the petitioner has demeaned the Indian Forces and eulogized the armed forces of China in the context of recent Galwan valley conflict between the two nations. It is equally true that the conversation contained in the audio clip, which was circulated on the social media by the co-accused Nissar Ahmed Khan, does bring into contempt the government established by law in India, but unless the conversation has the tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of public peace by incitement to an offence, the same would not be sedition to attract the applicability of Section 124A or for that matter Section 153A or 153B IPC” the Court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sheer-abuse-of-law-jammu-hc-quashes-fir-against-kargil-congress-councillor-101613238553629.html
13-02-2021||Delhi||DU College cancels lecture related to Singhu border, college cites technical problems||Academic-activist Sumial Singh Sidhu has alleged that a lecture titled ‘Baba Farid to Singhu border: The Making of Punjabi Radical Tradition’ was cancelled in the last minute by the administration of Delhi University’s Ramanujan College.Singh, a Punjab based scholar and historian from Bhatinda, said the online lecture organised by the History department of the college was scheduled on Thursday evening. “I was informed only 10-15 minutes before the lecture time of 5pm that it had been cancelled. I was told that the authorities had some issues with the title of the lecture,” he said. Singh said that the title was decided in order to summarise the history of Punjabi protest culture. “The college authorities had an issue with the use of ‘Singhu border’ in the title and abruptly cancelled the talk after succumbing to political pressure. The lecture would focus on the rich Punjabi protest culture — starting from the 13th century to the 21st century. It was all about the history and it would have helped the students,” he said.Singhu border is the epicentre of the ongoing farmers’ protests against the three new farm laws on the borders of the national capital. The farmers are also protesting at the Tikri and the Ghazipur borders. When contacted Ramanujan college principal SP Agarwal said, “The lecture was cancelled because of some technical problems. We did not cancel it due to its title or content. We always encourage researchers and scholars to come and deliver lectures for our students. I will discuss this issue with the concerned department and we will reschedule it whenever possible.”Responding to which Singh said, “If there was really a technical error, the college would have informed me and others waiting to join the lecture after 5pm and not 10-15 minutes before it.”Several faculty members in the university too criticised the college administration for cancelling the lecture. Naveen Gaur, an associate professor in Dyal Singh College, said, “This is indicative of the unease of college administration about discussing any issue that could be contrary to the government’s position. This is exactly opposite to what an academic institution should do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-college-cancels-lecture-related-to-singhu-border-college-cites-technical-problems-101613238695429.html

Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s municipal affairs in-charge, said, “On one hand, the BJP claims they have no money to pay the salaries of MCD employees, but on the other, the SDMC has increased the councillor fund from ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore along with an extra allocation of ₹50 lakh from the chairperson and vice-chairperson. “In the last one year, the BJP’s motto has been only to loot as much as possible from the MCDs. The AAP demands immediate rollback of this inhuman scheme,” he said. He said the Kejriwal government has given ₹1,095 crore to the MCD to pay their employees, but alleged that the salaries have still not been disbursed. However, the BJP said the hike in funds would minimise bureaucratic delays.“One finds it surprising to see the AAP objecting, as councillors of the BJP, the AAP and Congress can instantly give funds for work in their wards without red-tapism. This will also help councillors meet RWAs’ requests,” said Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-slams-sdmc-move-to-hike-councillors-local-area-funds-bjp-says-increase-will-cut-redtape-101613238694930.html
13-02-2021||Delhi||630 EV registered in city since launch of campaign: Govt||The Delhi government on Saturday said 630 electric vehicles (EVs) were registered in the Capital since the launch of the Switch Delhi campaign last week.The eight-week campaign aims at sensitising residents on the benefits of switching to an EV. It is part of the state government’s EV policy, launched in last year, that includes setting up 500 charging points across the city.“Analysis by RMI India (a private organisation) reveals that subsidies provided on electric two-wheelers under the policy made the upfront purchase comparable in price to top selling petrol two-wheelers. But the real saving is in the operating cost,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot.He said an electric two-wheeler could save a person monthly ₹1,850 compared to a petrol scooter and ₹1,650 compared to a petrol motorcycle. “An average electric two-wheeler provides a lifetime saving of 1.98 tonnes of carbon emissions... (the equivalent of ) roughly 11 trees. We can save our environment by making this switch and we owe this to our future generations,” Gahlot said. The minister also released statements from leading automakers.Bajaj Auto MD Rajiv Bajaj, read the release, said the policy inspired the company to accelerate its plan to scale up their electric Chetak as also to introduce the electric avatars its three-wheelers.Electric vehicle company Ather Energy co-founder and CEO Tarun Mehta is quoted as saying, “We have seen great response across launch markets for the Ather 450X and we will open our experience centre, Ather Space in Delhi in the next few weeks.” Gahlot said many other EV two-wheeler companies had launched several vehicle models in Delhi.Jitendar Kumar, a security guard who bought an electric two-wheeler and availed the government subsidy said his e-bike functions smoothly and efficiently.“I have been able to cut short my fuel expenses since I purchased my EV. My monthly salary is ₹10,000 and I used to spend a lot of money on petrol. Now, I have been able to save around ₹3500 monthly that I used. This has helped me in managing my other expenses,” Kumar said.Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL), a newly established 100% subsidiary of state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), said its EVs in Delhi clocked 20 million kilometres on Saturday. In a statement, the company said that it saved around ₹8.6 crore and prevented the emission of 3,573-tonne of carbon.“(It) also contributes to 133,000 litres saving in fuel consumption. A total of 565 CESL EVs are running in the national capital... There has been a rise of more than 140% YoY in sales of electric cars that shows the gradual acceptance of the technology among the climate conscious,” CESL said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/630-ev-registered-in-city-since-launch-of-campaign-govt-101613238693168.html

It won’t help. MPs and MLAs are deserting the party. The TMC will lose this time,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s state president.The BJP has already launched four Rath Yatras, which are presently moving through various constituencies of West Bengal. The fifth Rath Yatra is expected to be launched later this month. While the first three were launched by BJP president JP Nadda, the fourth one was flagged off by Union home minister Amit Shah.Abhishek Banerjee sharpened the ‘outsider’ charge against the BJP on Saturday saying, “Spitting gutka won’t be able to damage the iron of Bengal.”He also said, “They (BJP) are bringing in 500 leaders from various states and the centre to camp in West Bengal. They are saying that there would be the same government in the state and at the centre and that there would be a double-engine government. I would tell them to fight Mamata Banerjee’s single-engine first,” said Abhishek Banerjee.The BJP lashed out saying that the one-engine of the TMC is that of corruption which the BJP would remove with its two engines of development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-to-counter-bjp-s-rath-yatras-with-didir-doot-tableaus-in-poll-bound-bengal-101613237355210.html
13-02-2021||Noida||Jeweller duo robbed at gunpoint, jewellery worth ₹15 lakh taken away||Three unidentified motorcycle-borne armed men on Friday night allegedly robbed jewellers of gold and silver items near Ghookhna Morh area on the Delhi Meerut Road. The robbed goods valued at around ₹15-20 lakh, said police. The cops said that they had registered an FIR for robbery and that teams were on the case to trace the suspects. At 8pm, jeweller Raju Shishodia said he and his brother Amit had closed their shop for the day and were heading home barely 300 metres away when the incident happened. “As soon as we reached the main gate of our house, and still on our vehicle, three men who were masked arrived and pointed pistols at us. Soon, they started snatching the bag containing the jewellery and there was a brief scuffle. At this, two of the opened fire and fire two shots to scare us. One of them later pointed a pistol at my brother and told me to give away the bag or he will open fire,” said Raju Shishodia, one of the two victims. He said that all the men were masked and in age group 20-25 years. “Once he pointed the gun, we had no option to give away the bag. He also opened fire which just passed at some distance. Then, they snatched the bag and fled. We then tried to chase them, but they disappeared in small by lanes. Thereafter, we called up the police,” Shishodia said while adding that their shop is in place for past 20 years and each day, they take the jewellery to their house from their shop after closure. He said that the estimated loss was about ₹15-20 lakh and more valuation will be taken up. The cops said formed teams to trace the suspect robbers. “We have registered an FIR under IPC section of robbery and the victims were free to give additional statements if they were fired upon during the incident. We will add appropriate sections to the FIR. We have sought valuation from the duo. Meanwhile, we have deputed teams to trace the suspects,” said Awaneesh Kumar, circle officer (city 2).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/jeweller-duo-robbed-at-gunpoint-jewellery-worth-15-lakh-taken-away-101613237733149.html
13-02-2021||Noida||Very dense fog warning, air quality worsens as smog engulfs Noida, Ghaziabad||Noida: The city and adjoining areas are likely to witness very dense fog for the next two days, which will bring the visibility down to less than 50 metres, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned on Saturday. Also, the air quality of Noida and Ghaziabad worsened further on Saturday as a thick layer of smog engulfed the region. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), both the cities continued to be the most polluted in the country – a third over the past five days.According to the weather department, while the wind directions are westerly and north-westerly – dry and cold – the low wind speed that goes almost nil during the morning hours is leading to fog. “The region will see very dense fog for the next two days, which will bring down the visibility to less than 50 metres. The morning hours from 4am to 9am is the time of highest probability of the very dense fog in the region,” said an official at IMD. According to IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures are around the season’s average. On Saturday, the maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida was recorded at 26.6 degrees Celsius and 13.2 degrees Celsius, respectively. While the entire region remained engulfed by a layer of smog, Ghaziabad’s air quality slipped into ‘severe’ category again, being the top polluted city of the country, followed by Noida as the second most polluted city. With the weather conditions likely to remain the same for the next 48 hours, the pollution monitoring agencies see no major change in the pollution levels. According to the weather analysts, with no wind to ventilate off the particle pollutants, the fog layer thickens during the morning hours and leaves smog – mixture of pollutants and moisture – for the rest of the day. “The wind speed in the NCR is very low while the emissions are constant. Since the ventilation conditions are so poor, the particles cannot disperse, and they mix with the fog creating smog through the day. This condition may persist for a couple of days,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency. According to CPCB, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Saturday was 386 against 363 a day earlier, both under ‘very poor’ category and second most polluted city on both days. However, Ghaziabad’s air on Saturday again entered ‘severe’ zone with an AQI of 401 against 375 a day earlier – the most polluted city in the country just like on February 9 and 10 and 12. The AQI of Greater Noida was 363 against 352 a day earlier. AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to improve after February 15. “Surface winds are low. The ventilation is likely to stay in the same range and no significant change in AQI is expecting for the next couple of days. AQI is likely to stay in the very poor category for tomorrow. AQI likely to marginally improve to lower end of very poor to poor category is forecasted for February 15 and 16,” said a SAFAR statement on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/very-dense-fog-warning-air-quality-worsens-as-smog-engulfs-noida-ghaziabad-101613237673170.html

This assumes significance with local body elections scheduled for March in Uttar Pradesh and assembly elections in the state and Uttarakhand next year. Both states have a BJP government. The farmer leaders announced their intention under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella group of more than 40 farmer unions, many of which are influential. “We will not fight with the police or administration officers. The people of the BJP have attacked us in order to disrupt our agitation. If these BJP people come to your village or in neighbourhood villages and hold rallies or come to seek votes, then you should give them same treatment what they dished out to us,” Haryana Bharaitya Kisan Union (Chaduni) chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni told the gathering at the UP Gate on Saturday. He said that people should that vote for anyone who did not support the farmers’ agitation, from panchayat to parliamentary elections. “We agitate only when it becomes unavoidable. Now, that you have started the agitation and you should defeat the BJP in such a manner that the next one who comes to power should consider your demands beforehand,” said Chaduni. Other prominent farmer leaders Darshan Singh, Balbir Singh Rajewal along with Bhrataiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait were also present at the dais. They did not contest Chaduni’s statements. The farmers leaders also spoke on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s use of the term “andolanjeevi” in the Parliament on January 8. “We are fighting for our demands, but we never heard the government use such words for us. You heard the PM earlier calling us “annadatta (food giver)”, but now he described us with words like “andolanjeevi” and “parjeevi (parasite)”. A framer who grows crops and feed people has now become a parjeevi,” Rajewal told the gathering. He said that the words left a lasting scar on farmers. “If any BJP leader or worker comes to you, you should remember these words,” Rajewal said. The Prime Minister had used the word “andolanjeevi” in his reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s Address in the Rajya Sabha.“I have noticed that for some time, a new jamaat has been born; a new community has come forward. That is andolanjeevi (those who live off protests). If there is a lawyers’ protest, they are seen there; if there is a students’ agitation, they will be seen there; if there is a protest by labourers, they will be seen there...” the PM had said. Two days later, he clarified his remarks in the Lok Sabha. He said that the farmers’ protest was sacred but had been hijacked by andolanjivis who demonstrated with pictures of those jailed for terrorism. BJP leaders from UP said that the people would remain with them. “Everyone saw what happened at Red Fort on Republic Day. Farmers’ agitation is pavitra (sacred) for us but this was not the farmers’ agitation. The PM has already kept all facts about the new laws in both the Houses. In UP, the entire opposition was defeated in 2019 and now they are trying for 2022. In fact people who are politically reduced to naught are the andolanjeevis and now, when they were exposed, are upset about it,” said Chandra Mohan, spokesperson and state secretary of BJP – UP. “The workers of the BJP always remain with people. The government has brought in the farm laws keeping in mind benefit of farmers and common man. The farmers in UP trust the PM and with him.”The farmers have been camping at the UP Gate protest site since November 28, 2020 and demanding the repeal of three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. Their several rounds of talks with government have failed to break the deadlock and presently the farmers’ leaders are holding ‘Panchayats’ in different states and areas near Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmer-unions-call-on-people-to-not-vote-for-bjp-till-demands-met-101613237133644.html

Darshan Pal, a senior farmer leader from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, said that there were many panchayats being held in states near Delhi.“Lakhs of people who are attending the panchayats are being readied mentally for the day when we give a call (for the march). People will come from different areas and villages and they will come afoot to Delhi. You will have to walk to Delhi when a call is given by the Samyukt kisan Morcha. We will fight and offer any sacrifice,” Pal added. The move comes after incidents of violence were reported during the tractor rally undertaken in Delhi by farmers on Republic Day. Since then, there have been no discussions or talks held between farmers’ leaders and the government over their demands. The last time the two parties held talks was on January 22. ‘FULLY PREPARED FOR SUMMER’The farmers’ leaders on Saturday reiterated their demands and said that the summer season will have no impact on the ongoing agitation or the strength of the gathering at the UP Gate.“I have told leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha that there is no shortfall in numbers at UP Gate and we are fully prepared to continue protesting during the summers. Diesel will not come from the market but people will bring it like they brought water for me,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait.“In the summer, we will bring in generators of 200 kilowatt and will run coolers and air conditioners. It is not just people in the national Capital which can sleep peacefully in ACs but we will prepare large halls here where farmers will also sleep in ACs. They say that we are stealing electricity here. But we have told the government to give us commercial electricity connections and we will pay for it,” he added. He said a questionnaire will be prepared and that people should seek replies to it from “them” if “they” come to seek votes. “We are ready for talks but the government should speak to us. We will be holding 15 meetings (panchayats) in one month and will set the government right. We have tied them up with protest sites at the (Delhi) borders. If they come to seek votes, you should ask them whether their MPs/MLAs have given up their pensions and also what they did to support the agitation in Delhi. We will prepare the questionnaire soon,” Tikait added.GANDHI’S GRANDDAUGHTER LENDS SUPPORT TO FARMERSOn Saturday, the farmers at the UP Gate were joined by Mahatma Gandhi’s granddaughter Tara Gandhi Bhattacharya.Bhattacharya, 87, spoke to farmers from the dais, saying she is not representing any political party there. “I have come to meet the farmers. I want to tell them that we are alive just because of them. I don’t understand politics. Please consider me as one of you. I have come here to offer prayers and the truth should win. You should prosper. I would also like to tell all of you to remove mann ki hinsa (feeling of any violence/hatred in heart) as it pollutes the ambiance. You have so much truth in yourself that you don’t need any language of violence,” Bhattacharya told farmers. Before the arrival of farmers’ leaders at UP Gate, a group of local residents under the banner of ‘Ghaziabad Utthan Samiti’ staged a sit-in near the protest site, demanding that the National Highway 9, which is blocked due to the ongoing farmers’ protest, be opened up.“We staged a sit-in and later vacated the site after submitting a memorandum to officials. Thousands of people are affected daily by this agitation and many of these so-called farmers. They are here for over 70 days and are blocking our highway. We want to get it vacated. In case our demand is not met, we will come here in large numbers next week and start our peaceful protest,” said Dr Ashutosh Gupta, an assistant professor with Delhi University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/be-prepared-to-march-on-foot-to-delhi-farmer-leaders-tell-supporters-101613237133121.html

The account had Choubey’s same profile picture which his original account has.The fraudster then sent messages to those who accepted his friend requests, asking them to help him financially. He requested a journalist to urgently send him ₹20,000 claiming wife of one of his friends was serious. “Since I knew the senior officer well, I immediately informed him about the cyber con,” said the journalist. Meanwhile, the senior officer started receiving phone calls and messages from other friends too about the fake Facebook account, the police said.

13-02-2021||Mumbai||Ensure there are no encroachments on roads in Aurangabad: Bombay HC||Expressing anguish at the encroachments on footpaths in Aurangabad, which resulted in dissuading tourists from visiting the historical monuments like Ajanta and Ellora, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) directed the local administration and police to ensure removal of the encroachments. The court also expressed the hope that this action on the part of authorities would attract more tourists, thus improving the economy of the region. A division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar, while hearing a criminal suo-moto public interest litigation (PIL), was informed by advocate AP Bhandari that the plan by City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) was not being followed as the electronic shops and eateries that housed the area were causing nuisance and empty spaces between buildings and footpaths had been encroached by the shopkeepers themselves, as a result of which traffic in the area was also affected. Bhandari submitted photographs of the Cannaught Place area which was under Cidco. Commissioner/administrator of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, who was present in court submitted that following the directions of the court to ensure that the city was beautified, he had taken initiatives to remove the encroachments so that the city is made clean and beautiful. He added that an NGO had been roped in to do the needful and added that he planned to create a 20kms track for the use of cyclists and pedestrians. He also submitted that separate parking places and hawker zone in the city were also being planned to ensure that the roads are not crowded and there is a smooth flow of traffic. The Aurangabad city police commissioner also informed the court that steps were being taken to remove unauthorized parking and was extending all help to the corporation to remove the encroachments and hindrances to traffic. After hearing the submissions, the court in light of the suo-moto PIL observed, “In tourism map of India, Aurangabad district has a special place, due to places like Ajanta, Ellora caves, Bibi-ka-Makbara, etc. The tourists from all over the world came to Aurangabad. Aurangabad city can be developed as ‘tourist centre’ for tourists of all over the world. But, for those necessary steps need to be taken by all the authorities in that regard.” The court concluded that it hoped that once the city improved it would attract more tourists which would also provide jobs to the locals and posted the PIL for further compliance on February 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ensure-there-are-no-encroachments-on-roads-in-aurangabad-bombay-hc-101613233113722.html

The chief minister said that the people continued to stand by the state government. He said the continuation of power for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) was certain in the state.While inaugurating the ruling Left Democratic Front’s (LDF) pre-poll rally, led by CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan, in north Kerala’s Kasaragod, the chief minister said the state has witnessed all-round development despite many natural calamities and the Covid-19 pandemic.He listed the government’s many achievements and said the people wanted a continuation of power and their wish was quite visible in the recently-concluded local body polls. In the local body poll in December, the left had notched up a comfortable win.“Whether it was a flood or a pandemic situation, the government stood with people and met their needs without any fail. Nobody starved during the lockdown or natural calamities. When the continuation of power was certain, opposition parties and some central agencies came up with many stories but they all fell flat,” the CM said, indirectly referring to the gold smuggling case and other corruption charges against the government.Also read: First phase of Budget session concludes, Lok Sabha to reconvene on March 8After the opposition raked up the contentious Sabarimala temple issue, the government has decided to not bite the bait rather focus on developmental issues. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy had written a letter to the chief minister last month, asking him to approach the Supreme Court to speed up the verdict on the contentious temple issue and withdraw its earlier affidavit that favoured entry of women of all ages to the hilltop shrine. In the letter, Chandy also said the government’s affidavit created confusion which ultimately led to the five-bench verdict in 2018 that triggered widespread unrest in the state.Without referring to the temple issue, the CM said the state can’t live with mere controversies and slogans but it has to meet developmental aspirations of the people. “Let them rake up any issue, we are least bothered. People will realise their designs and vote for development. We are least worried because people are with us,” the CM said, adding that the Congress and the BJP have the same voice while criticising the government.As assembly elections are just two months away, poll fever has gripped the state with a series of rallies and visits of national leaders. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the state on Sunday to inaugurate the new plant of the Bharat Petroleum Corporation of India in Kochi. He will interact with the core committee members of the party.An also-ran in state’s bipolar politics, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is trying its best to make its presence felt in the state. The only political gain of the BJP so far was the lone assembly seat it won in Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram in last assembly elections.While opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala’s state-wide yatra is midway, the LDF began its rally in north Kerala’s Kasaragod on Saturday and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath will inaugurate BJP state president K Surendran’s ‘Vijay Yatra’ on February 21.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, also an MP from the state, will address the concluding session of Chennithala’s yatra on February 24 in the state capital.As free food kits played an important role in recent local body elections, the Congress is planning to counter it with Rahul Gandhi's ‘Nyay’ scheme which ensures lower-income families a monthly sum of ₹6,000. Party insiders said Gandhi will campaign extensively in Kerala this time as it is the key among five states that are going to polls.Meanwhile, a team of Election Commission led by Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora arrived in the state and started discussions with political parties to decide o the poll date and review the state’s preparedness. The team will be in the state for two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/continuation-of-power-in-kerala-certain-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-101613230717205.html

They did so to save MP. During 15 months of Congress rule, the state was ruined," Sharma told reporters on the sidelines of his party's two-day training session here.He said these legislators joined the BJP after being swayed by the public-centric welfare programmes of the party's governments in the state under Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.He said the public had endorsed these leaders, who had to face bypolls after quitting the MP Assembly, by voting for them.Speaking at the two-day training session, Union minister Narendra Tomar asked legislators to ask their own questions in the Assembly rather than those given to them by others as "vested interests" may be involved which could lead to embarrassment for the party, one of those who attended claimed.Tomar asked those attending the camp to stay in touch with the public of their constituencies and give importance to party workers whose hard work was at the centre of poll wins, the functionary added.The BJP's West Bengal in charge and senior MP BJP leader Kailash Vijaywargiya also addressed legislators on the last day of the training session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/congress-mlas-joined-us-last-year-to-save-madhya-pradesh-says-state-bjp-chief-101613230400200.html

Both the Bharatiya Janata Pary and the Trinamool Congress are our rivals. We are not going into an alliance and will contest the polls as an individual party,” said Mira Chakraborty, the party’s state president.Founded by late Ram Vilas Paswan, and presently led by his son Chirag Paswan, the LJP had even contested 135 seats during the Bihar assembly elections in 2020.Even though it managed to win only one seat, it secured around 10 per cent of the votes, giving a blow to Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United).The BJP and the TMC are however not giving any importance to the LJP saying that the party is struggling for its existence in Bihar.Also read: 'Under some sort of surveillance' - Mahua Moitra on armed officers“The LJP has become irrelevant now. It is struggling to prove its existence in Bihar. Who knows them in West Bengal?

Any political party may contest the polls from anywhere. But in Bengal, people only know Mamata Banerjee as the face of development,” said Partha Chatterjee, minister and a veteran TMC leader.Other regional parties like the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the Janata Dal (United), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Samajwadi Party (SP), Shiv Sena have also decided to contest the polls either in alliance or on their own.Psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty, who is also a professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University, said the regional parties are not likely to have any impact on the vote share in the upcoming Bengal polls.

13-02-2021||Jaipur||It'll bring loss to all: Rahul Gandhi calls on people to stand against farm laws||Aabshar H QuaziSenior Congress leader and former party chief Rahul Gandhi continued his offensive on the contentious farm laws on the last day of his two-day Rajasthan tour. Gandhi called upon all sections of the society to stand up against farm laws and said that the farm laws will impact all.Gandhi alleged that PM Modi wants to hand over ₹40 lakh crore worth agriculture sector to his corporate friends. Later, while addressing a tractor rally in Roopangarh in Ajmer district, Rahul Gandhi continued his fierce attack on PM Modi over farm laws.Addressing the tractor rally on a unique stage prepared over a tractor trolley, Gandhi said that, "It is not only farmers who are against farm laws but workers and small traders are also against these farm laws"."If these farm laws are enforced, then not just the farmers but street vendors and small traders will also suffer losses and then they will have to work for the corporates," alleged Gandhi.One big businessman still owns 40 per cent storage of agri commodities and these farm laws will give 80 per cent to 90 per cent control over farmers' produce, he said.Also read: J-K to get status of a state at an appropriate time -Home minister Amit ShahFarmers will be forced to sell their produce at lesser prices and will need to buy agri commodities at higher prices, this way, farmers will be looted twice, he said."The country will suffer due to these 3 farm laws so it is not the sole responsibility of just farmers but also workers, small traders, youth and the people of India to protest these farm laws," said Rahul.PM Modi wants that all agri commodities should be sold under one brand name, he said, adding that when these farm laws will be enforced, then no youth will be given jobs, said Gandhi.Criticising the farm laws, the Congress leader said that while the first farm law says that big corporates can buy any amount of agricultural commodities of any magnitude, then there will be no need for Mandi which means that the law first intends to kill Mandis. Farmers and Congress workers were present on the tractors and tractor trolley during the tractor rally."Farm laws allow unlimited hoarding of the agricultural commodities and prevent farmers from accessing judiciary if farmers want to take businessmen in court," said Gandhi."India's and world's biggest business is in agriculture which is worth ₹40 lakh crores and run by 40 per cent Indians which include farmers, small traders, porters, workers and poor but PM Modi wants to hand over this agriculture business to his corporate friends through this farm laws," he said.PM Modi wants to send agriculture into the hands of two corporates whereas farmers are not ready for it, he said.I have warned about the loss from Covid-19 earlier but the ruling party and media ridiculed me and later the family members of these people got ill of Covid-19, he said.He continued to attack demonetization and GST brought by the Modi government and said it had impacted small traders, workers, farmers and the poor.This agriculture business is of Bharat Mata not of farmers only, he said.The Modi government is robbing farmers' house and wants to give it to your 'Hum Do Humare Do' (corporate friends), said Gandhi."You want to steal farmers' wealth so no farmer will talk to you until you will repeal farm laws," he said.Gandhi said that PM Modi ridiculed farmers by calling them 'Aandolanjivi' (people who thrive on a movement) in the Parliament session.After the public meeting on tractor trolley, he also drove a tractor while Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasara remained seated beside him on the tractor. Gandhi also rode over a camel cart after the tractor rally today.Later, Rahul Gandhi also addressed Kisan Mahapanchayat in Makrana in Nagaur district. While addressing the Kisan Mahapanchayat, CM Ashok Gehlot said that "such kind of a person has become the PM who is insensitive"."Covid-19 management of Rajasthan was best in across states," he said.Speaking on the occasion, former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot said that the Modi government has made its mind to kick the stomach of the farmers."Congress and Rahul Gandhi have committed to the farmers for supporting them and forcing the Centre to repeal farm laws," he said."Rahul's visit will shake the Centre as he is with the farmers," he said.Earlier in the day, Gandhi visited Folk Deity Tejaji Maharaj temple in Sursura in Kishangarh district of Rajasthan and offered prayers. Folk Deity Tejaji Maharaj is revered and worshipped across several rural communities in the state including Jat, Gujjar, Meena and others.CM Gehlot, AICC state in-charge Ajay Maken, PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasara, former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, party general secretary KC Venugopal, among other Congress leaders, were also present at the tractor rally.Also read: After BJP’s offer to join, Dinesh Trivedi has a requestReacting to Rahul Gandhi's visit to Rajasthan against farm laws, state BJP president Satish Poonia said Gandhi has disappointed the people of Rajasthan."Rahul Gandhi has disappointed the people of Rajasthan by not entertaining them. Farmers kept waiting for counting till 10 and farm loan waiver. Baseless talks on farm laws, misleading information about China and disgraceful comments on the PM. Also, the cot of Congress broke down in the Congress program which means failure," Poonia tweeted.Meanwhile, Pilot was seen seated four places away from Gandhi who earlier used to sit just next to him. The impact of the dissidence of former deputy CM Sachin Pilot last year was during Rahul Gandhi's visit. Earlier, Sachin Pilot used to drive Gandhi in his car and used to accompany him like a shadow but the distance was seen between the two leaders during Gandhi's ongoing tour to Rajasthan.Experts say the distance between Gandhi and Pilot could be the result of Pilot's rebellion against CM Ashok Gehlot and his government last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/itll-bring-loss-to-all-rahul-gandhi-calls-on-people-to-stand-against-farm-laws-101613221157213.html

About 20.3% are in the age group of 41 to 50 years.The young guns are hopeful of bringing about a positive change in the lives of people in their respective areas. “I have always wanted to serve the society which is why I was earlier preparing for the civil services. But people from my area encouraged me to contest the zila parishad elections and now I will be able to live my dream,” says Bharati Janartha, 32, the newly elected member from Tikkar zila parishad ward in Jubbal and Kotkhai assembly segment.Kushal Mungta, 32, was elected to the zila parishad from Saraswatinagar ward. “The entry of youngsters into politics in Himachal is a healthy sign of democracy. Young people are energetic, and they can devote more time to the people,” said opined.Kushal, who was backed by the Congress and won by a margin of 6,500 votes, does not favour elections in Himachal on party symbols. “Though the PRI polls were not held on party symbols this time, but the same is being contemplated for the future. I feel elections on party symbols divide people,” he said.After being elected zila parishad chairperson in Bilaspur district, Muskan, 21, became the youngest to head the top post. She is pursuing her law studies. Muskan won as an independent candidate and later switched over to the BJP.Another 21-year-old, Sonika Lata, was elected as pradhan of Brasli gram panchayat in Rohru subdivision. “Though I made it, panchayat is a big responsibility. I will do my best,” she said.Political analysts believe that the increased participation of youngsters in the PRI elections reflects their sensitivity towards their professional obligations and responsibility. “The hike in age limits of PRI representatives and increase in panchayat budget has begun to attract youths,” said Harish Thakur, head of political science department at Himachal Pradesh University.Meanwhile, political parties also feel that the participation of young people will strengthen the democratic setup of the state as well as the country.Shimla (rural) legislator Vikramaditya Singh said it was good that many young people have been elected representatives in the panchayat elections. With this, we can hope for more young faces in upcoming assembly elections in 2022, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-68-under-40-young-blood-ready-to-take-on-grassroots-governance-in-himachal-101613219671689.html

These air pollutants also stunt the mental and physical growth of children.According to the data, the primary source of SOx in these areas is the brick manufacturing industry. The primary source of NOx (nitrogen oxides) pollutants is also the brick manufacturing industry.The bench headed by Chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel in an order passed on February 11 said, "We are of the opinion that further follow up action needs to be taken to prevent illegal operation of brick kilns and recovery of environmental compensation for the period of illegal operation, following due process of law.""For those not having consents, closure can be immediately, particularly when show cause notice has already been given. For those having consents, it is necessary to verify whether they are meeting the prescribed pollution norms and siting norms. A joint Committee of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State pollution control board and district magistrate of Ganga Nagar may look into these aspects and furnish a factual report within three months," the bench said."It is submitted that State Board has identified 594 brick kiln units in Sriganganagar district. Out of the identified units, 55 brick kilns are closed; 234 brick kiln are operating with valid consent to operate from the State Board; application of 80 brick kiln is under process with the State Board and out of the remaining 225 brick kiln, the State Board has issued show cause notice for intended closure to 217 brick kiln and closure directions to 08 brick kiln," NGT noted the State Pollution Control Board report.The plea, filed by Hakam Singh local resident of Shri Ganganagar and matter argued by Pushpinder Singh advocate, submitted that when 225 brick kilns are operating without any consent to operate, which is a matter of record, there is no need for show cause notice and on that pretext not closing such kilns amounts to permitting illegality.In any case, the said reply was filed by the PCB more than one year back i.e. on January 30, 2020 and show cause notices were reportedly issued in the year 2019, still, the kilns are being allowed to operate illegally.The petitioner further alleged that guidelines issued by the Rajasthan state pollution control board, Jaipur have not been complied with and there is no state policy with regard to the control of pollution by the brick kiln industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/ngt-directs-immediate-action-against-unauthorised-brick-kilns-in-rajasthan-101613216015976.html
13-02-2021||Pune||4 reports of tekdi fires in 10 days worry environments, Pune civic authorities||Over the past 10 days, there have been six fires reported on tekdis (hillocks), according to a group of volunteers working on the various tekdis in and around the city as well as the forest department and the fire brigade of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).“Every year we create a fire control line to control such fires from spreading. Citizens are alert and message us, we go and extinguish the fire. This time it has happened four times in 10 days, twice in Pashan and twice in Sus Nande reserve forest. We have taken guidelines from experts on how to extinguish fire. When the fire brigade team comes to extinguish, we learnt the basics of tackling the fire without putting ourselves at risk,” said Pushkar Kulkarni of Save Baner Hills. The group of volunteers in every area like Vetal tekdi, Baner, Pashan Sus Gaon, Bavdhan, Taljai, have formed a group ‘Prevent Forest Fires’ that includes forest range officials and fire brigade personnels.The biggest fire reported was spread across five kilometres and was spotted by volunteer Shankar Pandey in Mann, Hinjewadi. “The fire was spotted at 12 noon on February 11 and I immediately alerted the other team members and then, the forest department.”“It took us five hours to bring the tekdi fire under control,” said another volunteer Naresh Sonawane from Hinjewadi.According to Deepak Shrotre of Vasundhara Abhiyaan and an avid tekdi lover, “Every year in January and February, there are instances of forest/tekdi fires taking place. There are three reasons for these fires - people smoking on the tekdi and throwing the cigarette buds without really extinguishing it, or people with nuisance value and lastly those who do it out of greed for creating barren lands atop tekdis.”“On Wednesday, there was a massive fire atop the Katraj tunnel and it took several tankers to extinguish it,” said Prashant Ranpise, fire officer, PMC “Environment is disregarded as we are not sensitive about it. We have seen many incidents this season and there is a lot of dryness in the air and grass grows fast during the winter and has less moisture, hence it catches fire easily and strong winds help spread the flames,” said forest official, Rahul Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/4-reports-of-tekdi-fires-in-10-days-worry-environments-pune-civic-authorities-101613213851876.html

We had a couple of people say that they saw it too, and perhaps it might still be there in the murky waters. It cannot cross over from the place in the river that it is in, for the parapet wall is too steep and the river current is also very fast,” said Sumedh.Anil Khaire, chief executive officer, Wild Animal Rescue & Rehabilitation Centre, said, “An unknown person called on the helpline number and we have been trying to call back, but the phone is switched off. We are not sure if the crocodile is still there, but we are equipped to rescue it.”According to Khaire, there was only one sighting of a crocodile three years ago in Khadakwasla which was rescued and released in the wild.“We got information that a crocodile was spotted under the Bhide bridge. Together with the newly formed rapid response team and representatives of ResQ, we reached the spot. We did not receive any photographic evidence of the crocodile until 7pm.

On October 10 2016, a trial court convicted him under charges of the Official Secrets Acts and others and sentenced him to nine years in jail.The High Court upheld his conviction under the Official Secrets Acts. After completing his sentence, on April 14, 2020, he was released from jail but sent to Sewa Sadan Deportation Centre Lampur Village in Delhi for the purpose of deportation.

As many as 25-35 people are believed to be trapped inside the Tapovan tunnel.The State Emergency Operation Centre here said scientists of the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing during an aerial survey of Rishiganga found that the glacial lake formed due to the avalanche over it has begun to release water which reduces chances of its breaching or causing a flash flood.The lake, which has formed over Rishiganga after the flash flood, had increased the concern of experts on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/hole-drilled-in-tapovan-tunnel-for-possible-location-of-trapped-men-101613196629574.html
13-02-2021||Chandigarh||23 endangered gharials released in Punjab’s Beas river||Under the gharial reintroduction project in the Beas Conservation Reserve, 23 critically endangered long-snouted gharials were released in the Beas river near Salempur and Tahli forests in Hoshiarpur district on Friday. The gharials were transported in boxes from Chhatbir Zoo in Chandigarh, where they had been kept for a year after being brought from the natural hatchery at Morena in Madhya Pradesh.Project to establish breeding population of the species in state’s riversThe gharial reintroduction project of the Punjab forests and wildlife preservation department aims to establish a breeding population of the species in the state’s rivers. In phase-1 of this project, 47 juvenile gharials were released in the Beas Conservation Reserve in three batches — 10 on December 25, 2017, 15 on January 31, 2018, and 22 on March 15, 2018 — in Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts. The number of gharials released has now reached 70. “Punjab chief wildlife warden RK Sharma helped us in choosing a suitable undisturbed stretch of the Beas river near Salimpur and Tahli Forest in Hoshiarpur district for re-introduction of current batch of gharials,” said Gursharan Singh, district forest officer (wildlife) Hoshiarpur. Rajesh Mahajan, divisional forest officer, wildlife, Pathankot range, said, “This time they were released from Hoshiarpur side as there we found the conditions needed for release.” In the presence of Manish Kumar, conservator of forest, and Chhatbir Zoo field director M Sudhakar, a joint monitoring team of the Wildlife Division Hoshiarpur and World Wildlife Fund (WWF), India, has been formed for daily monitoring of gharials for the next one month, officials said. Reintroduction will complete area’s food chainGitanjali Kanwar, coordinator WWF India, who took part in the release event as an expert, informed that post release monitoring is one of the vital aspects of the gharial reintroduction. “The surveys will focus on understanding dispersal, habitat preference, population ecology and general well-being of the released gharials,” she said.“Field surveys conducted, so far, jointly with WWF-India indicate that gharials have dispersed both upstream and downstream of the release sites in the Beas Conservation Reserve. Between 40% and 50% of the reintroduced gharials can be spotted in the Beas Conservation Reserve depending on the water levels and season of survey,” Kanwar added. Mahajan said more gharials would be released next year this month. Before its reintroduction, the endangered animal was spotted the last time in 1974. It was important to reintroduce gharials in this area to complete the food chain. Its presence in the river will help increase the yield of fish for human consumption, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/23-endangered-gharials-released-in-punjab-s-beas-river-101613196030891.html

No more than five people will be allowed at one spot.” As per the Covid-19 protocols, it will be ensured that each visitor undergoes thermal scanning at the entry, and no one will be allowed inside without a mask. In fact, through out the say, there will be seven pre-booked hourly slots made available to visitors between 10am and 5pm, wherein the last entry will be allowed at 4pm. “It’s best to avoid bringing the elderly and young children,” adds Tiwari, considering the fact that they are more susceptible to coronavirus. For the plant lovers, there’s plenty in store to explore. PN Joshi, from Rashtrapati Bhavan’s horticulture department, says, “Over 130 varieties of roses are blooming in the garden this year. Besides these, there are more than 70 varieties of flowering plants across the gardens. Bahut mehnat kari hai humne... jab thand thi aur barish hui, toh flowers ko cover kar dete the plastic sheets se. At times we had to cover certain plants during the night and then uncovered them during day time to ensure that they get the right amount of sunlight as well as remain protected from the unpredictable winter.” Ask which is the flowering plant that is special this time around, and Joshi says, “Matthiola incana, which has quite a pleasant fragrance, has bloomed well this time. Isme special ye hai ki iski uniform flowering hui hai, and since it has single spikes, it stands out among the rest.” Must note: Do not carry any bags, eatables, water bottle, cameras.Drinking water and hand sanitiser will be made available inside.Wearing a mask is mandatory.

Jatinder, a native of Bhara village of Bhaderwah district in Jammu and Kashmir, had made calls to his wife and mother minutes before he went missing in the flood triggered by the glacier burst near Tapovan area of Uttarkhand on Sunday. "The only thing we now want from the administration that they should speed up the rescue operation to clear the debris so that at least I may get my younger brother’s body,” said Sunil Kumar, Jatiner’s elder brother. Jatinder worked as a labour supervisor for Hyderabad-based Rithwik Projects Private Ltd, executing the NTPC’s Tapovan hydel power project in Uttarakhand. His brother Surendra Kumar said Jatinder had left Reni village, where he lived, for the dam site along with 20 labourers and had called up both his wife and mother while on way and had promised to get back home soon. "My six brothers including cousins are at Tapovan dam site for the last five days, searching for Jatinder but they told us that there is tons of debris at the site of the incident where, according to eyewitnesses, he got drowned and buried along with 20 labourers,” said Kumar. “We will never be able to see him alive now” he added. Jatinder’s mother Bhagwana Devi (70) said he had made a video call to her and had told her that he was missing his three-year-old daughter a lot and would get back home soon. “That was the last when I saw her,” she said. Jatinder’s wife Meena (27) has been left lamenting that she failed to pick up her husband’s second call after speaking to him briefly during the first call. “My husband called me on Sunday at 10.32 am and talked for just two minutes, thereafter he again called me up at 10.35 am but I could not pick up the call as I had got busy in household chores," she said. "I will regret for the rest of my life that I didn't pick up that call and at 11.30 am, we came to know there was a disaster at the dam site in Tapovan,” said Meena. “Thereafter I made thousands of call but to no avail,” she rued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chamoli-glacier-burst-j-k-man-s-kin-urge-govt-to-speed-up-rescue-efforts-101613173975642.html
13-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s CSMVS to reopen on Tuesday with discounted museum tickets||One-way pedestrian routes and lowered ticket prices will mark the reopening of Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj museum (CSMVS) on Tuesday, February 16. After an 11-month closure necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be a phased reopening, starting with four of the institution’s 18 galleries. Natural history, Indian artefacts and the money and jewellery gallery, along with the Children’s Museum, will be open to visitors, for a price of ₹50 per adult and ₹20 per child, down from ₹100 and ₹30 respectively. The museum will be open all days of the week, but from 10 am to 3 pm at first, complementing the restricted local-train timings. “We have studied and learnt from the reopening process of the Nehru Science Centre and other museums, to better ensure the safety of our visitors and our staff members,” said Joyoti Roy, head of marketing and strategy at the museum. Trends in other Indian museums show that about 100 to 150 visitors can be expected daily, for institutes such as CSMVS, which received 5,000 to 8,000 visitors a day in normal times. “We will ensure that there is a limited number of people inside the building at any given time. Other visitors will wait for their turn on the lawns,” Roy said. The one-way pedestrian routes inside the building will ensure that visitors don’t come to face to face, and can more easily social-distance. Temperature checks and masks will be compulsory. Sanitisers are in place across the museum and toilets will be cleaned several times a day, Roy added. “CSMVS is a museum ‘by the people, for the people. We are following all standard norms laid down by the government and the ICOM [International Council of Museums]. Our staff have been sensitised towards this new normal too,” said Sabyasachi Mukherjee, director-general of the CSMVS. Meanwhile, this rare interlude is being used to restore parts of the iconic heritage building which, incidentally, first opened its doors 99 years ago, on January 10, 1922.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-csmvs-to-reopen-on-tuesday-with-discounted-museum-tickets-101613157990205.html
13-02-2021||Chandigarh||Fuel price hike makes vegetables dearer in Chandigarh||After apni mandis reopened in the city on February 1, the price of some vegetables has increased by ₹5 to ₹10, which the farmers attribute to the rising costs of fuel. The mandi, meanwhile, has started seeing a larger footfall as residents have started pouring in.Green chillies that used to cost ₹30 per kg now cost ₹40 per kg. The price of tomatoes has also increased by ₹5 per kg. Speaking about this, officials of the Punjab Mandi Board said, “While there is no shortage of supply, farmers are blaming the recent hike in petrol and diesel prices. The price of locally-grown vegetables is consistent.”Since January, the price of diesel in the city has gone up from ₹73.58 to ₹78.09 as of February 12. Secretary of the Chandigarh Transport Association BL Sharma said, “Even a small hike leads to an extra cost of thousands of rupees for transporters so vegetables brought to the city from other states will continue to see a hike in prices.”With the new season of crops likely to start soon, the price of some vegetables like cauliflower, which has remained unchanged, can also increase in the coming days.The price of onions has also gone up from ₹40 to ₹45 per kg. As per the vendors here, this was because of a shortage of supply coming in the city from Nashik. “Only a few wholesalers in Sector 26 get onions and we have to purchase it from them, which is why prices continue to stay high,” a vendor said, not wishing to be named.Meanwhile, the footfall at the mandis has also improved. Officials said that in the beginning they were only getting about 20% of the footfall they used to get earlier, but now the figure has gone up to 50%. All vendors didn’t show up which is why many stalls remained empty on the first day, but now about 80% of them were back, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fuel-price-hike-makes-vegetables-dearer-in-chandigarh-101613157809327.html
13-02-2021||Mumbai||With 1 positive case over 7 days, Bhiwandi still cautious||With only one Covid-19 positive case recorded over the last seven days in Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC), it is no less than a victory against the pandemic for the residents here.However, the civic body has claimed that the battle is still not over and appealed to the citizens to maintain social distancing and wear masks.From February 5 to 8, and again from Feb 10-12, no new cases were recorded in Bhiwandi while one case was reported on February 9. The city also has not recorded a single death since January this year. As per the state figures, the total number of deaths recorded in BNCMC till date is 341.In June, the BNCMC was the first civic body to impose strict lockdown for 15 days, as the number of daily Covid cases reached 170. The number of cases kept decreasing since after the BNCMC followed a four-step model of house-to-house surveys, contact tracing, containment and facility management under the guidance of civic commissioner Pankaj Ashiya since July.Ashiya said, “The four steps that we followed then are still followed rigorously without fail. This has helped in tracing maximum cases on time. Following the measures strictly is the only way to curb the cases.”In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Bhiwandi has the lowest total cases of Covid at 6,884 as per the state government records. As per the BNCMC records, the active cases in the city are 18. The civic body is now running only one Covid centre with a capacity of treating 50 patients as the number of positive cases is less.“Although, if the number of cases increases, the facilities that were developed earlier will be set up again. We have taken the doctors and staff into confidence that anytime they will have to provide the service if there is a surge in cases. The battle is still not over and we need to be extra careful and maintain it. Not a single death due to Covid has been reported since January and we are trying to maintain it by tracing all the high risk and low risk contact and strictly doing RT-PCR and not depending on antigen testing,” said Ashiya.Mohammad Abir Shaikh, 29, a resident of Kamatghar, Bhiwandi, said, “We keep checking the Covid records in the city on social media and websites and when we see zero cases in the city, it is a major sigh of relief. Bhiwandi was once having the highest number of cases at the beginning of the pandemic and now it has the lowest.”Manohar Konka, 35, a social activist from the city said, “The major reason for the reduction in Covid cases in the city is tracing by the civic body on time. The civic body has managed to reach each corner of the city. Despite people still not following social distancing at some places, the cases are low and this is commendable.”Dr. Satish Rudra, an anaesthetist from Bhiwandi, expressed that the civic body did the Covid testing on a wide scale and treated as many as patients on time, which is why it could curb the numbers.“In May, I was also infected and was initially home quarantined and later admitted to Indira Gandhi hospital for 10 days. The treatment there was also commendable.”Dr Sripal Jain, a MBBS physician, said, “During the initial days, I dealt with around 400 patients daily in which most had Covid symptoms. Now, there are no cases from Bhiwandi. The civic body played a very good role in making it mandatory for people with symptoms to do the Covid test on time. We also did CT scans for most patients at an early stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-1-positive-case-over-7-days-bhiwandi-still-cautious-101613157749064.html

13-02-2021||Mumbai||Special drive: Transgenders help cops handle traffic in Ulhasnagar||Motorists flouting traffic rules in Ulhasnagar were in for a surprise when they were stopped not by the regular traffic police but by transgenders.Transgenders assisted the police officers by manning the traffic this week. Those who are generally rude to the cops stopping them for not wearing helmets were scared to argue with the transgenders.Around 50 transgenders, along with the cops, manned the busy roads and gave lessons on road safety to motorists. The initiative was taken by the Ulhasnagar traffic unit and Vanya Foundation.Karishma Shah, (29), a transgender residing in Vithalwadi, said, “Many motorists were shocked to see us stopping them and demanding to see the licence and other documents. Some of them were shy while those who argued with traffic cops were scared to do the same with us. Most of them did not argue and accepted that they had flouted the norms, paid the fine and assured not to repeat the mistake.”Shah said that her community agreed to help the traffic police as responsible citizens. “There is a lot of congestion in Ulhasnagar mostly due to unruly motorists. We thought of addressing the issue as responsible citizens.”The transgenders were also supported by more than 100 special children in the initiative. In the weeklong initiative, they also gave white roses as a peace symbol to those who honked unnecessarily.Vanya Foundation head, Rekha Thakur, said, “This initiative aimed to create more interactions between people and these communities. We have created a traffic symbol song on which transgender performed on the street at three different signals in Ulhasnagar and Ambernath, educating people about traffic signals. We caught those flouting traffic norms, arranged bike rallies with the community and also a marathon, walkathon and cyclothon.”Traffic police inspector of Ulhasnagar, Shrikant Dharne, said, “Transgenders and our officers were on the streets to nab those flouting the rules and to create awareness among them. It was a really nice initiative by all the community members. They have learned a lot from us and vice-versa.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/special-drive-transgenders-help-cops-handle-traffic-in-ulhasnagar-101613157448557.html
13-02-2021||Other||Bombay HC to start physical hearing in TRP case from March 16||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday indicated that it was inclined to hear the cases filed by ARG Outlier Media – the group that runs Republic TV – and the channel’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in the television ratings point (TRP) manipulation probe through the physical hearing mode to expedite the proceedings. The court also said it wants to conduct a physical hearing for the abetment to suicide case of interior designer Anvay Naik, in which Goswami is an accused. The court held that as voluminous documents were being filed by both sides, it would not be possible to refer to them through virtual hearing and hence, preferred to have physical hearing from March 16. Meanwhile, the state assured the court that it would stand by its earlier statement on not taking any coercive action against ARG Outlier Media’s employees and Goswami till March 5, following which the court continued the earlier interim protection given to the editor-in-chief and the group’s staffers. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Mansih Pitale, while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by ARG Outlier and Goswami pertaining to the TRP manipulation case, sought to know if the state had been able to go through the voluminous responses filed by the petitioners. Kapil Sibal, counsel for Maharashtra, said it was not possible to go through the responses and hence, wanted some time. Sibal added that he was agreeable to the suggestion of the court to have a physical hearing on the matter and requested the bench to fix a closer date for it. However, ARG Outlier’s counsel Harish Salve sought to be excused from attending the physical hearing as he had received a Covid-19 vaccination shot and would have to get the second shot in six weeks and hence, could not be present. He, however, assured that another counsel would attend the hearing whenever the court fixed the date. The court then appreciated Salve for agreeing for physical hearing and said he was “fortunate” to get the vaccination shot. “Though we are not seeking any preference, we would also like to get the vaccination as we are attending court everyday,” said justice Shinde on a lighter note, and asked Sibal if he agreed to continue the statement of the state that no coercive action would be taken against ARG Outlier Media employees and its office-bearers till the next hearing. Sibal responded saying that though he was reluctant, the statement would continue till March 5, after which the court could extend the relief till March 16, when the physical hearing would be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-to-start-physical-hearing-in-trp-case-from-march-16-101613156968413.html

It had a strong smell and we were afraid it could be hazardous to the health of the residents around. The pond adjacent had turned completely black after the dumping of the sacks. I Tweeted about it with pictures and videos and also emailed to the board requesting the removal of the sacks dumped.”The residents of Vastu Vihar were subjected to foul stench for the entire day on February 9. Umesh Tank, 45, from the society, said, “The dumping was done at around 7.30pm and the next morning, the smell became stronger. We had seen a truck dumping those sacks but when we checked the CCTV footage, we realised that there were two trucks. We informed the police too and they are awaiting reports from MPCB.”Sachin Aadkar, sub-regional officer who had visited the spot and collected the sample of the powder, said, “Even as we are awaiting the lab results, prima facie it does not seem to be hazardous but looks like waste residue of cement from some factory or it could be ash. When we visited the spot, there was no smell, probably, the smell was only on the day after the dumping. We would be sending the report to the Panvel Municipal Corporation, police and also Cidco as the land belongs to them.”According to the residents, the land where the dumping was done falls under CRZ. “We visited the spot and found more than 100 sacks dumped there. Depending on the report from MPCB, we will see what can be done,” an officer from Panvel Municipal Corporation said. Meanwhile, senior police inspector Shatrughn Mali from Kharghar police station said, “We are awaiting the report from MPCB and the CCTV footage. If the report says it is hazardous material, an FIR would be lodged. If it is not hazardous, Cidco or the corporation would levy fine from the ones who dumped the sacks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-kharghar-residents-complain-of-foul-smell-from-waste-dumped-on-wetlands-101613156848583.html

Pedestrians will have to cover around 40 metres to cross the underpass, which will be 3-metre in height. On the surface, both sides around the underpass will have landscaping.The UT urban planning department has already given the go-ahead to the construction. The department recently approved the drawings of the project. The project was given in-principle approval by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in November last year.After putting it on the back-burner in the wake of the pandemic and budget cuts imposed by the Centre, the UT administration has now put the project on a fast track. With drawings and designs in place, the UT engineering department will now initiate the tendering process.The administration had come under severe criticism for first constructing a pedestrian underpass between Rose Garden and Sector 17, which has a very low footfall, rather than adhering to the long-standing demand for an underpass between PU and PGIMER.Before finalising the plans, this time around, the administration got a daily count of pedestrian and traffic conducted. “It concluded a substantial footfall necessitating an underpass as per the Indian Road Congress guidelines,” UT chief engineer CB Ojha said.Six months for constructionThe work on the ₹7.5-crore project is expected to start within this fiscal.Ojha said: “The project will start before March end, and is likely to be completed in six months.”During the construction of the underpass, for minimising inconvenience to patients coming to the PGIMER and maintaining a smooth flow of vehicles on the road, the engineering department is working on a traffic plan.“We are currently devising a traffic plan for the construction site. Once the project starts, traffic would have to be diverted. As the site witnesses heavy vehicular traffic and pedestrian footfall, our endeavour will be to limit the time needed to close the roads. Slip roads will be also used for vehicle movements,” said Ojha.Shops for generating revenueAs per the plans developed by the UT engineering department, the underpass will have 12 shops. Sized 80 square foot each, they will come up on one side of the underpass (left side when going from PGIMER to PU).“The utility shops are planned on the lines of the Delhi metro shopping arcades. When rented out, the shops are expected to generate a revenue of around ₹5 lakh per month for the administration. This will help recover a part of the construction costs of the underpass,” said Ojha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pupgi-underpass-to-come-up-for-7-5-crore-in-chandigarh-101613156669802.html
13-02-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai residents complain of bio-medical waste being dumped on highway||Panvel residents are upset at the bio-medical waste being dumped along the JNPT-Kalamboli Highway for the past several days with little official action.Morning walkers along the highway have been witnessing the rising debris of bio-medical waste in the area that is a risk to health. Hospitals and other medical institutions are expected to dispose of such waste as per specified government protocols.However, there have been several instances of bio-medical waste being dumped without any treatment in open spaces to save on cost.Atul Jaitpal, 40, a resident of Panvel, said, “A large number of local residents including children come here for walks and exercise every day. The waste is dumped in the open leading to pollution and health hazard. There are medicine bottles, syringes and all sorts of medical equipment. There are also expired medicines dumped here.” Pintu Pratap, 41, another local, lamented, “The dumping is going on for a long time. None of the authorities has bothered to take action. Those dumping seem to have found a safe haven here.” PCMC assistant municipal commissioner Dharyasheel Jadhav said that following complaints, a team of civic officials was sent to inspect and the team has started clearing the area of the waste.Jadhav said, “We have been taking action against such instances after ascertaining who is responsible for illegal dumping. In this case, too, we will try and find out who is responsible. We will confirm whose jurisdiction this area is under. However, we have taken immediate action in the interest of the residents. The waste is being cleared from the area. Steps will be taken to prevent such illegal dumping in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-residents-complain-of-bio-medical-waste-being-dumped-on-highway-101613156668596.html
13-02-2021||Mumbai||Residents demand cemetery to bury dead animals, birds in Kalyan-Dombivli||Animal lovers in the twin cities of Kalyan and Dombivli have demanded a cemetery for the burial of dead animals and birds in the city limits.Mahesh Bankar, animal activist, has written to the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) chief recently demanding a crematorium or a cemetery for animals and birds as usually they are dumped anywhere across the city.“People have no place to bury their pets. Even those animals found dead on the roads have no cemeteries. During the bird flu, there was no specific space for the birds to be buried,” said Bankar.President of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW), Pawan Sharma, said, “There has been demand to have a burial ground or cremation space for animals and birds. However, none of the civic bodies has taken initiative for this. There is no proper way for burying or cremating the animals and birds. There should also be a way to trace the owner of a pet or farm animal in case an animal is found dead. No such measures are taken, which is why the dead animals and birds land up in dumping grounds or are buried in any random place.”Suhar Pawar, secretary, Wild Animal and Reptile Rescue Found (WARR) Foundation, added, “The KDMC does not have any data on how many pet dogs or birds are there in its limits. This is the basic requirement when it comes to developing a cemetery or crematorium for pets. Again, the stray dogs are usually dumped in dust bins and then they land up in the dumping grounds. The rag pickers there set them ablaze, which is a wrong practice.”In 2019, several cows were found dead in a farm along the road parallel to Titwala-Ambivli railway track and they were left in the farm. This had led to foul smell in the area for more than a month and residents had even raised a complaint.Anagha Mohite, 39, a resident of Khadakpada, Kalyan (W) said, “There was no registration required with the civic body when we adopted a puppy five years back. One of my friends, who lost her pet, faced difficulty in finding a place to bury it. Also, she did not receive any guidance from the corporation.”Ramdas Kokare, deputy commissioner of KDMC, said, “Earlier, the dead animals were simply thrown into the dumping ground. However, now we have started burying the animals at the ground. Once the Adharwadi dump yard is cleared, we will have to find a designated place for the burial of animals and birds, which will be done simultaneously. The recent bird flu has raised the need to have a specific space for animals and birds and we are working on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/residents-demand-cemetery-to-bury-dead-animals-birds-in-kalyandombivli-101613156488314.html

The first part will include a three storied building for the office and a shade for accommodating six fire engines. The second part will be an eight-storied building that will have official quarters of the employees. The work is now under way and will be completed by early 2022.”Presently, the NMMC has five fire stations – in Vashi, Nerul, CBD Belapur, Airoli and Koparkhairane. In 2019, the fire department also hired more than 200 employees for filling up different vacant posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-fire-stations-in-navi-mumbai-to-be-redeveloped-101613155708316.html
13-02-2021||City||Tourist bus from Hyderabad falls into gorge in AP; 4 killed, 20 injured||At least four people were killed and 20 others injured, five of them severely wounded, when a tourist bus which they were travelling in fell off the ghat road and plunged into a 200-feet gorge near the picturesque tourist spot of Araku valley in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam district on Friday night, the police said.Visakhapatnam (rural) superintendent of police (SP) B Krishna Rao said the accident happened when the bus was negotiating a turn at the hair-pin bend near Dumuku village of Anantagiri block at around 7.30 pm.“The driver apparently lost the control over the steering while taking the turn as a result of which the bus slipped into the valley, overturned and fell into a gorge about 200 feet deep. The bus fell on a huge tree,” he said, adding that the police from Anantagiri and Araku rushed to the spot to take up rescue operations with the help of locals.While four passengers, including two women, a child and an old man, were killed on the spot, at least 10 others sustained injuries. “There were 24 people in the vehicle, including the driver. All 23 passengers included members of the same family and their relatives from Shaikpet area in Hyderabad,” Anantagiri sub-inspector of police K Sudhakar said.Also read: Tremors felt in Delhi-NCR, parts of north India; no damage reportedThe bus (registration number TS 09 UB 3729) belongs to Dinesh Travels from Hyderabad. The family members hired the bus and left Hyderabad for a picnic in Araku Valley on February 10 and were supposed to return by February 14. “The accident appears to have occurred due to brake failure,” Sudhakar said.The injured were moved to Sringavarapu Kota government hospital for treatment. “Five of them, whose condition is serious, were being shifted to Visakhapatnam government hospital,” the sub-inspector said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed shock over the ghastly accident in Araku valley. “Distressed to hear about the accident in Visakhapatnam, AP. Condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. Prayers with the injured. May they recover soon,” PM Modi tweeted.Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao expressed shock over the loss of four lives of Hyderabadis in the Araku Valley accident and expressed condolences to the bereaved families. He asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to coordinate with Andhra Pradesh DGP Goutham Sawang, DIG Kalidas and SP B Krishna Rao to supervise rescue operations.Andhra Pradesh Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy also expressed shock and grief over the mishap on the ghat road of Araku valley.

13-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Chinese varsity medical students await lifting of curbs||At a time when higher educational institutes are gearing up to restart and bring their students back on campus in a phased manner for physical classes, medical aspirants pursuing their degree from universities in China are still in the lurch. After spending months back home due to the Covid-19 lockdown around the world, the recent statement released by the Chinese government still gives no clear deadline on when the ban on international students ends. Earlier this week, Taiwan lifted its ban on international students but mainland China is yet to decide on the matter.“I had already started my medical internship in January 2020 at First Hospital of Jilin University when the Covid-19 situation in China started getting out of hand and everyone was asked to stay home. By February, our families back home started getting worried and most foreign students flew back home as the country was under severe lockdown restrictions,” said Rajesh P, a final-year student who has been at home in Santacruz since February 2020.According to the rules in China, MBBS students finish their final-year course and immediately have to complete a 52-week physical internship in assigned hospitals in order to be awarded MBBS degree. While the first, second and third-year MBBS students are currently attending lectures online, final-year students are at a loss as their internship can only be completed once the lockdown restrictions are lifted.According to data from UNESCO, in 2018 and 2019, China received around 500,000 international students annually — the third highest in the world after the United States and United Kingdom.Official data shows that in 2018, more than 23,000 Indian students were enrolled in various programmes in China. Indians represent the fourth largest group of international students in China, after South Korea, Thailand and Pakistan.“Even though we are attending regular lectures online, the fact that many Chinese mobile applications have been banned in India leaves us with very limited options to contact our institute officials and friends in China. Some of our batch mates have also complained about their attendance not being registered since several apps are not recognised in India,” said a third-year medical student on condition of anonymity.While students in India are in constant touch with Indian Embassy officials in Beijing, many have now started support groups on various social networking sites to reach out to other international students facing the same problem. “Out of desperation, many of us are sharing our story on Facebook and Instagram, hoping to attract the attention of Indian as well as Chinese government. With lockdown restrictions easing out slowly, even the universities in China can surely start bringing back students to campus in phases and insist on the 14-day quarantine period before starting physical classes,” said another student.Meanwhile, students in Jianghan University in Wuhan, China, said they had received communication from the university that their degrees will now say ‘MBBS in clinical medicine’. “My university sent us notice that they are changing our course to clinical medicine. We don’t know what is the meaning of MBBS in clinical medicine,” said Neha, a third-year MBBS student at the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-chinese-varsity-medical-students-await-lifting-of-curbs-101613155588129.html
13-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to let pvt hospitals vaccinate their in-house HCWs||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to allow a handful of the shortlisted major private hospitals to vaccinate their in-house healthcare workers (HCWs) in the hospital premises. The civic body has also conducted audits of 15 of 20 shortlisted private hospitals and a final report is yet to be tabled for approval before granting them permission to conduct the drive. As HT reported earlier, BMC in the last week of January had sent a Google Form —‘Private Hospital Covid-19 vaccination preparedness checklist’ — asking authorities to upload data of their infrastructure facilities. BMC’s move followed a proposal by the Association of Hospitals (AOH), a trust of private hospitals, to allow private hospitals to vaccinate their staffers inside their premises. Of the 100 private hospitals who submitted their details for approval, 20 have been shortlisted.“We have already conducted audits of 15 shortlisted hospitals for the vaccination programme. At first, we would allow them to vaccinate only their in-house HCWs,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. The BMC mulls also plans to include the selected private hospitals for the third phase of the mass immunisation programme, where citizens above the age of 50 and those with comorbidities will be inoculated. “This will be a stepping stone for the private hospitals. Once they successfully cover vaccinating their hospital staff, we can allow them to start immunising the public in the third phase,” said Kakani. Most major private hospitals such as Bombay Hospital, Hinduja, Hiranandani and Lilavati, among others, have shown interest in conducting the inoculation programme. However, the final list of hospitals is yet to be prepared. “I am yet to get the final audit report of the hospitals. Once I get it, I will be able to put a seal on the names,” he added.Most major private hospitals have over 2,000 HCWs, and claimed they have the adequate infrastructure to conduct mass immunisation within their premises. “On a daily basis, our nurses vaccinate people. We just have to inform and educate the nurses about the amount of doses to be given,” said Dr V Ravishankar, chief operating officer, Lilavati Hospital, Bandra.Doctors said their inclusion in the immunisation programme will help boost the overall turnout of the probable beneficiaries. “We can contribute in attaining almost 100% turnout in phase one,” added Dr Ravishankar.Dr Sujit Chatterjee, chief executive officer of LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, had earlier stated, “Only about 25% of HCWs go to the centre, but if vaccination is held within the premises of each major hospital then the turnout could be 75%-80%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-let-pvt-hospitals-vaccinate-their-in-house-hcws-101613155469481.html

13-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Woman booked for fraudulently obtaining husband’s bank statements||A Khar resident has been booked for allegedly conniving with a local police officer to illegally obtain bank statements of her husband, using a using forged notice. The woman allegedly took the step to use the statement in her claim of maintenance from the husband.Mumbai sessions court has, earlier this week, rejected her anticipatory bail application, observing that her custodial interrogation was required to investigate the forged documents.The accused has been fighting a matrimonial case against her husband since 2012. After the family court allowed maintenance for their children but rejected the plea for her, she approached the Bombay high court for maintenance. To substantiate her claim, the woman had attached bank account statements of her husband, his parents and their company, to show the husband’s income.The prosecution has alleged that when the complainant, the husband, inquired how she obtained the bank statements, he found that it was obtained by a local police officer by issuing a notice to the bank under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The section relates to issuance of summons to produce document or other thing for the purpose of police investigation.The complainant claimed that the police personnel had issued a notice citing a case against the husband over cheating ₹75 lakh, registered with Agripada police. The man then sought relevant documents from the police station under Right to Information Act, and came to know that the notice was forged and fabricated to obtain the bank statements. Following this, the man lodged a case of cheating and forgery against the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-woman-booked-for-fraudulently-obtaining-husband-s-bank-statements-101613155168215.html
13-02-2021||Mumbai||Give Class 10 students more time to submit papers for extra marks, say principals from Mumbai||Principals from schools in Mumbai requested the state board to give another extension to Class 10 students to submit their documents for bonus marks given for art, performing arts and sports. In a letter sent to the education department, the Mumbai Principals’ Association said that since a lot of exams and events did not take place in 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, the board should be more considerate and give an extension. “Drawing grade exams, for instance, did not take place in 2020. Similarly several other exams and events were delayed. We hope that the board takes note of this and grants an extension up to March 30, 2021,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the association.According to principals, nearly 15% students, who are awaiting their documents, might not get the benefit of the extra marks if the deadline is not extended. The board has allowed schools to send documents by March 15. An official from the education department said a decision with respect to deadline extension has not been taken yet. In 2017, the state education department had, for the first time, decided to grant additional marks (up to 25) to students for excelling in areas in addition to sports. It announced bonus marks for art and cultural activities. In 2018, after scores of students soared high with bonus marks, the department amended the rules and reduced the maximum bonus scores to up to 15 marks. For intermediate examinations, students now get three to seven bonus marks depending on the grade that the student gets in the exams. Last year (2020), more 188,000 students were awarded bonus marks in various categories like art, sports and dance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/give-class-10-students-more-time-to-submit-papers-for-extra-marks-say-principals-from-mumbai-101613154988088.html
13-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt to seek report from Governor secretariat over aircraft fiasco||The Maharashtra government will seek a report from Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s office over the incident on Thursday when the latter was denied state's aircraft to fly to Uttarakhand. The report will be sought from the secretary to the Governor Santosh Kumar by the state general administration department, chief secretary Sanjay Kumar told Hindustan Times on Friday.Koshyari had to face an embarrassment on Thursday as he went to Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSMIA) and boarded a state's aircraft for travelling to Dehradun but had to deplane and take a commercial flight since the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) had not approved the use of state's plane.After the incident, the CMO on Thursday blamed the Raj Bhavan secretariat saying that latter should have ensured that they had permission to use the aircraft before the governor departed from his official residence. Indicating action against the officials for not informing the Governor about permission updates, the CMO also said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had already directed the administration to fix the responsibility on the concerned officials for negligence.Sanjay Kumar said on Friday, “A report will be sought from the Governor's secretary (Santosh Kumar) over the incident. The state aviation department secretary will be directed to seek the report and the state government will take further decisions.”Also read: Tremors felt in Delhi-NCR, parts of north India; no damage reportedOn Friday, Thackeray avoided reacting to the controversy and remarked that the government will be developing an airstrip at Palghar so that everyone’s aircraft can land there. He was responding to a question about the incident. Thackeray also chose to use a helipad at Mahalaxmi racecourse instead of the one at Raj Bhavan (Governor house at Malabar Hill) following the aircraft controversy, the officials said.He was on a visit to Palghar district where he reviewed the development schemes and basic infrastructure. “I want to develop a small airstrip in Palghar so that everyone’s airplane can be landed here in the district,” Thackeray said when asked that the state government has denied the Governor to use its aircraft for flying to Dehradun in Uttarakhand.Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Thursday denied permission to Koshyari to use the state’s six-seater Cessna Citation XLS aeroplane to travel to Dehradun. This led to a controversy and blame game between the Raj Bhavan secretariat and the state.According to Raj Bhavan, Koshyari had reached the international airport and even boarded the state’s aircraft but he was told the plane would not take off as the CMO had not approved the travel, so consequently, permission for flying was not sought from the flying authority. The Governor then took a commercial flight to Dehradun.Ties likely to worsen?The incident, however, is likely to worsen the already strained relations between Thackeray government and Koshyari. According to senior government officials, Koshyari and Thackeray are not on talking terms beyond customary exchanges for the last many months. Recently, they met at the state’s Republic Day function at Shivaji Park, Dadar, but there was hardly any interaction between them, the officials said.“He (Uddhav Thackeray) should understand we also have some political compulsions. The Governor told this to Rashmi Thackeray, CM's wife during a brief interaction,” said a senior bureaucrat, requesting anonymity.Koshyari was referring to the appointment of 12 names as members of the state legislative council (MLC) under his (Governor’s) quota). The state cabinet had made the recommendation to Koshyari to nominate them to the Upper House as per the norms on November 6, last year. However, he is yet to take the decision, which has upset the chief minister and MVA leaders.The chief minister has not visited Raj Bhavan, official residence cum office of the Governor, for nearly nine months. Last time, he called on Koshyari after being elected as the member of the legislative council on May 18. His wife and son and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray were also present.Before that, Thackeray had called on the Governor at the Raj Bhavan on May 1. The meeting lasted for about 20 minutes. It was held a day after Koshyari wrote to the Election commission of India (ECI) requesting it to hold biennial elections to the nine vacant seats of the state legislative council at the earliest to facilitate Thackeray's election to the Upper House of the state legislature. The biennial elections for the nine vacant seats were postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Later, Thackeray also skipped a meeting called by the Governor to review the Covid-19 pandemic on May 21, the officials said.Meanwhile, Koshyari attended the 122th IAS induction program at the Lal Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie on Friday. He also met with Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and discussed the ongoing rescue operation following the glacier disaster in Chamoli. The Governor was expected to return in the state government’s aircraft but will be returning to Mumbai in a commercial flight on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-to-seek-report-from-governor-secretariat-over-aircraft-fiasco-101613154577190.html

The AAP has decided not to participate in any proceedings of the BJP-ruled North Delhi municipal corporation until he resigns. The BJP should also suspend him from the party for corruption,” said Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules all the three municipal corporations.Prakash dismissed that allegation as “baseless” and said that his son is the legal custodian of the concerned property in Sadar Bazar and has all necessary documents.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor too countered the AAP’s allegations by saying, “The AAP has failed in governance and so they are trying to malign image of BJP leaders ahead of municipal polls next year with such lies and baseless allegations. Never before in Delhi have political leaders of a party stooped down so low. They will have to face consequences in the 2022 municipal polls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-accuses-north-civic-body-mayor-of-forging-documents-to-occupy-land-bjp-hits-back-101613153009831.html
13-02-2021||Other||Doorstep delivery of rations: Govt offer people chance to opt out of scheme||The Delhi government’s scheme to ensure doorstep delivery of rations is designed to automatically include all 7.16 million beneficiaries of the public distribution system in the capital, unless they choose to opt out. To that end, the food department has started sending text messages to ration card holders alerting them about the scheme and offering them the choice to opt out, said a senior government official.Not responding to the message within 10 days of receipt means that the beneficiary is automatically included in the scheme. This, food rights activists say, will only confuse people. They argue that the government should have given people the choice to “opt in” rather than out.“The government has started sending text messages to ration card holders from January 2, asking if they want to opt out of the scheme. People who do not respond to the message within 10 days will automatically qualify for doorstep delivery of monthly rations. Those who want to opt out can also approach the district office concerned of the food and civil supplies department in later stages,” said a senior official of the food department who did not wish to be identified.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, on January 25, had said that the long-awaited scheme will be launched in March.Delhi has 1.75 million ration card holders – which translates to 7.16 million beneficiaries. Of the total ration card holders, 1.51 million are covered under priority household category of the National Food Security Act, 2013, while 0.17 million are covered under priority state household category, and the remaining 0.07 million come under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, show government records.While those under the first two categories are entitled to 5 kilos of food grains a month, those under the third category are entitled to 25kg wheat, 10kg rice and 1kg sugar every month. These items are distributed to them from 2,010 fair price shops that are currently functional across the city.The project was cleared by the Delhi cabinet in March 2018 but could not be rolled out because of several administrative issues, some of which even led to stand-offs between the elected government led by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and officials in charge of the department. Some of the administrative issues pertained to legal provisions under the food security law, which took more than one year to be resolved, said a senior government official.The project was given a fresh push ahead of the assembly polls in Delhi in February 2020 and a pilot run for three months was conducted in five municipal wards of north Delhi. In July 2020, the new cabinet gave fresh approval to the project.Shailendra Kumar, president of Delhi public distribution system welfare association, said: “People should have been given the choice of opting in rather than out. People need more time to understand the scheme. Many of them will choose not to respond to the text messages despite having apprehensions about inclusion.”Saurabh Garg, secretary of the Delhi-based sarkari ration dealer sangh, echoed similar concerns. He said, “Nearly 30% of the phone numbers registered for ration in the city are non-functional. The record updating process is yet not complete. Also, disclosure of mobile number for availing of rations is voluntary. It is uncertain what would happen to such beneficiaries.”The Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, a city-based collective led by activists such as Anjali Bhardwaj, Annie Raja and Sipa Sinha, that works on food rights, has raised concerns about the implementation of the scheme and flagged those concerns through a letter sent to Kejriwal last month.“The text messages sent to ration cardholders show that the government is making a presumption of consent for the home delivery of rations as it requires only those who do not want to avail of it to send a response message. As the proposed policy is going to significantly impact how people access their food grain entitlement under the National Food Security Act, it is important that people are given comprehensive information about the delivery mechanism and then be able to choose the preferred system,” said the letter, further highlighting concerns about “lack of transparency” in the process and more room for “corruption”.Delhi government spokespersons refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doorstep-delivery-of-rations-govt-smses-offer-people-a-chance-to-opt-out-of-scheme-101613153007948.html

Police had announced a reward on eight suspects, which does not include Sidhu. Police have not specified Sidhana’s alleged role, but had on January 27 said that Sidhana too was under probe.A total of 143 people, including actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, have been arrested in as many as 44 cases registered in connection with the Republic Day’s violence during a tractor rally by farmers, who have been camping against the three contentious farm laws at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders for the past 80 days. At least seven of the arrested persons have already been released on bail.Among the eight key suspects wanted in the Red Fort violence case, Sidhu was arrested on Monday night from Karnal Bypass in Haryana by Delhi Police’s special cell team while he was waiting for a car arranged by his friend to meet his wife in Bihar’s Purnea. He was evading arrest since a case was registered at the Kotwali police station on January 27. Two more suspects, Iqbal Singh and Sukhdev Singh (both among the eight suspects) have also been arrested.After Sidhu’s arrest, the Delhi Police had claimed that he had played a key role in instigating protesters and has even congratulated the man who hoisted flags at the Red Fort apart from doing a Facebook live from the iconic fort.A police officer, associated with the probe, said on the condition of anonymity that Sidhu was present at the Singhu border protest site on January 25 and had even delivered a “provocative speech”. “Technical investigation reveals that Sidhana’s location was also at the Singhu border at that time. Ascertaining the links between the duo is part of the ongoing probe,” the officer said.In his social media video, Sidhana has supported Sidhu and can also be heard asking people (farm leaders) to demand the release of Sidhu before resuming dialogues with the government over the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-probe-links-between-deep-sidhu-and-gangster-turned-activist-lakha-sidhana-101613153007380.html

On February 2, we received a mail informing us that 103 crew members had been sacked... Our demand is that the company reinstates all of us,” she said.She said they have also sought the Centre’s intervention.But in a detailed statement, a Lufthansa Airline spokesperson said the airline had signed an agreement with the airline union’s India wing, providing for two years of unpaid leave, with the airline continuing to pay for the local health insurance — even for enrolled family members.“Lufthansa was also willing to absorb all associated premiums during this period. Moreover, an offer for voluntary separation packages enabling eligible colleagues to leave the company on mutual terms was also part of the agreement. Unfortunately, consent to the agreement was revoked by the union on 31 December,” the airline said.It said, however, not being able to reach an agreement for cabin crew, the airline decided not extend these contracts as part of an inevitable restructuring“It should be noted that this restructuring (including personnel-related measures) is not limited to key international markets like India but affects all Lufthansa worldwide markets and to a great extent includes its home markets, especially Germany. However, there the Lufthansa was able to reach initial agreements with unions to help weather the crisis,” Lufthansa said.Deputy commissioner of police (IGIA) Rajeev Ranjan said some employees of the airline had gathered but the situation throughout remained peaceful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/100-ex-employees-of-lufthansa-stage-a-protest-want-to-be-reinstated-101613152769052.html

He had moved to the court challenging the order due to which the Delhi police had denied him permission to protest at Jantar Mantar.Advocate Narayan on Friday told the court that the earlier notifications issued by the Delhi government’s Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) brought to contain the spread of Covid-19 is no longer in force and new notifications have come in operation.Narayan, also said that other notifications under section144 of CrPC are in place for some areas.He said that the petitioner can file a fresh application to the city police to seek permission on the protest.Following the submission of the Delhi police, the court disposed of the plea and asked them to decide it in accordance with law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/order-banning-protest-has-been-withdrawn-cops-tell-hc-101613152768101.html
13-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC halts tendering process in maintaining parks by DDA||The Delhi high court on Friday stayed the awarding of tenders by the Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA’s) horticulture department in maintaining over 700 parks across the city, indicting the agency for alleged corruption and malpractices.A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli also called upon the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) to examine the matter and inform whether a full-fledged probe was required against the erring officials.The court also said that the actions could not have taken place without the blessings of local inspectors and other staff of the DDA, pointing to their connivance with contractors.The bench stayed the process of finalising all the tenders that have not been awarded yet. It also added that the ones which have been awarded after filing of the petition, would remain subject to further orders of the present matter.The court also issued notice to the Central Vigilance Commission to look into the matter while asking Kanwaljeet Arora, secretary, Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA), to give suggestions as to how the process could be improved.“The ways the tenders are structured and awarded, it is evident that there are serious malpractices and corruption,” the court said.The order comes while hearing a plea by a contractor Sanjay Sharma, who had sought to cancel or recall a tender issued by the horticulture department, Dwarka in October, 2020, for the maintenance of park area, lawns, tree plantations, sweeping of paths in the Sector 19 district park, Dwarka.The petition, filed through advocate Mohit Gupta, had said that due to the faulty clause of taking the minimum wages in structuring a tender for maintaining parks, the bidders had ended up quoting the same amounts. It had said that since the number of workers wanted are seven, the price is coming as same for all the contractors.It had said that the clauses were framed without factoring the service charges, labour cess, bonus component, wages payable to skilled supervisors and other expenses in terms of the tender.The plea had also sought that cost of logistics borne by a contractor is also taken in account while finalizing the successful bids. Earlier the DDA had submitted that bidders and contractors apply for small tenders incurring losses to gain experience.The counsel contended that corruption to the tune of crores is taking place due to the consideration of bids on the basis of minimum wages, as the final bidder is chosen on the basis of draw of lots, after the bids are common. It has said that since the clause for all the tenders is the same, this would have a bearing on several people.On November 27 last year, the court had stayed the land owning agency from issuing the Letter of Acceptance in the said tender.On Friday, senior advocate Sudhanshu Batra, appearing for the contractor, told the court that 300 tenders for maintaining the parks have been floated since April 2020 while quoting the minimum wages leading to the same bidding amount.He also said that 40 tenders alone were floated even after the November 27, 2020 order of staying the tender to maintain the park at Dwarka, Sector-19.Senior advocate Rajiv Bansal, appearing for the DDA, told the court that the agency is conscious of the malpractices ongoing in the tender process. He said that the vice chairman of DDA has taken note of the problem and every effort would be made to rectify this.However, the court said that the DDA should have been vigilant and pulled up the agency for not acting on the corrupt practices despite knowing.The DDA spokesperson refused to comment on the issue despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-halts-tendering-process-in-maintaining-parks-by-dda-suggests-cvc-enquiry-101613152767325.html
13-02-2021||Delhi||4k health workers in line to get second Covid-19 vaccine shot today||As part of the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive, officials on Friday reached out to 4,319 people scheduled to get their second vaccine dose on Saturday in Delhi.The beneficiaries include healthcare workers who received their first dose on January 16, when the vaccination drive began across the country. Delhi deployed Serum Institute of India’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccines.“After the first shot, the beneficiaries were given a card with details of their next dose. The Co-WIN portal also sends out an automatic message on their phones. However, we are not taking any chances. We asked all 81 vaccination centres (involved on the first vaccination day) to call the beneficiaries and inform them that they are due for the next dose,” said a senior official from Northeast Delhi district. The district consistently reported 100% coverage and its officials attributed it to this rigorous mechanism they followed.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageHT found a similar mechanism in place at other districts too. Co-WIN is a central government portal developed to track vaccination drive and their beneficiaries.Beneficiaries are slated to receive the second dose at the same centres where they received the first.“For now, there is no option for people to change their centre or the date. However, if people do miss their vaccination, they may be given another chance in another four to six weeks,” said the above-mentioned district official.But the protocol for the second attempt at a shot is yet to be finalised.“So far, we have not received any protocol for what to do if people miss their second vaccine dose. This will be decided after tomorrow (Saturday), but these beneficiaries need to get the vaccine within a certain period, as per the vaccination protocol,” said another official.The government plans to increase the number of vaccination centres. According to government data, the city has been vaccinating over 12,000 people each day for the last four days, up from the 4,000 on the first day. On Thursday, the government had increased centres from 183 to 265.Currently, all the vaccination sites are at hospitals – both government and private – where any adverse reactions can be handled. The new centres are expected to be at government dispensaries.Experts call for uniform messagingBoth vaccines deployed in India are two-dose vaccine with each dose spaced 28 days apart. But some data suggest that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine AZD1222 (the Indian variant is Covishield) gave better protection at 12 weeks apart. This, experts said, could lead to people giving the second dose a miss.“There is a lot of confusion among doctors and other healthcare workers on this. Some may miss their second dose and trying to delay it for as long as possible (believing it would be better to get it at 12 weeks). However, with just one dose, the seroconversion (production of antibodies) will not be proper and they will not be protected against the disease,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College.Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said, “There is a lot of confusion with the data currently available. However, what we know for sure is that one dose will not protect you against the disease. But whether the second dose should be given 28 days apart or 12 weeks is not clear. In general, for other vaccines, once the T cell (part of the immune system) response is primed they need to be boosted quickly for better response.”Both experts encouraged people not to miss the second dose even for minor adverse reactions. “Except those who suffered anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), the others should get the vaccine and be prepared for minor side effects like fever, giddiness etc,” said Dr Broor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/districts-call-up-beneficiaries-for-second-vaccine-dose-101613152707961.html
13-02-2021||Delhi||SC dismisses review petition terming Shaheen Bagh protests illegal||The right to protest cannot be anytime and everywhere, the Supreme Court said in an order, dismissing a review petition filed by 12 activists challenging an October 2020 ruling of the top court terming the anti-citizenship law protests held at Shaheen Bagh to be illegal.A three-judge bench of Justices SK Kaul, Aniruddha Bose and Krishna Murari stuck by its previous ruling that protests were meant to be held in designated places and the police will be within its rights to remove persons holding protest outside designated places.Dismissing the review petitions in chambers on February 9, the three judges held, “The right to protest cannot be anytime and everywhere. There may be some spontaneous protests, but in case of prolonged dissent or protest, there cannot be continued occupation of public place affecting rights of others.” The order was put out in public domain on Friday.The court dismissed the petition filed by Kaniz Fatima and 11 others and declined the request made in the review petition to list the matter in open court.The October ruling came in the context of the protests held against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA conducted at south Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh area. The protests started on December 15, 2019 and ended only after a lockdown imposed by the Central government on March 24 last year in order to curb the spread of Covid-19 came into force. The protests threw traffic out of gear in Shaheen Bagh, prompting one Amit Sahni, a resident of Delhi, to file a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Apex court, resulting in the October 7 decision.The top court had ruled, “We have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely. Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.”Since the protest at Shaheen Bagh blocked one of the key thoroughfares to Noida, the protest was held to be illegal.The review petition under Article 137 of the Constitution had raised five grounds to challenge the October order. The main ground for review was the vast powers the judgment conferred on police, leaving scope for its abuse.The petitioners stated, “Prima facie the order under review appears to be giving way to an unrestricted sanction to the police to take action by misusing these observations…. Such observations may prove to be a license in the hands of the police to commit atrocities on legitimate voice of protest, especially protesters coming from vulnerable sections of the social strata.”Further, it argued that the observation of the court that protests could be held at ‘designated places alone’ went against the five-judge bench decision of the Supreme Court in Himat Lal Shah case decided in September 1972. This decision upheld the right of a citizen to hold public meetings on public streets. The petitioners complained that before altering this principle, the apex bench did not hear the protestors.Considering all questions raised in the review petition, the review order said, “We have considered the earlier judicial pronouncements and recorded our opinion that the Constitutional scheme comes with a right to protest and express dissent but with an obligation to have certain duties.”The review petitioners had submitted that the judgment of the top court would lead to a situation where the administration would never engage in dialogue with protestors but would instead take action against them including their prosecution. “The order takes away the constitutional protection guaranteed to peaceful protestors….to put any curbs on this freedom to show dissent (towards government policies, legislations and other acts and omissions) leaves the citizens with no resort whatsoever to voice their concerns,” Fatima and others stated in their petition filed by advocate Kabir Dixit.The bench having gone through the review petition and record of its earlier order said, “We are convinced that the order of which review has been sought, does not suffer from any error apparent warranting its reconsideration.” The review petitions were dismissed on this count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-dismisses-review-petition-terming-shaheen-bagh-protests-illegal-says-protests-cannot-be-anytime-and-everywhere-101613152707261.html
13-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi education department to enhance its social media presence||As schools in the city open up after being shut for more than a year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi government has decided to engage an agency to ensure increased social media presence of the education department and enhance community outreach for policies that concern schools and education, said a senior government official on Friday.The initiative, said the official, will help the government improve communication and outreach on social media where several students and their parents have active presence.Schools in Delhi were closed for 10 months in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, with in-person classes for Class 10 and 12 students starting on January 18. The schools have been asked only to call students with the consent of the parents and follow all the Covid-19 precautions. On February 5, schools were opened for classes 9 and 11.“The agency will be entrusted with spreading information through social media platforms, manage the social media handles, profiles and pages for the education department, digital media management, writing and posting blogs about schools, colleges and education policies, do info-graphics, generate videos, design social media campaigns, and engage in fact-checks and generate content against any kind of misinformation,” said the senior official, who did not wish to be identified.The official further said, “The agency will also be entrusted with using social and digital media to engage with stakeholders on policies apart from aiming to enhance community outreach. The agency should have a good understanding and experience of engaging with citizens groups, civil social groups and the youth. Schools are reopening after the Covid-19 pandemic and the government needs impactful strategies on the front of communication.”The Delhi government had floated a tender in this regard on February 5 and the bidding process for the same will close on February 26, read the tender document, which HT has seen.“The team should have familiarity with keyword placement and other social media best practices, including Twitter trends, hashtags, Lives on Facebook and Twitter and other evolving trends,” the tender document read.The document further said that the objectives of the project would include ensuring awareness about education policies, real-time response on queries flagged on social media accounts after due consultation with the department, publishing “success stories” concerning the department and government schools, and increasing transparency.Delhi’s education minister Manish Sisodia said, “We have to equip our students with 21st century skills. These days even teachers use social media in many ways to learn things from across the globe and implement that in the classroom. Using social media for better communication and outreach is essential at this stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-education-department-to-enhance-its-social-media-presence-101613152648002.html
13-02-2021||Pune||Student turnout on the rise as safety measures win confidence of parents||On Friday, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) recorded 29.31 per cent student turnout in class 5 to 8 across the city. As schools reopened on February 1, the student turnout has been on a steady rise. Parents and school management noted that all safety measures are being taken against Covid-19 to ensure safety of students. Parents also shared that students are happy as schools are now offline. Suresh Jagtap, additional commissioner, PMC said that initially the turnout of students was less and gradually it is increasing. “We have seen this rise for class nine to 12 as well. Parents are hesitant initially but gradually give permission to students to attend school. The turnout of the students is slowly increasing,” said Jagtap. Speaking about the reopening, Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Apte Prashala said that the turnout is increasing. “The student turnout has improved since day one. We have alternate classes in our school, for example, if class 5 is coming to school today, class 6 will be attending school tomorrow. We sanitize the whole premise for the safety of our children. Also, children on the premises and under the supervision of our teachers adhere to social distancing and wear masks compulsorily,” said Sinnarkar. She further added that students now understand the importance of hand hygiene and social distancing. “They are very cautious about not forming a big group, maintaining proper distance and wearing masks at all times. Students also frequently use sanitizers,” said Sinnarkar. A city-based parent Asmita Patil noted that her daughter is very happy to be back in offline school. “The school is her happy place. She is in class 6th and is happy to go back to school. Online school was a little monotonous for her. She likes to step outside and now she even gets to meet her friends but in the past few months, she has understood the importance of wearing masks and hand hygiene. She follows it ardently in school as well,” said Patil.

13-02-2021||Pune||Pune colleges set to begin offline lectures from Feb 15||Colleges and universities in the state are reopening from February 15, and a circular on the lines has also been issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday. The higher educational institutes in the city have begun preparations as per the Covid protocol and are eagerly awaiting the return of students to campus after a hiatus of over 10 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Vidya Yeravdekar, pro-chancellor of Symbiosis International (deemed university) and principal director, Symbiosis said, “We are eagerly waiting for the students to come back. We have set up a committee to look into the details of health and safety of our students. Social distancing will be maintained. Students are requested to get RT-PCR test done before they come to the campus. We are opening from February 15 but have given a window until February 28 as many of our students come from faraway places. We will be calling them in batches and only 50 per cent can attend in class. We will have 50 per cent students in labs so we will have to juggle with the timetable. The placement teams are already here and coordinating with the industries for placements and internships.” NT Rao, vice chancellor of MIT World Peace University said, “With the recent government announcement of colleges and universities being allowed to re-open in Maharashtra, we, at MIT World Peace University (MIT-WPU) are equally enthusiastic like our students and look forward to welcoming them back on campus. At the same time, we as a responsible institution, are adequately sensitive to the concern of parents towards their wards and have made conscious efforts to create a safe and conducive space for our students to pursue their academic goals in this new normal.” According to Rao, cleaning and regular disinfection of frequently touched surfaces such as, doorknobs, elevator buttons, handrails, chairs, benches, washroom fixtures has been made mandatory in all classrooms, laboratories, parking areas and other common areas before the beginning of classes and at the end of the day. “Teaching materials, computers, laptops and printers shall also be regularly disinfected. Sitting places in classes, laboratories, computer labs, libraries will be clearly marked, keeping in view the norms of physical distancing,” he said. Aftab Anwar Shaikh, principal of Poona College of Arts, Commerce and Science said, “We are following the Covid guidelines for starting up of the colleges, but 90 per cent of our students come from public transport buses and some of them from slum areas. Along with safety precautions inside the colleges, it is also necessary to provide students a safe travelling mode. As schools and colleges resume, thousands of students will travel across the city. We will be checking and doing thermal scanning inside the college but at the same time it is necessary to have their travelling exposure to infection secure.” Ravindra Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College said, “We are taking extra precaution about arrangements to start the college, social distancing to be maintained properly. Also the consent from parents to send their children to college is also important, as without consent students won’t be allowed to attend the classroom lectures. Once we complete the Covid testing of all our faculties and get permission from PMC, the college will start.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-universities-and-colleges-set-to-begin-offline-lectures-from-feb-15-101613144786826.html
13-02-2021||World||WHO experts want 'more data' from China on possible early Covid cases||WHO experts told AFP in an interview Saturday they had not received access to enough raw data while in China probing the pandemic's origins, saying more was needed to detect possible early Covid cases."We want more data. We have asked for more data," Peter Ben Embarek, who headed WHO's expert mission to Wuhan, told AFP,"There is a mix of frustration but also a mix of realistic expectations in terms of what is feasible under which time frame," he said, adding he hoped the requested data would be made available going forward.The four-week WHO mission to China to uncover the origins of the coronavirus wrapped up earlier this week with no conclusive findings.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage Experts believe the disease -- which has killed nearly 2.4 million people worldwide -- originated in bats and could have been transmitted to humans via another mammal.But while the virus was first discovered in Wuhan in December 2019, it remains unclear if that is when and where the outbreak actually began.The expert team determined that there were no signs of large clusters of Covid-19 in Wuhan or elsewhere prior to December that year, but did not rule out sporadic cases spreading before that.'Trying to understand'Ben Embarek said the team would have been keen to have access to raw data about earlier cases of illnesses, including pneumonia, flu and fever, that could conceivably have been Covid.Prior to the mission, Chinese scientists had scanned their systems and identified 72,000 such cases between October and December.They had applied sets of criteria to determine if the cases could possibly be Covid, whittling down the list to just 92 cases worth examining.Sixty-seven of those were submitted to serological tests. They all came back negative for Covid.Also Read | WHO official leading Wuhan Covid-19 probe says cold-chain transmission possibleBen Embarek said the team had asked in vain for the specific criteria used."We are trying to understand that process of getting from 72,000 down to 92", he said, saying access to the raw data requested would make it possible to apply "less stringent criteria so we have a larger number to work with.""That will be a proposal for studies in the next phase," he said.John Watson, a British epidemiologist and a member of the team, acknowledged that there was a "full and frank discussion" about access to the data, but said focusing too much on that aspect would be unfair.While the team's Chinese counterparts did not share all the raw data requested, he said, they had shared "enormous detail" about their work, methods and results.Another team member, Peter Daszak, meanwhile rejected on Saturday a report that there had been shouting matches between the international team and their Chinese counterparts over data access."This was NOT my experience on @WHO mission," he said in a tweet, adding: "We DID get access to critical new data throughout."No 'smoking gun'The team members have had to walk a diplomatic tightrope, with the US urging a "robust" probe and China warning against politicising the issue.On Saturday, US national security advisor Jake Sullivan voiced "deep concerns" over China's Covid-19 investigation, and urged it to "make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak".The US and others have been fiercely critical of delays in sending the WHO team to Wuhan, with the mission taking place more than a year after the first cases surfaced.Ben Embarek acknowledged it would "have been fantastic" to go sooner, but pointed out that when disease outbreaks occur, the first reaction is to treat patients, not to try to figure out how it happened.He also stressed it would have been impossible to conduct investigations during the early months, when Wuhan under strict lockdown.Going forward, he said, the world should consider trying to run source investigations "in parallel".But, he stressed, "it is not too late.""There is still a lot to be learned, a lot to be discovered."Watson agreed that it was still possible to learn much more about the early stages of the pandemic.But he ruled out that investigators would "come up with a smoking gun" and determine exactly where and when the virus jumped from animals to humans.That is "really very unrealistic", he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-experts-want-more-data-from-china-on-possible-early-covid-cases-101613239953935.html
13-02-2021||World||Trump trial twist: Senate votes to call witnesses||In a surprise development, the US Senate on Saturday voted to call witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial of former president Donald Trump, a move that could prolong the process.The chamber voted 55-45 — with five Republicans joining the 50 Democrats — to allow for witnesses to be called to testify. The five Republicans who voted with Democrats in the evenly divided Senate were Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Graham had said that if Democrats call witnesses, so would Trump’s lawyers, and a lot of them — it would “open up Pandora’s Box if you call one witness”.The Senate was expected to end the trial with the final vote scheduled for Saturday afternoon after an hour of closing arguments from both the Democratic impeachment managers prosecuting the case and Trump’s defence lawyers.Representative Jamie Raskin, the lead House manager, opened the day’s proceedings saying the prosecutors wanted to call a fellow member of the House of Representatives, Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, to testify in view of new revelations from her the night before.Confirming earlier reports, Herrera Beutler had said in a tweet on Friday that Trump had told Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, in a phone call on January 6, “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”McCarthy, who had responded with an expletive-ridden remark, had called the former president to urge him to call off his supporters who were swarming all over the US Capitol at the time.Michael van der Veen, the former president’s lawyer, reacted angrily, threatening to call witnesses for the defence.Trump’s lawyers had wrapped up their opening arguments on Friday in under three of 16 hours allotted to them. They argued that Trump’s January 6 speech, which the House managers had said incited the mob, was constitutionally protected by his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech. They argued further that Trump did not incite the rioting because it was pre-planned and was underway even as he was making the speech. They said words used by him such as “fight”, which House managers had contended amounted to incitement to violence, were a part of political rhetoric.Earlier, the Associated Press reported that Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell will vote to acquit Trump, citing a source familiar with McConnell’s thinking.Word of McConnell’s decision came before what was expected to be the final day in the historic trial on the charge that Trump incited the deadly January 6 riot at the Capitol.The Republican leader’s views are closely watched and carry sway among GOP senators, and his decision on Trump is likely to influence others weighing their votes. While most Democrats are expected to convict Trump, the two-thirds vote needed for it appears unlikely in the Senate split 50-50 between the parties.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-trial-twist-senate-votes-to-call-witnesses-101613236353756.html
13-02-2021||World||US Senate votes to call witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial||US senators voted on Saturday in favor of allowing witnesses in the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, extending the proceedings as lawmakers weigh whether to convict Trump of inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.The development came after news that Trump told a top congressional Republican during the deadly assault by his supporters last month that the mob was "more upset" about his election defeat than lawmakers.The 55-45 vote in favor of allowing witnesses means a decision in the trial is unlikely to come on Saturday. Prior to the vote, closing arguments from the House lawmakers serving as prosecutors and Trump's defense attorneys had been expected on Saturday after a week-long trial.A lengthier trial could stymie efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden to move past the controversies surrounding his predecessor and push forward his own legislative agenda on Covid-19 relief and economic revival.Much of the trial focused on how much Trump knew about the rioters' actions as they rampaged through Congress on Jan. 6 seeking to prevent lawmakers from certifying Biden's victory in the November presidential election.Read | Which Republican senators are seen as possible votes against Trump?Herrera Beutler, one of 10 in her party who voted last month in the House of Representatives to impeach Trump, recounted in a statement late Friday the details of a call between Trump and the top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy."'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,'" Beutler quoted Trump as saying. She said Trump initially denied his supporters were involved in the attack, claiming the mob were members of the loosely organized left-wing Antifa movement, a false claim that McCarthy rejected.Trump, who left office on Jan. 20, is the first U.S. president to be impeached twice and the first to face trial after leaving office. If convicted, the Senate could then vote to bar him from running for office again.Conviction is seen as unlikely, however, as at least 17 Republicans in the 100-seat chamber would have to join all 50 Democrats to find the former president guilty. Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell will vote to acquit Trump, a source familiar with the situation said on Saturday.The trial has highlighted the extraordinary danger lawmakers faced on Jan. 6, when Trump urged his followers to march on the Capitol and "get wild" in an effort to overturn his election loss. Then-Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers had to be rushed into hiding for safety. Five people died in the chaos.Trump's words that day followed months in which he repeated false claims that Biden's victory was the result of widespread fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-votes-to-call-witnesses-in-trump-s-impeachment-trial-101613231038629.html
13-02-2021||World||'Deep concerns' about WHO Covid-19 report from China: White House||The White House on Saturday called on China to make available data from the earliest days of the Covid-19 outbreak, saying it has "deep concerns" about the way the findings of the World Health Organization's Covid-19 report were communicated.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement that it is imperative that the report be independent and free from "alteration by the Chinese government", echoing concerns raised by the administration of former President Donald Trump, who also moved to quit the WHO over the issue.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday said all hypotheses are still open about the origins of Covid-19, after Washington said it wanted to review data from a WHO-led mission to China, where the virus first emerged.A WHO-led mission, which spent four weeks in China looking into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak, said this week that it was not looking further into the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab, which it considered highly unlikely.The Trump administration said it suspected the virus may have escaped from a Chinese lab, which Beijing strongly denies.Read | China refused to provide raw data on early Covid-19 cases, says WHO team memberSullivan noted that US President Joe Biden had quickly reversed the decision to disengage from the WHO, but said it was imperative to protect the organization's credibility."Re-engaging the WHO also means holding it to the highest standards," Sullivan said. "We have deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the Covid-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them."The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed WHO investigators, reported Friday that China had refused to give the World Health Organization raw, personalized data on its early Covid-19 cases that could help determine how and when the virus first spread in China."It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government," Sullivan said."To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak."Going forward, all countries, including China, should participate in a transparent and robust process for preventing and responding to health emergencies, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deep-concerns-about-who-covid-19-report-from-china-white-house-101613229491913.html

Russia's emergency service advised people to stay away from trees, warning of winds gusts of 18 metres per second (40 mph).  "It's a real snowstorm, a snow Armageddon, a snow apocalypse. This is not a practice alert, but a combat alert," Evgeny Tishkovets from the weather service Fobos was quoted by RIA news agency as saying before the snowfall began.By early Saturday, snow depth in the city reached 56 centimetres (22 inches), Fobos said. This was close to exceeding a record high of 60 cm for accumulated snow on a Feb. 13, it said.On Friday Moscow saw record snowfall for a Feb. 12, breaking the previous record set for the date in 1973, Russian news agencies reported citing the national meteorological service.There have been multiple flight delays at the airports in Moscow, a city of more than 12 million people.

13-02-2021||World||Which Republican senators are seen as possible votes against Trump?||Most every senator has pledged to listen to the evidence in Donald Trump’s historic second impeachment trial, but most minds were likely made up before the trial began. Democrats would need a minimum of 17 Republicans to vote with them to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection, and that appears unlikely.Still, Democrats say they are holding out hope they will win over enough Republicans to convict the former president for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, in which five people died. If Trump were convicted, the Senate could take a second vote to ban him from running for office again. A final vote is likely on Saturday.A look at the Republicans whom Democrats are eyeing as they make final arguments in the case:The frequent Trump criticsRepublican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine have been clear that they believe Trump incited the riot. While none of them is a lock to vote for conviction, they have joined with Democrats twice to vote against GOP efforts to dismiss the trial.Collins said after the siege that Trump does “bear responsibility for working up the crowd and inciting this mob.” Murkowski called on Trump to resign after the attack on the Capitol, telling a local paper three days later that “I want him out. He has caused enough damage.”Romney tweeted on Jan. 6: “What happened at the U.S. Capitol today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States.” During the trial, the Democrats showed video of Romney narrowly escaping the mob, redirected by a Capitol Police officer as he unknowingly ran toward the violent crowd.Sasse said that Trump had “lied to” Americans and the “consequences are now found in five dead Americans and a Capitol building that’s in shambles.” In a recent video, he said Republican politics shouldn’t be about the “weird worship of one dude.”Murkowski, Collins and Sasse voted to acquit Trump during his first impeachment trial, in which Democrats charged that he had abused his power by urging the president of Ukraine to investigate then-White House candidate Joe Biden. Romney was the sole GOP guilty vote, leaving the Democrats far short of conviction.Headed outPennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who is retiring in 2022, has also voted twice with Democrats to move forward with the trial. Like Murkowski, he called for Trump’s resignation after the riots, saying that would be the best way to “get this person in the rearview mirror for us.” Toomey had also aggressively pushed back on Trump’s false assertions that he had won Pennsylvania and other states in the election.Three other GOP senators have said they will not run again in two years, potentially freeing them up to vote against Trump and anger base voters in the party. They are Rob Portman of Ohio, Richard Burr of North Carolina and Richard Shelby of Alabama. All three voted to dismiss the trial, but Portman says he still has an open mind about conviction.Burr said Thursday that he would not comment on the trial at all. Shelby said this past week that the impeachment managers had a “strong point” that Trump could have acted sooner to stop the violence, but maintained that the trial is unconstitutional because Trump is now out of office.Cassidy as wild cardLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who won reelection by a large margin in 2020, voted two weeks ago for a GOP effort to dismiss the trial. But he switched his vote this past week, saying Trump’s lawyers had done a “terrible” job making the case that the trial was unconstitutional.Cassidy, who has been taking extensive notes throughout the trial, said Friday that the managers had raised some “intriguing questions” during their two days of arguments. He said that he hoped Trump’s lawyers would answer them thoroughly and that he is “trying to approach it objectively.”During the trial's question and answer session on Friday afternoon, Cassidy asked Trump's lawyers about a conversation the then-president had with Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville on Jan. 6 just after Vice President Mike Pence had been evacuated from the Senate. Tuberville says he told Trump that Pence had been whisked away, making clear that Trump likely knew of the danger at that point, even though he tweeted criticism of Pence after that for not trying to overturn the election. Cassidy asked the lawyers if that showed Trump "was tolerant of the intimidation of Vice President Pence?”Lawyer Michael van der Veen dismissed Tuberville's account as “hearsay," an answer that Cassidy later said was not sufficient.Thune takes heat from TrumpSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican leader, dismissed Trump’s attempts to challenge the certification of Biden's presidential election victory. Thune predicted the effort would “go down like a shot dog″ in the Senate.That comment drew a furious response from Trump, who urged South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to run against Thune in a GOP primary, an idea she immediately rejected.Still, Thune has voted twice to dismiss the case. He said Friday that he was keeping an open mind and indicated he could be open to a censure resolution if Trump is acquitted.“I know a couple of my colleagues who’ve seen a couple of resolutions, at least, that I think could attract some support,” Thune said.Eyes on McConnellSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has twice voted to dismiss the trial, indicating he will ultimately vote to acquit. But he has also said that Trump “provoked” the mob, which was “fed lies.”Soon after the attack, McConnell privately told associates he was done with Trump and said publicly he was undecided on impeachment. He has told Republicans the decision on Trump's guilt is a vote of conscience.His neutral stand is in sharp contrast to his management of the first trial, when he largely protected Trump and pushed back against Democrats’ pleas to call witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-republican-senators-are-seen-as-possible-votes-against-trump-101613223073042.html

13-02-2021||World||Don’t call it a coup, Myanmar military leaders warn media||Myanmar’s military leaders aren’t happy with the choice of words used to describe this month’s coup.After the state of emergency that was “in accordance” with the constitution, some media are using “incorrect words” such as coup and referring to the military as junta or regime, the Ministry of Information said in a statement to the Myanmar Press Council on Friday.Inaccurate usage could be “acts of instigation that may arouse civil unrest,” it said. It’s also against publishing laws, the ministry said.On Feb. 1, the military -- known as the Tatmadaw -- detained Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders, declared a state of emergency for a year and voided her party’s landslide November election victory. Suu Kyi urged the country’s 55 million people to oppose the army’s move, calling it “an attempt to bring the nation back under the military dictatorship.”The Biden administration was quick to denounce the coup and implement sanctions against its leaders. Thousands of protesters have been in the streets in defiance of a military order, demanding the release of political leaders including Suu Kyi. The army has responded by detaining more of her aides.Earlier this week, the junta proposed a cyber security law that could see social media users fined or jailed for posts containing what it construes as “misinformation or disinformation that causes public panic.”Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party said the cyber security law is another attempt by the junta to limit freedom of speech and access to the internet. The Myanmar Computer Federation, the largest private sector technology organization, and affiliated groups said they strongly disagree to the enactment of the law, citing a lack of public consultations and insufficient time to give expert input to the ministry.At least 120 technology companies in Myanmar issued a statement on Saturday to denounce the cyber security bill, which they said “violates the basic principles of digital rights, privacy and other human rights.”“Given the current complex political situation, a regime fast-tracking bill is in violation with the fundamentals of the Constitution and will not create any positive values for the society,” the companies said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-call-it-a-coup-myanmar-military-leaders-warn-media-101613220327293.html

It is also a rare occasion in which Russia joins an exercise together with NATO countries, analysts said.“The exercise this time is unique in a sense that it provides an opportunity to navies from China, Russia and the US and other Western navies to come under one platform,” an officer from the Pakistan Navy told Chinese state media.The Chinese navy dispatched a Type 052D destroyer given the importance of the naval drill.The US Navy says this particular type of Chinese destroyer depicts China’s new naval power.“Chinese naval threats have grown by leaps and bounds during the past decade. No class of surface warship has demonstrated this newfound naval might more than the modern Luyang III–class guided-missile destroyers, also known as the Type 052D, which began entering service in 2014,” the US Naval Institute, an independent US-based think tank, wrote in a report on the warship.Ahead of the exercise, Pakistan navy chief, Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi told Chinese state media the PLAN’s presence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) the maritime area was important to maintain regional balance of power.Describing India as “expansionist” Niazi told the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times, that New Delhi was destabilising the IOR and the expanding partnership between Chinese and Pakistani navies will play an increasingly important role in maintaining peace in the IOR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-russia-navies-hold-drill-in-arabian-sea-off-pak-coast-101613219612203.html
13-02-2021||World||GOP strategist resigns from board of Lincoln Project amid sexual harassment row||Veteran Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, one of the faces of the so-called Never Trump movement, announced Friday that he has resigned from the board of the Lincoln Project.The move comes after a tumultuous week in which revelations surfaced that the organization, an influential critic of former President Donald Trump, knew about allegations of sexual harassment involving one of its co-founders several months before acknowledging them publicly.Schmidt made the announcement in a lengthy post on Twitter in which he shared a personal account of sexual abuse from a Boy Scout medic, a yearslong fight with depression and an apology for posting the private messages of a former Lincoln Project official a day earlier.“I am resigning my seat on the Lincoln Project board to make room for the appointment of a female board member as the first step to reform and professionalize the Lincoln Project,” Schmidt wrote.Spiraling allegations of misconduct have rocked the well-funded super PAC over the last 48 hours, raising existential questions about the organization's future while undercutting its message at a bad time. Having long claimed the moral high ground in its fight against Trump, the Lincoln Project is working to pressure Senate Republicans to convict the former president in this week's impeachment trial.The Lincoln Project also played a major role in pushing Republican-friendly businesses to stop donating money to Trump's Republican allies in Congress.Schmidt's statement came less than an hour after an attorney for former Lincoln Project official Jennifer Horn sent a note to the Lincoln Project counsel informing them that they should preserve documents and communications in anticipation of litigation.In his statement, Schmidt acknowledged playing a role in the public release of a series of private messages between Horn and a reporter the night before.“I am not the daily manager of the Lincoln Project, but I am the senior leader. As the senior leader, it is my responsibility to set an example and to assume accountability," he wrote.“I would like to apologize to Jennifer Horn,” he continued. “She deserved better from me. She deserved a leader who could restrain his anger.”While he stepped down from the four-member board, Schmidt is expected to maintain a role at the Lincoln Project. His statement did not address what he or other leaders may have known about co-founder John Weaver's misconduct before it became public late last month.Last June, members of the organization’s leadership were informed in writing and in subsequent phone calls of at least 10 specific allegations of harassment against Weaver, including two involving Lincoln Project employees, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the situation. The email and phone calls raised questions about the Lincoln Project’s statement last month that it was “shocked” when accusations surfaced publicly this year.The organization announced Thursday evening, after the new details were reported by The Associated Press, that its board had decided to “retain a best-in-class outside professional” to review Weaver’s tenure “to establish both accountability and best practices going forward for The Lincoln Project.”The Lincoln Project launched in November 2019 and quickly emerged as a powerful player in the political fight against Trump and his allies in Congress.Since its creation, the organization has raised $90 million. But only about a third of the money, roughly $27 million, directly paid for advertisements that aired on broadcast and cable, or appeared online, during the 2020 campaign, according to an analysis of campaign finance disclosures and data from the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-strategist-resigns-from-board-of-lincoln-project-amid-sexual-harassment-row-101613218077931.html

In video shown during the trial, Goodman was seen directing Senator Mitt Romney out of harm's way."Here in this trial, we saw new video, powerful video, showing calmness under pressure, his courage in the line of duty, his foresight in the midst of chaos, and his willingness to make himself a target of the mob's rage so that others might reach safety," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said on the Senate floor.Schumer pointed out Goodman, who stood in the back of the chamber. Lawmakers burst into a standing ovation for him. Goodman briefly placed his hand on his heart. Schumer said all the law enforcement officers who responded to the Capitol attack should be honored and recognized as well, spurring a second standing ovation. Goodman joined the second round of applause.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also praised Goodman, saying: "If not for the quick thinking and bravery of Officer Eugene Goodman in particular, the people in this chamber may not have escaped that day unharmed."US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a bill on Thursday that would award the Congressional Gold Medal to members of the Capitol Police force and to Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, whose officers were also called to the scene to secure the Capitol complex.Trump, the first US president to face two impeachment trials and the first to have such as trial after leaving office, has been accused of inciting an insurrection for an incendiary speech he made to supporters shortly before the siege.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-honours-police-officer-eugene-goodman-who-protected-lawmakers-in-riot-101613217567207.html

Success would also prove to Italy's sceptical northern allies that by offering funds to the poorer south, they will fortify the entire bloc.But he faces enormous challenges. Italy is mired in its worst downturn since World War Two, hundreds of people are still dying of COVID-19 each day, the vaccination campaign is going slowly and he only has limited time to sort things out.Italy is due to return to the polls in two years time, but it is far from certain that Draghi will be able to survive that long at the head of a coalition that includes parties with radically opposing views on issues such as immigration, justice, infrastructure development and welfare.Highlighting Italy's political instability, Draghi's government is the 67th to take office since 1946 and the seventh in the last decade alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italys-mario-draghi-sworn-in-as-prime-minister-of-unity-government-101613215187056.html
13-02-2021||World||EU calls on China to reverse ban on BBC World News channel||The European Union on Saturday called on China to reverse its ban on the BBC World News television channel imposed in apparent retaliation for Britain’s pulling of the license of state-owned Chinese broadcaster CGTN.The EU said in a statement that Beijing’s move further restricted “freedom of expression and access to information inside its borders," and violated both the Chinese constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The statement also said that Hong Kong’s announcement that its public broadcaster would also stop carrying BBC broadcasts added to the “erosion of the rights and freedoms that is ongoing" in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory since the imposition last year of a sweeping new national security law.“The EU remains strongly committed to safeguarding media freedom and pluralism, as well as protecting the right to freedom of expression online and offline, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information without interference of any kind," the statement said.While Britain is no longer in the EU, it remains a member of the Council of Europe, which oversees a 1989 agreement linking broadcasting licenses. Britain, the US and foreign correspondents based in China have also expressed dismay over the BBC ban.China's move Thursday was largely symbolic, because BBC World was shown only on cable TV systems in hotels and apartment compounds for foreigners and some other businesses. However, it comes against the backdrop of growing conflict between Beijing and Western governments over a slew of issues ranging from human rights to trade and the Covid-19 pandemic in which Chinese criticisms over foreign media coverage have played a prominent role.China's National Radio and Television Administration said BBC World News coverage of the country violated requirements that news reporting be true and impartial, reflecting complaints over BBC reports about the government's initial response to the virus outbreak in China. Other complaints were over allegations of forced labor and sexual abuse in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang, home to Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups. The EU statement specifically linked the ban to BBC reporting on those topics.It wasn't clear whether BBC reporters in China would be affected. Last year, Beijing expelled foreign reporters for The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times amid disputes with the Trump administration and complaints over media criticism of the ruling Communist Party.Britain’s communications watchdog, Ofcom, revoked the license for CGTN, China’s English-language satellite news channel, on Feb. 4, citing links to the Communist Party, among other reasons.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Ofcom acted on “political grounds based on ideological bias.”Losing its British license was a major blow for CGTN, which is part of a global effort by the party to promote its views and challenge Western media narratives about China, into which it has poured enormous resources. CGTN has a European operations hub in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-calls-on-china-to-reverse-ban-on-bbc-world-news-channel-101613214359253.html
13-02-2021||World||China refused to provide raw data on early Covid-19 cases, says WHO team member||China refused to give raw data on early Covid-19 cases to a World Health Organization-led team probing the origins of the pandemic, one of the team's investigators said, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the outbreak began.The team had requested raw patient data on the 174 cases of Covid-19 that China had identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, as well as other cases, but were only provided with a summary, said Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert who is a member of the team.Such raw data is known as "line listings", he said, and would typically be anonymised but contain details such as what questions were asked of individual patients, their responses and how their responses were analysed."That's standard practice for an outbreak investigation," he told Reuters on Saturday via video call from Sydney, where he is currently undergoing quarantine.He said that gaining access to the raw data was especially important since only half of the 174 cases had exposure to the Huanan market, the now-shuttered wholesale seafood centre in Wuhan where the virus was initially detected."That's why we've persisted to ask for that," he said. "Why that doesn't happen, I couldn't comment. Whether it's political or time or it's difficult ... But whether there are any other reasons why the data isn't available, I don't know. One would only speculate."Read | Covid-19 origin probe ends, politics over it continuesWhile the Chinese authorities provided a lot of material, he said the issue of access to the raw patient data would be mentioned in the team's final report. "The WHO people certainly felt that they had received much much more data than they had ever received in the previous year. So that in itself is an advance."A summary of the team's findings could be released as early as next week, the WHO said on Friday.The WHO-led probe had been plagued by delay, concern over access and bickering between Beijing and Washington, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.The team, which arrived in China in January and spent four weeks looking into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak, was limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and prevented from contact with community members, due to health restrictions. The first two weeks were spent in hotel quarantine.China's refusal to hand over raw data on the early Covid-19 cases was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal on Friday.The WHO did not reply to a request from Reuters for comment. The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment but Beijing has previously defended its transparency in handling the outbreak and its cooperation with the WHO mission.Harmonious, with argumentsDwyer said the work within the WHO team was harmonious but that there were "arguments" at times with their Chinese counterparts over the interpretation and significance of the data, which he described as "natural" in such probes."We might be having a talk about cold chain and they might be more firm about what the data shows than what we might have been, but that's natural. Whether there's political pressure to have different opinions, I don't know. There may well be, but it's hard to know."Cold chain refers to the transport and trade of frozen food.Beijing has sought to cast doubt on the notion that the coronavirus originated in China, pointing to imported frozen food as a conduit.On Tuesday, Peter Ben Embarek, who led the WHO delegation, told a news conference that transmission of the virus via frozen food is a possibility, but pointed to market vendors selling frozen animal products including farmed wild animals as a potential pathway that warrants further study.Embarek also said that the team was not looking further into the theory that the virus escaped from a lab, which it considered highly unlikely. The previous US administration of President Donald Trump had said it suspected the virus may have escaped from a Wuhan lab, which Beijing strongly denies."It was an unanimous feeling," Dwyer said. "It wasn't a political sop whatsoever."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-refused-to-provide-raw-data-on-early-covid-19-cases-says-who-team-member-101613213123940.html

13-02-2021||World||Religion and the death penalty collide at the Supreme Court||The Supreme Court is sending a message to states that want to continue to carry out the death penalty: Inmates must be allowed to have a spiritual adviser by their side as they are executed.The high court around midnight Thursday declined to let Alabama proceed with the lethal injection of Willie B. Smith III. Smith had objected to Alabama's policy that his pastor would have had to observe his execution from an adjacent room rather than the death chamber itself.The order from the high court follows two years in which inmates saw some rare success in bringing challenges based on the issue of chaplains in the death chamber.This time, liberal and conservative members of the court normally in disagreement over death penalty issues found common ground not on the death penalty itself but on the issue of religious freedom and how the death penalty is carried out.Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three justices who said they would have let Smith's execution go forward, said Alabama's policy applies equally to all inmates and serves a state interest in ensuring safety and security.But he said it was apparent that his colleagues who disagreed were providing a path for states to follow.States that want to avoid months or years of litigation over the presence of spiritual advisers “should figure out a way to allow spiritual advisors into the execution room, as other States and the Federal Government have done," he wrote in a dissent joined by Chief Justice John Roberts.Justice Clarence Thomas also would have allowed the execution of Smith, who was sentenced to die for the 1991 murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson in Birmingham.Alabama had up until 2019 allowed a Christian prison chaplain employed by the state to be physically present in the execution chamber if requested by the inmate, but the state changed its policy in response to two earlier Supreme Court cases.Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, says the court's order will most clearly affect states in the Deep South that have active execution chambers.Dunham said most state execution protocols, which set who is present in the death chamber, do not mention spiritual advisers. For most of the modern history of the US death penalty since the 1970s, spiritual advisers have not been present in execution chambers, he said.The federal government, which under President Donald Trump resumed federal executions following a 17-year hiatus and carried out 13 executions, allowed a spiritual adviser to be present in the death chamber. The Biden administration is still weighing how it will proceed in death penalty cases.The court's order in Smith's case contained only statements from Kavanaugh and Justice Elena Kagan.“Willie Smith is sentenced to death, and his last wish is to have his pastor with him as he dies,” Kagan wrote for herself and liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, as well as conservative Amy Coney Barrett. Kagan added: “Alabama has not carried its burden of showing that the exclusion of all clergy members from the execution chamber is necessary to ensure prison security.”Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Samuel Alito did not make public their views, but at least one or perhaps both of them must have voted with their liberal colleagues to keep Smith's execution on hold.The court's years long wrestling with the issue of chaplains in the death chamber began in 2019, when the justices declined to halt the execution of Alabama inmate Domineque Ray. Ray had objected that a Christian chaplain employed by the prison typically remained in the execution chamber during a lethal injection, but the state would not let his imam be present.The next month, however, the justices halted the execution of a Texas inmate, Patrick Murphy, who objected after Texas officials wouldn't allow his Buddhist spiritual adviser in the death chamber. Kavanaugh wrote at the time that states have two choices: Allow all inmates to have a religious adviser of their choice in the execution room or allow that person only in an adjacent viewing room.In response, the Texas prison system changed its policy, allowing only prison security staff into the execution chamber. But in June, the high court kept Texas from executing Ruben Gutierrez after he objected to the new policy.Diana Verm, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which had submitted briefs in two of the spiritual adviser cases, said it was unusual for the court with its conservative majority to halt executions.“You can tell from some of the opinions that the justices don't like the last-minute nature of execution litigation, but this is an area where they are saying: 'Listen ... religious liberty has to be a part of the process if it's going to happen," Verm said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religion-and-the-death-penalty-collide-at-the-supreme-court-101613210884646.html
13-02-2021||World||Russia slaps sanctions on 9 Ukrainian companies||Russia has imposed economic sanctions against nine Ukrainian companies, expanding a list of firms that it targets with such penalties, according to a government decree.Russia and Ukraine have been at loggerheads since 2014 when Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia denies Kiev's charges that its military was involved in the conflict.Western countries have imposed a range of sanctions since then on Russia, which has retaliated with its own measures.The companies targeted by "special economic measures" under the new Russian decree, which was published late on Friday, include Ukrainian vessel maker Craneship, towage firm Donmar, cargo operator Transship and metal producer Maxima Metal.The decree did not say why these nine companies had been targeted.There was no immediate response from Ukraine to the move, which takes the number of its companies sanctioned by Russia to 84.In a sign of further strains in Russia's relations with the West, Moscow said on Friday it was ready to sever ties with the European Union if the bloc hit it with painful economic sanctions, a statement that Germany described as disconcerting and incomprehensible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-slaps-sanctions-on-9-ukrainian-companies-101613208352646.html

Mother and child were taken to a hospital to warm up and for observation, the dpa news agency reported.Icy temperatures have also led to numerous accidents on roads and waterways. Police in southwestern Germany said a 49-year-old man was crushed to death Thursday when the tractor he was driving slid and toppled over on an icy field.In western France, freezing rains turned roads into chutes of treacherous ice. Authorities in Brittany said smaller roads that link towns and villages in the largely rural region were unusable, and urged people to stay home. Large trucks were banned from circulation.The German Red Cross warned people to be careful when skating or walking on frozen lakes and rivers after several adults and children fell through the ice and had to be rescued in recent days.Andreas Paatz, the head of the group's water rescue service, said many people don't realize that ice on standing water needs to be at least 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) thick and on running water 20 centimeters (7.9 inches) thick to support a person.Authorities in northern Germany have for the first time in years deployed icebreakers to smash passages through frozen shipping canals.In the neighbouring Netherlands, skating fans flocked to the ice Friday, causing a headache for authorities trying to enforce social distancing measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus.Authorities blocked roads close to some popular skating spots and ordered skaters off dangerously thin ice in some locations.Emergency services had to rescue at least one skater who sank through ice covering a lake next to the Dutch parliament buildings in The Hague.In the northern German town of Verden, police ordered some 50 skaters and hockey players off the ice, saying it was too thin and they weren't wearing face masks.The cold weather that has gripped northern Europe is forecast to make its way toward the southeast in the coming days. The Greek weather service predicted Athens might see snowfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arctic-blast-puts-europe-s-homeless-travellers-in-peril-101613191941216.html
13-02-2021||World||Gender identity bill divides Spain's feminists, left-wing||Victòria Martínez continues to sign official documents with the name that she, her partner and their two daughters ditched four years ago. Barring any surprises, she expects the Spanish government to recognize her as Victòria by May, closing a patience-wearing chapter familiar to transgender people around the world.Changing her legal identity at a civil registry office in Barcelona will allow Martínez to update her passport and driver's license and to carry a health card that correctly states she is a woman. But the process, which the pandemic prolonged, has been, in her words, “humiliating" — requiring a psychiatric diagnosis, reports from three doctors and a court's approval.“Did I want to be stigmatized by being labelled as crazy? Did I want to voluntarily apply for a shrink’s report that says so, to have a judge decide whether I can be what I already am?” Martínez, 44, recalls asking herself. “The whole thing has been emotionally exhausting.” A new law proposed by the far-left party in Spain’s coalition government would make it easier for residents to change genders for official purposes. A bill sponsored by Equality Minister Irene Montero aims to make gender self-determination — no diagnosis, medical treatment or judge required — the norm, with eligibility starting at age 16. Nearly 20 countries, eight of them in the European Union, already have similar laws.Factions of the Catholic Church and the far-right have focused their opposition to the bill on the fact that it also would allow children under 16 to bypass parental objections and seek a judge's assistance in accessing treatment for gender dysphoria, the medical term for the psychological distress that results from a conflict between an individual's identity and birth-assigned sex.Less expected has been the fierce resistance from some feminists and from within Spain's Socialist-led government.“I’m fundamentally worried by the idea that if gender can be chosen with no more than one’s will or desire, that could put at risk the identity criteria for 47 million Spaniards,” Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo, a veteran Socialist and women’s rights advocate, said last week.Opponents argue that allowing people to choose their gender eventually would lead to “erasing” women from the public sphere: if more Spaniards registered male at birth switch to female, they say, it would skew national statistics and create more competition among women for everything from jobs to sports trophies.The divide in Spain mirrors a debate between a branch of feminist theorists and LGBTQ rights movements around the globe. At one end, activists often derogatorily referred to as TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) posit that the advancement of transgender rights could undercut efforts to root out sexism and misogyny by negating the existence of biological sexesThe State Federation of Lesbian, Gay, Transgender and Bisexual people says that if passed in its current form, the law would help end discrimination against transgender people and leapfrog Spain to the European vanguard of protecting LGBTQ rights.Montero's bill nonetheless has provoked unusual fury on online platforms, where critics express alarm over provisions that would assign public toilets and prisons according to “registered gender.” Confluencia Feminista, an alliance of dozens of women’s rights organizations, also has come out against any changes to Spain’s existing lawThe concern of Confluencia Feminista activist Alexandra Paniagua pivots around the idea that by eliminating the opinions of doctors and judges, state-subsidized hormones and gender reassignment surgery would become more available, ultimately “promoting” more dysphoria among young people.“More people will see easier access to the invasive treatment, especially girls who have been told that their bodies are less worthy in our society,” she said.But Trans Platform Federation President Mar Cambrollé argues that some of the fears cited as reasons to keep existing hurdles in place are based on outdated ideas that reduce boys and girls, men and women to a handful of socially prescribed characteristics and roles.“Transphobic attitudes piss me off,” Cambrollé said. “As a woman, I’ve been discriminated against for being a woman in a world made by men for men, but also by cis(gender) people who build it with other cis people in mind.”Finding a compromise any time soon looks like an insurmountable task judging by the virulence of the debate online. Cambrollé has sued 85-year-old Lidia Falcón, the founder of Spain's Feminist Party, for repeatedly saying that transgender and gay people promote pedophilia; prosecutors are investigating Falcón's statements as a possible hate crime.Ángela Rodríguez, an advisor to Montero on LGBTQ issues, said the bill's timing has added to the tension, with International Women's Day coming up on March 8.“There is a dispute for the hegemony of the message in the feminist movement,” Rodríguez said during a recent panel discussion.What for many is a theoretical debate is painfully real to Martínez, who has closed most of her social media accounts. She says the constant chatter feels both too “personal” and "perverse, generalizing about what a trans person is."“Unfortunately, to this day, it’s still easier for people who stare at you when you are walking down the street and they can reconcile a certain type of face with a pair of tits,” said Martínez, who wears round-edged glasses and her hair in a bob to soften her sharp facial contours.To come out as transgender, first to herself and then to her partner, required Martínez to grow a kind of confidence that wasn't part of growing up as a boy in 1980s Spain. There were suicide attempts before she started living as Victòria, and she doesn't consider herself brave.“For me,” she said, “there just wasn't any other choice.”Yet Martínez hesitated over taking hormones and updating her civil registry record. She fought hard to be proud of the woman she is, with a deep voice and a way of carrying herself that stands out. Didn’t she want to break with traditional gender molds, including expectations that transgender women should embody stereotypical femininity?In the end, she decided it would be easier to navigate the world with a more socially conforming appearance and an identity card that confirms she is female, even if that meant bowing down to existing legal requirements and the notions of people who still think in binary terms.“I lived 40 years in hiding,” she said. “Now I protect myself, but I don’t hide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gender-identity-bill-divides-spain-s-feminists-leftwing-101613205403623.html

13-02-2021||World||Trump's speedy impeachment trial heads toward Senate vote||Senators are poised to vote on whether Donald Trump will be held accountable for inciting the horrific attack at the Capitol after a speedy trial that laid bare the violence and danger to their own lives and the fragility of the nation's tradition of a peaceful transfer of presidential power.Barely a month since the deadly riot, closing arguments are set for the historic impeachment trial as senators arrive for a rare Saturday session, all under the watch of armed National Guard troops still guarding the iconic building.The outcome of the quick, raw and emotional proceedings are expected to reflect a nation divided over the former president and the future of his brand of politics in America.“What’s important about this trial is that it’s really aimed to some extent at Donald Trump, but it’s more aimed at some president we don’t even know 20 years from now,” said Sen. Angus King, the independent from Maine, weighing his vote.The nearly weeklong trial has been delivering a grim and graphic narrative of the Jan. 6 riot and its consequences for the nation in ways that senators, most of whom fled for their own safety that day, acknowledge they are still coming to grips with.Acquittal is expected in the evenly-divided Senate, a verdict that could heavily influence not only Trump’s political future but that of the senators sworn to deliver impartial justice as jurors as they cast their votes.Read | Pompeo calls on Biden administration to confront China 'head-on' like TrumpHouse prosecutors have argued that Trump's rallying cry to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell” for his presidency just as Congress was convening Jan. 6 to certify Joe Biden’s election was part of an orchestrated pattern of violent rhetoric and false claims that unleashed the mob. Five people died, including a rioter who was shot and a police officer.The defense attorneys countered in a short three hours Friday that Trump's words were not intended to incite the violence and impeachment is nothing but a “witch hunt” designed to prevent him from serving in office again.Only by watching the graphic videos — rioters calling out menacingly for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the vote tally — did senators say they began to understand just how perilously close the country came to chaos. Hundreds of rioters stormed into the building, taking over the Senate and some engaging in hand-to-hand, bloody combat with police.While it is unlikely the Senate would be able to mount the two-thirds vote needed to convict, several senators appear to be still weighing their vote. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell will be widely watched for cues, but he is not pressuring his GOP side of the aisle and is telling senators to vote their conscience.Many Republicans representing states where the former president remains popular doubt whether Trump was fully responsible or if impeachment is the appropriate response. Democrats appear all but united toward conviction.Trump is the only president to be twice impeached, and the first to face trial charges after leaving office.Unlike last year’s impeachment trial of Trump in the Ukraine affair, a complicated charge of corruption and obstruction over his attempts to have the foreign ally dig up dirt on then-rival Biden, this one brought an emotional punch over the unexpected vulnerability of the nation’s tradition of peaceful elections. The charge is singular, incitement of insurrection.On Friday, Trump’s impeachment lawyers accused Democrats of waging a campaign of “hatred” against the former president as they wrapped up their defense, sending the Senate toward a final vote in his historic trial.The defense team vigorously denied that Trump had incited the deadly riot and played out-of-context video clips showing Democrats, some of them senators now serving as jurors, also telling supporters to “fight," aiming to establish a parallel with Trump's overheated rhetoric.“This is ordinarily political rhetoric,” declared Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen. “Countless politicians have spoken of fighting for our principles.”But the presentation blurred the difference between general encouragement politicians make to battle for health care or other causes and Trump’s fight against officially accepted national election results, and minimized Trump’s efforts to undermine those election results. The defeated president was telling his supporters to fight on after every state had verified its results, after the Electoral College had affirmed them and after nearly every election lawsuit filed by Trump and his allies had been rejected in court.Democratic senators shook their heads at what many called a false equivalency to their own fiery words. “We weren’t asking them 'fight like hell' to overthrow an election,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.Democrats say that Trump was the “inciter in chief” whose monthslong campaign against the election results was rooted in a “big lie” and laid the groundwork for the riot, a violent domestic attack on the Capitol unparalleled in history.“Get real,” lead prosecutor Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said at one point. “We know that this is what happened.”The Senate has convened as a court of impeachment for past presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and now twice for Trump, but the unprecedented nature of the case because he's no longer in the White House has provided Republican senators one of several arguments against conviction.Republicans maintain the proceedings are unconstitutional, even though the Senate voted at the outset of the trial on this issue and confirmed it has jurisdiction.Six Republican senators who joined Democrats in voting to take up the case are among those most watched for their votes.Early signals came Friday during questions for the lawyers. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, asked the first question, the two centrists known for independent streaks. They leaned into a point the prosecutors had made asking exactly when did Trump learn of the breach of the Capitol and what specific actions did he take to bring the rioting to an end?Democrats had argued that Trump did nothing as the mob rioted.Another Republican who voted to launch the trial, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, asked about Trump’s tweet criticizing Pence moments after having been told by another senator that the vice president had just been evacuated.Van der Veen responded that at “no point” was the president informed of any danger. Cassidy told reporters later it was not a very good answer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-speedy-impeachment-trial-heads-toward-senate-vote-101613206580220.html
13-02-2021||World||Some Europeans get choosy about which Covid-19 vaccines they want||Many Europeans are desperate for a coronavirus vaccine. But not just any vaccine.As AstraZeneca shots are rolling out to European Union nations this month, joining the Pfizer and Moderna doses already available, some people are balking at being offered a vaccine that they perceive — fairly or not — as second-best.Poland began vaccinating teachers Friday with the AstraZeneca vaccine, and some had misgivings about being put in line for a vaccine they believe is less effective than the others.Ewelina Jankowska, the director of a primary and high school in Warsaw's southern Wilanow district, said nobody in her school was enthusiastic about getting the AstraZeneca shot, although many signed up, eager for any protection against a virus that has upended their lives and their students' schooling.“I still fear the illness more than the AstraZeneca vaccine,” said Jankowska, who was infected with Covid-19 in November and had a very slow recovery.AstraZeneca, an Anglo-Swedish company, developed its vaccine with the University of Oxford. While regulators in more than 50 countries, including the EU's drug watchdog, have authorized its widespread use, it has attracted more criticism than others due to concerns about its human trials.Several European nations have recommended the drug only for people under 65, and other countries have recommended it for those under 55, because AstraZeneca's trials included a relatively small number of older people.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot acknowledged the criticism but said regulators had reviewed the data and deemed the vaccine safe and effective. Cov-19 vaccines are in short supply, he said, and the AstraZeneca shot offers high levels of protection against severe disease, which is the most important benchmark in fighting a virus that has killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide.“Is it perfect? No, it's not perfect, but it's great,” Soriot said Thursday. “We're going to save thousands of lives and that's why we come to work every day.”The World Health Organisation says the AstraZeneca vaccine is about 63 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 after two doses. That's less than the 95 per cent effectiveness reported by Pfizer and Moderna, but experts caution against such comparisons as the studies were done at different times and under different conditions. Furthermore, all have proven extremely effective at preventing serious illness and death.“If you're offered any approved vaccine, take it," said Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "They have all been found safe. Vaccines are the world's route back to some sort of normality.”French President Emmanuel Macron angered scientists last month when he called the AstraZeneca vaccine “quasi-ineffective” for people over 65 — a comment that came hours before the European Medicines Agency approved it and said it could be used for all adults, including those over 65. Those who criticized Macron argued that he had spoken irresponsibly and had encouraged vaccine skepticism.French Health Minister Olivier Veran, who is 40, made a point this week of getting the AstraZeneca vaccine to show government confidence in it for under-65s.Adding to AstraZeneca's troubles have been criticism from the EU about delivery shortages, its lack of approval yet in the U.S., and a preliminary study that raised questions about the vaccine's ability to combat a Covid-19 variant discovered in South Africa.In its favour, however, is that it is cheaper and can be stored at refrigerator temperatures — not the far colder temperatures required of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.In Cyprus, Health Minister Constantinos Ioannou warned that opting for one over another risks delaying inoculations, given the limited deliveries of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in the coming weeks, and he noted "all three vaccines reduce hospitalizations and deaths drastically.”Yet in Poland, Spain and Italy, some unions complained that their members are slated to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine, expressing concerns they were being treated as less important than groups getting the Pfizer or Moderna doses.Police unions in Spain have raised concerns about a government decision to administer AstraZeneca shots to police, military, firefighters and teachers.Some Italian doctors in the private sector are declining AstraZeneca shots, saying they want the Pfizer or Moderna shots going to public health care workers.“I'm not a no-vax AstraZeneca. But for an at-risk population, health care workers, they should use the same vaccination strategy for everyone and not create any discrimination," said Dr. Paolo Mezzana, a Rome plastic surgeon who helps administer a Facebook group of private doctors. They have been posting refusals to accept the AstraZeneca shot after vaccinations began this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-europeans-get-choosy-about-which-covid-19-vaccines-they-want-101613206775543.html

"It strengthens the findings of the autopsy. The cubs probably caught the virus from the person handling and feeding them."Pakistan's zoos regularly draw the ire of animal rights activists, who say hundreds of animals have died from poor living conditions there."The last two white tiger cubs have died at Lahore zoo and once again the negligence of the management and authorities has come out," Zufishan Anushay, founder of JFK (Justice for Kiki) Animal Rescue And Shelter, told Reuters."White tigers are extremely rare and need a specific habitat and environment to live a healthy life. By caging them in unhygienic conditions with no medical arrangements, we will keep witnessing these incidents.”Covid-19 is a new virus, and the world is making policies for humans, she said. “It should not forget animals in pet shops, zoos and everywhere else.”Saleem rejected the allegations of neglect at the zoo, telling Reuters that animal rights activists were welcome to visit and check the facility's safety and hygiene protocols themselves.In December two Himalayan brown bears were airlifted out of the Islamabad Zoo to a sanctuary in Jordan.That rescue came weeks after an elephant Kaavan was moved to a sanctuary in Cambodia, the culmination of a years-long campaign that included US pop star Cher.At the Peshawar Zoo, officials have said four giraffes died in 2020. Last year two lions at Islamabad Zoo suffocated when workers lit fires in their cages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-white-tiger-cubs-in-pakistan-likely-died-of-covid-19-zoo-officials-101613205938098.html
13-02-2021||World||Clubhouse users’ raw audio may be exposed to Chinese partner||Clubhouse, the popular app that allows people to create digital discussion groups, says it’s reviewing its data security practices after the Stanford Internet Observatory found potential vulnerabilities in its infrastructure that could allow external access to users’ raw audio data.The SIO confirmed that Agora Inc., a Shanghai-based start-up with offices in Silicon Valley, provides back-end infrastructure to Clubhouse and sells a “real-time voice and video engagement platform.”User IDs are transmitted in plaintext over the internet, making them “trivial to intercept,” the Observatory noted. User IDs are like a serial number, not the username of the person. Agora would likely have access to users’ raw audio, potentially providing access to the Chinese government, it said.“Any observer of internet traffic could easily match IDs on shared chatrooms to see who is talking to whom,” the SIO said in its Twitter feed about its findings. “For mainland Chinese users, this is troubling.”SIO, a program at Stanford University that studies disinformation on the internet and social media platforms, said it observed metadata from a Clubhouse chatroom “being relayed to servers we believe to be hosted in” China. Analysts also saw audio being relayed “to servers managed by Chinese entities and distributed around the world,” their report noted.SIO said that as a Chinese company, Agora was subject to China’s cybersecurity laws and would be “legally required to assist the government in locating and storing” audio messages authorities said jeopardized national security.Agora didn’t immediately respond to emails outside regular business hours seeking comment.Metadata Transmission“Any unencrypted data that is transmitted via servers in the PRC (People’s Republic of China) would likely be accessible to the Chinese government,” SIO said in its report. Since SIO was able to observe the transmission of metadata between servers, it believes the Chinese government would be able to collect metadata without having to access Agora’s networks.However, the Observatory noted that Agora claims not to store user audio or metadata “except to monitor network quality and bill its clients,” which means it wouldn’t have any records of user data if Beijing were to request it.It also said that as long as audio was stored in the U.S., it was unlikely that the Chinese government would be able to access it.SIO said it chose to disclose the security issues because they were easy to uncover and because of the risk they pose to Clubhouse’s millions of users. “SIO has discovered other security flaws that we have privately disclosed to Clubhouse and will publicly disclose when they are fixed or after a set deadline.”Clubhouse ResponseIn a statement included in the report, Clubhouse said it would roll out changes over 72 hours to add “additional encryption and blocks to prevent Clubhouse clients from ever transmitting pings to Chinese servers. We also plan to engage an external data security firm to review and validate these changes.”Clubhouse recently raised $100 million at a reported $1 billion valuation, and some of the most notable technology executives, including Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, have joined the service.Agora, known mostly within tech circles as an industrious but low-profile provider of software tools, has soared more than 150% since mid-January. It is now worth almost $11 billion.In early February users of Clubhouse in China said they were unable to access the app after an explosion of discussions on taboo topics from Taiwan to Xinjiang. Now, it appears that users can access the app by using virtual private networks, one of the few ways people in mainland China can access internet beyond the Great Firewall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clubhouse-users-raw-audio-may-be-exposed-to-chinese-partner-101613204809308.html

Assange is believed to be responsible for the largest leak of classified information in history on WikiLeaks in 2010 that shed light on war crimes committed by US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-continues-to-seek-extradition-of-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-101613202636461.html
13-02-2021||World||Rise of variants sparks push for all-in-one Covid vaccines||Just weeks into the rollout of vaccines to combat Covid-19, researchers are shifting their focus to a new class of potential shots to take on the threat posed by fast-spreading mutations.Dangerous coronavirus variants identified in Africa, Europe and South America are carpeting the globe, pushing scientists in the U.K. and elsewhere to target multiple versions of the pathogen in a single shot and perhaps head off more lethal foes that may emerge.A variant that arose in South Africa has already shown itself capable of partially evading defenses raised by several vaccines. The country paused rolling out a shot from AstraZeneca Plc because it offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness cause by the mutant, called B.1.351. With a spreading virus comes an increased risk of more alarming mutations.“We cannot be complacent that we’ve got the vaccines we need and it’s just a matter of time to ending the pandemic -- it’s not,” said Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which has worked to accelerate development of Covid inoculations. “We’re in a race with the virus and we’ve got to get ahead of it.”Britain snapped up huge Covid vaccine supplies early and became the first Western country to approve a shot. Now it’s seeking to catch up with the outbreak and sustain its momentum in the next phase of the crisis, a difficult task as the virus runs rampant.Blunted OptimismThe government last week announced a pact with CureVac NV to tackle variants, pairing artificial intelligence to predict future mutations with messenger RNA technology that can rapidly generate new vaccines. After a once-promising partnership with Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals Inc. ended and separate trials with Sanofi ran into delays, London-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc is also working with CureVac on mutant-quelling vaccines.Meanwhile, countries across the European Union, which has lagged the U.S. and U.K. in immunizations, have raised questions about the bloc’s strategy on mutants. At a meeting of ambassadors Wednesday, countries including Malta and Germany urged the European Commission to ensure contracts with manufacturers cover sufficient batches if booster shots are needed, according to a cable seen by Bloomberg.The new variants, including the B.1.1.7 lineage that surfaced in southern England, have blunted the optimism that greeted highly-effective mRNA shots from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. late last year. The companies should be able to quickly redesign their inoculations based on the distinctive spike protein that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells, according to Michael Kinch, a vaccine specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. While scientists have the tools to keep pace, further mutations call for alternative approaches, he said.“The bad news with these particular variants, and the reason many of us are nervous, isn’t that the vaccines will suddenly not work,” Kinch said, “but that they will slowly become obsolete.”Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have said they’re starting work on developing booster shots or other efforts to bolster their vaccines. AstraZeneca and partner Oxford aim to have a tweaked version tailored to new variants available by fall.Another strategy involves including a variety of antigens, the molecules in the vaccine that provoke an immune response, Kinch said. Although the spike protein has proven to be a good target, other surface proteins in the virus’s envelope and membrane could turn out to be important, too.‘Almost Job Done’“Vaccines based on the spike protein are the first out the door,” said Julian Hiscox, a coronavirus specialist and chair of infection and global health at the University of Liverpool. The next round could add the N -- or nucleocapsid -- protein, whose job is to bind viral RNA, he said. With both S and N proteins, “that’s almost job done,” he said.Traditional methods that use the virus itself in a weakened or inactivated form and provide a broader choice of potential targets -- like those used by some Chinese developers including Sinovac Biotech Ltd. -- could also play a more significant role, Kinch said.CEPI, the Oslo-based group that has funded a number of Covid vaccine programs, has set a goal of developing “strain changes” within 100 days if needed, Hatchett said. Pfizer’s partner BioNTech SE has said that if their vaccine turns out to be ineffective against a new strain, they could, in theory, produce an updated shot targeting that variant within six weeks.For years, multivalent flu vaccines targeting three or four versions of the pathogen have provided protection against multiple strains circling the globe. Glaxo and CureVac plan to rely on mRNA technology to develop a product that addresses multiple variants in one Covid vaccine. If the work is successful, a vaccine could be ready next year.That could still have a big impact given how many countries still lack access to vaccines, said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer for Glaxo’s vaccines unit. One of the big flu vaccine suppliers, Glaxo is used to altering vaccines quickly, he said.Following partnerships with the U.K. and Glaxo, CureVac has been approached by other governments, said Mariola Fotin-Mleczek, its chief technology officer.“The virus will mutate further, and therefore we need to re-invest now,” she said.Some scientists, including a team at the University of Cambridge, are exploring vaccines that could protect against multiple coronaviruses to prepare for future pandemics. Backed by U.K. funding, the Cambridge group is developing technology that could be plugged into any platform to fight multiple variants and other coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. They’re planning to start human trials in the spring.Pressure Rises“We need to bring on the next generation that are going to work against not only these variants, but the next pandemic,” said Jonathan Heeney, the Cambridge professor leading the study.Combinations are another avenue drugmakers are pursuing. Oxford is launching a trial bringing AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines together to determine whether two shots of different products yield better results. Russia also plans a study mixing the Astra vaccine with its Sputnik V shot.As the work progresses, the pressure is rising. New strains could make it more difficult to achieve a sufficient level of immunity needed to get control of the virus, Hatchett said.“Every responsible observer is concerned about what we’re seeing. We’re going to get an awful lot of mileage out of the vaccines that we have,” he said. “But we also need to be ready.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rise-of-variants-sparks-push-for-all-in-one-covid-vaccines-101613204110651.html

So far, four vaccines — Sinophram (China), Oxford-AstraZeneca (UK), Sputnik-V (Russia) and Cansino Bio (China) — have been registered. This will make it easy to arrange the vaccine for such a large population to create herd immunity,” he said.Also read| VIMSAR doctors to study seroconversion of vaccinated peopleReplying to a question, Shah said it was not possible to get the vaccine for millions of people from one company, so a basket would be created in which vaccines of various countries/companies would be included.During the trial, around 9,000 volunteers were vaccinated through the University of Health Sciences (UHS) and Aga Khan University.UHS Vice Chancellor Dr Javed Akram told Dawn that during the clinical trial of Cansino Bio, around 6,000 volunteers were vaccinated under his university.He said only five per cent of the volunteers developed minor fever but not a single casualty or hospital admission was reported.He said issuance of emergency use authorisation to a number of companies would create competition and help bring down prices of the vaccines.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases in the country reached 561,625 after 1,262 new cases were detected in the last 24 hours, according to the ministry of National Health Services.The country reported 58 deaths in this period, taking the total number of fatalities to 12,276.A total of 523,700 coronavirus patients have recovered, while 1,692 people are in critical condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pakistan-approves-cansino-vaccine-101613198560135.html

Work is being done closely on that.”If that deal is arrived it, it will over the 20 million doses of the vaccine that Canada has already placed an order of with AstraZeneca.Referring to his conversation earlier in the week with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trudeau said, “It was good to talk to Prime Minister Modi on a range of subjects including the role that India is playing in producing vaccines for the developing world and other issues that are important to us.”The Canadian PMO readout immediately following the conversation did not mention Trudeau calling Modi with a request for India-made vaccines and said the “two leaders agreed to work together on access to vaccines”.On the other hand, following the conversation, Modi had tweeted that he “was happy to receive a call from my friend, @JustinTrudeau” and added, “Assured him that India would do its best to facilitate supplies of Covid vaccines sought by Canada.”For the time being, Canada’s current contract is for the AstraZeneca shipment to arrive from the United States, contingent on public health authorities providing emergency authorisation to the vaccine.However, with the US stressing priority for its own citizens when it comes to vaccines manufactured there, there is lack of clarity on that front.The Serum Institute is working with Verity Pharmaceuticals, based in the Greater Toronto Area, for importing the vaccines to Canada, as and when an arrangement is finalised with Canadian authorities.“Our arrangement is currently being finalised.

13-02-2021||World||Indian-origin Arora Akanksha, 34, announces candidacy for UN Secretary-General post||An Indian-origin employee at the UN has announced her candidacy to be its next Secretary-General, the first person to throw her hat in the ring against incumbent Antonio Guterres, who is seeking a second five-year term beginning January 2022 as chief of the world organisation.Arora Akanksha, 34, working as an audit coordinator for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), said she will run for the post of the world’s top diplomat and launched her campaign #AroraForSG this month.“People in my position aren’t supposed to stand up to the ones in charge. We are supposed to wait our turn, hop on the hamster wheel, go to work, keep our heads down and accept that the world is the way it is,” Akanksha said in a two and half minute campaign video posted online.The video shows Akanksha walking inside the sprawling UN headquarters, as her voiceover says that people who have come before her have failed to hold the UN accountable.“For 75 years, the UN has not fulfilled its promise to the world - refugees haven’t been protected, humanitarian aid has been minimal, and technology and innovation has been on the back-burner. We deserve a UN that leads progress," she said.“That is why I am running for the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I refuse to be a by-stander. I will not accept this is the best the UN can do,” she said in the video.Last month Guterres, 71 had confirmed that he will seek a second five-year term as chief of the world organisation.Guterres’s first term ends on December 31 this year and the term of the next Secretary-General will begin on January 1, 2022.Guterres assumed office on January 1, 2017 after a reformed selection process that included a public informal dialogue session in the General Assembly.Guterres is the 9th Secretary-General of the United Nations and no woman has held the position of the world’s top diplomat in the 75-year history of the United Nations.The Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Security Council, making the Secretary-General's selection subject to the veto of any of the five permanent members of the Council.Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General, responding to a question at the daily briefing on the UNDP staffer announcing her candidacy for Secretary-General, said "Antonio Guterres is a candidate for the selection process. It's not for him to comment on other people who may want to come forward."This is a process run by Member States. So, I'm not aware of any issues or problems with that….I speak for the incumbent candidate, but we have no comment on anyone else who may wish to put their hat in the proverbial ring,” Dujarric said.The spokesperson for UN General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir, Brenden Varma was asked at the press briefing whether Akanksha had written to the President on her candidacy.Varma said the President’s office had not received any formal communications on this matter.Varma had earlier said that so far the General Assembly President had not received any notifications of candidacies for the position of Secretary-General from Member States.He added that candidates have traditionally been presented by Member States.In the video, Akanksha adds that it is time that the UN stop serving politicians and start serving people.“It is time for a new UN - a UN that is a guardian for refugees, takes humanitarian crises through to completion and gets technology and education in the hands of all.”She said these ideas are not impossible and don’t need another 75 years to accomplish.“It takes someone being bold, being a first - first to speak up, first to take action, first to make a difference and now first to challenge the UN.

13-02-2021||World||Anger over arrests in Myanmar at anti-coup protests||Opponents of Myanmar's military coup sustained mass protests for an eighth straight day on Saturday as continuing arrests of junta critics added to anger over the detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Thousands assembled in the business hub, Yangon, while protesters took to the streets of the capital Naypyitaw, the second city Mandalay and other towns a day after the biggest protests so far in the Southeast Asian country."Stop kidnapping at night," was among the signs held up by protesters in Yangon in response to arrest raids in recent days.The United Nations human rights office said on Friday more than 350 people, including officials, activists and monks, have been arrested in Myanmar since the Feb. 1 coup, including some who face criminal charges on "dubious grounds".Anger in Myanmar has been fueled by videos showing more arrests of government critics - including a doctor who was part of the civil disobedience movement. Some arrests have taken place during the hours of darkness.Internet memes captioned "Our nights aren't safe anymore" and "Myanmar military is kidnapping people at night" have circulated widely on social media.The government did not respond to requests for comment on the arrests.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog group for political prisoners, voiced concern."Family members are left with no knowledge of the charges, location, or condition of their loved ones. These are not isolated incidents, and nighttime raids are targeting dissenting voices. It is happening across the country," it said in a statement.The army said it had seized power because of alleged fraud in a November election that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party had won in a landslide. The army's complaints were dismissed by Myanmar's electoral commission.TRANSITION HALTEDThe coup halted a tentative transition to democracy that began in 2011 after nearly half a century of isolation and stagnation under military juntas.Suu Kyi, for decades the standard bearer of the fight for democracy in Myanmar, faces charges of illegally importing and using six walkie-talkie radios found in a search of her house.The 47-member U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on Friday calling on Myanmar to release Suu Kyi and other officials from detention and refrain from using violence on protesters.Thomas Andrews, the U.N. rights investigator for Myanmar, told a special session of the rights council in Geneva that the U.N. Security Council should consider imposing sanctions and arms embargoes.Myint Thu, Myanmar’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the session that Myanmar did not want "to stall the nascent democratic transition in the country," and would continue international cooperation.The United States this week began imposing sanctions on the ruling generals and some businesses linked to them.Airline staff, health workers, engineers and school teachers were among groups that joined the protest marches on Saturday and which have rallied to a civil disobedience campaign that has shut down a swath of government business."We are preschool teachers, Every child our future, We don’t want dictatorship," said one banner.The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said thousands of people had joined pro-military demonstrations in parts of Myanmar on Friday. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report.The junta remitted the sentences of more than 23,000 prisoners on Friday, saying the move was consistent with "establishing a new democratic state with peace, development and discipline" and would "please the public".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anger-over-arrests-in-myanmar-at-anti-coup-protests-101613194874239.html
13-02-2021||World||As impeachment trial ends, GOP senators face big decision||Most every Senate juror has said they will listen to the evidence in Donald Trump’s historic second impeachment trial, but most minds were likely made up before the trial began. Democrats would need a minimum of 17 Republicans to vote with them to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection, and that appears unlikely.Still, Democrats say they are holding out hope that they will win over enough Republicans to convict the former president for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, in which five people died. If Trump were convicted, the Senate could take a second vote to ban him from running for office again. A final vote is likely on Saturday.Here's a look at the Republicans whom Democrats are eyeing as they make final arguments in the case:THE FREQUENT TRUMP CRITICSRepublican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine have been clear that they believe Trump incited the riots on Jan. 6. While none of them are locks to vote for conviction, they have joined with Democrats twice to vote against GOP efforts to dismiss the trial.Collins said after the riots that Trump does “bear responsibility for working up the crowd and inciting this mob.” Murkowski called on Trump to resign after the attack on the Capitol, telling a local paper three days later that “I want him out. He has caused enough damage.”Romney tweeted on Jan. 6: “What happened at the U.S. Capitol today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States.” During the trial, the Democrats showed video of Romney narrowly escaping the mob, redirected by a Capitol Police officer as he unknowingly ran toward the violent crowd.Sasse said that Trump had “lied to” Americans and the “consequences are now found in five dead Americans and a Capitol building that’s in shambles.” In a recent video, he said Republican politics shouldn’t be about the “weird worship of one dude.”Murkowski, Collins and Sasse voted to acquit Trump during his first impeachment trial, in which Democrats charged that he had abused his power by urging the president of Ukraine to investigate then-candidate Joe Biden. Romney was the sole GOP guilty vote, leaving the Democrats far short of conviction.HEADED OUTPennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who is retiring from the Senate in 2022, has also voted twice with Democrats to move forward with the trial. Like Murkowski, he called for Trump’s resignation after the riots, saying that would be the best way to “get this person in the rearview mirror for us.” Toomey had also aggressively pushed back on Trump’s false assertions that he had won Pennsylvania and other states in the election.Three other GOP senators have said they will not run again in two years, potentially freeing them up to vote against Trump and anger base voters in the party – Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby. All three voted to dismiss the trial, but Portman says he still has an open mind about conviction.Burr said on Thursday that he would not comment on the trial at all. Shelby said this week that the impeachment managers had a “strong point” that Trump could have acted sooner to stop the violence, but maintained that the trial is unconstitutional because Trump is now out of office.CASSIDY AS WILD CARDLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who won re-election by a large margin in 2020, voted two weeks ago for a GOP effort to dismiss the trial. But he switched his vote this week, saying Trump’s lawyers had done a “terrible” job making the case that the trial was unconstitutional.Cassidy, who has been taking extensive notes throughout the trial, said Friday that the managers had raised some “intriguing questions” during their two days of arguments. He said that he hoped Trump’s lawyers would answer them thoroughly and that he is “trying to approach it objectively.”During the trial's question and answer session on Friday afternoon, Cassidy asked Trump's lawyers about a conversation the then-president had with Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville on Jan. 6 just after Vice President Mike Pence had been evacuated from the Senate. Tuberville says he told Trump that Pence had been whisked away, making clear that Trump likely knew of the danger at that point, even though he tweeted criticism of Pence after that for not trying to overturn the election. Cassidy asked the lawyers if that showed Trump "was tolerant of the intimidation of Vice President Pence?”Lawyer Michael van der Veen dismissed Tuberville's account as “hearsay," an answer that Cassidy later said was not sufficient.THUNE TAKES HEAT FROM TRUMPSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, dismissed Trump’s attempts to challenge the certification of President Biden's election victory. He predicted the effort would “go down like a shot dog″ in the Senate.That comment drew a furious response from the former president, who urged Gov. Kristi Noem to run against Thune in a GOP primary, an idea she immediately rejected.Still, Thune has voted twice to dismiss the case. He said Friday that he was keeping an open mind and indicated he could be open to a censure resolution if Trump is acquitted.“I know a couple of my colleagues who’ve seen a couple of resolutions, at least, that I think could attract some support,” Thune said.EYES ON McCONNELLSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has twice voted to dismiss the trial, indicating he will ultimately vote to acquit. But he has also said that Trump “provoked” the mob, which was “fed lies.”Soon after the attack, McConnell privately told associates he was done with Trump and said publicly he was undecided on impeachment. He has told Republicans the decision on Trump's guilt is a vote of conscience.His neutral stand is in sharp contrast to his management of the first trial, when he largely protected Trump and pushed back against Democrats’ pleas to call witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-impeachment-trial-ends-gop-senators-face-big-decision-101613194105543.html

13-02-2021||World||Israel sits on Moderna Covid-19 vaccines after signing Pfizer data accord||While countries around the world scramble for coronavirus vaccines, Israel has so many shots that it’s keeping its Moderna Inc. supply on hold.And it’s doing so while under fire for not inoculating the millions of Palestinians under its control.Vaccine supply has outstripped demand in the world’s leading inoculator per capita, which has contracted to receive millions of doses from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE in exchange for extensive data on the country’s vaccine rollout. People under 50 have been less eager than their older compatriots to line up for a shot, so the pace of vaccination has slowed, with 40% of the country’s 9.3 million people having received a first inoculation.Thanks to steady Pfizer shipments, much of the only delivery from Moderna, totaling around 100,000 doses, remains in cold storage, according to Eli Gilad, a senior Health Ministry official working on the coronavirus.“The amount of Moderna in Israel is very small” and it isn’t worth putting another vaccine into circulation when the country is using millions of Pfizer doses, Gilad said.The Moderna supply -- which was delivered in January and can remain in longer-term storage for six months -- will eventually be used and there hasn’t been any change to expected shipments, Gilad said. Guidelines for the vaccine’s use haven’t been issued, said Avi Levin, who manages the Tel Aviv vaccine complex for Israel’s largest healthcare provider, Clalit Health Services.Israel is also postponing receipt of the supply it’s allotted through a World Health Organization-backed program, an Israeli official said on condition of anonymity to discuss vaccine strategy.Two thousand Moderna doses were transferred to the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority to inoculate medical workers, with an additional 3,000 planned. But for the most part, Israel is brushing off calls to provide vaccines for Palestinians.Some officials and advocacy groups say Israel has a responsibility or interest in inoculating the millions of Palestinians under its control.“The argument that you cannot afford to give the Palestinians doesn’t hold anymore,” said Zvi Bentwich, a board member of Physicians for Human Rights - Israel. The unused Moderna doses, he said, “reinforce that argument.”But even a program to vaccinate Palestinians who work in Israel isn’t in the offing yet, according to Israel Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch.While Moderna and Pfizer both use similar technology and demonstrated near-identical results, there are small differences. The interval between Pfizer shots is three weeks compared to four for Moderna, and Moderna’s vaccine is easier to store and transport, while Pfizer’s requires ultra-cold temperatures.The minor discrepancies shouldn’t deter Israel from using Moderna, said Eli Waxman, a physicist leading a team advising Israel’s national security council.“The most important thing is to get as many vaccines as we can -- Moderna, Pfizer -- and get people vaccinated,” Waxman said. “I believe that they would be able to handle such a modification without great difficulty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-sits-on-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-after-signing-pfizer-data-accord-101613188936050.html

Candidates will be tested first for the coronavirus, a senior DHS official who asked not to be identified told reporters.At least 70,000 people were returned to Mexico under the agreement from January 2019, when the program began to be implemented, through December 2020, according to the NGO American Immigration Council.US authorities emphasized that they are working closely with the Mexican government and with international organizations and NGOs at the border.DHS chief Alejandro Mayorkas, who is the first Latino and the first immigrant to head the department, stressed that Washington is committed to "rebuilding a safe, orderly and humane immigration system.""This latest action is another step in our commitment to reform immigration policies that do not align with our nation's values," Mayorkas said in a statement.The program was part of Trump's hardline plan to fight illegal immigration, one of the hallmarks of his administration and which included efforts to build a border wall and the policy which separated children from thousands of migrant families.After Biden took office on January 20, his administration announced that it would reverse the most controversial measures and created a task force to reunite families that remain separated, a policy his administration has termed a "national shame."On the day Biden was inaugurated, the DHS announced the suspension of new registrations in the "Remain in Mexico" program and asked all those enrolled to stay where they are while waiting to be informed about their cases.Washington said Friday that those waiting "should not approach the border until instructed to do so."In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, at his press briefing, welcomed Biden's move.Lopez Obrador said he hoped to discuss with Biden a work visa program for Mexicans and Central Americans."Their presence as workers in the United States" is vital to the US economy, Lopez Obrador said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-begins-dismantling-trump-s-remain-in-mexico-asylum-policy-101613183717686.html

13-02-2021||World||New York calls NRA bankruptcy dismissal, cites bad faith||The New York attorney general called for the dismissal of the National Rifle Association’s bankruptcy, alleging it was filed to escape state oversight.The case is improper because the NRA has openly stated that the gun rights organization is “in its strongest financial condition in years,” New York said in a filing Friday in bankruptcy court in Texas. The Chapter 11 was also brought in bad faith to avoid New York’s lawsuit seeking to dissolve it, the state said.The NRA is “essentially fleeing or seeking an end run around a pending regulatory enforcement action in New York,” the state said in the filing. The lawsuit filed last year by New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges the NRA diverted charitable donations for years to enrich the organization’s top executives in violation of laws governing non profits.“The filing is another transparent move in a partisan crusade to shut down the NRA,” said William A. Brewer III, a lawyer for the NRA. He denied that the group is trying to avoid New York’s lawsuit. “As the Association has said repeatedly, it welcomes the opportunity to litigate these contrived claims and the motives which led to their filing.”The state in its filings also took aim at NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, who it claims fleeced the gun rights organization. LaPierre has disputed New York’s allegations.LaPierre, who was among the signers of the group’s bankruptcy petition, “is accused of looting the NRA, yet he has made the determination and signed the petitions in an effort to use the bankruptcy court to remove the NRA from regulatory oversight,” the state said in its filings.In the filing, New York highlighted allegedly improper spending over the years, including LaPierre’s reimbursement between 2013 and 2017 for more than $1.2 million in expenses, including more than $65,000 for Christmas gifts from the executive, $800 in mosquito control treatments outside his home for “security purposes” and membership fees for Susan LaPierre for the Shikar Safari Club International, “which cost thousands of dollars annually.”The NRA is now facing a host of challenges to its bankruptcy. On Wednesday, ad agency Ackerman McQueen Inc. made similar claims of bad faith and ask that the case be tossed out. The NRA and the ad agency have been locked in a complex legal battle that began in 2019.Earlier this week, a former director for the NRA called for an investigation into fraud allegations made against the NRA in the New York lawsuit. Phillip Journey, a Kansas judge and former state legislator, asked the NRA’s bankruptcy judge to appoint an independent investigator to determine the truth of claims.Read More: NRA Foe Seeks Dismissal of Bankruptcy, Citing Bad FaithThe NRA has said the bankruptcy filing will allow it to reincorporate in Texas, free from the “corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York.” But in its court filings, New York points to state law that gives it broad control over the structure of charities incorporated there -- like the NRA.The state asked that a court-appointed trustee take control of the NRA if its bankruptcy judge won’t toss the case.Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, is a donor to candidates and groups that support gun control, including Everytown for Gun Safety.The case is National Rifle Association of America, 21-30085, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-calls-nra-bankruptcy-dismissal-cites-bad-faith-101613180613716.html
13-02-2021||World||Pompeo calls on Biden administration to confront China 'head-on' like Trump||Former US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Friday (local time) said that US President Joe Biden's administration has to confront China 'head-on' in the same way the previous Donald Trump-led administration had done."For 50 years, the United States allowed the Chinese Communist Party to walk all over us, destroyed millions of jobs here, they stole intellectual property. They infiltrated our research institutions. All of this was, frankly, under Republican and Democratic presidents alike," Pompeo said in a programme by Fox News.He further opined that Biden's promise of protecting Americans from China only matters to the extent that the administration is prepared to back it up."When they were spying on us from a consulate in Houston, we closed it. When they were engaging in trade practices that were unfair, we put tariffs on them. Every place in our livelihoods, our administration took it on. That's what they need to do," Fox News quoted Pompeo.He further urged the importance of the Biden administration to address the Chinese threat."... I spent two-and-a-half-years both here in the United States talking to governors right there, working at the state level. I went out to the Wisconsin legislature, they're trying to influence our state legislatures," said the former State Secretary.Pompeo's statements come after Biden on Thursday underscored about the crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang during his first conversation with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.The US President also underlined Beijing's coercive and unfair economic practices and military aggression actions in the region, including toward Taiwan.The ties between the two countries had deteriorated under the Trump administration, over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Hong Kong protests, unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China's military aggression in various parts of the world, including Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-calls-on-biden-administration-to-confront-china-head-on-like-trump-101613178610979.html
13-02-2021||World||Biden to slowly allow 25,000 people seeking asylum into US||The Biden administration on Friday announced plans for tens of thousands of people who are seeking asylum and have been forced to wait in Mexico under a Trump-era policy to be allowed into the U.S. while their cases wind through immigration courts.The first wave of an estimated 25,000 asylum-seekers with active cases in the “Remain in Mexico" program will be allowed into the United States on Feb. 19, authorities said. They plan to start slowly, with two border crossings each processing up to 300 people a day and a third crossing taking fewer numbers.President Joe Biden's administration declined to publicly identify the three crossings out of fear it may encourage a rush of people, but U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, said officials told him that they are Brownsville and El Paso in Texas, and San Diego's San Ysidro crossing.The move is a major step toward dismantling one of former President Donald Trump's most consequential policies to deter asylum-seekers from coming to the U.S. About 70,000 asylum-seekers were enrolled in the program officially called Migrant Protection Protocols since it was introduced in January 2019.On Biden's first day in office, the Homeland Security Department suspended the policy for new arrivals. Since then, some asylum-seekers picked up at the border have been released in the U.S. with notices to appear in court.Biden is quickly making good on a campaign promise to end the policy, which the Trump administration said was critical to reversing a surge of asylum-seekers that peaked in 2019. But the policy also exposed people to violence in Mexican border cities and made it extremely difficult for them to find lawyers and communicate with courts about their cases.“As President Biden has made clear, the U.S. government is committed to rebuilding a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. “This latest action is another step in our commitment to reform immigration policies that do not align with our nation’s values.”Asylum-seekers will be released with notices to appear in court in cities close to or in their final destinations, typically with family, administration officials said.Homeland Security said the move “should not be interpreted as an opening for people to migrate irregularly to the United States.” Administration officials say the vast majority of people who cross the border illegally are quickly expelled under a public health order that Trump put in place in March amid the coronavirus pandemic. But some asylum-seeking families have been released in Texas and California, working against that messaging.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that she was concerned limited releases in the U.S. may encourage others to cross illegally.“We don’t want people to put themselves in danger at a time where it is not the right time to come, because we have not had time to put in place a humane and moral system and process,” she said.Court hearings for people enrolled in “Remain in Mexico” have been suspended since June because of the pandemic. Getting word to them about when to report to the border for release in the United States may prove a daunting job.Homeland Security said it would soon announce a “virtual registration process” online and by phone for people to learn where and when they should report. It urged asylum-seekers not to report to the border unless instructed.The International Organization for Migration will help with logistics and test asylum-seekers for Covid-19 before they enter the U.S., spokeswoman Liz Lizama said. The U.N. migration agency's Mexico director, Dana Graber Ladek, said last month that it would seek to inform and support asylum-seekers on any changes in the “Remain in Mexico” policy.Roberta Jacobson, coordinator for the southwest border on the White House National Security Council, said asylum-seekers who have been waiting the longest will get priority, along with people deemed more vulnerable due to their health or threats to their safety.The announcement provides no relief to people whose cases were dismissed or denied, and Jacobson told Spanish-language media that the administration was still considering how to address any cases beyond those that are active. Advocates argue that communication problems, including lack of working addresses in Mexico, caused some people to miss hearings and lose their cases as a result.Mexico agreed to take back more asylum-seekers in June 2019 to defuse Trump's threats of tariff increases. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador welcomed Biden's changes, saying at a news conference Friday that it would be “good” for the U.S. to host them instead while their cases wind through the system.The Remain in Mexico releases will come as more people are getting stopped crossing the border illegally since Biden took office, challenging the administration in its early days.Raul Ortiz, deputy chief of the Border Patrol, said Tuesday that more than 3,000 people had been stopped in each of the previous 10 days, compared with a daily average of 2,426 in January.About 50 to 80 adults and children have been arriving daily since Jan. 27 at Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, which temporarily houses people released by the Border Patrol, said Sister Norma Pimentel, the group’s executive director. The charity tests for Covid-19 and sends anyone who tests positive to a hotel for isolation.Jewish Family Service of San Diego housed 191 asylum-seekers the first 10 days of February after they were released, up from 144 in January and 54 in December, said Eitan Peled, the group’s border services advocate. They are quarantined in hotels for 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-slowly-allow-25-000-people-seeking-asylum-into-us-101613178087975.html
13-02-2021||World||Andrew Cuomo administration 'froze' over nursing home data requests||New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's top aide told Democratic lawmakers that the administration took months to release data revealing how many people living at nursing homes died of Covid-19 because officials “froze” over worries the information was “going to be used against us."Republicans who term the comment admission of a “cover-up” are now calling for investigations into and the resignations of both Cuomo and the aide, secretary to the governor Melissa DeRosa. And a growing number of Democrats are joining calls to rescind Cuomo's emergency executive powers, blasting the administration's defense of its secrecy.“To continual defenders of NY Gov. Cuomo how is this ok?" New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, a Democrat, tweeted. “How is it not #Trump like? And when FORCED into admission, the most you get is a sorry we got caught...and not even directly from him or to the families.”The disclosure of DeRosa’s comments, made on a Wednesday conference call with Democratic legislative leaders, came as the Democratic governor — a third-term Democrat who says he'll run again in 2022 and penned a book touting his handling of the pandemic — and his administration were already facing backlash over their handling and reporting of outbreaks in nursing homes.Cuomo refused for months to release data on how the pandemic has hit nursing home residents, instead pointing to figures more favorable to his administration. Experts say the release of more — and accurate — data can shape policy to help save people’s lives.“These are people’s parents and grandparents,” Fordham University political science professor Christina Greer said. “They’re people. We should be more specific. Cooking the books on the data isn’t just about nursing homes, it’s about numbers of people infected and possibly dead.”In recent weeks, a court order and state attorney general report has forced the state to acknowledge the nursing home resident death toll is nearly 15,000, when it previously reported 8,500 — a number that excluded residents who died after being taken to hospitals. The new toll amounts to about one-seventh of the people living in nursing homes as of 2019 in New York.Since last spring, news outlets, lawmakers and the public have asked the Cuomo administration for data about Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents. On Aug. 3, lawmakers asked state health Commissioner Howard Zucker for the number of nursing home residents who died in hospitals.By mid-August, then-President Donald Trump began retweeting comments criticizing Cuomo for his administration’s response on nursing home deaths. On Aug. 26, the Department of Justice gave Cuomo's administration 14 days to provide data on nursing home deaths.“Basically, we froze because then we were in a position where we weren’t sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice or what we give to you guys and what we start saying was going to be used against us, and we weren’t sure if there was going to be an investigation,” DeRosa told the Democratic leaders in comments were first reported by The New York Post.“That played a very large role into this,” she added, saying the administration had asked legislative leaders whether it could “pause on getting back to everybody until we get through this period and we know what’s what with the DOJ.”Cuomo’s office provided a partial call recording to The Associated Press, but declined to say where it obtained it or allow its publication.DeRosa didn’t directly respond to a question from the AP about whether New York was withholding data from state lawmakers to avoid it being used in any Justice Department investigation.DeRosa issued a statement Friday saying the administration told legislative leaders in September that it had to set aside lawmakers’ August request to deal with the Justice Department's request first. Cuomo's office didn't respond to the AP's question Friday about when it fulfilled the federal data request.“We were comprehensive and transparent in our responses to the DOJ, and then had to immediately focus our resources on the second wave and vaccine rollout,” the news release said, adding that the administration was “committed to being better partners going forward.”Cuomo administration officials have also said they needed months to verify deaths outside nursing homes.Still, it remains unclear why New York couldn’t provide data that nearly every other state publishes to lawmakers and the Justice Department at the same time, and later correct it if needed.The state Department of Health initially released data about all deaths of nursing home residents, regardless of location. The administration stopped as of May 3, when New York became one of at least two states to only release the number of deaths that took place at nursing homes.Lawmakers at Wednesday's conference call said they still don't buy the Cuomo's administrations' reasons for delay. They spent the first hour of the call taking state health officials to task for the delay, according to Assemblymember Ron Kim, a Queens Democrat.“We were all frustrated at the excuses; there was one after another,” Kim said.Richard Gottfried, the Assembly health chair representing Manhattan who also attended Wednesday's meeting, said he and other lawmakers also requested nursing home data in June. He called the entire meeting, including DeRosa's comments, “very disturbing."“They weren’t releasing data from the investigation,” he said. “It’s not the sort of thing they would make up. I don't think the state’s explanation is acceptable."When asked whether lawmakers would subpoena the Cuomo administration, he said, “I don’t think the New York Legislature is well organized for conducting investigations."He noted state Attorney General Letitia James' team has done a good job in an ongoing investigation that, among other things, correctly estimated that far more nursing home residents died of Covid-19.James' spokesperson didn't respond to request for comment Friday.Kim called for legislative action to protect vulnerable residents, including repealing immunity for nursing homes, launching a victims compensation fund and authorizing a bipartisan commission with subpoena power to investigate COVID-19 outbreaks at long-term care homes.“If you make a mistake, issue a public apology for a change, that would make a big difference,” Kim said.Kim said after DeRosa's comments, staffers and lawmakers listening in on the call began texting each other asking: “Oh crap, did she just incriminate herself?”But Kim said while he supports reducing Cuomo's emergency powers, he doesn't back ousting DeRosa because it wouldn't “resolve the institutional problems the administration caused over the last 10 months.”“There was a lot of trust that was lost,” Kim said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/andrew-cuomo-administration-froze-over-nursing-home-data-requests-101613177053060.html
13-02-2021||World||UN rights body adopts watered-down text on Myanmar coup||GENEVA (AP) — The U.N.'s top human rights body passed a consensus resolution Friday urging military leaders in Myanmar to immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian government leaders detained after a military coup, while watering down an initial draft text amid pressure led by China and Russia.In a special session at the Human Rights Council, the original resolution presented by Britain and the European Union was revised to remove calls to bolster the ability of a U.N. rights expert to scrutinize Myanmar and for restraint from the country's military.After the updated resolution passed with no opposition, Chinese Ambassador Chen Xu thanked the sponsors for “adopting our recommendations” but said China still was distancing itself from the measure.The sponsors of council resolutions often agree to soften the language of their texts in order to win consensus and to show that the 47-member body is united on thorny human rights issues.The council has no power to impose sanctions but can train a political spotlight on rights abuses and violations. The session came shortly after the Biden administration, which has already imposed sanctions on top leaders of the Myanmar coup, revived U.S. participation in the Human Rights Council, which the Trump administration pulled the country out of in 2018.U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric called the resolution’s adoption “a very important step” that shows “the international community will speak strongly ... in calling for a reversal of the events we’ve seen in Myanmar, and for the full respect of the democratic will of the people of Myanmar as well as full respect of their human rights.”“The disproportionate use of force, the use of live ammunition -- those are all unacceptable,” Dujarric stressed.China and Russia faulted attempts to politicize the Myanmar situation in Myanmar and called it a domestic matter. Many Western countries, the U.N. rights office and others decried the coup and state of emergency.“The seizure of power by the Myanmar military earlier this month constitutes a profound setback for the country after a decade of hard-won gains in its democratic transition,” Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada al-Nashif said. “The world is watching.”The resolution called for the “immediate and unconditional release" of Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint and other top government officials, for the lifting of internet restrictions, and for the military to respect peaceful assembly and refrain from "excessive force against the public.”But the revised text excised a call on U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, to give the independent U.N. special rapporteur on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, “increased assistance, resources and expertise" to carry out his job.“We need real action from the United Nations,” said Andrews, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, citing information that the junta had detained 220 government officials and civil society members.“The message from the people of Myanmar to all of you and to the people of the world is clear: This cannot stand,” he said. Andrews has been seeking the right to visit Myanmar, which its government has denied.Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said in a video message his country would suspend "all direct development cooperation with the now illegitimate government” but “continue to support the civil society of Myanmar.”The U.S. charge d'affaires in Geneva, Mark Cassayre, urged Myanmar's military to return power to the democratically elected government, and invited other countries to “join us in promoting accountability for those responsible for the coup, including through targeted sanctions.”John Fisher, Geneva director for advocacy group Human Rights Watch, said: “Myanmar’s military should heed the clear warning messages, immediately release those they have wrongfully detained and end their abusive power grab, or face tougher consequences from the international community.”The Feb. 1 coup led by Min Aung Hlaing ousted Nobel laureate Suu Kyi from power and prevented recently elected lawmakers from opening a new session of Parliament. It reversed nearly a decade of progress toward democracy following 50 years of military rule and has led to widespread protests.The military says it was forced to step in because Suu Kyi’s government failed to properly investigate allegations of fraud in November elections. The election commission has said there is no evidence to support those claims.Wearing a mask in a nearly empty hall at the U.N. Geneva amid the coronavirus pandemic, Myanmar's ambassador, Myint Thu, largely gave general commitments from his country, such as helping internally displaced people or fighting Covid-19. He took office in October under Suu Kyi’s government, but justified the military's actions.“In light of the post-election irregularities and following complex situation, Tatmadaw was compelled to take the state responsibility in accordance with the state constitution,” the ambassador said, using the term for Myanmar's military.“Myanmar is undergoing the complex — extremely complex — challenges and delicate transition," he said. "We do not want to stall our nascent democratic transition in the country.”Russia and China, among a few others including Belarus, said they opposed attempts to make a human rights case of the situation in Myanmar, calling it a domestic matter.“Attempts to whip hype around the situation in Myanmar need to cease," said Gennadiy Gatilov, the Russian ambassador in Geneva.Sudan’s ambassador, Ali Ibn Abi Talib Abdelrahman Mahmoud, reminded the council of other concerns about rights in Myanmar — namely abuses against Rohingya Muslims, who fled a violent military crackdown by the hundreds of thousands into neighboring Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-body-adopts-watered-down-text-on-myanmar-coup-101613176491192.html
13-02-2021||World||Biden administration to launch review of Guantanamo Bay prison||Washington [US], February 13 (ANI): US President Joe Biden's administration on Friday (local time)will launch a review of Guantanamo Bay Military Base prison in Cuba with the goal of shuttering the facility, the White House."Well, that (closure of prison) certainly is our goal and our intention, and we are three weeks in. I realized at a certain point, I can't say that anymore, but we are still just three and a half weeks in. We are undertaking an NSC process, which is how it should work, to work with the inter-agency, I should say, to assess the current state of play that the Biden administration has inherited from the previous administration," said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki during a press briefing.She further said: "I would note that in order to see this process through completely and thoroughly, there are a number of key policy roles that still need to be filled within the inter-agency, including sub-cabinet policy roles, at Defense State and the Justice Department, because there are many players from different agencies who need to be a part of this policy discussion about the steps forward."The prison was opened during the George W Bush administration to hold foreign terror suspects following the terror attacks on September 11, 2001. The prison housed around 800 prisoners at its peak, but the population was whittled down substantially under former President Barack Obama, reported The Hill.Obama sought to close the prison but was unable to do so during his term as Republicans opposed the effort and Congress blocked Obama from closing the prison in defense legislation.Obama's successor Donald Trump reversed those plans, signing a directive in 2018 keeping the military prison open. However, he expressed unease at the cost of detaining prisoners at the prison the following year, however, after The New York Times reported that it cost more than USD 540 million to keep the detention facility running.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-launch-review-of-guantanamo-bay-prison-101613176225985.html

13-02-2021||World||'I am a child!' Pepper spray reflects policing of Black kids||The 9-year-old Black girl sat handcuffed in the backseat of a police car, distraught and crying for her father as the white officers grew increasingly impatient while they tried to wrangle her fully into the vehicle.“This is your last chance,” one officer warned. “Otherwise pepper spray is going in your eyeballs.”Less than 90 seconds later, the girl had been sprayed and was screaming, “Please, wipe my eyes! Wipe my eyes, please!”What started with a report of “family trouble” in Rochester, New York, and ended with police treating a fourth-grader like a crime suspect, has spurred outrage as the latest example of law enforcement mistreatment of Black people.As the U.S. undergoes a new reckoning on police brutality and racial injustice in the wake of George Floyd's death last May, the girl's treatment illustrates how even young children are not exempt.Research shows Black children are often viewed as being older than they are, and are more likely to be seen as threatening or dangerous. Advocates have long said that leads to police treating them in ways they wouldn’t dream of treating white children. In some cases it has led to fatalities like the killing of Tamir Rice, a Black 12-year-old shot by a white police officer in Cleveland in 2014.“Black children have never been given their opportunity to be children,” said Kristin Henning, law professor and director of the Juvenile Justice Clinic and Initiative at Georgetown Law.A study published in the journal Pediatrics in late 2020 found Black children and teenagers were six times as likely to die from police gunfire as white children. It analyzed data from police use of force in situations involving young people between the ages of 12 and 17 from 2003 to 2018.“Black children have really been seen as older, more culpable, less amenable to rehabilitation and less worthy of the Western notions of innocence and the Western notions of childhood,” Henning said.The headlines from Rochester were deeply personal for Mando Avery, whose 7-year-old son was hit by pepper spray from a police officer aiming at someone else during a protest in Seattle last summer. The spray left his son's face and chest painful and swollen from chemical burns for several days, and even required a visit to the emergency room.He has since had nightmares and now fears police. Small things can bring back bad memories, like using a spray bottle to do his hair.“Their innocence goes away much, much sooner,” Avery said. “What kind of temper tantrum leads to handcuffing a child?”In the Rochester case, the girl's mother called police on Jan. 29 after an argument with her spouse and said she asked officers to call mental health services when her daughter grew increasingly upset.But police body camera video shows only officers at the scene, first handcuffing the girl's hands behind her back and then growing increasingly impatient as they tried to get her into the police car, culminating in the pepper spray.There's a point in the video when an officer says, “You're acting like a child!” to which the girl replies, “I am a child!”The officers have been suspended pending an investigation. More video footage released Thursday showed the wait until an ambulance arrived for the girl.The case comes months after the high-profile death last spring of Daniel Prude, a Black man undergoing a mental health crisis when his family called the Rochester police. Officers handcuffed him, then put a hood over his head when he spit at them. As he struggled, they pinned him face down on the ground, one officer pushing his head to the pavement until he stopped breathing.The 9-year-old girl's mother, Elba Pope, told The Associated Press she didn’t think the white officers saw her daughter the same way they would have seen a white child.“Had they looked at her as if she was one of their children, they wouldn’t have pepper sprayed her,” she said.Henning agreed. “This is where the question of race comes into play,” she said. “If that child had looked like one of their little girls, looked like the little child that they tucked into bed, it is far less likely that they would have done that.”The president of the Rochester police union has said the officers didn't lack compassion but were dealing with a difficult situation with limited resources and were following department protocol.New York isn't the only place where police treatment of Black children has been a flashpoint.In suburban Denver, four Black girls aged 6 to 17 were detained by police at gunpoint after they were wrongly suspected of being in a stolen car last year.One officer tried to handcuff the 6-year-old, who was wearing a tiara for what was supposed to be a girls day out with her relatives, but the cuffs were too big, according to a lawsuit filed by the family.In North Texas, a white police officer was recorded on video pushing a swimsuit-clad Black girl to the ground at a pool party in 2015. Later that year, a sheriff’s deputy at a school in South Carolina flipped a girl to the floor and dragged her across a classroom after she refused to surrender her cellphone in math class.In Tamir Rice's case, the 12-year-old was playing with a pellet gun in November 2014 when Cleveland police responding to a call pulled up and within seconds, shot him. When his 14-year-old-sister ran to the scene, she was pushed to the ground and handcuffed. The officers were not indicted.It's that history that makes Christian Gibbs, a Black father of three daughters, grateful the girl in Rochester wasn't more grievously injured — and angered that's even a worry.“Thank God she wasn’t killed. ... And the fact that we have to say that is already an indictment of the type of treatment that we expect to be doled out, even to little children,” said Gibbs, 46, of Bowie, Maryland.Holly M. Frye, of South Ogden, Utah, said she has near-daily conversations with her three children about how to act around police officers, the same kind of conversations her parents had with her.“This sort of aggression toward the Black race has always been in existence, it’s just being recorded now,” she said. “It’s a topic that never leaves our kitchen table, we’re always constantly talking about it.”While data is scarce on very young children's interactions with police, Black youths are nearly five times as likely to be incarcerated compared with white young people, according to an analysis by the nonprofit The Sentencing Project.The incarceration rate for white youth is 83 per 100,000; for Black youths that number jumps to 383, The Sentencing Project found. While that is partly due to differences in offending, studies have found teenagers of color are more likely to be arrested and more likely to face severe consequences compared with their white peers, the report said.And it's not just policing and the criminal justice system. Black students face higher rates of suspension and expulsion from school, said Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project, which fights against structural racism.It's “the way that our Black children are questioned by adults, with this underlying assumption that they are not to be believed, and they’re not to be trusted, and that they’re always up to something wrong,” she said.That leads to trauma and mistrust on the part of Black youth toward the authorities around them, she said.“There is no ‘Officer Friendly' for Black kids,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-am-a-child-pepper-spray-reflects-policing-of-black-kids-101613169989630.html
13-02-2021||World||US CDC recommends schools reopen with masks and rigid health protocols||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued new guidance for US schools to reopen, recommending universal mask-wearing and physical distancing as key Covid-19 mitigation strategies to get children back in the classroom quickly.The guidelines https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/index.html, which also emphasize the need for facility-cleaning, personal hygiene and contact tracing, are intended to give school districts a road map to bring the nation's 55 million public school students back to classrooms without sparking Covid-19 outbreaks."We believe with the strategies we have put forward that there will be limited to no transmission in schools if followed," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters, noting that the CDC was not mandating that schools reopen.The agency also said school reopenings should not be conditional on teachers' access to Covid-19 vaccines, but strongly recommended US states prioritize teachers and school staff for vaccination.President Joe Biden promised to reopen most K-8 schools within 100 days of taking office on Jan. 20. On Sunday, he said the problems arising from the continued closure of schools, including children's mental health struggles and the exodus of parents from the workforce, have amounted to a national emergency.Just 44% of US school districts were offering fully in-person learning as of December and 31% were operating all remotely, according to the Center for Reinventing Public Education, which surveyed 477 of the nation's nearly 13,000 school districts. Other districts have employed a hybrid learning model, where students attend some school days in-person and some virtually.School reopenings have caused labor disputes between teachers unions, who fear for their members' safety, and school districts in major US cities. In Chicago this week, after months of negotiations that included threats of a lock-out and strike, the teachers union and district reached agreement on a safety plan.On Friday, the American Federation of Teachers, which has about 1.7 million members, praised the CDC's guidance for its basis in "facts and evidence.""We urge the CDC to remain flexible as more data comes to light. The guidance is instructive for this moment in time, but this disease is not static," AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement.Flexible approachThe CDC's phased mitigation strategy is intended to be adapted depending on the level of Covid-19 transmission in a school's community.In areas where the Covid-19 positive test rate is below 5% and there were fewer than nine new cases per 100,000 in the last seven days, schools can fully reopen and safely relax social distancing measures as long as masks are worn, Walensky said. In areas of higher transmission, the agency is urging 6 feet (1.83 m) of separation in classrooms and weekly testing of students, teachers and staff.Elementary school students should learn in-person at least part-time even in areas of high transmission, the guidance says.Recent studies have shown that in-person learning has not been associated with increased community transmission, especially in elementary schools.House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy criticized the reopening guidelines on Friday as not bold enough to ensure that students return to classrooms promptly."Families and students deserve better. They need iron-clad assurances that their children will be able to get back into the classroom environment that offers the best education model," McCarthy said in a statement.US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, commended the guidance and said House committees were working to pass Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan legislation, which includes a $130 billion investment that could help schools follow the CDC protocols."Without strong assistance from Congress, our schools cannot afford to enact the science-based safety precautions required," Pelosi said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-recommends-schools-reopen-with-masks-and-rigid-health-protocols-101613168614259.html
13-02-2021||World||Religion and the death penalty collide at the US Supreme Court||The Supreme Court is sending a message to states that want to continue to carry out the death penalty: Inmates must be allowed to have a spiritual adviser by their side as they are executed.The high court around midnight Thursday declined to let Alabama proceed with the lethal injection of Willie B. Smith III. Smith had objected to Alabama's policy that his pastor would have had to observe his execution from an adjacent room rather than the death chamber itself.The order from the high court follows two years in which inmates saw some rare success in bringing challenges based on the issue of chaplains in the death chamber. This time, liberal and conservative members of the court normally in disagreement over death penalty issues found common ground not on the death penalty itself but on the issue of religious freedom and how the death penalty is carried out.Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three justices who said they would have let Smith's execution go forward, said Alabama's policy applies equally to all inmates and serves a state interest in ensuring safety and security. But he said it was apparent that his colleagues who disagreed were providing a path for states to follow.States that want to avoid months or years of litigation over the presence of spiritual advisers “should figure out a way to allow spiritual advisors into the execution room, as other States and the Federal Government have done," he wrote in a dissent joined by Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice Clarence Thomas also would have allowed the execution of Smith, who was sentenced to die for the 1991 murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson in Birmingham.Alabama had up until 2019 allowed a Christian prison chaplain employed by the state to be physically present in the execution chamber if requested by the inmate, but the state changed its policy in response to two earlier Supreme Court cases.Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, says the court's order will most clearly affect states in the Deep South that have active execution chambers. Dunham said most state execution protocols, which set who is present in the death chamber, do not mention spiritual advisers. For most of the modern history of the U.S. death penalty since the 1970s, spiritual advisers have not been present in execution chambers, he said.The federal government, which under President Donald Trump resumed federal executions following a 17-year hiatus and carried out 13 executions, allowed a spiritual adviser to be present in the death chamber. The Biden administration is still weighing how it will proceed in death penalty cases.The court's order in Smith's case contained only statements from Kavanaugh and Justice Elena Kagan.“Willie Smith is sentenced to death, and his last wish is to have his pastor with him as he dies,” Kagan wrote for herself and liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, as well as conservative Amy Coney Barrett. Kagan added: “Alabama has not carried its burden of showing that the exclusion of all clergy members from the execution chamber is necessary to ensure prison security.”Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Samuel Alito did not make public their views, but at least one or perhaps both of them must have voted with their liberal colleagues to keep Smith's execution on hold.The court's yearslong wrestling with the issue of chaplains in the death chamber began in 2019, when the justices declined to halt the execution of Alabama inmate Domineque Ray. Ray had objected that a Christian chaplain employed by the prison typically remained in the execution chamber during a lethal injection, but the state would not let his imam be present.The next month, however, the justices halted the execution of a Texas inmate, Patrick Murphy, who objected after Texas officials wouldn't allow his Buddhist spiritual adviser in the death chamber. Kavanaugh wrote at the time that states have two choices: Allow all inmates to have a religious adviser of their choice in the execution room or allow that person only in an adjacent viewing room.In response, the Texas prison system changed its policy, allowing only prison security staff into the execution chamber. But in June, the high court kept Texas from executing Ruben Gutierrez after he objected to the new policy.Diana Verm, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which had submitted briefs in two of the spiritual adviser cases, said it was unusual for the court with its conservative majority to halt executions.“You can tell from some of the opinions that the justices don’t like the last-minute nature of execution litigation, but this is an area where they are saying: 'Listen ... religious liberty has to be a part of the process if it’s going to happen," Verm said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religion-and-the-death-penalty-collide-at-the-us-supreme-court-101613168397022.html
13-02-2021||World||Trump impeachment trial: Defense wraps up closing in 3 hours; calls it politically motivated 'witch hunt'||Lawyers for Donald Trump defended him against impeachment Friday by accusing Democrats of waging a campaign of “hatred” against the former president and manipulating his words in the lead-up to the deadly siege of the US Capitol. Their presentation included a blizzard of their own selectively edited fiery comments from Democrats.The Trump legal team characterized the impeachment case as a politically motivated “witch hunt" — an outgrowth, they said, of years of efforts to drive him from office — and they sought to reduce the case to Trump's use of a single word, “fight,” in a speech preceding the Jan. 6 riot. They played dozens of clips showing Democrats, some of them senators now serving as jurors, using the same word to energize supporters in speeches railing against Trump.“You didn't do anything wrong" in using the word, Trump attorney David Schoen told the senators. “But, please, stop the hypocrisy.”Alos Read | ‘He let us down’: Nikki Haley breaks with former boss Donald TrumpThe Trump defense team left out that what Trump was doing in telling his supporters to “fight like hell” was to undermine a national election after every state had verified its results, after the Electoral College had affirmed them and after nearly every election lawsuit filed by Trump and his allies had been rejected in court. Instead, they contended, he was telling the crowd to support primary challenges against his adversaries and to press for sweeping election reform — something he was entitled to do.The case is speeding toward a conclusion and near-certain acquittal, perhaps as soon as Saturday, with Trump's lawyers making an abbreviated presentation that used less than three of their allotted 16 hours. The defense arguments and the quick pivot to the Democrats' own words deflected from the central question of the trial — whether Trump incited the assault on the Capitol — and instead aimed to place impeachment managers and Trump adversaries on the defensive.After a two-day effort by Democrats to sync up Trump's words to the violence that followed, including through raw and emotive video footage, defense lawyers suggested that Democrats have typically engaged in the same overheated rhetoric as Trump.But in trying to draw that equivalency, the defenders minimized Trump's monthslong, efforts to undermine the election results and his urging of followers to do the same. Democrats say that long campaign, rooted in a “big lie,” laid the groundwork for the mob that assembled outside the Capitol and stormed inside. Five people died.Without Trump, who in a speech at a rally preceding the violence told supporters to “fight like hell,” the violence would never have happened, Democrats say.“And so they came, draped in Trump’s flag, and used our flag, the American flag, to batter and to bludgeon," Rep. Madeleine Dean, one of the impeachment managers, said Thursday as she choked back emotion."On Friday, as defense lawyers repeated their own videos over and over, some Democrats chuckled and whispered among themselves as almost all of their faces flashed on the screen. Some passed notes. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal threw up his hands, apparently amused, when his face appeared. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar rolled her eyes. Most Republicans watched intently.During a break, some joked about the videos and others said they were a distraction or a “false equivalence” with Trump's behavior.“Well we heard the word ‘fight' a lot,” said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.Colorado Sen. Michael Bennett said it felt like the lawyers were “erecting straw men to then take them down rather than deal with the facts."“Show me any time that the result was that one of our supporters pulled someone out of the crowd, and then we said, ‘That’s great, good for you,’” said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons.Trump's defenders told senators that Trump was entitled to dispute the 2020 election results and that his doing so did not amount to inciting the violence. They sought to turn the tables on prosecutors by likening the Democrats' questioning of the legitimacy of Trump's 2016 win to his challenge of his election loss. When Trump implored supporters to “fight like hell” on Jan. 6, he was speaking figuratively, they said.“This is ordinarily political rhetoric that is virtually indistinguishable from the language that has been used by people across the political spectrum for hundreds of years,” said Michael van der Veen, another Trump lawyer. “Countless politicians have spoken of fighting for our principles.”The defense team did not dispute the horror of the violence, painstakingly reconstructed by impeachment managers earlier in the week, but said it had been carried out by people who had “hijacked” for their own purposes what was supposed to be a peaceful event and had planned violence before Trump had spoken.“You can't incite what was going to happen,” he said.Acknowledging the reality of the January day is meant to blunt the visceral impact of the House Democrats' case and quickly pivot to what Trump's defenders see as the core — and more winnable — issue of the trial: Whether Trump actually incited the riot. The argument is likely to appeal to Republican senators who want to be seen as condemning the violence but without convicting the president.Anticipating defense efforts to disentangle Trump's rhetoric from the rioters' actions, the impeachment managers spent days trying to fuse them together through a reconstruction of never-been-seen video footage alongside clips of the president's monthslong urging of his supporters to undo the election results.With little hope of conviction by the required two-thirds of the Senate, Democrats on Thursday delivered a graphic case, describing in stark, personal terms the terror they faced that day — some of it in the very Senate chamber where senators now are sitting as jurors. They used security video of rioters searching menacingly for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence, smashing into the building and engaging in bloody, hand-to-hand combat with police.Though defense lawyers sought to boil down the case to single speech, Democrats displayed the many public and explicit instructions Trump gave his supporters well before the White House rally that unleashed the deadly Capitol attack as Congress was certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. And they used the rioters’ own videos and words from Jan. 6 to try to pin responsibility on Trump. “We were invited here,” said one Capitol invader. “Trump sent us,” said another. “He’ll be happy. We’re fighting for Trump.”The prosecutors' goal was to cast Trump not as a bystander but rather as the “inciter in chief” who spread election falsehoods, then encouraged supporters to come challenge the results in Washington and fanned the discontent with rhetoric about fighting and taking back the country.The Democrats also are demanding that he be barred from holding future federal office.Trump's lawyers say that goal only underscores the “hatred” Democrats feel for Trump. Throughout the trial, they showed clips from Democrats questioning the legitimacy of his presidency and suggesting as early as 2017 that he should be impeached.“Hatred is at the heart of the house managers’ fruitless attempts to blame Donald Trump for the criminal acts of the rioters — based on double hearsay statements of fringe right-wing groups, based on no real evidence other than rank speculation," van der Veen said.Trump's lawyers noted that in the same Jan. 6 speech he encouraged the crowd to behave “peacefully,” and they contend that his remarks — and his general distrust of the election results — are all protected under the First Amendment. Democrats strenuously resist that assertion, saying his words weren’t political speech but rather amounted to direct incitement of violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-lawyers-say-democrats-urge-supporters-to-fight-too-101613163449732.html
13-02-2021||World||‘He let us down’: Nikki Haley breaks with former boss Donald Trump||Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the United Nations who is widely expected to run for the White House in 2024, has lashed out at her one-time boss, former president Donald Trump, saying he “let us down” and that Republicans should never have followed him.Haley’s remarks were seen as constituting a major break by a senior Republican with the former president, who might be contemplating another run for the White House if he is acquitted in the ongoing impeachment trial – which he is expected to be.“We need to acknowledge he let us down,” Haley said in an interview to Politico in an article posted just hours before Trump’s lawyers started their arguments at the impeachment trial.She was referring to the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.“He went down a path he shouldn’t have, and we shouldn’t have followed him, and we shouldn’t have listened to him. And we can’t let that ever happen again,” said Haley, who was the first Indian-American to hold a cabinet rank position, as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations.Republican leaders have largely rallied around the former president, unwilling to antagonise him and his supporters.Those who dared to criticise him for the Capitol riots quickly fell in line such as House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and Senator Lindsey Graham.“Never did I think he would spiral out like this… I don’t feel like I know who he is anymore… The person that I worked with is not the person that I have watched since the election,” Haley said.Should she have spoken out sooner? “At the time, I didn’t think that was dangerous,” she said in the interview.“I didn’t think that there was anything to fear about him. There was nothing to fear about him when I worked for him. I mean, he may have been brash. He may have been blunt. But he was someone who cared about the country… I still stand by that. I don’t think we should ever apologise for the policies that we fought for and the things that we did during his four years,” she said. “I mean, I’m deeply disturbed by what’s happened to him.”She, however, thinks the impeachment was a “waste of time”.“I think he’s going to find himself further and further isolated,” Haley told the interviewer. “I think his business is suffering at this point. I think he’s lost any sort of political viability he was going to have. I think he’s lost his social media, which meant the world to him. I mean, I think he’s lost the things that really could have kept him moving.”Haley believes Trump won’t run for office again. “I don’t think he’s going to be in the picture,” she said. “I don’t think he can. He’s fallen so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-let-us-down-nikki-haley-breaks-with-former-boss-donald-trump-101613153608143.html

They planted banana plants on the advice of horticulture officials in 2019. When crops were ready to be harvested they failed to get buyers and proper rates for the produce.Ramesh Yadav, 46, of Khusara village in Sitarganj block said, “We had planted 5000 saplings of banana on 4.25-acre of land. Our crops were ready in the month January but we failed to get buyers and proper rates. When we failed to get the results of our hardships we ploughed and destroyed the crops by a tractor.”Yadav said, “When the banana fruit was ready to be harvested I went to Pilibhit and Bareilly of UP in search of buyers but no one took interest. They were not ready to buy even ₹200 per quintal. If our crops had sold at ₹1000 per quintal we would have earned around ₹22-lakh.”The horticulture department of US Nagar provided plants free of cost under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2019 to encourage the farmers to grow banana crops.Yadav said his family had come under huge debt due to banana cultivation.Harish Tiwari, joint director of Kumaon, horticulture department said, “Banana is a highly fed crop and starts fruiting in 13 months after plantation. In the previous season, farmers made good profit from the crops. What happened with these farmers we will go there and see in a day or two.”“Around 50 farmers, who were provided plants by us, are cultivating bananas across the district. They are satisfied and are not complaining like this,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-farmers-destroy-crops-after-failing-to-get-buyers-proper-rates-101613237948182.html

"There is so much truth in your reason that it speaks for itself. I am with truth and will always stand by it," Gandhi said, according to news agency ANI.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, earlier in the day, urged all sections of the society to stand up against farm laws and said that the legislation will impact all. He alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to hand over ₹40 lakh crore worth agriculture sector to his corporate friends. The Congress leader is not related to the Father of the Nation."India's and world's biggest business is in agriculture which is worth ₹40 lakh crores and run by 40% Indians which include farmers, small traders, porters, workers and poor but PM Modi wants to hand over this agriculture business to his corporate friends through this farm laws," he said.Farmers have been protesting against the Centre's contentious farm laws for more than two months now at the borders of Delhi. The Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders have seen the majority of the dissenters.There have been several rounds of talks between the Centre's representatives and the farm leaders but all have so far ended in a stalemate. The Centre has said that it has no intention of withdrawing the laws while the farmers have made it clear that they would not stop the protest unless they are completely rolled back. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said that the protests might go on until October should the Centre not heed the farmers' demands.The protests led to a tractor rally on Republic Day which ended in violence when agitators marched into Delhi and stormed the historic Red Fort. The Delhi Police since have taken strict measures to prevent the farmers from entering the Capital.The farmers have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and the Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, since November 26 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/so-much-truth-mahatma-gandhi-s-granddaughter-lends-support-to-protesting-farmers-101613235215758.html

13-02-2021||India||Bihar moves to terminate 7 health staff for irregularities in Covid-19 testing||The Bihar government has initiated the process of termination against seven health officials in Jamui while serving show-cause notices to four other doctors in Araria district over alleged irregularities in Covid-19 testing, as it put up a brave front and said that the entire state and its corona warriors should not be discredited for a few black sheep in the system.Addressing the media on Saturday, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit said that barring Barhat and Sikandra blocks of Jamui district, no such glaring anomalies were found in the ongoing investigation in 26 districts so far.“Investigators had found many fake entries of people, who either did not exist or were not tested, but their name figured in the testing list with incorrect mobile numbers at Barhat and Sikandra blocks,” said Amrit, sharing the crux of the investigation being undertaken by district magistrates as well as independent teams of the health department.“We have initiated the process of termination against the district programme manager of Jamui, a block health manager each of Barhat and Sikandra, two auxiliary nursing midwives and a laboratory technician in each of the two blocks for the glaring lapses,” he said.The department had earlier on Friday suspended four health officials of Jamui, including its civil surgeon, the district immunisation officer and two medical officers in-charge of the health facilities at the two blocks.Amrit said incongruity in mobile numbers of those tested had been found in Araria and Forbesganj towns as well as Purnahiya block of Sheohar. However, unlike Barhat and Sikandra, people in these towns were tested, but the mismatch was in their mobile number.“Out of 4,504 samples taken in Araria, there were 275 entries that mentioned 10 times ‘0’ and 522 entries with 10 times ‘1’ under the mobile number column against the name of the person tested in Forbesganj town,” he said.“Showcause notices have been served on in-charge superintendent of Sadar hospital, Araria; deputy superintendent sub-divisional hospital, Forbesganj, and medical officers in-charge of primary health centres at Araria and Forbesganj for dereliction of duty,” said Amrit.When our investigators asked the healthcare workers responsible for the lapses, they said that people who came for testing were not keen to share their mobile numbers. They also said that there was no way they could verify the mobile numbers which people shared with them.Replying to a question on difference in prices of rapid antigen testing kits procured by the state government last July and January this year, managing director Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Limited Pradeep Kumar Jha said, “One kit cost ₹504 when purchase was done on July 9 and the same now costs ₹42.47.”Explaining the difference in price, he said, “The Indian Council of Medical Research had approved only one firm for purchase of testing kits in July, whereas 18 firms had now got the ICRM nod. All purchases, he said was made through the government e-market (GeM) place, hosted by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS&D).The government had asked district magistrates to conduct random inquiry in two to four blocks of their respective districts by physically verifying the persons mentioned in the testing list to check for inconsistencies in Covid-19 testing.The government action follows a news report, which claimed that in several cases, the mobile numbers of those tested were owned by unrelated people from other districts or states; in some cases, mobile numbers listed were invalid, in others; multiple unrelated persons were listed under one number. In a few cases, numbers used were those of the primary health centre staffers themselves, pointing to basic data protocol being bypassed to meet the daily testing target, and in some cases to allegedly siphon off profits from unused testing kits, the report said.OTP based RT-PCR testsThe Bihar health department had suggested one-time password (OTP)-based testing to curb any further anomalies in Covid-19 testing.Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit said, “We will introduce in the next few days OTP based testing in case of RT-PCR tests, while allowing rapid antigen tests to be conducted only at health facilities to check any future inconsistency or mismatch in mobile number and the name of the person tested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-moves-to-terminate-7-health-staff-for-irregularities-in-covid-19-testing-101613234736178.html

13-02-2021||India||Researchers propose that humidity from masks may lessen severity of Covid-19||Did you know that the humidity created inside masks may help in combating respiratory diseases such as Covid-19? According to a team of researchers, this is yet another benefit of wearing masks regularly.The findings of the study were published in the 'Biophysical Journal'. The study, led by researchers in the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), found that face masks substantially increased the humidity in the air that the mask-wearer breathes in.This higher level of humidity in inhaled air, the researchers suggested, could help explain why wearing masks has been linked to lower disease severity in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, because hydration of the respiratory tract is known to benefit the immune system."We found that face masks strongly increase the humidity in inhaled air and propose that the resulting hydration of the respiratory tract could be responsible for the documented finding that links lower Covid-19 disease severity to wearing a mask," said the study's lead author, Adriaan Bax, Ph.D., NIH Distinguished Investigator.Dr Bax added, "High levels of humidity have been shown to mitigate severity of the flu, and it may be applicable to the severity of Covid-19 through a similar mechanism."High levels of humidity can limit the spread of a virus to the lungs by promoting mucociliary clearance (MCC), a defense mechanism that removes mucus and potentially harmful particles within the mucus from the lungs.High levels of humidity can also bolster the immune system by producing special proteins, called interferons, that fight against viruses, a process known as the interferon response. Low levels of humidity have been shown to impair both MCC and the interferon response, which may be one reason why people are likelier to get respiratory infections in cold weather.The study tested four common types of masks: an N95 mask, a three-ply disposable surgical mask, a two-ply cotton-polyester mask, and a heavy cotton mask. The researchers measured the level of humidity by having a volunteer breathe into a sealed steel box. When the person wore no mask, the water vapor of the exhaled breath filled the box, leading to a rapid increase in humidity inside the box.When the person wore a mask, the buildup of humidity inside the box greatly decreased, due to most of the water vapor remaining in the mask, becoming condensed, and being re-inhaled. To ensure no leakage, the masks were tightly fitted against the volunteer's face using high-density foam rubber. Measurements were taken at three different air temperatures, ranging from about 46 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit.The results showed that all four masks increased the level of humidity of inhaled air, but to varying degrees. At lower temperatures, the humidifying effects of all masks greatly increased. At all temperatures, the thick cotton mask led to the most increased level of humidity."The increased level of humidity is something most mask-wearers probably felt without being able to recognize, and without realizing that this humidity might actually be good for them," Dr Bax said.The researchers did not look at which masks are most effective against inhalation or transmission of the virus and defer to the CDC for guidance on choosing a mask. Earlier studies from Bax and his colleagues showed that any cloth mask can help block the thousands of saliva droplets that people release through simple speech droplets that, if released, can remain in the air for many minutes. While the current study did not examine respiratory droplets, it does offer more evidence as to why masks are essential to battling Covid-19."Even as more people nationwide begin to get vaccinated, we must remain vigilant about doing our part to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19," said NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers."This research supports the importance of mask-wearing as a simple, yet effective, way to protect the people around us and to protect ourselves from respiratory infection, especially during these winter months when susceptibility to these viruses increases," added Rodgers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/researchers-propose-that-humidity-from-masks-may-lessen-severity-of-covid19-101613230943522.html

Rescuers have so far retrieved 38 bodies and at least 166 people are still missing and feared dead following the flash floods on February 7.“The dams should have a system of disseminating early warnings and by early warning I do not mean a sign board that reads going near the river can be dangerous. Unfortunately, in the 21st century we still don’t have any systems in place. The workers had the time to vacate had they known. Also, a lot of muck had been dumped at the head of the Tapovan tunnel which amplified the impact of the flood pushing people deep inside it with muck,” said Navin Juyal, retired geologist from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad.“Two events took place on February 7. To say that the glacial breach was an act of god is one thing but we have to understand how the disaster amplified. The glacial breach and the ice and debris came down with a lot of power. When such floods occur they destroy all barriers in their way and pick up more sediment from the barrier. The glacial breach can be ascribed to nature but what about the barriers and obstructions in its way?” asked Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute and head of the Chopra committee on hydroelectric projects set up by the Supreme Court in the aftermath of the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand which killed over 5000 people.“Our committee was asked if hydroelectric projects were destroying the ecology of the region. We had said yes. We had also mentioned that siting hydroelectric projects in the paraglacial zone (above 2000 metres) could accentuate disasters,” he added. Chopra, however, added that “the era of dams is possibly over. Hydropower is expensive. It is costing ₹6 to ₹8 per unit to produce whereas solar power is costing ₹2 to ₹2.5 to produce. Soon nobody will want to buy hydropower,” Chopra said.Uttam Lal, assistant professor (geography), Sikkim University said the entire high mountain region in India is vulnerable to such events and changes in microclimate along with climate change make these regions very vulnerable. “The glacial breach happened at 3600 metres altitude which came down with debris and ice traversing 12 km at 2000 metres altitude and at a 45 degree slope. The slope is high. We should understand the terrain of the region and how microclimatic changes can contribute to such disasters.”The meeting was organised by India River’s Forum, Water Conflicts Forum, People’s Science Institute, South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, Mattu Jan Sangathan and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/river-experts-and-geologists-demand-accountability-for-rishi-ganga-disaster-101613228682995.html

Khattar’s comment came after he met Union home minister Amit Shah to discuss the farmers' protest against the three farm laws among other issues. “We discussed the farmers' protest among other issues. We will be bringing a law for recovery of damages to public property from protesters,” the Haryana chief minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Khattar had on Friday said, according to ANI, that some people are agitating just for the "sake of protest" against the Centre’s farm laws, which reflects their "vested political intent". The chief minister also said the Centre will be ready for any amendment in the laws if required and that he is hopeful that the issue will be resolved soon. Khattar said the Centre is clearly of the view that the three laws are for the benefit of farmers and will give a boost to the agricultural sector.Khattar, according to a statement, said this after a meeting with the members of Parliament from his state.Farmers, especially from Haryana and Punjab, have been protesting against the three farm laws for more than two months now, demanding the repeal of the legislation which they say threaten minimum price guarantee and would leave them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-to-claim-recovery-of-damages-to-public-property-by-protesters-soon-khattar-101613230088831.html

13-02-2021||India||2 years of Pulwama terror attack: The day when India lost 40 CRPF men||Sunday marks two years of the Pulwama terror attack when 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed after a suicide bomber rammed an IED-laden vehicle into the security convoy carrying them. The convoy of 78 buses carrying 2,500 CRPF personnel was moving from Jammu towards Srinagar.The 22-year-old suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar drove a Maruti Eeco through one of the alleyways onto the highway at around 3pm and rammed the explosive-laden car into a bus carrying the CRPF troopers. Within seconds of the crash, the bus was reduced to a mangled heap of metal and 40 troopers were blown up.The day has been the bloodiest in the Valley’s 30-year-old insurgency period. Provoking grief and anger in the same pulse, the attack led India to carry out strikes in Pakistan's Balakot 12 days after February 14. The aim was to bomb the Jaish-e-Mohammed's (JeM’s) camp in the dense forests of Balakot, following which India and Pakistan saw tight monitoring of their air space. Simultaneously, India rushed thousands of troops to Kashmir and heightened the security in the Valley.The Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack after repeated denials from Pakistan. The explosives used in the attack were found to be ammonium nitrate, nitroglycerin and RDX after a forensic investigation. The investigation also confirmed the identity of the suicide bomber through DNA matching with that of his father.Read | Farmers announce 'rail roko' on Feb 18; candle marches for Pulwama braveheartsA spokesperson of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the attack, said that by piecing together the remains of the vehicle used by the suicide bomber in the Pulwama terror attack, investigators, with the support of forensic and automobile experts were able to identify the vehicle used for the blast.“A Maruti Eeco vehicle having Chassis number MA3ERLF1SOO183735 Engine G12BN164140 was sold to Mohammad Jaleel Ahmed Haqqani, a resident of Heaven Colony, Anantnag in the year 2011. It subsequently exchanged hands seven times and finally reached Sajjad Bhat, son of Mohammad Maqbool Bhat, resident of Bijbehara, district Anantnag, who had acquired the vehicle on February 4. Sajjad was a student of Siraj-ul-Uloom, Shopian,” the spokesperson said.In March 2020, NIA had arrested an operative of terror outfit JeM in the first major breakthrough in the Pulwama terror attack case. Last month, the Border Security Force (BSF) and Jammu police on Wednesday detected a 150m long cross-border tunnel at the international border that intelligence agencies believe may have been used by Mohammad Umar Farooq, JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar’s nephew, to enter India to execute the February 14, 2019, Pulwama terror attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-years-of-pulwama-terror-attack-the-day-when-india-lost-40-crpf-men-101613225652501.html

13-02-2021||India||Road crashes in India hike poverty, poor suffer more deaths: World Bank report||More than 75% of poor households in India reported a decline in their income as a result of a road traffic crash. The financial loss for the poor amounted to more than seven month’s household income, while it was equivalent to less than one month’s household income for rich households, a World Bank report released on Saturday noted.The report titled “Traffic Crash Injuries and Disabilities: The Burden on Indian Society”, was released by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday. The report highlights the disproportionate impact of a road crash on poor households that pushes them into a vicious cycle of poverty and debt. It sheds light on the links between road crashes, poverty, inequality, and vulnerable road users in India.Post-crash impact among Low Income Households is more severe compared to High Income Households with incidence of fatality among poor households as high as 44% in rural areas compared to 11.6% in urban areas, the report by the World Bank and Save Life Foundation on the socio-economic burden of road crashes released by Gadkari on Saturday noted.The report stated that Lower Income Household (LIH) reported twice the numbers of deaths post-crash vis-à-vis High Income Household (HIH) adding that victims from LIH and rural areas are also twice more likely to suffer a disability after a crash than their HIH counterparts.Overall, the post-crash impact was more severe for LIH in low capacity states compared to HIH in high capacity states, it noted.“The socio-economic burden of road crashes is disproportionately borne by poor households. The decline in total household income was sharper among LIH (75%) than HIH (54%). The severe impact of decline in income was highest among LIH in rural areas (56%) compared to LIH in urban areas (29.5%) and HIH rural (39.5%), and cases where victims died as well as where victims were males,” it said.The report also brings out the sharp rural-urban divide and the disproportionate impact on women. The survey shows that the income decline for low-income rural households (56 per cent) was the most severe compared to low-income urban (29.5 per cent) and high-income rural households (39.5 per cent). Women bore the burden of crashes across poor and rich households, often taking up extra work, assuming greater responsibilities, and performing caregiving activities after a crash. About 50 per cent of women were severely affected by the decline in their household income after a crash. About 40 per cent of women reported a change in their working patterns post-crash, while around 11 per cent reported taking up extra work to deal with the financial crisis.Within households, women bear the brunt of caregiving activities post-crash, leading to a double burden of labour and mental load and exacerbated inequality of opportunities in returning to livelihoods and income generating tasks, it noted.India tops the world in road crash deaths (WHO, 2018), with more than 400 fatalities per day. India has 1% of the world’s vehicles but accounts for 11% of all road accident deaths and 6% of total road crashes, according to the ministry of road transport and highways.In the last decade alone, road crashes have killed 1.3 million and injured over 5 million in India.“The risk of a road crash in low-income countries is three times higher than compared to that in high-income countries. Not only does it lead to untold and unaccounted for suffering and loss for victims and their families, but also, it drains the GDP of countries by claiming millions of economically productive young lives.Road crash deaths in India, which are the highest in the world, are a burden on its demographic dividend and have a tangible impact on poverty. The disproportionate impact can be gauged by the fact that with only 1 percent of world’s vehicles, India accounts for 11 percent of all crash related deaths or expressed different, a crash death happening every four minutes,” said Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Country Director, India World Bank.World Bank commissioned a survey-based assessment study in association with the Save LIFE Foundation (SLF)– a national non-governmental organization focused on road safety. Based on the survey data collected from four Indian states – Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, the research assesses the social, financial, gender, and psychological impacts of road crashes on poor and disadvantaged households.The study quantifies the differential financial impact of RTIs on poor disadvantaged households by comparing a test sample of victims and their family members from Low-Income Households (LIH, i.e., the bottom 40% of the population by per capita income) with a control sample of High Income Households (HIH, i.e., the top 10% of the population in terms of per capita income). It also reveals the gendered and psychological impact of crashes, a subject that has been hitherto unacknowledged in previous studies, the report noted.India is also a signatory to the United Nation’s Brasilia Declaration with the target of reducing road fatalities by 50% by 2020. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari also said the government aims to bring down road accidents and its related deaths down by 50 per cent before 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/burden-of-road-crashes-borne-by-poor-suffer-higher-post-crash-fatality-report-101613222006656.html

Trivedi' comments come a day after he resigned as the member of the Rajya Sabha on Friday during the debate on the Union Budget, saying he felt suffocated in the House since he was unable to do anything regarding the violence and unrest in West Bengal."I am very grateful to BJP and its senior leaders, I was told they have said that I am welcome. It would be a privilege, no question about it. But, let me settle down," Trivedi said, according to news agency ANI.The BJP was quick to respond to Trivedi's resignation, with party's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya saying that they would welcome him in the party and anyone who wanted to do honest work could not stay in the TMC. "Not just Dinesh Trivedi ji, whoever wants to do honest work, cannot stay in Trinamool Congress. If he wants to join the Bharatiya Janata Party, we will welcome him," Vijayvargiya said.Vijayvargiya has been campaigning extensively in West Bengal along with senior leaders like JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and Dilip Ghosh for the state's upcoming assembly elections.Trivedi also took a jibe at Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, saying that no one could hold their heads up high in an environment of fear. "If Mamata Banerjee, rightly says 'I want to keep my head up', she should know that everybody should keep their head up.

The soldiers and officers are undergoing training at High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS) in Gulmarg.In a video shared by ANI, the troops are seen training in knee-deep thick snow in a group of 20-30. The training in new techniques is being done with the latest equipment which will help soldiers with skills for successful rescue operations on challenging snow terrain.The army has included personnel of the paramilitary forces and forces of friendly nations in this training. These troops are trained in high altitude, super high altitude and glaciated terrain at HAWS, Lieutenant Colonel Dipanankar Hamalyan, a senior trainer at the school, said."As of now two courses are imparted in HAWS, one is the winter warfare series under which the basic and the advanced courses are provided. The second course in the mountain warfare series also includes basic and advanced courses. Once a person completes all the courses, they are known as Mountain Warriors," Hamalyan said.After the conclusion of the training, the troops will move to their respective units and train their fellow soldiers, Lt Col Hamalyan said. HAWS trains at least 540 soldiers in a year.The focus of the training is on military skiing which helps in the post to post-movement and patrolling in snowbound areas, Major Saleem Jafer, a trainer at HAWS, said."Soldiers are trained to ski with weights on their backs, initially with 5 kilograms which subsequently increased up to 20 kg. In advanced training, they will be trained to navigate 80-degree slope which will help them surveil any area no matter how snowy the terrain is," Major Jafer said.Jafer said soldiers are being prepared to outlive extreme harsh climates and avalanches. In order to do that, a one-week survival training is imparted after which soldiers can make their own igloos, snow trenches and snow caves, he said. They are also being training for avalanche rescue at high altitude near the Line of Control (LoC) and Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/watch-indian-army-trains-mountain-warriors-in-gulmarg-for-high-altitude-ops-101613211346694.html
13-02-2021||India||Work on India’s first dolphin research centre to start soon in Patna||The society for the long-awaited National Dolphin Research Centre (NDRC) is likely to be formed within a month, officials said.Last year, chief minister Nitish Kumar had laid the foundation stone of the centre and the fund for the building was also sanctioned to the building construction department (BCD), but things could not move beyond that.Principal secretary, department of forest and environment, Dipak Kumar Singh said that there were some issues with Patna University on the society formation, but that has now been sorted out. “The society will be formed within a month. The construction of the building in Patna University will also get underway soon. Fund has already been sanctioned,” he added.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announcing Project Dolphin last year on the lines of Project Tiger to focus on both river and sea dolphins, the centre has acquired more importance. The project also got in-principle approval at the first meeting of the National Ganga Council (NGC), headed by the PM.The NDRC is a long-pending project, but it got further delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic. The erstwhile Planning Commission had sanctioned a sum of ₹28.06 crore for it in 2013 itself and subsequently the state government also released a sum of ₹19.16 crore for infrastructure development on June 4, 2014 to Infrastructure Development Authority (IDA).However, the autonomous centre, proposed under Bihar’s department of environment and forests, still could not take off due to wrangles over its location and control. “Now, there is no issue and the work on it will begin soon,” he added.Prof RK Sinha, vice chancellor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (Jammu & Kashmir) and Padma Shree awardee in 2016 for his contributions to dolphin research, said sooner the centre took shape, better it would be. “With the announcement of Project Dolphin, Bihar can take lead in it. The state has the advantage of half the Dolphin population as well as expertise for conservation,” he added.As Bihar accounts for 50% of the world’s river dolphin population, a highly endangered species under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and declared the National Aquatic Animal in 2009, Sinha said the NDRC would be a big step forward for the conservation of the mammal.In 2018-19, around 1500 dolphins were sighted in the Ganga during a survey by teams of experts. This also prompted the government to build India’s first observatory, Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, for the mammals in Bhagalpur. Once it is completed, it is expected to boost eco-tourism. Another observatory is also in the pipeline at Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-on-india-s-first-dolphin-research-centre-to-start-soon-in-patna-101613212827581.html

Under the policy, New Delhi recognizes the Tibet Autonomous Region as part of the territory of the People's Republic of China, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.The Tibetan activist, who started a solo march towards the national capital on Friday, is holding the flag of both India and Tibet. He has decided to walk 550 kilometres on foot to raise awareness about the issue of Tibet.Tsundue is a poet, writer and activist, who won the first-ever Outlook-Picador Award for Non-Fiction in 2001."I would like to express two important things. I am a Tibetian who was born in India. I am both Indian and Tibetan. Today is Losar (Friday) and I am starting a march. I will march towards Delhi, which will take one month's time and will try to spread awareness about the issue of Tibet," the activist said on Friday while addressing the people in Dharamshala."For the long term interest of India, it must change the one-China policy. Crores are being spent which could have been avoided, had the Tibet would be free. Like we have given a reply to Pakistan, we will give a reply to China. Not with violence, but diplomatically," Tsundue added.While talking to ANI, Tsundue said that he has decided to walk the long march in order to directly engage with the public on the issue of Tibet."I have decided to walk because this is direct public engagement, where I will get to meet people, speak to media and I will be able to maintain this movement about an entire month and this is also timely," he told ANI.Tsundue further said that Tibet is the missing link between "India-China crisis," adding that without understanding Tibet."India cannot understand China. I am raising the issue of Tibet and in the process reach to the government of India to repeal 'One China Policy.' Later I will write in the newspaper why we should repeal One China Policy," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tibetan-activist-begins-march-to-delhi-seeks-change-in-one-china-policy-101613211357011.html

"It appears I am under some sort of surveillance," ANI quoted the member of Parliament as saying.On Friday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmakers Nishikant Dubey and PP Chaudhary had given a breach of privilege motion notice in the Lok Sabha against Moitra for her speech in the House that soon went viral on social media.The MPs in the letter said that Moitra had made 'adverse statements' against the former chief justice of India Ranjan Gogoi in respect to the discharge of his duties during her speech on Motion of Thanks on the President's address on February 8. The letter said that Article 121 does not allow for discussion in the Parliament relating to the conduct of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Court with respect to the discharge of their duties.Also Read | Cong MP moves motion against FM for calling Rahul Gandhi 'doomsday man of India'"The above-said speech is now available on the YouTube, Twitter handle and other social media platforms of Mahua Moitra.

Her remarks pertaining to the judiciary were later effaced from the proceedings.Moitra in her speech had questioned the situation of democracy in the country and had alleged that the country is in a state of 'undeclared emergency'.

The association members have appealed to chief minister Nitish Kumar to reconsider the development plan and incorporate the old buildings in the heritage segment.The government’s redevelopment plan to turn the PMCH into a world class 5,462- bed hospital will cost an estimated of ₹5,540 crore.The PMCH has a long history. Developed in 1925 it was known as the Prince of Wales Medical College and was named after Edward VIII four years after he visited the country and the state as part of his royal tour in 1921.The medical college traces its origin to the Temple Medical School set up in 1874 in Patna. It was later shifted to Muradpur area of the then Bankipur on the banks of the Ganga and was renamed as the Prince of Wales Medical College."The PMCH has not just been a hospital, offering medical treatment to the patients or grooming young medicos. It's been a living testimony of the different phases of development of Patna. The administrative block was the first construction on the campus and even Hathwa ward was developed soon. Very soon these structures would become 100-years old," said Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, the PMCH Almuni Association president.These deserve to be preserved for posterity. Otherwise they would find the original background of the hospital only in the history books, he added."We appeal to the government to consider this point and preserve a couple of old structures and develop modern buildings in the rest of the campus," he said.Dr Singh said a delegation of doctors would be meeting the chief minister in this connection in the next few days.JK Lal from the INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage), Patna chapter, said the PMCH has been a building of heritage significance. “Structures which are not yet over 100 years old, but have historical background, are considered the structures of heritage significance and are preserved. The original buildings of the PMCH should be preserved through restoration work," he said.But not everybody is keen on preserving the ol structure. Dr Amarkant Jha Amar, the Indian Medical Association president, said the PMCH development plan has been a long pending demand. "Now that the government has started working over it, let the things get going. Hope it gets complete in the next five years," he said.Another senior doctor, Dr BK Sinha said the PMCH badly needs the development work. "It's been old and badly damaged. Patients' lives are at risk at many buildings. Concern for heritage is good, but people need a world class hospital in state capital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmch-alumni-association-appeals-to-nitish-kumar-to-preserve-old-buildings-101613211009378.html

Police were looking for the mastermind and other key members of the racket.Acting on specific intelligence, the ANC intercepted a truck at Vikroli, seized the marijuana. and arrested Akash Yadav, the driver of the vehicle, and one Dinesh Kumar Saroj. The truck was on its way to Bhiwandi to take the marijuana to a godown.Milind Bharambhe, a joint police commissioner, said the racket is well-organised. "It would traffic the drugs in tempos by concealing them in between the sacks of coconuts." He said that the gang members would randomly hire a tempo from Bhiwandi, go to the bordering district of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh and send the driver of the tempo to stay in a hotel and meanwhile another driver would take the tempo further into Odisha and get the marijuana loaded.The loaded vehicles would return to the hotel and then another driver would bring it back to Mumbai via Hyderabad, Solapur, and Pune."The syndicate heads would ensure that the drivers and middlemen used for trafficking the drugs do not get to know the source and destinations of the consignment and also what actually the consignment was," said Bharambhe.He said the racket would bring 4,000 kilograms of marijuana every month to Mumbai from Odisha's Kandhamal, a Maoist-hit district. "Investigations so far have not established any link of the narcotics gang with the Naxalite groups."The racket was also supplying marijuana to other groups in Solapur and Pune.

We found that it was a false case, after a thorough investigation and gathering of technical evidence,” Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat told reporters.The second-year B Pharm student had told the police that the autorickshaw which she had boarded at Rampally cross roads did not stop at R L Nagar where she was supposed to get down, but continued to go at a high speed despite her cries.She had claimed that the autorickshaw driver, along with two other men who boarded midway, took her to Yamnampet village, where she was bundled into a van and taken to a remote place. In the meantime, she managed to make a quick call to her mother, who informed the police through Dial 100 helpline.The police swung into action and started searching for her by tracking her mobile phone. “Finally, we traced the woman in an isolated place near Bethel Church, Annojiguda service road. She was in a state of semi-conscious state with her clothes torn and there were injuries on her body. Police teams with her relatives shifted her to nearby Cure Hospital for treatment. Based on her statement, we, too, suspected it to be a case of kidnapping and rape and booked the case accordingly,” Bhagawat said.In the last two days, the special operations teams of the Rachakonda police conducted thorough investigation to piece together the girl's movements and locations during the period she said she was abducted. “We managed to track down the autorickshaw in which the girl travelled with the help of the local auto drivers’ union. We examined the video footage obtained from 100 different closed-circuit television cameras located in the area and interrogated the auto drivers, locals and her college mates,” the police commissioner said.The police teams found that there was absolutely no connection to what the pharmacy student claimed in her statement and the evidence the police had gathered.“The video footage clearly showed that the woman got down at the next stop from her actual destination, walked for about four kilometres towards Yamnampet and then, took another autorickshaw to reach Annojiguda, from where she called her mother stating that she was kidnapped,” Bhagawat said.The CCTV footage revealed that she was walking on the road near Annojiguda when she called her mother. “Exactly at the same time, the auto driver was at a bar after dropping other passengers at a shopping complex far away from the place where she was found,” the commissioner said.After corroborating all the evidence, the police grilled the student on Friday following which she confessed that she had lied to the police. Apparently, she wanted to leave her house for her own reasons and hence enacted the whole drama, he said.The police, however, did not explain why she was in a semi-conscious state lying in the bushes with her clothes torn. “Investigation will continue,” the commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-pharmacy-student-abduction-and-rape-case-was-a-hoax-say-police-101613208036487.html

You had promised that you would bring back Pandits (to Kashmir). Did you succeed? You should at least say that since the polls are over so there is an obligation to fulfil the promise,” Chowdhury was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Congress along with other opposition parties also attacked the BJP over the abrogation of Article 370. Chowdhury said that bringing back Gilgit-Baltistan is a separate matter but the home minister should also try on bringing back displaced Brahmins back to Kashmir. He said, “Mr Amit Shah said that he'll bring back Brahmins. Did he succeed in bringing back Pandits? You say you'll bring back Gilgit-Baltistan. It's a matter that can be discussed later but at least (the government) should bring back those who were internally displaced, those who cannot return to the Kashmir valley.”The lawmakers also debated whether officers outside Jammu and Kashmir should be assigned in administrative positions within the state. BJP MPs Satpal Singh, TRS MP Nama Nageswara Rao and Brijendra Singh of BJP said that if civil service officers from outside Jammu and Kashmir are posted in administrative positions, then it will help the region to become a part of mainstream processes which was earlier not possible due to Article 370. They also said that officers are transferred to different states then they can also learn about new things which they can later introduce in their home states to foster development.While several opposition MPs said that there is still no normalcy in the region, BSP MP from Uttar Pradesh Malook Nagar said that the abrogation has helped the Gujjar and Bakarwal communities, as well as other nomadic communities, remain safer because they are at the most vulnerable when ceasefire violations occur. He also urged the government to help create a special economic zone in the region. He also said that these communities can contribute to the dairy industry. BJP MP from Ladakh Jamyang Tsering Namgyal also praised the BSP MP for his openness and criticised the Congress saying that they have a problem with national integration.The NDA government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir by repealing Article 370 on August 5 in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-questions-govt-on-j-k-s-development-rehabilitation-of-kashmiri-pandits-101613208330066.html

13-02-2021||India||Odisha CM seeks withdrawal of NMA bylaws for Bhubaneswar shrines||Close on the heels of the Centre withdrawing draft notification of the National Monuments Authority banning any developmental work within 100 metres of an archeological site, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has urged the union government to take back similar communique for areas around Lingaraj temple and Brahmeswar shrine here. Reacting on the issue, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has assured the people of Odisha and Patnaik that the Centre will leave no stone unturned in honouring the culture, pride and local sentiments on the issues related to the recent draft notification of the NMA. A delegation of the BJD MPs met Union Parliamentay Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi in New Delhi Saturday and placed demands that the centre remove the bylaws relating to Lingaraj temple. Since Union Culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel was not in the national capital, the BJD Parliamentarians met Prahlad Joshi. The proposed heritage rules, prohibit construction within a radius of 100 metre of any archaeological site,undermining the Odisha government's plan to develop the Lingaraj temple and its surroundings as a heritage site at the cost of ₹700 crore. A section of the people are also critical of the fact that the bylaws equate Shree Lingaraj temple, where living gods are being worshipped, with museums and other monuments. National Monuments Authority which comes under union ministry of culture had issued the notification last month. Pradhan said that Patnaik might not have been properly briefed on the applicability of the proposed NMA rules while responding to the series of tweets by the chief minister on Friday where he demanded the withdrawal of the NMAs draft notification for areas around Lingaraj and Brahmeswar temples in the state capital. Patnaik in his tweets had invoked sentiments of lakhs of devotees and interests of servitors for making demands to withdraw the bylaws. "I assure Hon. CM that Hn. PM Shri @narendramodi's govt. will leave no stone unturned in honouring and respecting the culture, pride & sentiments of Odisha and its people. We are committed to address through dialogue all objections of the State Govt. regarding these draft bylaws," Pradhan, the Petroleum and Natural Gas minister said in a tweet on Friday. Pradhan,who hails from Odisha, also requested Patnaik to direct the chief secretary to write a letter to the secretary of the union ministry of culture for examining point by point provisions of the draft bylaws and for listing out objections of the state government in the draft published by NMA. "It seems that Hon. CM Shri @Naveen_Odisha is inadequately briefed on the applicability of the draft bylaws promulgated by NMA on the Ananta Basudev and Brahmaeswar temple in Bhubaneswar," Pradhan said in another tweet. The union minister clarified that the director of culture department in the Odisha government being the competent authority has been giving necessary permissions for any kind of construction and development activities within the periphery of the notified monuments of Odisha. He also said that the NMA was constituted by a court order to provide better policy and legal framework to further improve upon preservation of monuments of immense cultural and historical importance. "NMA also facilitates better upkeep, protection and preservation of natural treasures," Pradhan said. Referring to the ongoing controversy between the state and the centre over the NMA draft notification, Pradhan said, "Protection of monuments of national, historical & cultural importance is a collective responsibility of all of us. "HonCM who is a founding member of the @INTACHIndia must be aware that all notified monuments are protected under the AMASR Act, 1958 enacted in the Parliament." Sources said that the draft notification on heritage bylaws is applicable for all the 80 monuments including Lord Jagannath temple in Puri, Shree Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar, Sun Temple in Konark and others preserved by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in the state. However, the objections have been raised over Puri temple and some temples in Bhubaneswar. While the centre has already withdrawn the notification for Puri temple, it remained in force for other monuments across the state, a senior ASI official told PTI. Though the NMAs notification does not mention the name of Shree Lingaraj temple in the draft notification, it will automatically come under the purview of the proposed laws as the 11th century shrine is located in the regulated zones of Ananta Basudeva temple. Earlier this week, a joint effort by the BJD and the BJP saw withdrawal of the NMA's regulations for the 12th century Jagannath temple in Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cm-seeks-withdrawal-of-nma-bylaws-for-bhubaneswar-shrines-101613206896069.html

Assault upon them with the feeling of a grudge is the assault upon the dignity and supremacy of the judiciary of this country, which cannot be tolerated and requires strict punishment against the erring police officials under the contempt law," it has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judges-assault-sc-rejects-pil-says-nothing-found-in-enquiry-by-bihar-police-101613196091777.html

A weak opposition is not good for democracy," Tomar said."As far as the farmers' movement is concerned, the government is holding discussions with the farmers, we have given them the best proposal. When they convey their opinion, then we will carry forward the discussion," he further added.Speaking about the BJP's training program, Tomar said, "Training in BJP is important, from the local committee to a worker at the national level. There are many workers who have won for the first time, there are many who have experience. They should meet so that they can learn from each other in terms of working with the party and the public, therefore training classes are organised."Speaking to ANI after attending the first day of the training session, BJP MLA Mahendra Singh Sisodia who had left Congress to join BJP along with Jyotiraditya Scindia said, "Today, the first day of the training program was of 11 hours and was amazing. I am running out of words to appreciate the program. Everything is zero in Congress party. The BJP has struggled for 70 years and has formed an organisation that is working across the country."Sisodia further stated that such training programs were never heard of in the Congress, but here everything from discipline, personality development, party development, ideology, Central government, the state government was covered in the session.On being asked about the training program organised as part of preparations for the upcoming polls in 2023 and 2024 Sisodia said, "BJP is always ready, unlike the Congress which is just the opposite."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-others-demanding-repeal-of-farm-laws-know-nothing-says-tomar-101613203042183.html

On the contrary, it has enforced observance and respect for LAC and prevented any unilateral change in the status quo," the ministry said in the strongly-worded statement.The MEA also said the two countries have agreed to convene the 10th round of senior commanders meeting within 48 hours after complete disengagement in the Pangong Lake area to address the remaining issues, and added that no date has been set for Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs.The agreement on disengagement in the north and south banks of Pangong lake mandates both Chinese and Indian sides to "cease" forward deployment of troops in a "phased, coordinated and verifiable" manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-on-defence-decides-to-visit-galwan-valley-pangong-in-eastern-ladakh-101613199497727.html

There may be some spontaneous protests but in case of prolonged dissent or protest, there cannot be continued occupation of public place affecting rights of others”, the bench said, while dismissing a plea by one Shaheen Bagh resident Kaniz Fatima and others seeking review of last year's verdict of October 7.The top court, which considered the matter in the judges' chambers also rejected the prayer for open court hearing in the matter.The apex court had on October 7, last year held that public spaces cannot be occupied indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.It had said occupation of public ways in the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh locality here was “not acceptable”.Observing that democracy and dissent “go hand in hand”, the apex court had said constitutional scheme comes with the right to protest and express dissent, but with an obligation towards certain duties.It had said the mode and manner of dissent against colonial rule during India's freedom struggle cannot be equated with dissent in a self-ruled democracy.“However, while appreciating the existence of the right to peaceful protest against a legislation...we have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely,” the top court had said.The apex court's verdict had come on a plea by lawyer Amit Sahni against blockade of a road in Shaheen Bagh area by those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which aimed to provide Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.It had held that the protest at Shaheen Bagh was a blockage of a public way which caused grave inconvenience to commuters.The top court had said such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests, is not acceptable and “the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions”.“Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone,” it had said, adding, “We cannot accept the plea of the applicants that an indeterminable number of people can assemble whenever they choose to protest”.Restrictions were imposed on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and the Okhla underpass, which were closed on December 15, 2019 due to the protests.Later, due to Covid-19 pandemic, the area was cleared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-to-protest-cannot-be-anytime-and-everywhere-says-sc-dismissing-shaheen-bagh-plea-101613201468175.html

The lake is being monitored through satellites. Right now, we need to be cautious, but there is nothing to be worried about."A glacier broke in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli District of Uttarakhand on Sunday, which led to massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers and damaged houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-glacier-burst-rescue-operation-underway-at-tunnel-in-joshimath-101613199510425.html
13-02-2021||India||Shiv Sena urges Centre to recall Maharashtra Governor||The Shiv Sena, which is in power in Maharashtra, on Saturday accused state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari of toeing the BJP's line, and said that if the Centre wants the Constitution to be upheld, it should recall him.The party also asserted that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) dispensation is stable and strong, and added that the Centre cannot use the governor's shoulders to take aim at the state government."Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari is back in news again. He has been in politics for the last many years. He was a union minister and also the chief minister of Uttarakhand. However, ever since he became the Maharashtra governor, he has always remained in news or landed in controversy," the Sena said in an editorial in mouthpiece 'Saamana'."Why he is always landing in controversy is a question. Recently, he is in news over the use of a state government's plane. The governor wanted to go to Dehradun using the state aircraft. But the government denied permission to it. He sat in the aircraft on Thursday morning, but as the plane did not have approval to fly, he had to disembark and take a commercial flight to Dehradun," it said.The opposition BJP is creating an issue out of it. But why did the governor sit in the plane even as the government had not given its approval for it to fly, the party asked.It was a private tour of the governor and as per the law, not only the governor, but even the chief minister cannot use a state plane for such purposes. The Chief Minister's Office (CMO) has acted in accordance with law, it said."But Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis accused the state government of being egoistic. The country knows who is indulging in politics of ego. Despite the death of over 200 farmers during the ongoing protest on Delhi borders over the three farm laws, the government is not ready to withdraw them. Isn't that ego?" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party asked.A governor should pursue the agenda of the government of the day and not that of the opposition, it added.The Sena also criticised the delay in governor's approval of 12 names recommended by the state cabinet for their nomination to the Legislative Council from his quota."The governor is acting like a puppet," it alleged.The governor of Maharashtra is an honourable person. But it is also his own responsibility to keep the prestige of the position that he occupies. However, he is being forced to dance to the BJP's tunes, it said."If the Union Home Ministry wants the Constitution, laws and norms to be upheld, it should recall the governor," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-urges-centre-to-recall-maharashtra-governor-101613198982488.html

The existing rule states that if both parents are government employees and one of the parents dies either during service or post-retirement, the family pension in respect of the deceased becomes payable to the surviving spouse. In the event of the death of the spouse, the child will receive both the family pensions in respect of the deceased parents and is subject to fulfilment of other eligibility conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-raises-upper-ceiling-of-family-pensions-from-rs-45k-to-rs-125k-per-month-101613199285303.html

They said the medium-range or big size plantations need 200 to 500 acres.The government has come up with the new Bihar Agriculture Investment Promotion Policy ( BAIPP) and introduced tea as one of the important investment categories to boost the sector.“The lifting of the exemption limit is crucial for attracting investors as the existing ceiling limit is not conducive for bigger plantations. There is no ceiling in states like West Bengal and Assam where land is given by the government on lease. ...the government should accord tea processing, plantation, and packaging [the status] of agro-based industry,” said, Raj Karan Daftari, president of Ashok Bihar Tea Planters Association, which represents planters in Kishanganj district.He said the planters have long been demanding the exemption from the ceiling to boost the growth of the sector. “ It is good the government has announced subsidy and incentives for setting up tea processing units. But that also requires land,” Daftari said.He highlighted how the Bihar Industrial policy, 1995, had provisions of lifting land ceiling.There are nine tea processing plants in Kishanganj, which has the potential for nine more.Agriculture secretary N Saravana Kumar said he has taken note of the matter and the processes have started to address it. “ We have already taken up the matter with the revenue and land reforms department... We are seriously looking into the matter."BAIPP nodal officer A C Jain said they are getting a good response from probable investors. “Tea planters and producers can avail the incentives under promotion policy for setting up processing units as a huge stock of green leaf goes to the neighbouring state for processing. There is a potential of setting nine to 10 units,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tea-planters-in-bihar-seek-exemption-from-land-ceiling-101613199158987.html

It will also suggest revisions to the State Action Plans on Climate Change.According to the UNEP, countries globally are committed to achieving net-zero emissions goal by around mid-century. At the beginning of 2021, 126 countries – accounting for 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions – have net-zero goals that are formally adopted, announced or under consideration.Officials said Bihar has registered higher economic growth in the past few years. The state is highly vulnerable to the climate crisis, which may undermine its developmental efforts. Officials underlined the role of state government in identifying and addressing local adaptation and mitigation measures to deal with the climate crisis.Union minister Babul Supriyo, who was present at the signing ceremony on Friday, said the crisis rings a global alarm and warrants immediate attention and action. "Climate change mitigation and adaption, along with environmental sustainability, has been a focus area of the government. The collaboration is a key step in the right direction that aims at strengthening existing policies and proactive actions taken to combat climate change effectively.”Bihar State Pollution Control Board chairman Ashok Ghosh said to fight global warming and climatic crisis, they need to equalise carbon emission and neutrality. "UNEP will help us in analysis and strategy formulation for striving a balance between source and sink of carbon emission."Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad said the new agreement is another addition to the green initiatives taken by Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-signs-mou-with-unep-for-climate-resilience-and-low-carbon-development-101613198734081.html

13-02-2021||India||Andhra Pradesh holds panchayat polls in Odisha village despite official protest||A day after the Supreme Court fixed February 19 as the date of hearing of the case of Andhra Pradesh “invading” Odisha’s territory, the Jagan Reddy government on Saturday went ahead with panchayat polls in one of the villages of Koraput district despite the Odisha government asking it to not to do so.On Friday, the SC asked Andhra Pradesh to file its response after Odisha moved a contempt of court petition, seeking action against the neighbouring state over its violation of the apex court order in 1968 and 2006 alleging that the neighbouring state was trying to hold panchayat polls in three of its bordering villages. The Odisha government in its petition informed the court that the three villages where Andhra Pradesh is holding the panchayat elections fall within Odisha and form part of 21 villages in respect of which a suit was filed in 1968 by Odisha in the Supreme Court.The panchayat polls which began in Andhra Pradesh on February 9 will end on February 21.On Saturday morning hundreds of villagers of Patusinri village under Kotia grampanchayat in Koraput district were seen queuing up at polling booths across the inter-state border even as Koraput district collector Abdaal Akhtar wrote to his counterpart in Andhra to desist from holding the polls as the matter was sub-judice.Officials said on Saturday morning, hundreds of people of Patunsiri (renamed as Pattu Chennuru by Andhra Pradesh) were seen going to the polling booths despite Pottangi BDO and Tehslidar urging them not to go. The voting began from 6 am and will conclude at 3 pm.Sarpanches for two other villages - Talaganjeipadar and Phagunseneri - that were declared as separate grampanchayats by the Andhra Pradesh government have been elected unopposed. The AP government renamed Talaganjeipadar as Ganjayibhadra and Phagunseneri as as Paguluchennuru in its panchayat poll notification.On Friday, Koraput district collector in a letter to Vizianagaram district collector M Hari Jawaharlal said that as the matter was sub-judice, no election should be held there. “In its oral observations, the SC has observed that should the state of Andhra Pradesh go ahead with its plans, necessary consequences will follow," Akhtar wrote.According to the Odisha government, the group of villages of Kotia GP form part of the Koraput parliamentary constituency and the Potangi Assembly segment. There are 2,448 voters and all of them have been provided election photo identity cards. The state government told the SC that it has been conducting the general census in Kotia since 1951.But despite the Odisha government's submission in the SC, officials conceded that it would be tough for them to administer the villages of Kotia GP. While doctors of Andhra Pradesh can reach the Kotia panchayat by travelling only 15 km distance, those in Odisha have to cover a distance of 70 km. Around 60 per cent people of the panchayat speak and understand Telugu as against 40 per cent Odia speaking. The AP government last year granted land rights under the Forest Right Act to 19 families in Arjuvalsa village.The panchayat polls may become embarrassing for the Naveen Patnaik government as it comes just before the Budget session starting next week. On Friday, a delegation of BJP leaders led by the Odisha unit chief Samir Mohanty had forced officials from Andhra Pradesh to retreat in Gangabada GP in Gajapati district where the latter were trying to conduct panchayat polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-holds-panchayat-polls-in-odisha-village-despite-official-protest-101613197066011.html

The lights get dimmer as one walks past, helping the colony to save electricity bills and reduce its carbon footprint.Innovations like this and many others, including the country’s first machine to segregate municipal waste, are all first put to use in the colony of 250 families, mostly of scientists and research scholars.The colony acts as a living lab for the scientists, where innovations made in the institute’s laboratory, are first tried and tested before they are finally launched for public use.“All innovations made in the CMERI lab, some of which are first of its kind in the country, are initially put to use in the colony. This helps us to further finetune the product according to the needs of the society. Only then they are launched for public use,” said Harish Hirani, director of CSIR-CMERI, who is also a resident of the colony.The CMERI is India’s apex research and development institute for mechanical engineering under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The Swaraj and Sonalika brand tractors, which are popular in rural India, are products of CMERI.“The colony hasn’t produced any waste in the last two years. All the waste generated by the families, including plastic and sanitary waste, are mechanically segregated in a plant – the first of its kind in India – and then converted into biogas, manure, fuel briquettes, electricity, and road-building materials. These are used in the colony. The use of LPG has dropped. Roads and parking areas are also being constructed with recycled products,” said Amit Ganguly, a senior scientist associated with the development of the segregation plant.There are also huge trees in the colony with solar panels fitted onto every branch. Known as solar trees, they help to enhance the production of solar energy.Also being tried and tested are large air purifiers to bring down pollution levels. Air purifiers, called WAYU developed by the CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, have been installed on some roads of Delhi.“Our laboratory products are being put to use in almost every nook and corner of the society. Starting from simple plant manure manufactured from domestic waste to air purifiers and smart-street lighting, there are many innovations that are being tried and tested in this colony-lab comprising 250 families,” said Subho Samanmta, a scientist of CMERI and a resident of the colony.In cities, vehicle owners find it difficult to locate a parking space and have to jostle for space. The scientists of CMERI are now planning to come up with a smart parking system, wherein vehicle owners would get to know about vacant parking lots before they approach the parking area.“We are in the process of upgrading our parking lots into smart parking spaces. Not only would the car owner receive messages on his mobile about which lots are free, and which are engaged, but he would be able to see the green lights of free parking spaces as he approaches the parking area. A red light would mean the space is not free,” said Ajoy Roy, one of the scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-living-lab-a-community-hosts-innovations-at-bengal-research-institute-101613196213458.html

The committee note that the current manpower is grossly insufficient for committed R&D projects," it said.The DRDO works under the Defence ministry only.The committee said more effective measures should be taken by the Defence Ministry to augment the workforce in the DRDO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manpower-insufficient-for-committed-r-d-projects-parliamentary-panel-on-drdo-101613195287054.html

As Sitharaman on Saturday was replying to the discussion on Union Budget 2021 in the Lok Sabha, she posed 10 questions about Rahul Gandhi's speech which was mainly on farmers' protest, not Union Budget 2021, the finance minister said."He said he would be only commenting on farmers' issues as this is also part of the budget. I am also giving my reply pertaining to that," Sitharaman said.First, the finance minister said she expected Rahul Gandhi to explain the Congress's U-turn on farm reforms as similar promises were part of Congress's election manifesto earlier.Sitharaman counters Rahul Gandhi's 'Hum do, Hamare do' with MNREGA dataSecond, Sitharaman said she expected Rahul Gandhi to explain why farm loan waiver was not been implemented in Madhya Pradesh (when Congress was in power), Rajasthan. "Congress is so sympathetic to farmers' issues. Then why not implement loan waiver especially when you come to power riding on these promises," Sitharaman said."My third expectation was Rahul Gandhi would say something on Punjab's 'kala kanoon' that has provision to send farmers to jail. I thought he would say he has asked Punjab CM to repeal that law," Sitharaman said.In her fourth point, she said she expected Gandhi to say something on stubble burning but he did not."I expected Rahul Gandhi to at least point one clause of the three laws that is anti-farmer," the finance minister said in her fifth point.In her sixth point, the finance minister referred to Gandhi's 'Hum do, Hamare do' jibe and said, "When PM Modi talked about small farmers, I expected Rahul Gandhi to announce that he had also asked 'his two' to return lands to farmers that were acquired at throwaway prices. But he didn't do that.""I had also expected Rahul Gandhi to say that Congress party won't dishonour Manmohan Singh after PM Modi quoted Manmohan Singh on farm reforms. I expected he would say why the Congress has started to forget Manmohan Singh's ideas," she said listing this as her seventh point."Can you show one proof of APMC being closed anywhere in the country? I expected him to come up with at least one example," Sitharaman said."This is not an expectation, but a question to Rahul Gandhi. Why does he choose to insult constitutional authorities?" Sitharaman asked even raking up the 2013 incident when Gandhi had trashed then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's ordinance when Singh was abroad."My last point will be the fake narrative that he is building identifying with the 'break India fringe group'. I remember what he said about Covid-19 pandemic. I don't want to waste the time of the House by repeating the same but in summary, it was like 'I will continue to demean India'. The veteran leader is perhaps becoming the doomsday man of India," Sitharaman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-becoming-doomsday-man-of-india-sitharaman-poses-10-questions-101613195284154.html

The state health research committee has already given its nod for the research which will be conducted for a period of 12 months, an official said.The objective of the study is to observe seroconversion on the population, who have been vaccinated, to calculate the numbers of people required to be vaccinated for herd immunity, so that we will be able to control the pandemic, said Dr Sanjeeb Mishra, principal investigator of the study.Seroconversion is the time period during which a specific antibody develops and becomes detectable in the blood. After seroconversion has occurred the antibodies can be detected in blood tests for the disease.Also read| India records 12,143 new Covid-19 cases, 103 deaths in last 24 hoursThe team of doctors of VIMSAR, who will conduct the study, includes Sanjeeb Mishra, principal investigator and tutor of department of community medicine, and co- investigators from doctors various other departments of VIMSAR.Mishra said, whenever a new vaccine is launched, Odisha gets it much later than other states of the country. However, the Covid-19 vaccine drive was launched throughout India in a single day allowing for this research here. It is a unique opportunity for us.Bimal Panda, who is also Nodal Officer of the MRU, said, this is the first indigenous research project of the MRU of VIMSAR. We have already started making our laboratory ready for the study, he said.Since the emergence of Covid-19 and declaration of Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the entire world has been eagerly waiting for a vaccine for its prevention.While two vaccines namely Covishield and Covaxin have been given emergency approval for restricted use in India, results from large scale trials are still awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vimsar-doctors-to-study-seroconversion-of-vaccinated-people-101613193344163.html

Gandhi further took a jibe at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government’s popular slogan ‘acche din’ by saying that the days were neither ‘acche’ (good) nor ‘sacche’ (true).“Neither true nor good days of Modi government! Our annadatas are struggling peacefully for the better future of the country. I was and will be with them,” Gandhi’s tweet roughly translated from Hindi read.Addressing a rally in Rajasthan’s Padampura on Friday, he said that almost 40 per cent of the country’s population was employed in businesses associated with agriculture and the new laws would adversely impact them. Claiming that these 40 per cent of the people feed all citizens, the Wayanad MP said that this business was worth ₹40 lakh crore.ना सच्चे ना अच्छे,दिन मोदी सरकार के!देश के बेहतर भविष्य के लिए हमारे अन्नदाता शांतिपूर्ण संघर्ष कर रहे हैं।मैं उनके साथ था, हूँ और रहूँगा। pic.twitter.com/9bxJzGL7um“This is the motive of these laws. The day these laws are implemented, remember my words, the business of 40 per cent population will go in the hands of two people,” Gandhi alleged during his Padampura rally. He further appealed to the Centre to repeal the farm laws before engaging in any future discussions with the farmers.“PM Modi says in Parliament that he wants to talk to the farmers but what talks do you want with farmers? End these laws first and then farmers will talk to you,” he said.Also Read| Sitharaman counters Rahul Gandhi's 'Hum do, Hamare do' with MNREGA dataEleven rounds of talks have been held between the Centre and the farmers’ unions till now - which remain deadlocked despite the former placing an offer to suspend the laws for 18 months. Farmers have been protesting at several border points in Delhi since November 26 last year. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had said on Friday that the farmers would not return home and protest would continue until both sides arrive at an agreement.Meanwhile, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh had said that the government, in several rounds of talks, had requested the unions to ‘discuss the farm laws clause by clause’ in order to solve their problems. “However, farmers’ unions never agreed to discuss the farm laws except for the demand for their repeal,” Tomar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-was-and-will-be-with-annadata-rahul-gandhi-as-farmers-agitation-continues-101613193560868.html

At that time this place was barren and deserted and there was only sand everywhere. It was a lot of trouble in the beginning. Water had to be brought from the house in a pot for the plants," he further said.Talking to ANI he said, "Animals used to destroy the plants. I brought thorny bushes from the forest and made a hedge. The hedge still protects my orchard.""When Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar came to know about my contribution to environmental protection, I was made a member of the Child Protection Commission," he said.Satendra Gautam Manjhi holds an MA degree from Magadh University.An erstwhile member of the Child Protection Commission and currently a member of the Senate at the University of Magadh, Manjhi still continues to take care of his orchard.Most of the guavas are of the Allahabad Guava variant which is considered to be of high quality.

BPCC president Madan Mohan Jha has also offered to resign.Congressmen familiar with the developments said that Das’ keen interest to rejuvenate the party has boosted the workers’ morale. It has also boosted the list of leaders aspiring to lead the new state unit. Rajya Sabha member and chairman of the BPCC campaign committee Akhilesh Prasad Singh is said to be leading the race to replace Jha as the next state chief.Former governor Nikhil Kumar, AICC media panelist and former NSUI chief Prem Chandra Mishra, former BPCC chief Anil Sharma, working presidents Shyam Sundar Singh Dheeraj and Kaukab Quadri, MLA Shakeel Ahmad Khan, former party vice president Pravin Kushwaha, AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha, Kapildeo Prasad Yadav are also among those eyeing for the BPCC chief’s post.BPCC media in-charge HK Verma said that Das is likely to reach Patna on February 18 and travel to Mithilanchal and Kosi regions the next day, which also coincides with the opening day of the Budget Session of the state legislature. “Itinerary of Das’s visit is being finalized,” said Verma.Kishore Kumar Jha said that Das’ bid to establish dialogue with grassroots workers over the new shape of the party had raised hopes of the Congress getting back into the reckoning. “Das is the first in-charge, who unlike his predecessors, prefer spending his time with workers in the state. However, he urgently needs to set up a new team to plan the strategy for the party’s revival,” said Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-in-charge-in-bihar-to-launch-next-round-meetings-to-revamp-state-unit-101613192939381.html

The operation was jointly carried out by the Border Security Force (BSF) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).According to people aware of the developments, the NCB got a tip about an attempt to smuggle in drugs from the Pakistan side. The officials laid a trap at the IB.At around 2:30 am, the team heard some sound along the fence and fired eight rounds from 9 mm Beretta. At 2:45 am, another similar attempt was made in the Amritsar sector and a vigilant soldier of the BSF fired three rounds in the direction of the sound.During preliminary search, a PVC pipe and 14 packets of contraband were recovered from the first spot. A packet of heroin hanging on the fence and another in a wheat field about 10 metres from there was found at the second.The soldiers also recovered a body, about 25 metres from the IB. The patrol party had followed a blood trail, which led it to the dead body.People aware of the development say that the body is believed to be that of a smuggler who tried to run towards Pakistan after getting shot. One mobile phone, one magazine and a pistol have been found in his possession.This comes a day after the BSF troops found a plastic pipe and saw footmarks on both sides of the border fence in Chanmullah, in the Amritsar sector.An FIR was lodged in connection with the case and area domination beefed up in the wake of dense fog, which has shrouded the area for the past two days.Such attempts are regularly carried out from the Pakistani side to fund terrorism activities in India, the people cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-forces-thwart-drug-smuggling-attempt-at-international-border-101613192716109.html

Today, four people run the country — hum do, hamare do,” Gandhi had said, without taking any name.Click here for the live updates from the Lok SabhaNirmala Sitharaman used the same slogan and said though Congress comes up with "very good schemes", it lacks the will of using those schemes properly as those schemes turn into devices to only favour "cronies" and "hum do hamare do"."Take the credit of giving birth to MNREGA. But also take credit for mismanaging it, for giving money to ghost workers," Sitharaman said.Addressing Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor, Sitharaman said, "Kerala invited one crony to develop a port — no bidding, just invitation. Because Kerala has no damad, Damad is here. Damads get land in states which are governed by some parties - Rajasthan, Haryana once upon a time""The budget combines stimulus with reforms and has an element to provide impetus to make India one of the top economies of the world in the coming decades. The budget took a courageous approach," the finance minister said.Attacking the tradition of India's post-Independence 'licence quota raj' Sitharaman said, "This budget draws on the experience of Prime Minister when he was the chief minister of Gujarat. He saw how licence raj constricted India's economy."Since Jan Sangh days, respecting India's entrepreneur skill and India's taxpayers has been followed, Nirmala Sitharaman said amid resistance from opposition leaders that the reference to Jan Sangh was irrelevant.

He said, “With collaborative efforts, we aim to rehabilitate a total of 50 slums by the year-end while rest 60 will be rehabilitated by 2022.”For eradicating manual scavenging the civic body has procured a spider-shaped robot.\ic ‘bandicoot’.“Abolishing the inhuman practice of manual scavenging, our sanitation staff will clean and unclog clean septic tanks and manholes with the help of robots and machines. We will also set up three sanitary napkin packaging units in the city providing employment opportunities to women. Besides, women living in slums will be given better reproductive health facilities and family planning counseling,” he said.UNPF’s representative Argentina Matavel Piccin, who virtually attended the programme, said, “Slums are the major area which contribute to the increase of urban population. Overall development of any city can’t be achieved without the development of slums.”The PMC has also geared up for the installment of CCTV cameras at 500 places in Patna to enhance surveillance for checking crime and traffic norm violations along with construction of 25 public toilets.

13-02-2021||India||Better 'immune training' in poorer countries led to fewer Covid-19 deaths: CSIR||“Immune training” through repeated exposure to infections in poorer countries has led to fewer deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in comparison to those that have a high GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and Human Development Index, says a study by researchers at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.The study, recently published in the journal Current Science, looked at the co-relation between Covid-19 deaths and various factors such as urbanisation, sanitation, and population level prevalence of autoimmune diseases.“Better sanitation leads to poorer ‘immune training’ and thus could be leading to higher (deaths per million),” the study said.“From the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen that a higher number of Covid-19 deaths were reported from high income countries. We wanted to look at the reasons. And, we found improved hygiene and better sanitation co-related with more deaths. So did a higher age profile of the population,” said Dr Shekhar Mande, director general of CSIR.He said, “In Covid-19, once the virus enters the body it starts making copies of itself leading to the symptoms and the body fights it off by the tenth or twelfth day. However, around the eighth or ninth day, the body’s immune system goes into hyper-drive in some people and this is what kills them. So, we started looking at prevalence of other auto-immune conditions and these are the same countries that have a high prevalence of such diseases; there was a good co-relation.”The researchers found a high co-relation of Covid-19 deaths with auto-immune conditions such as multiple sclerosis (a condition where the body’s immune system attacks the layer covering the nerve fibres), rheumatoid arthritis (where the immune system attacks the joint linings), type-1 diabetes (where the immune system destroys the insulin-making cells), and psoriasis (where the immune system attacks the skin cells and increases its production abnormally).The study also looked at BCG vaccination coverage; several studies had hypothesised that countries with high anti-tuberculosis vaccine coverage saw fewer deaths because it trained the innate immune system of the body. However, the study found “negligible” correlation between the two.“Although our study shows that countries with poorer hygiene practices and sanitation had fewer Covid-19 deaths, it does not advocate maintaining the poor hygiene conditions. The best way to reduce Covid-19 deaths is to protect against the infection by wearing masks. Other studies done by our lab have shown that Covid-19 is majorly airborne and wearing a mask can reduce the chances of getting the infection considerably,” said Dr Mande.The study also added, “This analysis opens up avenues to consider ‘immune training’ with possibilities of microbiome therapies to supplement improved hygiene and sanitation practices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/better-immune-training-in-poorer-countries-led-to-fewer-covid-19-deaths-csir-101613189126922.html
13-02-2021||India||Tajikistan earthquake: Tremors shake cities in north India, Pakistan||People across North India felt strong tremors as an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 on the Richter scale struck near Tajikistan, according to India’s National Center for Seismology. People rushed out of their homes in Kashmir and Punjab and in other parts of north India, fearing the intensity of the tremors. Tremors were also felt across Pakistan’s Islamabad, Lahore and Peshawar.Initially, the seismology department erroneously had said that the epicentre was Punjab’s Amritsar, citing the depth of the earthquake at 19km. The national seismology department then confirmed that the earthquake was centred at Tajikistan in central Asia.“The epicentre is in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region where the Indo Australian plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. It's a seismically highly active area. The tremors have been felt across Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi NCR. However, we haven’t received any reports of damage yet,” said JL Gautam, head of operations, National Centre for Seismology (NCS) told Hindustan Times.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh also tweeted expressing concerns after reports of people rushing outside their houses due to the quakes were reported across Twitter.The United States Geological Survey said that the earthquake’s magnitude was 5.9 and centred 35 km west of Murghob in Tajikistan, Central Asia, according to news agency Reuters. The location was a sparsely populated area 420 km east of Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe, said Tajikistan Emergency Situations Ministry on Friday.AP Pandey, a seismologist at the National Centre for Seismology, told Hindustan Times that the earthquake which happened in the Himalayan region was strong enough as its tremors were felt throughout the several north Indian states. He said, “As we know the Indian and the Eurasian plates are colliding, so the Himalayas are always active.

13-02-2021||India||Centre allows expansion of Odisha's Kulda coal mine despite air pollution fears||-The Union environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) has recommended environmental clearance for expanding the capacity of the Kulda opencast coal mine in Odisha’s Sundargarh district by 20%, overriding opposition by residents concerned over the project’s impact on their health, agriculture and water bodies.The mine’s output will now increase from the current 14 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) to 19.60 MTPA.The clearance was recommended on condition that Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) which owns the mine, will plant 100,000 native trees with broad leaves along the villages and 50,000 trees along the transportation route in two years to prevent air pollution, according to the latest minutes of the EAC published on the Parivesh website.The EAC has also directed MCL to operationalise three air quality monitoring stations by March, update related data in real time on the company website and display it in the mining lease area.Residents of nine villages in Himgiri Tehsil of Sundargarh district had written to the EAC last month that the MCL did not comply with conditions of the green clearance recommended in February 2018 for capacity expansion from 10 MTPA to 14 MTPA.In February 2018, an environmental clearance was granted only for a year, but it was extended to 30 years in January 2020. According to locals, the mine has not complied with environmental conditions since 2007, when it started producing coal.MCL, in its compliance reports, submitted that it had avoided transporting coal through any village. Residents have countered that claim with pictures of coal being transported through village roads.“The route through which transportation happens is flanked on both sides by our agricultural fields. The heavy dust pollution caused by the transportation has been damaging our crop production continuously,” the villagers said in their letter to the EAC last month.“The paddy cultivated by us in the last year was not sold at any mandi or with any vendor as they rejected it because of its quality and blackened colour as a result of the coal dust. This has become a grave threat to our lives and livelihoods. The coal dust also causes respiratory and breathing issues for the residents of the villages along which transportation happens.”A spokesperson for Coal India Limited, of which MCL is a subsidiary, said he was not in a position to comment on the opposition by locals. “We will get information and then respond,” the spokesperson said.Virendra Pradhan of the Jan Shakti Vikas Parishad, which represents 45 villages, alleged that MCL had lied to the EAC that coal was being transported through a coal corridor.“But there is no coal corridor, coal is transported on PWD (Public Works Department) roads through 45 villages....We feel choked because there is coal everywhere. People are not able to hear each other properly because of noise and our children have stopped going to anganwadis and schools because we fear they will be run over by trucks. We will continue our protests,” he added.Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research think tank, said the approach to enforcing environmental regulations presented at least three areas of concern.“First, expansions of the current scale are exempt from public hearings based on recent amendments made by the environment ministry. This has once again reduced the decision making to being a bilateral matter between a mining company and the central government,” she said“Second, the EAC has allowed the expansion despite full knowledge that the non-compliance of environmental safeguards has resulted in massive pollution in the area which in turn has impacted health, food security and mobility of people living around the mining and transportation routes. Third, neither the ministry nor the project authorities have carried out a risk assessment of extending the impact footprint despite heavy and publicly reported opposition in the area,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-allows-expansion-of-odisha-s-kulda-coal-mine-despite-air-pollution-fears-101613187028676.html

Moreover, it is also not easy to make such a tattoo which is on the forearm of the complainant if there is some resistance from the other side,” justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said in the judgment.“It is not everybody’s job and it is also not the case of the prosecutrix that the petitioner had anything to do with the tattoo business,” the court said in its judgment.The woman alleged that the accused forced her to have physical relations with him by threatening and blackmailing her. She asserted that physical relations continued from 2016 till 2019.The accused said the complainant, who was married, loved him and claimed they were in a consensual relationship. He said the FIR was registered only after she failed to convince him to maintain the ties.He also showed the photos of the tattoo on the woman’s arm and said she clicked selfies with him, exchanged garlands, attended festivities, and sent a him a Facebook friend request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-easy-to-force-a-tattoo-delhi-hc-grants-bail-to-rape-accused-101613178661661.html

13-02-2021||India||BJP, Rahul Gandhi in war of words over claims of land being conceded||The Union government and leaders from the Bharatiya Janaya Party (BJP) on Friday hit out at former Congress president Rahul Gandhi for raising questions over the agreement between India and China on troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh, and called his comment an attempt to dampen the morale of the military.Minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy said the Congress MP should question his great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru who “gave India’s land to China”.Reddy was responding to Gandhi’s comments earlier on Friday that “the PM has given away sacred Indian territory to China”, and that the Indian Army held Finger 4 area in Ladakh along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) but now it will move back to its permanent position near Finger 3.“He must ask his great-grandfather (Jawaharlal Nehru) about who has given India’s territory to China, he will get the answer. Who is a patriot and who is not, the public knows it all,” Reddy said.In a press briefing, Gandhi raised questions about the disengagement a day after Union defence minister Rajnath Singh informed the Lok Sabha that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will retreat to its base east of Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso and the Indian Army will move back to its permanent position near Finger 3.“Indian government’s position was status quo ante in April 2020. Now, defence minister comes and makes a statement. We find Indian troops will now be stationed in Finger 3. Finger 4 used to be our territory. Why has PM Modi given our land to the Chinese?” Gandhi asked.“Why they have been asked to move back? There is no word on our most strategic area of Depsang plains. The government is mum on Gogra post and Hot Springs. PM Modi has stooped before China and given away the land between Finger 3 and Finger 4 to the Chinese,” he said.“There is no strategic advantage. Chinese were in our land. Our soldiers risked everything they had to go to Kailash ranges. Now PM has given back land and status quo ante is irrelevant. This is absolute 100% cowardice. The Prime Minister is a coward who can’t stand up to the Chinese,” Gandhi added.The Union defence ministry said in a statement that contrary to certain misleading reports being circulated, India had not ceded any territory as a result of the disengagement agreement.Senior BJP leader and Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi accused Gandhi, who is a member of the Lok Sabha from Wayanad, of demoralising the Indian security forces. “There is no cure if they (the Congress) are engaged in conspiracy to defame the country... they are trying to break the morale of the security forces,” Naqvi said.This is not the first time that the BJP and the Congress have sparred over defence and strategic issues. The BJP has in the past accused the Congress in general and Gandhi in particular of disrespecting the forces, questioning their defence preparedness and raising doubts about operations.In December 2018, Gandhi said that the Indian Army had conducted three surgical strikes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power but those operations were kept under wraps at the force’s insistence and accused the BJP government of turning a targeted September 2016 operation into a “political asset” to garner votes during the Uttar Pradesh elections.The BJP retorted by accusing him of insulting Indian soldiers. In response to Gandhi’s comment, the then BJP chief Amit Shah dubbed the statement as “an insult to the martyrs” of Uri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-rahul-gandhi-in-war-of-words-over-claims-of-land-being-conceded-101613174058496.html
13-02-2021||India||India begins roll-out of second shot today||India will begin administering second doses on Saturday to people who got a coronavirus vaccine 28 days ago when the drive was launched, sending automated SMS messages as well as using direct phone calls to make sure eligible recipients turn up for what will be a new logistical challenge for a campaign that is the most complex and voluminous than seen anywhere in the world.Government experts said recipients will not need to take their second doses exactly at the 28-day mark but a window of two weeks will be given – which means the doses will need to be taken 4-6 weeks after the first were administered.On January 16, over 202,000 people got the first doses.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“The second dose can be given any time between four to six weeks. That’s the window period that we have,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health) of Niti Aayog, who took his first Covaxin dose on the launch day of January 16 and is likely to take the shot on Monday.“Though I am eligible to take the shot on February 13, I am most likely to take the second dose on Monday (February 15) as I am away,” he said.The states have been given the flexibility to reschedule appointments in case a beneficiary is not able to make it on the stipulated date. “An alternate date will be given to those who either are not available on the scheduled date assigned to them or miss the slot under certain circumstances,” said Paul.Reminders are being sent at regular intervals through a phone text (SMS) to all beneficiaries listed to take the shot.“There are people on job to ensure not a single beneficiary is missed. The second shot can actually be taken even up to eight weeks after having taken the first shot but the sooner it is the better, which is why up to six weeks is what is being told,” said Dr NK Arora, National Task Force member on Covid-19 vaccines.Dr Arora said he will take the second shot on Wednesday. “I have been scheduled on February 17 for taking the second dose. Even though February 13 the second dose process should start, I believe, the numbers will pick up after the weekend,” he added.Also Read | 4k health workers in line to get second Covid-19 vaccine shot todayA senior official, who asked not to be named, said the health ministry was confident of covering everyone who needs to take the second dose. “There is no question of people falling through the cracks as we have real-time information on who all have taken the first dose. It is all QR-coded and any changes automatically get updated on the digital database that the central and state governments can access. Teams are working to mobilise recipients and inform them about their next dosage schedule,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity.As on Friday, India has vaccinated 7.8 million people with first doses since January 16. While this is the quickest any country has delivered these many doses, India also faces one of the tallest targets – it has set a rough deadline of July-end to inoculate 300 million (roughly the population of the United States of America) of the people who make up the three priority groups: health workers, frontline staffers and people above the age of 50.Asked if India might miss the deadline, Arora said the said the campaign will be ramped up significantly in order to catch up. “We are looking at vaccinating 5 million beneficiaries per day in future as we have the capacity. In Polio, the government managed to vaccinate 170 million children in a week. So, it is not that big a target and will be achieved comfortably,” he said.According to HT’s tally of vaccinations based on figures released by states, there was an average of roughly 400,000 vaccinations every day over the last week.“It is marathon that we are trying to run and will pick up pace gradually. Everything will depend on the digital platform, Co-WIN, as it is a new software and we had to see how it functioned in real-time. Now that the platform has been streamlined, we can scale up in no time,” Arora added.Health experts said that next couple of months will determine how soon the vaccination process for the initial population groups is completed. “We still have got some time to see how things pan out. The pace has to be picked up, obviously, and it will depend on factors such as opening up vaccines for general population beyond the essential services; and how many more Indian vaccines get regulatory approvals so that more options open up. By April-May there should be some more vaccines approved and we will know how well the pace is picked,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.In Delhi, health workers said they have already begun reaching out to people.“After receiving the first dose of the vaccine, the recipients were given a card with details of when their next dose would be given. An automatic message is also sent by the CoWIN portal. However, we are not taking any chances. We have asked all the centres to call the beneficiaries and inform them that they are due for the next dose,” said a senior official from Northeast district in Delhi, which has been reporting the highest vaccination coverage.The officials said that the beneficiaries for now do not have a choice of where they will get the second dose.“Their names are listed against the centre where they received the first dose and will get the second dose there itself. For now, there is no option of changing the centre for the second dose,” said an official from Shahadara district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-begins-roll-out-of-second-shot-today-101613170746995.html

They said some of the bodies were charred beyond recognition.The fire broke out around 1.45 pm at Sree Mariammal Fireworks, a licensed unit under the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) in Achankulam area.According to initial reports, the fire broke out when workers were handling chemicals inside the unit. The blaze quickly spread to nearby sheds and caused minor blasts.Virudhunagar district collector R Kannan said the unit employed about 70 people. “Some of them were out for lunch,” he said. “One of those inside who regained consciousness told us about what happened.”He said a first information report was filed against the factory owner. Police were looking for him till the time of going to press.Kannan said some of the bodies were badly damaged. “We couldn’t even identify if they were male or female,” he said.Rescue operations went on for a couple of hours. Ambulances and fire-tenders were pressed into service. Locals too rushed in for help.Of those undergoing treatment, at least four people sustained more than 90% burns, a senior health official said, requesting anonymity. “One person died during treatment.”Those injured have been admitted to three government hospitals in Sattur, Kovilpatti and Sivakasi. Medical assistance was also brought in from the neighbouring Madurai district, officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an ex-gratia payment of ₹200,000 each to the families of those killed and ₹50,000 each to those severely injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.“Fire at a firecracker factory in Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu is saddening. In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. I hope those injured recover soon. Authorities are working on the ground to assist those affected,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) tweeted.Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced an ex-gratia of ₹3 lakh each to the families of those killed and ₹1 lakh each for those critically injured.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi appealed to the state government to provide immediate “rescue, support and relief”. “Heartfelt condolences to the victims of the firecracker factory fire in Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu...,” he tweeted.Virudhunagar district is known for its firecracker manufacturing units. Accidents are common, especially in Sivakasi. Ten years ago, 11 people were killed in three separate incidents in Sivakasi. Between July and August 2009, over 40 were killed in five separate fire incidents.“These fires are a recurring event and its always the workers who pay the price,” said Dharmesh Shah, a policy researcher and activist who has worked with firecracker labourers.“Ironically, it’s the same workers whose jobs the fireworks industry claims to protect every time there is a talk of a ban. If the industry is that concerned about its workers, it ought to treat them better and allocate more resources towards the health and safety of its staff,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-killed-in-tamil-nadu-fireworks-unit-blaze-101613165358954.html

The bill intends to replace an ordinance issued on November 4, 2020.Prasad justified the ordinance route for the law, saying that it saves public money and also emboldens the legal options to act against any fraud even after an arbitrator has given his adjudication.With courts flooded with public interest litigations, the law minister took the opportunity to also appeal to the courts to only take “genuine” public interest litigations so that their time is not wasted. “Today I appeal to the judiciary to exercise their discretion in selecting the genuine PILs,” Prasad said, adding that elected representatives should be the sole authority to handle governance issues.The law minister said that under the law, which allows ample opportunities to create India as an arbitration hub, India will welcome foreign arbitrators. He further informed the House that the government is in touch with experts to seek suggestions on this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-be-a-hub-for-foreign-arbitrators-law-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad-101613164826341.html
13-02-2021||India||‘First repeal farm laws’: Rahul Gandhi, BKU's Tikait intensify attack on PM||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Friday continued their attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government over the new farm laws at separate mahapanchayats in Haryana and Rajasthan, respectively.Addressing a rally in Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh district, Gandhi claimed that the new laws will render 40% of the people who are engaged in farming jobless, and the control will slip into the hands of corporates. “Agriculture protects food security of the country and India’s 40% people are dependent on agriculture which means crores of people are part of it, including small traders, workers, commission agents and others. The Congress has always tried that this business should not go to a single entity and it should stay in the hands of 40% people,” he said.Also Read | Playing by own rules, Rakesh Tikait propels farm protests into UPFor nearly three months, farm unions have camped outside Delhi demanding repeal of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which farmers say favour big corporations. The Centre has refuted the concerns, and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but talks are currently locked in a stalemate.The Congress leader urged the Centre to scrap the three agricultural laws before further talks with farmers. “PM Modi says in Parliament that he wants to talk to the farmers but what talks do you want with farmers? End these laws first and then farmers will talk to you. You are snatching away land and the future of the farmers and asking for talks with them, there is no need for talks. First cancel these farm laws and then talk to farmers,” he said.State BJP president, Rajasthan, Satish Punia said that “Rahul Gandhi should first reply on the poll promises made regarding farm loan waiver as still farm loans have not been waived off in the State which was promised during last assembly polls”. He said that the Congress is misleading farmers on the issue of farm laws which are brought by Modi government for the benefit of the farmers.In Haryana’s Bahadurgarh, Tikait, too, hit out at the Centre. “These people are making an attempt to store the food leading to increase in hunger. They are traders of hunger and they want to make a business of hunger in the country. Bukh ke saudagar ko jana hoga, ye lutreon ka aakhire badshah hoga, esko nahi jamne denge, esko jana hoga (The man, who is involved in the business of hunger will have to go, he (referring to Modi) will be the last ruler of robbers, we will not allow him to settle here and he will have to go now,” the BKU spokesperson added.Going firm on the demand for repeal of the agricultural laws, Tikait warned the Modi government that there will be “no ghar wapsi” till their demands are fulfilled.“We will not go back home until the barricades and iron spikes placed on Delhi’s borders are removed and their demands are met. The government has asked their people to build storage houses before bringing these three laws. If these laws were implemented, the corporates will control the market and they will ensure heavy barricading outside their storage house and a greedy man can’t be able to get a roti in the same way we can’t cross Delhi’s borders due to heavy barricades,” he added.The BKU further alleged that the people of Gujarat were being jailed by the government if they want to join the protest.“ The police have stepped up security outside the house of those who want to join our stir. The people are not allowed to come in trains to join our stir. We will visit Gujarat and ensure that the people should get freedom there too. The farmers from Karnataka and other parts of the country will start a march towards Delhi, if needed. The government has been banning our vehicles after a span of 10 years but the police are using the same vehicles for more than 20 years and without having any insurance cover. We will go back only, if these laws are repealed and after a formulation of committee to discuss hundreds of other issues related to farming,” Tikait said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-repeal-farm-laws-rahul-gandhi-bku-s-tikait-intensify-attack-on-pm-101613164471089.html
13-02-2021||India||Congress names Mallikarjun Kharge as Rajya Sabha leader of Opposition||The Congress has nominated Mallikarjun Kharge as the new Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Rajya Sabha, party chief Sonia Gandhi informed Upper House chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Friday -- three days before the incumbent Ghulam Nabi Azad’s term comes to an end.Ever since Kharge was brought in to the Upper House last year, despite his defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, party insiders speculated that he is tipped to succeed Azad.Kharge, a Dalit leader, was the floor leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha between 2014 and 2019 and Union minister for railway and labour. He was also appointed as the party general secretary in charge of Maharashtra.In the party circles, Kharge is considered very close to Congress’s former president Rahul Gandhi. His nomination also signals that the party will be less accommodating while negotiating with the government for floor management and will work more in tandem with Gandhi’s line of action against the government. Recently, Gandhi was disappointed to see the party’s Rajya Sabha leaders participating in the debate on President’s speech while their Lok Sabha counterparts continued protests to demand a separate discussion on farm laws.According to party leaders, Azad had suggested to the party leadership that after his exit, the deputy leader Anand Sharma should be promoted as the LoP. Both Azad and Sharma were part of the group of 23 senior leaders who demanded sweeping changes in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-names-mallikarjun-kharge-as-rajya-sabha-leader-of-opposition-101613163256686.html
13-02-2021||India||Budget aims to uplift poor, Oppn is spreading false narrative: FM Sitharaman||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the Union Budget 2021-22 aims to attain sustainable growth for an Aatmanirbhar Bharat (a self-reliant India) with enhanced allocations to key sectors and focus on uplifting the poor, but the Opposition was spreading a “false narrative” that the government was working for the rich.Speaking on the budget in the Rajya Sabha, Sitharaman said the budget was drawn from the experience of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, known for his commitment to development, growth and reform, and it was through these three things that Aatmanirbhar Bharat would be attained.Citing global recognition to India’s effective handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, she said: “False narratives were created... There is a lot of grudge in the speech of the former finance minister [referring to Congress leader P Chidambaram]... not to recognise how honourable Prime Minister handled the corona crisis. Today the entire world is seeing how we in India have had less deaths per million, we in India have less active cases when there are countries which are seeing wave after wave [of Covid-19]...”Chidambaram attacked the Modi government in the House on Thursday, calling its Budget a “disappointing” one, and labelling it a “budget for the rich, of the rich, and by the rich”. Earlier last week, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said in a tweet: “Modi’s crony centric budget means- Struggling MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises] given no low interest loans, no GST relief. The employers of India’s largest workforce betrayed.”Reacting to the criticism, Sitharaman said: “It’s now become a sort of habit for some in the Opposition to constantly allege whatever this government is doing... False narrative is created to accuse saying, oh, this government works only for cronies.”She provided details of some of the work done by the government for the poor, including the completion of over 16.7 million houses for the poor under the PM Aawas Yojana, more than 26.7 million homes having been electrified since October 2017 and the total value of orders placed in the government’s e-marketplace being ₹8,22,077 crore. Sitharaman said all these benefits had gone to the poor and small enterprises and not to the rich.She said the total verified applications on the national scholarship portal were over 90 million and these people were getting scholarships. “Whom are these fellowships going? Are they going for the rich? Are they going for the capitalists? Are they going for the cronies who the UPA government had happily encouraged? And now to stand up [in the House], and each time create the false narrative,” she said.Also Read | ‘Very important business’: BJP issues 3-line whip to Lok Sabha membersSitharaman said approximately 16.9 million farmers were registered with e-NAM or the online National Agriculture Market to get connected across the country for better prices for their produce and not “constricted” by the local market. “Are these farmers rich, corporate farmers? No, not at all, they are small farmers,” she said.Speaking about the government’s disinvestment policy, Sitharaman said it was part of the reform process initiated in 1991. “The entire range the Congress party covered from high socialism [to] hybrid socialism with Indira Gandhiji’s Congress... which was nothing but ‘license-quota raj’. And from there to 91 [1991] without blinking an eyelid... They moved from the high socialism to come down to opening globalisation and everything else,” she said.Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda said, “In about seven years of BJP government, on the economy, there is a big difference between what BJP says and does, and this budget also reflects the same.”Sitharaman said the Modi government’s policy is consistent with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Jan Sangh’s ideology of “Antodaya” or to take care of the people at the bottom of the rung. “At the same time, respect wealth creators, respect taxpayers, all citizens will have to be respected,” she said.Sitharaman said the criticism that the health and defence budget had been curtailed was incorrect and quoted the World Health Organization that water and sanitation were integral parts of health care. “So, increased allocation for water has been based on the objective to provide tap water to ensure health for all,” she said.Even the budget allocations to health departments per se had been substantially increased, she said. According to her, the budget allocations to the ministry of health and family welfare were raised by 9.6%, to the ministry of ayush by 40%, and to health research by 26.8% (year-on-year comparison with budget estimates or BE). Similarly, defence (revenue) saw 1.3% growth in the budget and defence (capital expenditure) grew by 18.8%, she said.Ram Singh, professor at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), said the Budget for FY-22 has elements of realism, which is reflected in enhanced allocation in capital expenditure. “It is tailored to revive the economy in the short-run and accelerate the growth rate in the medium terms. The government expenditure is well targeted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-aims-to-uplift-poor-oppn-is-spreading-false-narrative-fm-sitharaman-101613162727411.html

One AK-56 assault rifle was also recovered from the spot, he said.“The search operation will continue to arrest the suspected abductors who escaped taking advantage of the nearby jungle,” he said, urging people not to give shelter to such miscreants.The Chief Minister also lauded the Imphal East police team for successfully rescuing the workers. He announced that commendation certificates would be given to all the personnel and officers, who took part in the day’s operation.Later in a Facebook post on Friday afternoon, Biren Singh wrote, “Well done Imphal East District Police and Commando team for rescuing three labourers from their kidnappers today. Handed over a cash reward of ₹10 lakh for their bravery and the police team will also be awarded the Chief Minister's commendation certificates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-police-team-gets-rs-10-lakh-reward-for-saving-3-workers-from-militants-101613160538461.html
13-02-2021||India||Playing by own rules, Rakesh Tikait propels farm protests into UP||When, after months of peaceful protests, a group of farmers stormed the Red Fort and clashed with police in the Capital on January 26, farm unions feared the violent episode could spell the end of their gritty movement.Instead, Rakesh Tikait, a beefy leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), an influential farmers’ organisation, has managed to re-energise the protests and entrenched them in a new avatar in his home turf, the politically crucial sugarcane belt of western Uttar Pradesh. His model is now being replicated in other states as well, just as the model led by farmers from Punjab and Haryana, tens of thousands who are camped at Delhi’s Tikri and Singhu borders since November 26, was being replicated by Tikait’s group at the Ghazipur border.Also Read | Police escort Tikait’s car for ‘security’ near UP GateSince January 28, when the UP Police attempted to vacate the Ghazipur site only to see its number swell, Tikait has been holding a series of “kisan mahapanchayats”, or rural conclaves — respected village institutions of the landed Jat community where social decisions taken by elders are binding.Under him, therefore, the farmers’ protest against three new agricultural laws has branched off into a regional uprising. Analysts say his strategies diverge from those devised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the national platform of farm unions, in two ways.First, he has built a groundswell of support for the agitation by raising local farm issues, such as the problems of sugarcane growers, aside from the larger demand of scrapping the farm laws.Second, while farm unions at the national level have vowed to keep their agitation off-limits for political parties, Tikait has departed somewhat from this strategy. Prominent politicians from Opposition parties are freely attending his mahapanchayats, and speaking in them.Also Read | Farmers' protest: 'Ghar wapsi' only after laws are repealed, says Rakesh TikaitThe Tikaits belong to the Baliyan khap, a dominant clan among the Jat agrarian community in western UP, most which is made up of sugarcane growers. They voted overwhelmingly for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha, and the 2017 assembly elections.On February 5, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Jayant Chaudhary attended the “mahapanchayat” in Bhainswal village in Shamli, a Jat-dominated region of western Uttar Pradesh. On Wednesday, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi attended another gathering of farmers at Chilkana, Saharanpur to protest against the new farm laws.Politicians from the RLD and Samajwadi Party have so far attended gatherings in Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor, Mathura, Baghpat and Shamli, all in western UP.This sugarcane belt was the “ground zero” of the deadly Jat-Muslim clashes in 2013, which polarised votes in favour of the BJP since then. Analysts say the Jat-Muslim religious divide is now being bridged because of the farmers’ agitation. The Bhainswal mahapanchayat had seen heavy participation from Muslims.“Mahapanchayats have different connotations in rural settings. The current farmers’ agitation is being organised by informal all-inclusive mahapanchayats, which historically have great respect among the people,” said Sudhir Panwar, a professor of Lucknow University.“These mahapanchayats are a true extension of the diffused leadership. The classic example was the Bhainswal mahapanchayat which was inclusive of all castes of Hindus and Muslims,” he said.The glue for farmers in western Uttar Pradesh is an age-old problem of sugarcane farmers: pending dues from millers. “The government must ensure that all sugarcane arrears are paid. There are no bonuses on cane price this year. Why? The government must answer,” Tikait said. According to official data, millers owe nearly ₹11,000 crore to cane farmers in Uttar Pradesh in unpaid dues.Farmers have been camping for months on national highways leading into Delhi to demand the repeal of a set of laws approved by Parliament in September last year. The government has said that the laws will bring investments in the farm sector and give farmers more market access. Farmers say the laws will threaten their livelihoods by forcing them to sell to corporate giants instead of government-regulated markets.Tikait’s mahapanchayats in western Uttar Pradesh are now set to be replicated in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Darshan Pal, a prominent farm leader from Punjab, said mahapanchayats will be held in Bahadurgarh Bypass (Haryana) on February 13, Sri Ganganagar (Rajasthan) on February 18, Hanumangarh (Rajasthan) on February 19 and Sikar (Rajasthan) on February 23.Their success would fly in the face of the government’s assertion that the farmers’ agitation is limited to the two states of Punjab and Haryana, said political analyst Milind Sharma of Osmania University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/playing-by-own-rules-rakesh-tikait-propels-farm-protests-into-up-101613160140393.html
13-02-2021||India||SC/ST intake drops in departments across IITs, shows govt data||Fifteen of 31 departments at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi, and 16 of 26 in IIT-Bombay did not admit any scheduled caste (SC) student last year in their doctoral programmes as part of a broader trend of lower recruitment from marginalised communities at the PhD level in these prestigious institutions, data furnished by government in Parliament shows.When it came to enrolment of scheduled tribe (ST) students at the doctoral level, 19 departments at IIT-Delhi and five at IIT-Bombay didn’t admit any in 2020, according to the same dataset.The data was part of a response by the Union education ministry to a question by CPI(M) Lok Sabha member S Venkatesan in the Lok Sabha. The answer covered 23 IITs and provided information on SC,ST, other backward class (OBC)and economically backward class (EWS) students at the PhD level.At all levels, the numbers were lower than the designated level of representation fixed by the government’s reservation policy: 15% for SC, 7.5% for ST, 27% for OBC and 10% for EWS.Data showed some of the newer IITs had very few doctoral students from marganisalised communities. In IIT-Tirupati and IIT-Palakkad, there were zero ST student admissions in any department at the PhD level in 2020, while in IIT-Bhilai, IIT-Goa and IIT-Dharwad, there was just one ST doctoral student admission in the entire institute last year.Overall, the number of students stood far lower than the mandated quota. At IIT-Delhi, the percentage of SC doctoral student admission was around 7%, that of ST students around 2.5% and OBC students at 18%. These figures in 2019 stood at 6.4%, 1% and 15%, respectively, according to official data.At IIT-Bombay, the percentage of SC doctoral student admission was around 5%, that of ST students was 11% and OBC around 3%. These numbers stood at 8%, 1% and 20% respectively in 2019.At IIT-Madras, the percentage of SC doctoral admission was around 10%, ST around 3% and OBC around 23.5%. These figures stood at 8%, 4% and 24% in 2019.Many of the institutes refused to officially comment on the data, but some officials connected with PhD recruitment pointed out that the 2020 admission process was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown imposed to arrest its spread, because the digital divide and poor internet access hurt poor and marginalised students in particular.IIT-Bombay said the institute strictly followed the government’s reservation policy and undertook extra efforts and lower cut off marks to fulfil the quota criteria.“IITs have very high expectations of our student input, which is needed to carry out research towards a PhD. While we do get sufficient candidates in certain departments, in some other departments, students of the required calibre tend to take up industry jobs rather than join for a PhD which has extra uncertainties and lower income levels during PhD and in some areas even post PhD. It is possible that the family background and economic level may have an impact on such candidates applying for a PhD,” it said in a statement.IIT-Kharagpur refused to comment on the matter. IIT-Madras, too, didn’t respond officially but a senior faculty member at the institute said the low numbers was a general problem across IITs.“A PhD research program is not like a curriculum where you can bring them up if they are weak by giving extra time and coaching. Research requires a certain level of academic credentials to even get started where these candidates often lack and so we have to consider this as a larger problem from its root,” he said.He said IIT-Madras received 7000-8000 PhD applications annually. “We finally select 400 from that large pool so the competition is really tough. But we do care and go easy on the initial filtration so SC/ST candidates can come in for interviews and we work towards applying the government’s reservation,” he said.IIT-Delhi refused to officially comment on the data but a senior official at the institute said the reason for no enrolment in certain categories of PhD courses was “unavailability” of eligible candidates. “In IIT-D we could not even fill all the seats in general category since we did not get enough eligible candidates. We could have admitted 200 more PhD students last year if we had candidates available. It’s not that IIT-D is discriminating or something,” the official added.Experts said the problem of lower enrolment at the PhD level was a longstanding problem, especially at prestigious institutions such as IITs and pointed to more systemic problems such as poor access to high-quality school education.“For first generation learners or Dalit students, we have to see how school education is. Also, science education in mofussil towns or villages is generally dismal. Government should try to strengthen school education and science learning to build a strong base,” said Vivek Kumar, a professor of sociology at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. “The problem is not of merit, it is of practice and access to quality education,” he added.Hansraj Suman, the chairperson of Delhi University’s (DU) SC, ST, and OBC teachers’ association, demanded the Centre intervene to resolve the matter. “There is no dearth of candidates but these institutes don’t find them eligible. Even after passing the entrance exams, the SC/ST candidates face discrimination during the interviews. The government should immediately seek a report,” he said.(With inputs from Fareeha Iftikhar in Delhi, Priyanka Sahoo in Mumbai, and Divya Chandrababu in Chennai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scst-intake-drops-in-departments-across-iits-shows-govt-data-101613159889432.html
13-02-2021||India||TMC’s stand against Left, Congress raises questions in poll-bound Bengal||The strike was called in protest against baton charge and use of tear gas shells by the police during an agitation in Kolkata and Howrah by youth and student fronts of the Left parties on Thursday. To stop the young men from marching to Nabanna, the state secretariat, and voice their demand for jobs, the police even erected barricades similar to the ones witnessed during the farmers’ agitation in Delhi.The BJP alleged that with such a crackdown the ruling party is making space for the Left and Congress and helping them paw into the anti-establishment votes that helped the saffron camp rise in Bengal. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the Left contested as opponents while the BJP won 18 of the 42 seats, thanks to a huge swing in Left votes towards the saffron camp.Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Friday did not support the general strike, calling it anti-development, and alleged that the TMC is helping the Left and Congress regain ground.“This is part of Mamata Banerjee’s tactics to dig into the BJP’s vote share,” said Ghosh.The allegation came against the backdrop of the soft stance TMC chief Mamata Banerjee and her leaders took towards the CPI (M) in January while her follower-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari openly appealed to Left and Congress workers to help the BJP oust the ruling party. “I appeal to our friends in Left Front and Congress to attend rallies of their parties but vote for us in the interest of Bengal,” Adhikari said at a rally in West Burdwan district in January.The Left Front’s decision to announce a general strike at such short notice surprised many since this was not the first time the police used force to disperse Left agitators. The Indian Secular Front, a new platform launched by popular cleric Pirzada Abbasuddin Siddiqui from Hooghly district, also supported the strike. Siddiqui has shown keenness to have a seat-sharing arrangement with the Left and Congress.Although Bengal’s Marxists took part in the all-India strikes called by trade unions and farmers’ fronts in the recent past, they did not organise any Bengal bandh in at least five years, Left leaders said. In 2016, the Left trade unions had called a general strike in Bengal but it saw poor response.In sharp contrast, roads, highways and railway tracks were blocked in parts of every district on Friday. Shops and established were closed in parts of north Bengal too where the BJP made maximum inroads in 2019. “Railway services were affected in several sections in the morning,” said K D Das, chief public relations officer of the Eastern Railways.“In a way, the strike helped the Left parties evaluate their presence on the ground,” said Manoj Bhattacharya, state secretary of the Revolutionary Socialist Party, a partner in the Left Front.CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who was in Kolkata on Friday, claimed that success of the strike proved that a “Left, democratic, secular alternative” is rising and the contest is a triangular one.“How can Mamata Banerjee and Narendra Modi, who rose to power by leading processions, crack down on people’s movements today. They follow the same path and people are rising for their rights. The coming election is not one to seek change in regime but to protect our democratic rights,” Yechury said.“The TMC and BJP have created this narrative on a bi-polar election for their own advantage. It gives the BJP the opportunity to exploit people’s anger against the TMC while the ruling party gets the support of voters with secular views. In 2019, there was no alternative before voters. Now, there is one,” Yechury added.TMC leaders said Yechury and Ghosh were both wrong and the contest remains a bi-polar one. “Mamata Banerjee does not need parties with microscopic presence to win elections,” said a cabinet minister who did not want to be quoted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmcs-stand-against-left-congress-raises-questions-in-poll-bound-bengal-101613158948068.html
13-02-2021||India||Other friction points on table next: Centre||Outstanding problems with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra — friction points on the contested border in eastern Ladakh — will be tackled after full disengagement between rival soldiers in the Pangong Tso area, where mutual withdrawal of front-line troops is underway, the defence ministry said on Friday.This was the first official mention of Depsang, which lies south of Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) in a strategic area that the military calls Sub-Sector North, as a friction point after border tensions began last May.The outstanding issues related to deployment and patrolling at the three friction points will be taken up within 48 hours of pullback of troops deployed on strategic heights on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, the ministry said in a statement.Disengagement in the Pangong Tso area along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) began on Wednesday.Also Read | India has not conceded any territory to China along LAC, says defence ministryIndia has not ceded any territory to China as a result of the disengagement agreement, the ministry said hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given away land in the Finger area on the north bank of Pangong Tso to the neighbour. Gandhi asked why the government was silent on Depsang.“On the contrary, it (the agreement) has enforced observance and respect for LAC and prevented any unilateral change in the status quo,” the statement said. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told reporters that the agreement was reached after several rounds of sustained negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels.Giving out details of the Pangong Tso disengagement plan in Parliament on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh said the PLA will retreat to its base east of Finger 8, the Indian Army will move back to its permanent position near Finger 3 and neither side will patrol the contested areas in between until an agreement is reached through future talks.Singh also told both Houses that India did not “concede anything” during the military talks, and added that there were still some outstanding issues at some other points along the LAC.Disengagement is progressing smoothly in the Pangong Tso area and it could be over in two weeks after which talks would focus on the other friction points, people familiar with the developments said on Friday.“Both sides on Friday withdrew more troops from the area for third straight day. Armoured and artillery elements retreated to their respective positions from heights on the south bank on Thursday. Infantry is now being pulled back,” said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named.Focus will shift to Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra after Pangong Tso.PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Gogra and Hot Springs, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.“The synchronised and simultaneous disengagement process is seemingly progressing as planned. This augurs well for subsequent disengagement from other friction points. While we may not trust the Chinese post the Galwan Valley clash, we need to trust ourselves and the armed forces to protect our interests,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points. It could be a time-consuming process and take several months, said a second official. The external affairs ministry didn’t go into specifics such as the next steps for disengagement during a regular news briefing on Friday, with Srivastava saying these issues were spelt out in Singh’s statements in both Houses.“It will be a long-drawn process and should hopefully be followed by de-escalation and de-induction. There should be some clarity on timelines after the next round of military talks. As long as disengagement is successful, time is not of essence,” said Bhatia.The current disengagement involves pulling back troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline at heights of almost 18,000 feet as well as withdrawing soldiers holding positions on the Kailash range on the south bank.Addressing a press conference, Gandhi said Indian troops will now be stationed at Finger 3 while Finger 4 used to Indian territory.“The assertion that Indian territory is up to Finger 4 is categorically false. The territory of India is as depicted by the map of India and includes more than 43,000sq km currently under illegal occupation of China since 1962,” the defence ministry said.Before PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4, the Indian Army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are 8km apart. The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4.Srivastava responded to questions on why India had agreed to a buffer zone in the area between Finger 4 and Finger 8 by saying that the defence ministry’s statement had set the record straight on “wrongly understood information.”The defence ministry statement said the government had reposed full faith in the armed forces for safeguarding India’s interests and territory in eastern Ladakh.“Those who doubt the achievements made possible by the sacrifices of our military personnel are actually disrespecting them,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/other-friction-points-on-table-next-centre-101613157722822.html
13-02-2021||India||India has received letter from Myanmar's military on coup, says MEA||India said on Friday it had received a letter from Myanmar’s military administration outlining reasons for the removal of the elected government, even as New Delhi continued to engage with other players on the fallout of the February 1 coup.Defying the military government’s call to halt mass gatherings, hundreds of thousands joined pro-democracy demonstrations across Myanmar on Friday. At several places, anti-coup protesters clashed with police, though protests by more than 100,000 people in Yangon were largely peaceful.Friday’s protests were the largest so far, and came a day after US President Joe Biden imposed new sanctions against the top military officials who ordered the coup that removed the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.“Yes, we have received the letter and I believe such a letter has also been sent to other governments,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a news briefing, referring to the letter sent to India by Myanmar’s military administration. He didn’t give details of the letter or India’s response to it.Srivastava said India had already made its position clear soon after the coup on February 1. “We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld,” he said.“As immediate neighbours with close cultural and people-to-people ties as well as relations strengthened by exchanges in trade, economy, security and defence, we are closely monitoring developments in [Myanmar]. We will remain engaged with all concerned on this issue,” he added.The developments in Myanmar figured in telephone conversations between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Biden on February 8 and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his US counterpart Antony Blinken on February 9. “India and the US have agreed to remain in contact and exchange assessments on the situation,” Srivastava said.On Thursday, Jaishankar and his Australian counterpart Marise Payne discussed the situation in Myanmar, reflecting the growing coordination between the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad on the issue.Blinken discussed ways to strengthen cooperation with allies and partners of the US to address the coup in Myanmar during a phone call with Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi on Wednesday.While the US has adopted a tough position on Myanmar in line with Biden’s approach of upholding democratic norms, India has adopted a more cautious position because of security concerns linked to its north-eastern states. India has close ties with both the civilian and military leadership of Myanmar, and the security relationship between the two sides is crucial to tackling militancy in the north-eastern states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-received-letter-from-myanmar-s-military-on-coup-says-mea-101613156313400.html

13-02-2021||India||Supreme Court grants Centre six weeks to decide on Rajoana's pardon||The Supreme Court on Friday gave the Centre six more weeks to decide on granting pardon to Balwant Singh Rajoana, accused of killing former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh in August 1995.The Centre told the Court on Friday that the mercy petition for pardoning Rajoana was still pending with the President of India. Appearing before a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “The petitioner is accused of assassination of former Chief Minister Beant Singh of Punjab possibly over differences over the Khalistan issue. Since the President will take his own decision, the Court may await the decision of the President.”The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked Mehta, “Can you indicate a time-frame.” Mehta requested the Court to have it after six weeks. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi who appeared for Rajoana opposed this request claiming that the man has been in jail for over 25 years. The mercy plea filed on his behalf by various Sikh organizations and individuals have been pending decision since March 2012. Rajoana has neither moved any mercy petition nor appealed against his death sentence before any Court.This is the second consecutive adjournment request by the Centre. On January 8, the Centre informed the Court that the Ministry of Home Affairs had processed the file at its end. On January 25, when the matter was next heard, the Centre sought three weeks claiming, “The government is examining the matter. Under the present circumstances please have it after three weeks.”The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, Amritsar and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee had moved separate mercy pleas seeking pardon for Rajoana in March 2012. The petitions were filed before the President of India under Article 72 of the Constitution. On March 27, 2012, the President’s Secretariat forwarded the two mercy petitions along with several similar appeals received from various organizations and individuals supporting Rajoana’s release to the Ministry of Home Affairs.In his petition filed through advocate Rupesh Kumar, Rajoana had stated that on September 27, 2019, the Centre wrote a letter to Punjab Chief Secretary affirming that the mercy plea of Rajoana is to be processed under Article 72 of the Constitution coinciding with the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. When the same was not done, Rajoana came to the top court to remind the Centre of its resolve.Rajoana was sentenced to death on July 27, 2007, when the trial court found him and his associate Jagtar Singh Hawara guilty of killing the former Chief Minister by triggering a bomb blast at the Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat on August 31, 1995. Later, on October 12, 2010, the Punjab and Haryana High Court confirmed the death penalty on Rajoana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-centre-six-weeks-to-decide-on-rajoana-s-pardon-101613155540050.html

A witness also reported a wall collapse near the northern Indian city of Amritsar, but there were no reports of casualties.Also Read | Earthquake felt in Delhi-NCR, parts of north IndiaG. Suresh, a senior scientist at the IMD, told Reuters there were two earthquakes within 10 minutes in Tajikistan and Sichuan, China. An Indian government monitor had earlier said the quake was centred near Amritsar."The seismic waves have been mixed up in data monitoring," he said.Tremors were felt across Pakistan including the capital, Islamabad, and northwestern Peshawar, and even as far as the eastern city of Lahore, which borders India.Also Read | Aftershocks possible but may not impact India: NCS scientist after 6.3 quakeIn Muzaffarabad, where a 2005 earthquake wreaked serious destruction, there was mass panic, according to witnesses and many rushed out of their homes in fear."I thought it's the same like what had hit us in 2005.

13-02-2021||India||Aftershocks possible but may not impact India: NCS scientist after 6.3 quake||Smaller aftershocks and tremors are likely after an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude hit Tajikistan at 10.31 pm on Friday, but due to the distance of northwest India from the epicentre it is unlikely to impact national capital Delhi and surrounding areas, senior seismologists at the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) said.The strong earthquake had its epicentre in Tajikistan with latitude of 38 N and longitude 73.58 E and recorded a depth of 74 km.“The epicentre is in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region where the Indo-Australian plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. It’s seismically highly active area. The tremors have been felt across Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi NCR. However, we have not received any reports of damage yet,” said JL Gautam, head, (operations) at the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).“As we know the Indian and the Eurasian plates are colliding, so the Himalayas are always active. This event happened towards the Eurasian plate but it was a very strong earthquake, so the energy was felt here also. Smaller aftershocks are possible but the source is very far so it’s unlikely to impact us,” said AP Pandey, seismologist at National Centre for Seismology.Earlier, initial reports by the National Centre of Seismology had suggested it was an earthquake of 6.1 magnitude with its epicentre in Amritsar, Punjab. But, a little later the report was corrected by NCS. Social media platforms were abuzz with people in Delhi-NCR sharing videos of fans, lights and other fixtures oscillating during the strong tremors felt.Neighbouring Pakistan also reported strong tremors of magnitude 6.4 on Friday night. However, no loss of life or property has been reported yet. Tremors were felt in capital Islamabad and major cities of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab provinces and also in Pakistan occupied-Kashmir.Pakistan geologically overlaps the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates and is an earthquake-prone zone. The Chaman Fault poses the biggest threat of earthquakes to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aftershocks-possible-but-may-not-impact-india-ncs-scientist-after-6-3-quake-101613153173221.html
13-02-2021||India||Political parties trade barbs over 25-year-old’s killing in Mangolpuri||A political blame game erupted between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress over the murder of 25-year-old Mangolpuri resident Rinku Sharma, which took a communal angle as posts circulated by political leaders over social media gained popularity on Friday.While the AAP and the Congress questioned the deteriorating law and order situation in Delhi demanding home minister Amit Shah’s intervention, the ruling BJP questioned Delhi chief minister’s Arvind Kejriwal “silence” on the matter and demanded a compensation of ₹1 crore for Sharma’s family. Some BJP leaders on social media asked for “justice” for Sharma, with one of them, Kapil Mishra even suggesting he was killed for collecting money for the Ram temple in Ayodhya.Delhi Police have arrested five persons in connection with the murder that took place on Wednesday night, and have maintained that Sharma’s death was on account of personal enmity, and a dispute that arose at a birthday party.Also Read | No communal angle, business rivalry behind Mangolpuri murder: PoliceOn Friday, president of Delhi BJP Adesh Gupta said: “Why is Kejriwal silent on Rinku’s murder?... AAP leaders in the Delhi government leaders announce compensation and condemn such incidents when they go to UP, Bengal, MP and other states. But when such incidents take place in Delhi, the CM doesn’t even utter a word. The state government should give a compensation of ₹1 crore to the family.”BJP leader Kapil Mishra claimed on Twitter that Sharma was murdered by “jihadis. He said on Twitter that since the person who died had a Hindu name, the CM would not step in to help the family financially. Mishra also urged people to come forward and collect money for the family.Gupta and BJP parliamentarian Hans Raj Hans visited Sharma’s family on Friday. Hans Raj Hans also met senior police officials and demanded speedy probe into the matter. Separately, AAP legislator Rakhi Birla also paid the family a visit.The AAP released a statement on Friday stating that the law and order situation in Delhi needed improvement. “The law-and-order situation in Delhi has badly deteriorated. Many such incidents show that the MHA (Union minister of home affairs) has failed to maintain the law-and-order situation in Delhi. We strongly condemn this gruesome killing and urge the MHA to take urgent steps to restore people’s faith in the law-and-order system of Delhi.”AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj tweeted, “Rinku Sharma’s murder is a blot on humanity. The guilty should be given the strictest punishment in accordance with the law. Also, Union home minister Amit Shah should immediately convene a meeting with the elected government in Delhi on the law-and-order situation in Delhi. Necessary steps should be taken to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. Otherwise, things like this would keep repeating.”The Congress, too, hit out at the ruling BJP for deteriorating law and order situation in the city. “Crime rate in Delhi is increasing in the city. In the past one year, rioters have tried to damage the city. Due to the current law and order situation, such anti-social elements feel emboldened. Strict action should be taken against those involved in Rinku Sharma’s murder,” Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-parties-trade-barbs-over-25-year-old-s-killing-in-mangolpuri-101613152947420.html
13-02-2021||India||No communal angle, business rivalry behind Mangolpuri murder: Police||Tension simmered in Delhi’s Mangolpuri on Friday after the murder of a 25-year-old man took a communal twist even as police said their investigations revealed that the crime was a result of personal enmity.Police said extra force was deployed in the area -- in north-west Delhi -- as the killing of Rinku Sharma, who was stabbed while returning home from a birthday party on Wednesday night, appeared to turn political owing to his links with some Hindu groups.Some leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- including Kapil Mishra and Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta -- said on social media that Sharma was collecting money for construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Mishra even linked the killing to the collection drive, as posts demanding “justice” for Sharma gained traction through the day.Gupta and party MP Hans Raj Hans also visited Sharma’s house to meet his family, as did Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Rakhi Birla.Delhi Police, who on Friday arrested a fifth person in relation to Sharma’s death, however, said that Sharma and the accused were known to each other for a long time, got into a fight at a party over the shutting down of a mutual friend’s restaurant, and the row escalated into Sharma being stabbed later that night.The five arrested are Mohammad Danish,36, Mohammad Islam, 45, Zahid, 26, Mohammad Mehtab, 20, and Tajuddin, 39.Denying any communal angle to the murder, the official handle of deputy commissioner of police (outer) tweeted at 10.26am:“So far, during investigation, it has surfaced that quarrel started during a birthday party over shutting down of a restaurant... All persons are known to each other and live in the same locality. Any other motive alluded to this incident is factually wrong.”Sharma’s family members, however, said on Friday that some of the accused had fought with him last August because of his links with Hindu groups. “Rinku was associated with Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal. Last year in August when Rinku and his friends carried out a Ram Rath Yatra (procession), these people objected to it and fought with him. It is a retaliation of that which led to his murder,” Sharma’s brother Mannu said, adding that some of the accused objected to reciting the Hanuman Chalisa outside his house.Sharma worked as a lab technician at a private hospital. His father works in an export firm.Reacting to the family’s statement, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said investigators were looking into all possible angles.Detailing the background sequence of events leading to Sharma’s murder, police said that Sharma was a friend of Akash (second name not known) whose younger brother Sachin had opened a restaurant in Rohini last year. The restaurant shut down shut due to losses, and Sachin blamed their acquaintance Zahid — who also owns a restaurant in the same area — for this.Police said that Sharma, Akash, Sachin, Zahid and another friend, Golu, were at the birthday party on Wednesday night. An argument broke out between Sachin and Zahid, during which Sachin slapped Zahid, leading to a scuffle that also involved Golu and Sharma. As the fight escalated, Zahid called his uncle Islam, and acquaintances Danish and Mehtab. Later, when Sharma and Akash were heading home from the party, Zahid, and his accomplices Danish, Islam and Mehtab intercepted and assaulted them.Police said Danish stabbed Sharma with a knife, and Akash, who tried to save him, was also injured in the attack. Sharma was rushed to a nearby hospital, where the doctors pronounced him dead. The hospital staff reported the matter to the police.Reacting to the police saying there was no communal angle in Sharma’s murder, Mishra said: “Police needs to listen to the family before coming to a conclusion. This is not an isolated incident in Delhi. Ankit Saxena, Dhruv Tyagi, Dr Narang, all were killed in the same manner. Police have to improve a lot.”The AAP called for strict punishment to the perpetrators but appealed that the incident not be given a communal colour. “The Aam Aadmi Party demands that strictest action be taken against those found guilty in the case. They should be arrested, jailed and hanged. The punishment should be strictest, in accordance with the law of the land. Secondly, we also urge people not to give communal colour to the incident,” AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said.Speaking about the circumstances behind the arrest, additional deputy commissioner of police (outer) Sudhanshu Dhama said that Danish and his friends were identified early in the probe, and caught in a police raid.“Sharma and Danish lived in the same area and were familiar with each other. Medical examination revealed that Sharma had one stab wound in his abdomen and probably died of excessive bleeding. While Danish and Islam work as tailors, Zahid is a third-year college student and Mehtab is a student of Class 12. All of them are adults. None of them have any previous criminal involvement. Further probe is underway,” he said.Experts cautioned against allowing the incident to turn into a communal issue.“To make sure that the matter is not blown out of hand, the police should loudly proclaim the real reason behind the murder. If some politicians are flaring up the matter, their party leaders must be apprised of the situation and they must intervene to stop anything like this from snowballing into a communal riot-like situation,” said Julio Ribeiro, former chief of police in Bombay and Punjab, adding that the incident seemed to be due to personal enmity.Former Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar said in such situations police must make sure that those spreading misinformation are under preventive custody. “Preventive deployment can help control the situation from flaring up and maintaining law and order. The involvement of local leaders also helps in pacifying the residents. Decisions are to be taken according to the situation on the ground,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-communal-angle-business-rivalry-behind-mangolpuri-murderpolice-101613152887390.html
13-02-2021||India||China’s actions along LAC led to distrust, confrontation: Army chief||China’s rising footprint in India’s neighbourhood, coupled with that country’s attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along disputed borders, has led to confrontation and mutual distrust, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Friday.His comments, at a seminar on evolving security challenges in the country’s North-east and the way forward, come at a time when disengagement between Indian and Chinese troops is underway in the Pangong Tso area of eastern Ladakh.The army chief said the regional security environment was characterised by Chinese belligerence in the Indo-Pacific, Beijing’s hostility towards weaker nations, and its relentless drive to create regional dependencies through steps such as the multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – a state-backed global infrastructure development project covering scores of countries.Also Read | Other friction points on table next: CentreSince it was unveiled in 2013 by President Xi Jinping, BRI has expanded to cover a vast swathe of territory from South America to the Arctic, and includes plans to build a vast network of highways, ports, power plants, pipelines, and other infrastructure. Both India and the United States oppose BRI because it favours Chinese firms and Beijing employs predatory lending practices.“The resultant Sino-US rivalry has created regional imbalances and instability,” Naravane said.He said a renewed focus on the North-east was in order in the wake of the ongoing security dynamics across India’s borders and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Although endowed with natural resources, the North-east is a laggard in growth and development. Protracted insurgencies, legacy issues further accentuated after partition and inefficient integration with rest of India account for much of what the region faces today,” Naravane said.Experts said China’s actions were aimed at curtailing India’s leadership role in the neighbourhood.“China’s aggressive behaviour along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as part of its strategy of military coercion, and increased footprint and investments in India’s neighbourhood, aim at restricting India’s strategic space and leadership role,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.Naravane added that the security situation in the North-east had improved significantly and two army divisions had been pulled out of counter-insurgency and internal security duties, and were now solely focused on their operational role along the northern borders. “This has been a significant achievement. The operational responsibility of these areas has now been taken over by the Assam Rifles,” he said.The move will help the army focus on the borders and train for conventional operations. Several parliamentary panels have made recommendations in their reports to reduce the army’s exposure to counter-insurgency and counterterrorism duties because it results in blunting the force’s focus on its main task -- defending the country from external aggression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinas-actions-along-lac-led-to-distrust-confrontation-army-chief-101613152408404.html
13-02-2021||India||SC seeks govt, Twitter replies on fake news plea||The Supreme Court on Friday sought responses from Twitter India and Centre on a petition demanding regulation of “fake and seditious” content and advertisements circulated on social media platforms from unverified accounts.The petition filed by Delhi Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) unit’s IT and Social Media Cell chief Vinit Goenka cited the recent order of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued on February 1 directing Twitter to block more than 250 Twitter accounts found to promote fake and provocative contents. Goenka accused Twitter of creating hatred in society by circulating, publishing, and promoting seditious contents and sought a mechanism to deal with such content.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued a notice and tagged it with two similar petitions pending in Court on the issue of regulating content on social media. In October 2020, the Court issued notice on a petition by two law students demanding profile verification of social media accounts in order to weed out illicit and graphic content uploaded on social media.Appearing for Goenka, advocate Ashwini Dubey argued that there was an urgent need for the Court to interfere since, he claimed, there was no law is in place to prevent circulation of anti-national content and posts that spread hatred based on fake news.“In the absence of any law to deal with offensive and hatred messages, platforms like Twitter are knowingly promoting the messages which are against the law of the land and therefore, the Respondent No.4 (Twitter) needs to explain for circulating and promoting the prohibited content,” the petitioner said.With notices been issued, responses have to be filed to the petition by Twitter and the two Central departments – ministry of law and justice and ministry of information and broadcasting.The petition comes a day after the Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who also has the charge for the ministry of electronics and information technology, warned social media companies that they cannot ignore Indian law and told parliament that new rules and codes were in the works for social media companies to follow.This month, Twitter has been locked in a rare confrontation with the Union government after being given orders to block over 1,300 links -- entire profiles as well as posts -- for alleged incitement during the January 26 farm protest-linked violence. The company complied partially, saying that the orders were not consistent with the law, prompting the government as well as legal experts to accuse it of ignoring the rule of law.At present, Twitter enjoys a considerable presence in India. According to the petition, 10 per cent of 3.5 million Indian accounts are fake with some of their bearing names and profiles of top constitutional functionaries in the country that tends to mislead the common man.“Fake accounts are used to promote casteism, communalism, regionalism, linguism,” the petition stated by citing what it said were posts posts by separatist organizations such as Sikhs for Justice, Pakistan-based Inter Services Intelligence, as well as terror groups that it said created fake IDs and foment division.“The aforesaid act shows that the Respondent 4 (Twitter) is sympathetic to terrorist groups. There is no law/mechanism which prohibits Respondent 4 from doing aforesaid illegal acts, and Respondent 4 does not have its own mechanism” Goenka stated in his petition.Twitter declined to comment on the matter.According to Apar Gupta, lawyer and founder of Internet Freedom Foundation, the step initiated by the Court would be injurious to freedom of speech and expression. “Censorship in any form is imperfect and leads to a wide chilling effect on freedom of internet users. Even the category proposed for taking down content such as seditious content is wide which often confounds experts. What amounts to seditious content can be decided only after a criminal trial,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-govt-twitter-replies-on-fake-news-plea-101613152407233.html
13-02-2021||India||Negotiations between Centre, Naga groups concluded: Governor||Nagaland’s governor and the Union government’s interlocutor for the Naga peace talks, RN Ravi, on Friday announced in the state assembly that the political negotiations that were going on for several years between the Centre and Naga groups have finally concluded.Addressing the first day of the seventh session of the 13th Nagaland Legislative Assembly (NLA), the governor said even as the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic was going on for the past year, the early resolution of the long-drawn-out Naga political issue continued to remain the focus of the government.With the negotiations over, he said there is now a need for efforts to build on the substantial gains made so far, and to move swiftly for a “final solution”.Governor Ravi’s fresh statement came barely two weeks after he said the Centre’s initiative to resolve the Naga political issue since the past 24 years was yet to bear fruit due to “unrealistic intransigence of some people” who were unwilling to forsake politics of the gun. In his Republic Day address, Ravi, without naming any group, blamed the delay in Naga solution on “politics by gun”, which, he said, had fragmented the Naga society.The new statement also comes close on the heels of the assertion made in Parliament by India’s junior home minister G Kishan Reddy on February 9 that negotiations with Naga groups were at an advanced stage, but no time-frame for agreement could be indicated at this stage. Reddy was responding to an unstarred question in the Lok Sabha raised by Nagaland MP Tokheho Yepthomi regarding the progress of negotiations between the Centre and Naga groups, and whether the agreement is likely to be signed in the current year.The Naga insurgency began in 1950s seeking independence, but over the years that gave way to demand for other things like more autonomy, integration of all Naga-inhabited areas in Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur.The prominent Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN-IM, has been holding peace talks with the Union government since 1997, while a conglomeration of seven different Naga national political groups (NNPGs) have also been engaged in separate talks with the centre since 2017.The Centre had signed a “framework agreement” with NSCN (IM) in 2015, and an “agreed position” with the NNPGs in 2017.The relationship between NSCN (IM) and interlocutor Ravi appeared to sour when, in 2019, the rebel group stood firm on its demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution, and the interlocutor later set a deadline to ink the final agreement on the protracted Indo-Naga issue. During such a time, both parties concurred that the almost all the modalities were all drawn out, except symbolic issues including the flag and constitution, the NSCN (IM) and the interlocutor had a fallout, with the armed group accusing Ravi of violating the spirit of the “framework agreement” and of becoming a liability for the Naga political settlement.“The pending issues are about the Naga people’s political rights and identity as symbolised by the Naga flag and Yehzabo (constitution) but Ravi is putting the blame on gun politics,” the NSCN (IM) had stated in the January issue of its bi-monthly newsletter “Nagalim Voice”. The group also made it clear that only the principle of the “framework agreement” was the key to an honourable and acceptable solution for durable peace, not economic packages or imposed political packages.NSCN (IM) then resumed negotiations vis-a-vis flag and constitution with other government agencies, according to people familiar with the matter.Meanwhile, the Naga tribal and civil society, along with the state government, have been reiterating that the armed groups must come together to facilitate “one solution” for the sake of the Naga people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/negotiations-between-centre-naga-groups-concluded-guv-101613152287297.html
13-02-2021||India||MP high court grants bail to two men arrested with comic Munawar||The Madhya Pradesh high court on Friday granted interim bail to two people who were arrested along with stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui earlier this month for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.MBA students Prakhar Vyas and Edwin Anthony were the organisers of the January 1 event in Indore from where the two, Faruqui, Nalin Yadav, and a minor, were held on the complaint of Hindu Rakshak Sangathan convener Eklavya Singh Gaud, son of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Malini Singh Gaud . A day later, Faruqui’s friend Sadaqat Khan, a Mumbai-based engineer, was also arrested for allegedly making abusive remarks about Eklavya. He and Yadav continue to be in jail after their bail pleas were rejected .Faruqui was released from prison late on February 6 after the Supreme Court stayed a Madhya Pradesh high court judgment that declined him bail, and issued notices to the state police as well as the complainant. The top court also restrained the Uttar Pradesh Police from arresting Faruqui in a separate case registered against him at Prayagraj for allegedly offending religious feelings through his jokes.Vyas’s counsel Ajay Bagadia said the high court order came on the grounds set by the Supreme Court for granting bail to Faruqui.“The apex court had found a violation of Section 41 of CrPC (arresting a person without a warrant) as police should arrest a person in a case having a provision of punishment more than 3 years only after a preliminary investigation,” Bagdia said.Indore, Inspector General (IG) of Police, Harinarayan Chhari Mishra said, “We can’t comment over it as the matter is sub-judice. We will submit the reply to the notice.”Prakhar Vyas’s uncle, Nitin Vyas, said, “We don’t want to comment anything, but we have full faith in the judiciary. Prakhar and others will be acquitted in the false case.”Former advocate general Ravi Nandan Singh said, “It’s a check and balance system. The same court, which denied bail to Faruqui and Nalin Yadav, granted bail to two young comedians due to Supreme Court order. Everybody should follow the system and law whether it is a police or judiciary. Our law has no room for injustice. If anybody tries to ignore the law, we have layers of the judiciary system.”On Friday, at least 100 artistes and writers, including Arundhati Roy, Kunal Kamra, and Kalki Koechlin, issued a joint statement demanding the dismissal of charges against the accused.The signatories said that every citizen in India has the constitutional right to free speech and expression, albeit with reasonable restrictions “however, through instances like these, it is obvious that most arrests and forms of censorship carried out against artistes are founded on arbitrary grounds and are greatly damaging to artistic and creative freedom in the country”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mphc-grants-bail-to-two-men-arrested-with-comic-munawar-101613152227830.html
13-02-2021||India||TMC MP says feeling ‘suffocated’, quits Rajya Sabha||Former Union railway minister and Trinamool Congress MP Dinesh Trivedi, a prominent national face of the party, dramatically announced his resignation from the Rajya Sabha while participating in the debate on the budget in the House on Friday, alleging that he was feeling “suffocated” and saying that he heard the call of his antaratma (inner voice).The latest jolt for West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress came ahead of assembly elections in the state and two months after political heavyweight and minister Suvendu Adhikari, state minister Rajib Banerjee and a few party MLAs quit to join the BJP. A section of the party saw Trivedi as a key figure among the non-Bengali population in Kolkata and nearby districts.State elections are expected in April-May this year and the Trinamool and the BJP are the prime contenders.In the House, Trivedi said “the motherland is supreme”, cited his inability to speak on the “violence” and the “situation” in West Bengal to conclude that “there is no point to just sit here and remain silent”. Later, he said, it was a spontenous decision but added that he consulted his “mentors” before announcing his resignation.“The way there is violence, I feel awkward what should I do by sitting here. For us, the homeland is supreme. I am in a party. Party has disciplines. But now I am feeling suffocated. If I am sitting here and can’t do anything, it’s better that I resign and go back to Bengal,” he told the Rajya Sabha, quoting Swami Vivekananda and the lyrics of a patriotic Bengali song.He evaded questions on whether he is set to join the BJP, but said in a TV interview, “Narendra bhai (PM Modi) has been a friend since 1990.” Many BJP leaders claimed he was in touch with them while the Trinamool issued a statement saying, “Trinamool” means grassroots. “This will give us an opportunity to send one of our ‘grassroot’ workers soon to the Rajya Sabha.”According to officials, Trivedi later met Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and handed over his resignation letter in the prescribed format.Both in Parliament and in the TV interview, Trivedi repeatedly cited his brief tenure in the rail ministry and the presentation of the budget. He said even at that time, “I had listened to my inner voice and kept the interests of the motherland supreme.” His budget had proposed a hike in passenger fares and left West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee so irked that he had to resign hours after his budget speech. Mukul Roy, who is in the BJP now, replied to the budget debate in Parliament.Trivedi said he was not happy with the Trinamool’s strategy both inside Parliament and outside and expressed displeasure over the way PM Modi was being “abused” by his party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mp-says-feeling-suffocated-quits-rs-101613152227214.html
13-02-2021||India||Centre extends tenure of Bombay HC judge by just 1 year, overruling collegium||The central government on Friday extended by one year the tenure of justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court in view of her controversial rulings on sexual assault on children under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).Overruling the recommendation made by the Supreme Court collegium to extend the woman judge’s tenure by two years, the government modified the proposal and instead gave her an extension of just one year as an additional judge.The SC collegium, which had asked for giving justice Ganediwala a further term of two years, comprised chief justice of India SA Bobde, justices NV Ramana and Rohinton F Nariman.Justice Ganediwala’s extension was notified by the Union law ministry on Friday evening after a hurried exercise of getting approval from the Prime Minister’s Office and then the President’s secretariat during the day.Since the judge’s tenure as an additional judge was ending on Saturday, it was incumbent to notify her extension by the end of Friday so as to maintain continuity of her judgeship and not affect her seniority, people familiar with the development told HT.But former chief justice of India (CJI) RM Lodha was critical of the move by the government to take a unilateral decision, overriding the mandate of the CJI and the collegium regarding justice Ganediwala’s extension.“It is not just a norm but rulings of the constitution benches that the collegium, which is headed by the chief justice of India, has primacy in matters of appointment of judges, transfer, posting, etc. And the government is bound by it,” justice Lodha told HT.If the political executive, the former CJI said, has a view different from the collegium, the proper course is to send such a recommendation back to the collegium with the reasons, asking for a review.“But to modify or segregate or tinker with the collegium’s decision without referring it back to the collegium is not proper. Such actions affect the primacy of the collegium. It is now for the collegium in the Supreme Court to take up this matter with the government,” added justice Lodha.During his tenure as the CJI, justice Lodha had in July 2014 publicly criticised the NDA government for its “unilateral” move to segregate former solicitor general Gopal Subramanium from the panel of four names recommended for appointment as Supreme Court judges by the collegium.He had also expressed his disapproval in a letter to Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, and said the government should not adopt such “unilateral segregation” in the future.Justice Ganediwala will now function as an additional judge for one year, and then a decision will be taken whether her tenure will be extended by another year as an additional judge or should she be made a permanent judge.Under constitutional provisions, an additional judge can be appointed for a maximum period of two years unlike permanent judges, who are appointed till the age of 62. Further, an additional judge can either be made permanent following a recommendation by the collegium to the central government, or the tenure can be extended for up to two years, pending review of the judge’s performance.Justice Ganediwala has courted controversy after a series of her judgments on the interpretation of the POCSO Act came under criticism. In a January 19 ruling, she held that groping a minor without removing her clothes was not a case of sexual assault but only of molestation, since there was no “skin to skin” contact. This judgment was stayed by a Supreme Court bench, led by the CJI on January 27. In another judgment on January 15, the judge ruled that holding the hands of a minor and unzipping one’s trousers in front of her does not amount to “sexual assault”.The SC collegium had on January 20 recommended that justice Ganediwala be made a permanent judge, only to withdraw its proposal within a week. In a revised proposal, the collegium said her tenure should be extended by two years but the government did not accept it and modified the tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-extends-tenure-of-bombay-hc-judge-by-just-1-year-overruling-collegium-101613151927205.html
13-02-2021||India||Have seen drop in hate speech content, says Facebook||The prevalence of hate speech on Facebook has dropped compared to the last quarter, the social media company said in its fourth quarter enforcement report released on Thursday.“Last quarter, we shared the prevalence of hate speech on Facebook for the first time to show the percentage of times people see this type of content on our platform. This quarter, hate speech prevalence dropped from 0.10-0.11% to 0.07-0.08%,” the company said.This implies that for every 10,000 posts there were seven to eight views of hate speech. Further, the prevalence of violent and graphic content also dropped from “0.07% to 0.05% and adult nudity content dropped from 0.05-0.06% to 0.03-0.04%”. The social media company added that it also took down 6.4 million pieces of organized hate content, up from 4 million in the last quarter and 26.9 million pieces of hate speech content, up from 22.1 million.According to the company’s policy prevalence estimates the percentage of times people see violating content on the platform. “It is calculated by selecting a sample of content seen on Facebook and labelling how much of it violates our hate speech policies”.“Because hate speech depends on language and cultural context, we send these representative samples to reviewers across different languages and regions. Based on this methodology, we estimated the prevalence of hate speech from July 2020 to September 2020 was 0.10% to 0.11%. In other words, out of every 10,000 views of content on Facebook, 10 to 11 of them included hate speech,” the company’s said.Facebook has been charged with allowing hate speech to flow freely on its platform. Facebook officials on September 2 met the Indian parliamentary panel on information technology to discuss alleged political bias shown by the company, following reports that its executives intervened to shield Bharatiya Janata Party leaders from action for spreading hate speech.The company said that the improvements were mainly due to changes made to reduce problematic content. “Each post is ranked by processes that take into account a combination of integrity signals, such as how likely a piece of content is to violate our policies, as well as signals we receive from people, such as from surveys or actions they take on our platform like hiding or reporting posts,” Facebook said.In areas of bullying and harassment, Facebook said that its proactive rate of action went up from 26% in Q3 to 49% in Q4 on Facebook, and 55% to 80% on Instagram. “Improvements to our AI in areas where nuance and context are essential, such as hate speech or bullying and harassment, helped us better scale our efforts to keep people safe,” Facebook said.Facebook’s report corresponded to the calendar year 2020, which meant the latest data is from the October-December period.The company added that 6.3 million pieces of bullying and harassment content were taken down, up from 3.5 million in Q3, while 2.5 million pieces of suicide and self-injury content were removed, up from 1.3 million in Q3 due to increased reviewer capacity.On Instagram, 5 million pieces of bullying and harassment content, 308,000 pieces of organized hate content, 6.6 million pieces of hate speech content, and 3.4 million pieces of suicide and self-injury content, were removed due to increased reviewer capacity.“This year, we plan to share additional metrics on Instagram and add new policy categories on Facebook. Our goal is to lead the technology industry in transparency, and we’ll continue to share more enforcement metrics as part of this effort,” the company said. “We also believe that no company should grade its own homework. Last year, we committed to undertaking an independent, third-party audit of our content moderation systems to validate the numbers we publish, and we’ll begin this process this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-seen-drop-in-hate-speech-content-says-fb-101613151807868.html
13-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand rescuers face fresh threat after lake formation, say experts||Authorities on Friday dispatched an eight-member team to inspect a lake that has formed on the Rishiganga river due to the accumulation of debris and threatens ongoing rescue operations after a glacier break triggered an avalanche and deadly floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district earlier this week.Geologists have sounded caution about the lake near the disaster-hit Reni village --- about 6km upstream --- and said water from there could ooze out gradually and pose a risk to teams involved in rescue and search operations downstream. Satellite images have confirmed the formation of the water body.“There is a place where Rontigad, or Ronti river, meets the Rishiganga. The debris that fell after the glacier breach on February 7 has blocked the Rishiganga water there, creating a lake,” said Navin Juyal, a retired geologist from the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad.“The water will definitely spill as the lake is full. We have been informed that authorities are trying to drain the water...The lake will not collapse, but it will gradually drain, which can be dangerous for those engaged in rescue work,” Juyal added.Also Read | Chamoli tragedy: Rescue agencies change tactic, focus on drilling into tunnelHe said a geologist, Naresh Rana, went to the area to physically inspect the lake with the help of villagers on Wednesday.YP Sundriyal, geologist and professor of the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University, said he and his colleague Rana found out about the lake formation on Wednesday and informed the authorities.A State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team was sent to the area on Friday to assess the situation before draining out the waters, according to Riddim Agarwal, deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), SDRF.“A team of SDRF reached there...exact information could be received once the team returns,” Nilesh Anand Bharne, deputy inspector general (law and order), said. The team is working on setting up a temporary helipad there.In a statement on Friday evening, the Uttarakhand government said scientists of the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, who conducted an aerial survey of the site, informed chief secretary Om Prakash that water flow had started from the lake.Rescuers have retrieved 38 bodies since tragedy struck Chamoli district on Sunday morning, when a glacier breach sent a torrent of water and sludge hurtling down a valley into the Rishiganga river (it becomes Alaknanda in Chamoli city). At least 166 people have been missing since the subsequent flooding that hit villages, including Reni, on the way, damaged two power plants (the Tapovan project and the Rishiganga hydel project), and prompted a section of experts to link the event to climate change.Juyal said some boulders in the higher reaches in the area were “as big as a house”. “It is understood from various satellite images and aerial surveys that rocks and boulders from Nanda Ghunti or Trishul, the two peaks here, have fallen on the glacier. There was no lake on the surface of the glacier, but there may have been subsurface water bodies. The glacier surface along with ice, water, debris fell on February 7. Because of the remoteness of the region studying it manually is very difficult.”The India Meteorological Department (IMD), meanwhile, warned that a fresh, feeble western disturbance was likely to impact the Western Himalayas from February 14 to 16. There is likely to be light rainfall (up to 1 cm) and snowfall (up to 10 cm) in the northern parts of Uttarakhand, including Chamoli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ukhand-rescuers-face-fresh-threat-after-lake-formation-say-experts-101613151747255.html

Initial reports by the National Centre of Seismology suggested an earthquake of 6.1 magnitude with the epicentre in Punjab’s Amritsar. However, the report was corrected by NCS soon after.“The epicentre is in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region where the Indo Australian plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. It’s seismically highly active area. The tremors have been felt across Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi NCR. However, we haven’t received any reports of damage yet,” JL Gautam, head of operations at National Centre for Seismology (NCS), said.Earthquake of Magnitude:6.3, Occurred on 12-02-2021, 22:31:33 IST, Lat: 38.00 & Long: 73.58, Depth: 74 Km ,Location: 285km ENE of Fayzabad, Afghanistanfor more information https://t.co/PxX3VNYiFY @ndmaindia pic.twitter.com/2F8ndn7p5v“As we know the Indian and the Eurasian plates are colliding, so the Himalayas are always active. This event happened towards the Eurasian plate but it was a very strong earthquake, so the energy was felt here also. Smaller aftershocks are possible but the source is very far so its unlikely to impact us,” AP Pandey, a seismologist at National Centre for Seismology, said.People were seen rushing out of their homes in many parts of north India such as Punjab's Ludhiana, Jammu and Srinagar among other places. “Not since the earthquake of 2005 have the tremors in Srinagar been bad enough to force me out of the house. I grabbed a blanket & ran. I didn’t remember to take my phone & so was unable to tweet “earthquake” while the damn ground was shaking,” National Conference leader Omar Abdullah tweeted.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted after the quake, saying he is praying for everyone's safety. "Earthquake tremors felt in Delhi. Praying for everyone's safety," Kejriwal posted on Twitter.Tremors were also felt in Pakistan’s Islamabad, Lahore and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces. There were no reports of loss to life or property in the neighbouring country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earthquake-felt-in-delhi-ncr-parts-of-north-india-101613149695063.html
