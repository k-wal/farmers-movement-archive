21-02-2021||Pune||Metro work hits roadblock on Old Mumbai-Pune highway due to absence of road width||The Pune Metro work has hit a roadblock on the stretch of Old Pune Mumbai highway in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limit from Khadki railway gate to the All-Saints high school junction. The work has been stuck due to a lack of road width. The PMC has highlighted serious traffic problems if Pune Metro moves ahead with constructing pillars at the centre of the highway. On the other hand, Metro officials are trying to find a solution to resolve the problem. On January 23, 2017, MahaMetro began construction work on the Pune Metro stretch of PCMC to Swargate. The route is 16.6 kilometres (km) long starting at Dr Ambedkar chowk near the PCMC main building. This metro route is elevated until Range Hill and then descends gradually, reaching ground level near the College of Agriculture. The stretch has 11.5 km of elevated work with nine stations. There are five underground stations, and the total stretch of underground metro rail is 5.1 km. It includes Shivajinagar bus stand, Civil court, Phadke houd, Mandai and Swargate stations. In the month of January 2021, the Maharashtra Metro Railway Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) completed a six-kilometre stretch between PCMC and Phugewadi of Pune Metro and successfully conducted a trial run last month which is the priority stretch of the Pune Metro project. But it is not operational for the public because of incomplete Metro stations on the six km stretch. The work on the stretch from PCMC to Harris bridge was smoothly underway before the issue of road width arose. The problem exists within PMC limits from railway gate No. 20 (Khadki) to 800 m towards All Saints high school junction due to lack of road width. The civic body wants 42-metre road width in this stretch to solve traffic problems and implement the Bus Rapid Transport (BRTS) system on this road from Harris bridge to Patil estate area (Shivajinagar). If the metro constructs a pillar at the centre of the road, the proposed BRTS is not possible on this road. Besides that, highways become narrow and could cause huge traffic problems as there is no alternate route to divert traffic on this highway. Road width menace The Old Pune Mumbai road is a critical arterial road which connects Pune with Pimpri Chinchwad. Rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have overburdened this road especially within Pune limits wherein the road width varies between 18m to 21m from Bopodi chowk to Range Hill chowk. The width of the road within Pimpri- Chinchwad limits is 61m and adequate to cater to all modes of traffic. However, the width within PMC limits is not sufficient to cater to traffic especially in the second half of the day when heavy commercial and multi-axle traffic access the road. The PMC has widened the road to 42m as per Development Plan (DP) sanctioned by the state government from Wakdewadi to Range Hill and the widening has been achieved in stretches for the section from railway gate No. 20, Khadki to Harris Bridge (Bopodi chowk) which is 700 m. The intermediate stretch in Khadki Cantonment area which varies in widths from 20m to 21m is within the ambit of various defence units and the PMC has initiated the land acquisition process through the office of collector, Pune. However, the financial constraint in the acquisition is inhibiting to PMC and hence, the transfer of Equal Value Land (EVL) has been initiated by the Defence Estate Office, Pune area. On the 800-metre stretch where there is only 21m of road width on the Old Mumbai-Pune highway, as per sanctioned project plan, the Maha-Metro will have to construct around 25 pillars on the alignment from Khadki railway gate to All Saints high school junction. Resolution in the works? According to PMC road officials, “A joint meeting was convened by Maha Metro and chaired by the divisional commissioner, Pune division (DC) and PMC municipal commissioner (MC) along with officials from the road department in February 2021 wherein the hindrances in the execution of metro work was discussed due to the non-transfer of defence land by MoD. Based on this meeting, the divisional commissioner, Pune division and municipal commissioner along with officials from road department of PMC visited the Khadki station area on February 12, 2021, wherein the Maha Metro had arranged a presentation to explain the new proposed alignment in the 800m stretch from railway gate No.20, Khadki up to within the defence area on the Pune side.” Dr Kunal Khemnar, the additional municipal commissioner of PMC said, “The discussion is going to resolve the problem at a higher level. Due to the lack of road width, traffic problems may arise in this stretch after constructing metro pillars. Therefore, widening a road in this stretch will be one of the solutions.” Dr Jayashree Katare, the resident district collector said, “Mahametro has demanded land to widen the road of old Mumbai-Pune highway. It belongs to defence, however, the process has not been initiated yet.” Jawahar Salunkhe, senior deputy general manager (civil) said, “On this stretch, Metro has proposed around 40 pillars. It was mentioned in the original Pune Metro plan. However, due to the lack of road width, the discussion is going on to re-align pillars in this stretch.” Who will pay? According to officials, the cost of land acquisition will be around ₹100 crore to widen the stretch of 800 metres. Now, the question has arisen: who is going to pay the amount? The civic body wants MahaMetro to pay the amount due to lack of funds in their coffer. On the other hand, MahaMetro is anticipating that PMC should have to pay land acquisition costs as they will benefit more after road widening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/metro-work-hits-roadblock-on-old-mumbai-pune-highway-due-to-absence-of-road-width-101613932099712.html

21-02-2021||Noida||Discom begins chemical earthing of transformers in Noida||NOIDA: To ensure uninterrupted power supply during summer, the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), the power distribution company, has started chemical earthing of nearly 24,000 transformers in Noida. Virendra Nath Singh, PVVNL’s divisional chief engineer, said that after the chemical earthing of transformers, not only their shunting capacity will increase, but it will also help identify power faults. “Due to less shunting capacity of simple earthing, the transformers get blown up during peak demand in summer. The chemical earthing will ensure longevity to the transformers. Besides, chances of tripping are also reduced with this wiring,” he said. Singh also said that PVVNL distributes power to the consumers of different categories in the city through over 24,000 transformers, including 3,000 in urban areas. “The average cost of chemical earthing varies from ₹1,400 to ₹2,500, depending upon the capacity of the transformers. Till date, chemical earthing has been done to nearly 1,000 transformers. By the end of March this year, all the transformers in Noida will have chemical earthing,” he said. The official said that the discom has also begun overhauling the old infrastructure. “The headquarters have released ₹20 crore for upgradation work, including replacement of 17,500 poles, 990 air circuit breakers between transformers and low transmission power lines, and 11 kilowatt vacuum circuit breakers,” he said. The discom is also replacing 100 kilometers of 11kv wires, 80km of insulated conductor wires and 200 pillar boxes. “Also, the proposal for conversion of overhead supply wires into underground cables has also been sent to the headquarters for approval. After approval, there will be no overhead wires in urban areas of Noida,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/discom-begins-chemical-earthing-of-transformers-in-noida-101613931797436.html
21-02-2021||Noida||Noida residents await LPG subsidy for nine months||Almost all cooking gas consumers in Gautam Buddh Nagar had not received their subsidy for the last nine months, according to the district supply officer.An official at the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas, which deposits the subsidy of the liquified petroleum gas (LPG) beneficiaries in their bank accounts, said they were aware of the issue and attributed it to a fund crunch. Gautam Buddh Nagar supply officer (DSO) Chaman Sharma said, “The Centre transfers the subsidy under the direct benefit transfer scheme. I got to know that LPG consumers have not got the amount in their accounts since May 2020.”The DSO pegged the number of LPG consumers in the district at 1 million. “Out of them, over 250,000 are not entitled to the subsidy as their annual taxable income is above ₹10 lakh,” he said.The subsidy is transferred under the central government’s direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme. According to officials, over ₹21,000 crore in subsidy was pending till date across the country.Akhil Kumar, an auto-rickshaw driver in Noida, said that he has not received his gas subsidy in his account after May last year. “We live near Labour Chowk. Over 200 LPG consumers in my area have been running pillar to post for the subsidy amount. When we ask the gas agency owner and supply department officials, they say that the matter of subsidy credit is decided by the Centre,” he said. Ragini Singh, an accountant in a private firm, said that the government stopped the subsidy without any prior information. “The annual income of our family is less than ₹5 lakh. Over 500 female consumers of Nithari area have written letters to one and all in ministry of petroleum, to release the subsidy to give us respite from unwanted financial burden, but nothing tangible has been done so far,” she said. Rachna Yadav, the owner of a gas agency in Noida, said, “When consumers make queries, we don’t have any reply for them.”Ministry officials were not forthcoming with an explanation for the issue although a joint secretary-level officer said that the government planned to lay more focus on the central government’s flagship Ujjwala scheme, which envisages providing LPG connection to every rural household. Added to this is the cut in the budget for LPG subsidy from over ₹40,000 crore in this fiscal to around ₹13,000 crore in the coming fiscal in April and the increase in coverage for the flagship scheme.“Till the government makes any decision on it, the components of gas subsidy has been stopped. I hope that before the end of the present fiscal 2020-21, the government will take a final call on it. Speculations are high that in the coming fiscal 2021-22, the government will use the subsidy amount for the beneficiaries of Ujjwala scheme,” the officer, who wished to remain unnamed, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-residents-await-lpg-subsidy-for-nine-months-101613931740352.html

21-02-2021||Noida||Covid effect: Noida’s 35th annual flower show goes virtual||Noida: The city’s 35th Vasant Utsav went virtual this year as the annual flower festival kickstarted on Sunday with judges and participants interacting online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With petunia -- a species of flowering plant native to South America with over 20 species -- as this year’s theme flower, 62 participants including corporates, residential societies, individuals, and schools, would compete under seven categories till Thursday, said the Floriculture Society of Noida, organisers of the event. The annual fest with thousands of visitors thronging Noida stadium in February and enjoying their day had witnessed 73 participants last year, with a number of activities and competitions. This year, however, in the wake of the Covid-19 threat, the organisers said that they couldn’t take the risk compromising on the visitors’ health and thus decided to do away with stalls.“The annual flower show is a much awaited festival and it’s really painful to hold the event online with 19 judges and 62 participants interacting via WhatsApp. But we had to take the decision to ensure everyone’s safety as the annual fest always saw a very impressive footfall,” said Manju Grover, general secretary of the floriculture society.Grover said that the participants will be sending videos and pictures of their gardens or planters to the judges, based on which the winners will be selected. Also, unlike last year, this year’s participants are only from Noida and Greater Noida.The competition categories this year include -- Roadside garden, large garden (50 square metres or more), balcony garden, corporate garden, medium garden (25 to 50 sq metres), residential society parks and clubs, school and preschool garden, and terrace garden, among others.“We have given special emphasis to the roadside gardens which primarily are the gardens or plantations outside the residential societies. We are promoting them as they are directly linked to the swachhta mission, as it encourages residential societies to keep their peripheries or areas outside their boundaries clean and decorated,” said Grover.Officials of the floriculture society also said that while the event is not physical, the 600-member floriculture society is mulling to hold a one-day annual plant bazaar at the government nursery in Sector 8 on March 6.“The nursery will see the members and others displaying their best planters for the purpose of trade or barter. We are still working on this plan,” added Grover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-effect-noida-s-35th-annual-flower-show-goes-virtual-101613931738658.html

Khalishwayo allegedly needed money as she was a single mother. After checking her call data records, NCB found several mobile numbers in her contact details who live in Mumbai and Kolkata. The agency suspects that they could be involved in an international drug cartel which allegedly deals in heroin, said NCB officers.After scanning her travel details, it was found that earlier she travelled to many countries in South America and southeast Asia. South American drug cartel mostly uses poor women and it appears that she is part of the same syndicate, added an NCB officer.Based on a tip-off, NCB arrested her on Thursday after she arrived at CSMIA from Johannesburg via Doha. Khalishwayo was carrying a grey trolley bag, which has a cavity. Officers found two packets of heroin concealed in the cavity and one packet in the bag.

Harendra and his gunner Bhoodev Sharma (46) were shot dead at a wedding on February 8, 2015 in Niyana village in Greater Noida by armed assailants.Harendra’s widow Bevan Nagar has filed a case alleging Bhati gang members are threatening her brother-in-law Ravindra Nagar, who is a complainant and witness to this case, to turn hostile. Harendra Nagar alias Harendra Pradhan was the village head of Dadopur in Dankaur. An FIR was registered on directions of the district and sessions court, Surajpur, at the Kasna police station on Friday. In the complaint, Bevan alleged that her husband was killed by Bhati gang members as he was a witness in a case in which Bhati was accused in 2019.“My brother-in-law Ravindra registered a murder case against the Bhati gang members in 2015 after my husband’s death.

21-02-2021||Noida||Foggy February: Experts explore reasons behind ‘unusual’ weather phenomenon||Noida: The national Capital region, as well as parts of western Uttar Pradesh, has been seeing an unusually dense cover of fog in the morning and evening hours this month, leaving commuters stuck and weather analysts perplexed. Scientists said they are still exploring reasons behind this phenomenon which is not a common occurrence for this time of the year. The analysts stated that while the wind speed this month had been calm and the impact of western disturbances low – a weather system that causes rains or snowing in the Himalayan states and subsequent rains or thundery development over the NCR – the month also saw more polluted days as compared to the same month last year, which some believe could be a plausible reason or a contributing factor.“Never has such dense fog been seen over larger areas simultaneously for longer duration daily – upto nine-10 days – after February 10 in any winter season, even in Delhi or any airport at this belt, including Amritsar and Lahore. We get dense fog in February but for a few days of the first week only, when the winter season has some features favouring it. This time, however, this spell has occurred when the night temperatures were two-three degrees Celsius above normal, which is something unique,” says RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Fog cover is considered shallow when visibility is upto 500 metre, moderate when it is up to 200 metre, dense when visibility is up to 50 metre, and very-dense when visibility is below 50 metre.The IMD said that this “unusual phenomenon” that had affected regions around Delhi to Lahore, has so far in February seen 23 hours or five mornings of fog dense enough to affect flight operations at IGI airport, against 28 hours (seven mornings) in December 2020 and 43 hours (ten days) in January this year.Interestingly, the average dense-very dense fog frequency for the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) for February is usually around 12 hours (three mornings). The phenomenon had also been seen at other airports including at Lucknow and Amritsar, says RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre, IMD.Stating that air pollution could be one of the contributing factors but not the entire cause, the weather scientist believes that moisture, low winds and near average minimum temperature are the reasons behind the foggy month.“Absence of an active western disturbance in the northern plain areas leads to an anticyclone or a high pressure belt, leading to calm winds or light winds in the areas at lower levels, which form the top criteria fulfilled for dense fog to stay longer over this region,” added Jenamani. For Monday, the Met department had forecasted dense to very-dense fog over Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and north-west UP. “Dense fog over isolated pockets is very likely in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north-west Uttar Pradesh on the morning hours of February 22,” stated the IMD’s bulletin.According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Noida in February 2021 saw 16 days of ‘very poor’ air quality and one day of ‘severe’ air quality so far, against only five days of ‘very poor’ air quality in February 2020. Jenamani further said that more intensive study is required to understand the phenomenon in a better way.“More analysis is needed to get all the answers around such unusual occurrences. There are already studies done for the period of 2015 to 2021 on fog at IGI, but by looking at the current condition, the study needs to be expanded to other areas as well. So we can in future understand and prepare to tackle the situation that hinders commuting,” said Jenamani.According to weather analysts, commuters taking to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, Yamuna Expressway and the Taj Expressway must avoid the early hour drives on these stretches as thick fog is most likely to slow them down by cutting the visibility.“Either avoid or take caution while taking the expressways up to at least 9am for the next few days as foggy conditions may go on for a few days. The phenomenon may go on and off as winds speeds are likely to vary,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.Motorists said the heavy fog conditions are proving to be a hindrance to their commuting plans.“It took me over five hours to reach Karnal via the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPR), which usually takes not more than three hours. Due to the farmers’ agitation, I chose to avoid the Singhu border and instead opted for the EPR via Ghaziabad to go to Shimla. However, as soon as I hit the EPR at Duhai around 5.30am, the fog was so dense that I couldn’t drive at more than 10-20 kmph for the entire stretch upto Rai,” said Anil Bhasin, a resident of Gulmohar Park in Delhi, who was commuting to Shimla on Saturday morning.AIR QUALITY IMPROVESMeanwhile, with varying wind speeds, the average air quality was recorded in the “poor” category across Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida.Pollutants PM 2.5 and PM 10 were also present in the air of the five immediate neighbours of Delhi, according to the air quality index (AQI) maintained by the CPCB.According to the index, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The average 24-hour AQI at 4pm on Sunday was 260 in Ghaziabad, 300 in Greater Noida, 251 in Noida, according to CPCBThe CPCB states that an AQI in the “very poor” category may cause respiratory illness to people on prolonged exposure, while “poor” may cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.On Saturday it was 336 in Ghaziabad, 324 in Greater Noida, 269 in Noida, 248 in Faridabad and 258 in Gurgaon.The AQI for each city is based on the average value of all monitoring stations there. Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Noida have four such stations while Greater Noida and Faridabad have two stations each, according to the app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/foggy-february-experts-explore-reasons-behind-unusual-weather-phenomenon-101613931437938.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Youth body sets up Thane’s first community fridge at Wagle Estate||Thane’s first community fridge was set up at Wagle Estate by Bal Mitra Mandal, a youth organisation. The youngsters stocked the fridge with biscuits, fruits and mineral water. They are also taking efforts to spread the word and get more people to voluntarily come forward and fill the fridge. Around 40 people turn up at the fridge daily looking for food.“Under the current circumstances, there are many who are in need of food. We have seen an increased crowd during lunch hour and even between 8pm to 9pm at the fridge. If a similar number of people turn up to ensure the fridge remains stocked up with food, it would be of great help to those in need. Through word of mouth we have reached out to those in slum pockets and other areas near Wagle Estate so that whoever is in need of food can come forward and make use of this community fridge,” said Sameer Sawant, president, Bal Mitra Mandal.Shanti bai, a 65-year-old resident of Shree Nagar, Wagle Estate, said, “I stay alone and cannot afford any help. Due to the Covid situation, my son lost his job and has now gone to a different city in search of a job. I don’t have the strength to cook every day and sometimes end up short of money by month end. This community fridge is a boon for me, even a fruit a day will do for me nowadays.”Bal Mitra Mandal is also reaching out to caterers and restaurants to give excess food to the fridge instead of disposing of it, said members of Bal Mitra Mandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/youth-body-sets-up-thane-s-first-community-fridge-at-wagle-estate-101613931378784.html
21-02-2021||Noida||Work on Bhangel elevated road to resume on Monday||NOIDA: The work on 5.5km elevated road project over the Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera (DSC) road is likely to resume on Monday, officials of Noida authority said on Monday. The work was halted on February 19 after two workers had suffered minor injuries due to the collapse of a steel rebar frame of a pillar of the elevated road near Sector 49.Following the incident, the Noida authority imposed ₹10 lakh fine on the UP State Bridge Corporation (UPSBC) which is constructing the project. The authority’s chief executive officer has also sought explanation from officials looking after the project, said the officials. However, the authority may resume the work as it has taken measures for the safety of the labourers and other staff members.“The authority has directed the agency to take all required safety measures while carrying out the work at the construction site. It has also directed the labourers to use all safety gears so that such incident is not repeated. If all goes well, then the work may be started at the site on Monday,” said Mukesh Vaish, project engineer of the Noida authority.Recently, the deadline of the ₹467 crore project was revised to December this year. The earlier deadline of completion was 2022-end. About 36% work on the project has been completed, the officials said. “Steel frame put up above the pillar fell off suddenly injuring two labourers, who were working on another pillar. They had sustained minor injuries. They had forgot to wear their helmets. However, we have made it clear to the labourers not to repeat this mistake,” said an official of UPSBC, requesting anonymity.The elevated road project aims to facilitate commuting between Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. It starts from Sector 39/43 crossing and end at Sector 82 T-point. Once developed, the stretch will decongest major traffic in Noida’s Barola, Bhangel, and sectors 49, 45, 47 and 46, among other areas. On March 3 last year, the authority had roped in UPSBC for constructing the elevated road. The piling work had started on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/work-on-bhangel-elevated-road-to-resume-on-monday-101613931377499.html

21-02-2021||Chandigarh||Subhash Chawla takes over as Chandigarh Congress chief||Subhash Chawla took over as the new president of the Chandigarh Congress at a function held at Congress Bhawan in Sector 35 here on Sunday.Chawla, who was appointed the new president of the Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee (CTC) on February 9, replaced Pradeep Chhabra, who held the post for around six years.Eying the MC elections due later this year, Chawla, a two-time mayor himself, asked the party workers to dedicate themselves towards winning on the line with the Punjab MC elections.“People who will work hard for the party will get the party’s support for the MC elections regardless of their seniority level,” Chawla said.Former Uttarakhand chief minister and in-charge of Punjab and Chandigarh Congress, Harish Rawat, former Union minister and AICC treasurer Pawan Bansal, Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, Chandigarh councillors and outgoing Chandigarh Congress president Pardeep Chhabra were present on the occasion.‘Take everyone along’Pawan Bansal while advising Chawla said, “Now you have the responsibility to win the upcoming MC elections and for this, you have to take everyone along.”In his address, Rawat said the performance of Congress in Punjab municipal elections should be repeated in Chandigarh as well. He asked Chawla to appoint the office-bearers of the local body in the next 15 days of the district and block levels within 25 days, and strengthen the party at the booth-level in the next two months.In his address, Sidhu said the success achieved by the Congress in the Punjab civic body elections would be repeated in Chandigarh. Chhabra said that with blessings of the party leadership, he had been strengthening the party for six years and would continue to fight for its benefit.A section of the party workers were, however, peeved when the Facebook live feed of the ceremony went silent while Chhabra was addressing the gathering. Chawla’s appointment has not gone down well with a section of Congress workers and there are concerns of internal party fissures coming out in the open, sources within the party said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/subhash-chawla-takes-over-as-chandigarh-congress-chief-101613931258172.html

We hope to finish the work in a month’s time so that commuters can travel from Greater Noida to Jewar smoothly,” said YEIDA chief executive officer (CEO) Arun Vir Singh.“This road will also help people having residential properties and industrial plots in Sector 18, 20 and other areas located along the Yamuna Expressway. They can travel within Yamuna’s urban areas without any hassle,” Singh added.The service lane is of utmost importance because it will provide an additional connectivity, till the Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar, where the work is likely to begin by mid-2021. The work on the Noida International Greenfield Airport will start by mid-2021, and operations are scheduled to begin by the end of 2023-24.The 4-kilometre stretch, in parts at multiple locations, of the 24-kilometre service lane could not be finished because some farmers had refused to give their land. They have now given their land, according to the officials.In view of the expected traffic pressure, the YEIDA aims to provide multiple connectivity routes ahead of the operations at the airport.“After the completion of the road project, thousands of commuters travelling between Greater Noida and Jewar won’t have to use the Yamuna Expressway or pay the toll tax. Commuters can easily avoid the Yamuna Expressway, while going to the Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar,” according to a YEIDA official.This road was not built near Galgotias University near Dankaur and at some other places amid issues with land-owning farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/jewar-airport-service-lane-parallel-to-yamuna-e-way-likely-to-be-ready-by-march-end-says-yeida-101613930957366.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||20% of MMR’s coastline highly susceptible to flooding: Study||A stretch of 50.75km along the coast of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) is highly susceptible to flooding because of unsustainable development, finds a recent study on coastal vulnerability by a group of researchers from a cohort of institutes.Unsustainable development along with changes in land use and land cover, combined with the destruction of mangroves, wetlands and water bodies between 1976 and 2015, have made the low-lying topography of MMR highly susceptible to sea level-induced flooding and coastal erosion, find researchers.The study “Improving outcomes for socioeconomic variables with coastal vulnerability index under significant sea-level rise: an approach from Mumbai coasts” was published in the global peer-reviewed journal Springer Nature on February 5.A group of three researchers – Malay Kumar Pramanik from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi and fellow from the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand; Poli Dash from Deshapran College of Teachers Education, Medinipur, West Bengal, and Dimple Behal from the School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal – studied the coastline from Mira Bhayander to Alibag. They studied a total of 274.1km, of which 50.75km (almost 20%) was considered to be very-highly vulnerable, based on 12 geological, physical and socio-economic variables. Another 60.91km had moderate vulnerability and 55.83km of the shoreline surveyed had very-low vulnerability.Researchers found that the coastline in the eastern suburbs, including Kurla, Deonar, Shivaji Nagar, Trombay Koliwada and the western section of the Thane creek, was very susceptible to flooding. While areas like Borivli and Andheri fell under the low vulnerability scenario, other zones such as Gorai, Uttan, Uran, and Alibaug fell under the moderate to high vulnerability scenario.“We identified that unsustainable urbanisation, unplanned development, and huge land conversion, combined with the destruction of mangroves, reclamation of waterways with construction debris, inadequate drainage, overflow, and absence of natural protectors over the past four to five decades has made the region highly vulnerable to flooding,” said Pramanik, lead author of the study.The researchers involved in this study suggested that higher development activity combined with an increasing population per square kilometre was leading to coastal erosion, while activities such as tourism and fishing are contributing to an adverse influence along the coastal belt, especially along south Mumbai and the eastern suburbs.The study has warned that under the direct impact of the increase in sea surface temperatures due to global warming, the rise in sea level is expected to cause coastal floods annually. The findings are along the lines of a previous international study by an American scientific research organisation, Climate Central, in October 2019, which found that large portions of the city’s suburbs and south Mumbai may be underwater by 2050 if emissions are not kept in check.“While there is a need for sustainable development and alternate livelihood strategies, natural areas and ecosystems that have been degraded under developmental pressures need to be conserved and restored,” said Pramanik, adding that the research findings will help formulate policies to mitigate the impacts of coastal flooding along Mumbai. Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Management, Pune, who was not part of the study, said, “We need policies and action plans at the local level, based on conditions, geography, population, etc. Action plans should integrate flood forecasting with tidal information so we can have early warning systems. When making plans, we also need to think of both artificial protections as well as natural defences. Mangroves are a low-cost protection measure – they break the flow of floods, absorb their impacts. We should also be trying measures like bio-drainage, networks of canals that act as drainage during floods and can retain rainwater during dry periods.”P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said, “We aim to develop a Sponge City Master Plan wherein chronic flood spots need to be addressed first. A consultant will be appointed to study and suggest flood control measures including holding ponds. Separately, we are also in talks to appoint a Japanese consultant to build underground holding ponds. Some of the flood control measures include water absorbent concrete, honeycomb water storage structures below roads and footpaths, water storage structures in each big development, building porous structures wherever possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/20-of-mmr-s-coastline-highly-susceptible-to-flooding-study-101613930899115.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Savitri becomes first leopard at Mumbai’s SGNP to be radio-collared||In a first, a female leopard was radio-collared and released back into the wild at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) on Saturday.Savitri, named after the social reformer and educationist Savitribai Phule, became the first leopard to be radio-collared at SGNP. The two-year-long project to radio-collar leopards was initiated in 2018 when the park authorities signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Wildlife Conservation Society – India (WCS). The project is aimed at tracking and understanding the animal’s movement.G Mallikarjuna, director, SGNP, said, “We are hoping that Savitri will help us understand leopards better. Under this project, a total of five leopards will be radio-collared and tracked.”The collars work by sending signals via satellite, which researchers can then use to investigate where the animal is and what it is doing.The key goals of this project are to obtain knowledge on how humans and leopards interact with each other, and how each adapts to the presence of the other. The collars will help gather information on how leopards move across major roads such as Ghodbandar Road and understand their use of space and time in the SGNP landscape. This data will then help provide management recommendations concerning the way these big cats move in the landscape and conflict mitigation based on the results of the study.Dr Vidya Athreya, WCS, said, “In 2008, when we radio-collared leopards in rural India, it changed the narrative of how big cats behave. It helped us understand that they are more shy than they are aggressive. This project at SGNP will give us yet another level of insight as in Mumbai, a high density of people live in such proximity to big cats. It will also help us track their pathway and understand how they cross busy roads such as the Ghodbunder Road. This will then help us manage them better to bring down mortality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/savitri-becomes-first-leopard-at-mumbai-s-sgnp-to-be-radiocollared-101613930358122.html

21-02-2021||Other||Consumer forums should take steps to expedite adjudication||Delays in the justice system inflict so much pain and misery on the victim that the oft quoted legal maxim ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ seems an understatement. Delays in the justice system actually serve to punish the victim, instead of the perpetrator. One can see this irony in the two recent orders of the apex consumer court. In both the cases, the complainants did not get the relief that they sought during their lifetime.Both cases pertain to repudiation of insurance claims. These were not high value claims, yet the insurance companies thought it fit to file appeals against the orders of the consumer courts at the district and the state levels, thereby dragging on the case. Inordinate delays in hearing the cases, particularly before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission , only made matters worse and made a mockery of the time limit of 90 days prescribed under the consumer protection law for resolution of disputes. . Following the theft of a tractor in September 2008 and rejection of his claim by the insurer, Sri Lal Meena filed a complaint before the District Consumer Forum in 2009 . However, it was only in 2012 that the District Forum gave its verdict –that the insurer should pay ₹3,30,000 towards the loss of the tractor and ₹5000 towards litigation costs within two months. Insurer is liable to pay 9 per cent interest on delayed payment, the court saidInstead of complying with the order, the insurance company filed an appeal. The Rajasthan State Consumer Commission dismissed it- but after three years - in 2015. That was not the end of the matter. The insurer-United India Insurance Company- filed a revision petition against it (RP No 2674of 2015) before the National Commission. On February 12, 2020, when the case came up for hearing, the Commission was informed that the consumer had died the previous year. The Commission therefore asked the insurance company to file an application for substitution of the complainant with his legal heirs within four weeks.The commission however found that even after one year, When the case was taken up, the insurer had not complied with this order and was seeking more time. Exasperated, the commission said it was ‘just, equitable and conscionable to summarily dismiss the case’ and also impose a penalty of ₹1 lakh on the insurer. While ₹50,000 should be paid to the legal heirs in addition to the amount specified by the District Forum, ₹50,000 should be deposited in the Legal Aid Account of the District Forum, the commission said.The second case pertaining to the theft of a motor cycle was more or less similar. Here too, the District Forum allowed the complaint through its order in December 2012 and the State Commission, Rajasthan, dismissed the appeal of the insurance company in March 2013. But Munna Singh’s happiness was short lived. The insurer-Shriram General Insurance Company - filed a revision petition (RP No 2115 of 2013) before the National Commission in May 2013 and there it got stuck!On July 1, 2020- when the case came up for hearing, the Commission was informed that the complainant was dead. The Commission noted in its order of February 16 that the insurance company had not filed an application, as directed, to replace the complainant with his legal heirs. Even the representative of the insurer was not present. So it dismissed the case for non-prosecution and imposed a penalty of ₹1 lakh.Cases such as these should act as a wake up call and force the government as well as the consumer courts to take all necessary steps to expedite the process of adjudication. While imposition of steep punitive damages will discourage meritless appeals, timely appointment of adjudicating members to the apex consumer court by the central government (and to the consumer courts at the state and the district level by state governments ) will go a long way in preventing delays. The consumer courts also need to stop giving adjournments at the behest of lawyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/consumer-forums-should-take-steps-to-expedite-adjudication-101613930120312.html
21-02-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala’s Christian cemetery gets a fresh lease of life||The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) has started the restoration and maintenance process of 66 graves of World War 1 (1914-1918) soldiers, who were buried at the British-era Christian cemetery in Ambala Cantonment. As per rough estimates, nearly two lakh graves spread across 20.84 acres of land were in ruins, most broken or taken over by wild grass. The maintenance work began last week after a team led by CWGC Indian subcontinent manager Amit Bansal visited the site. Staff members Tajender and Ranjeet Ram said, “Through GPS coordinates, list of names and plot-wise layout of the land, we were able to locate the graves. As per the process, if a stone of a grave is broken, a report is sent to the head office in the United Kingdom and a particular type of marble is transported.” The development comes after the British Deputy High Commission, Chandigarh, through district administration gave the possession and maintenance to Father Patras Mundu and C Anthony of the Ambala Cemetery Committee last month. Father Anthony said, “We’ve started the cleaning work and repaired the boundary wall. Our priority was to get the war graves repaired. It was a difficult task as the graves were spread at all corners of the land and it will take some time.”Paddy Willis, a resident of Guilford town in England, whose grandfather stationed with the British Army was buried here in 1934, said he was distressed to see the condition of cemetery on his first-ever visit in 2017.“I was the first person in my family to visit my grandfather’s grave with the help of locals, but was saddened to observe the condition of graves. The restoration of war graves and cleaning of the land is a welcome step indeed. The jar of the topsoil from his grave on my desk is a constant reminder of my connection with this corner of the world,” Paddy said in an e-mail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambalas-christian-cemetery-gets-a-fresh-lease-of-life-101613930058177.html
21-02-2021||Chandigarh||Fuel rates at all-time high in Mohali, dealers fume||With fuel prices at a record high in Mohali district due to daily hike, filling station owners have been hit hard. What’s adding to their woes is the fact that both petrol and diesel remain dearest in Mohali across the tricity.While petrol was available for ₹92.36 per litre in Mohali on Sunday, it cost ₹88.34 in Panchkula and ₹87.16 in Chandigarh. Even diesel, which was priced ₹83.43 in Mohali, was available for ₹81.36 in Panchkula and ₹80.67 in Chandigarh.Ashwinder Singh Mongia, president, Mohali District Petroleum Dealers Association, said: “Due to disparity in fuel rates in the tricity, we have lost about 70% of our business. All the dealers in Mohali whose pumps are located on the border with Chandigarh are the worst sufferers. When the authorities can bring parity in liquor rates, then why not in fuel rates?” What makes fuel so expensive in Mohali is the high rate of taxation in Punjab. The effective value added tax (VAT), including cess, on petrol in Mohali is 31.17%, while in Panchkula, it is 26.25%. In Chandigarh, VAT is 22.45% and there is no additional cess. On diesel, VAT in the three districts is 19.49% , 17.23% and 14.03%, respectively. Such high rates have hit the sales in Mohali drastically. According to figures available with the dealers association, diesel sales have dropped by 70% from 10,000 litres per pump per day in August 2017 to 3,000 in January this year. “As fuel is available at cheaper rates just a couple of kilometres from our petrol pumps, why would anyone come to us?” said Mongia. “Even in Delhi NCR, there is a fuel rate differential of just 25 paisa, despite the area being heavily populated and comprising Delhi, Haryana and UP.” Last year, a businessman who owned three petrol pumps in Mohali committed suicide, citing huge losses being suffered due to the substantial difference in fuel rates. In a letter to the Punjab governor, he also stated that non-revision of VAT in Chandigarh had robbed him of 80% of his business as his pumps were situated on the border.The dealers are also resentful of Chandigarh pumps putting up boards and hoardings advertising the cheaper rates. They claim the boards are illegal, and question as to why the UT administration has not acted against them. Meanwhile, a senior officer in the excise and taxation department of Punjab expressed helplessness over the issue. “Since Mohali is part of Punjab, we cannot have different rates from the rest of the state. Efforts were made to bring parity with Chandigarh, but proved futile,” he said, on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fuel-rates-at-all-time-high-in-mohali-dealers-fume-101613929942673.html

21-02-2021||Chandigarh||No water tariff hike rollback in Chandigarh for now||There will be no immediate rollback in the water tariff hike in Chandigarh. The administration is all set to ask the municipal corporation to reconsider the General House resolution, seeking withdrawal of the tariff hike notification.In September last year, the UT administration had notified a hike between 50% and 200%, depending upon the category of user and water consumption level. After facing public outcry and criticism from the opposition, the MC General House passed a resolution in October, asking the administration to withdraw the notification and stick to the existing rates till the pandemic lasts. The resolution was then send to the administration for its approval.“The administration is not rejecting the resolution, but will only ask the MC to reconsider it,” said a senior UT official, who did not wish to be named.Notably, after his election, mayor Ravikant Sharma had listed the rollback in water tariff as one of his priorities. BJP city chief Arun Sood also held several rounds of meetings with the administration on the issue.Meanwhile, residents have been getting inflated water bills since December last year. Resident welfare associations, trade unions and social organisations even took out a rally opposing the hike earlier this year.‘Need of the hour for fund-starved MC’ The administration’s decision is in the wake of the MC financial crisis and the need for it to generate its own funds, said the UT official.“The hike was very much needed, as for nearly a decade there was no revision. The city has one of the lowest water tariffs,” said an MC official, requesting anonymity.In fact, the resolution was accompanied by the MC commissioner’s note, which laid emphasis on the need and urgency of the hike.The rates were last revised in 2011. The proposal for further hike was first mooted in 2014. Another attempt was made in 2018, but the General House rejected it while seeking additional water supply for the city first.An audit department report had also asked the MC to revise the rates, since its annual losses from water supply had crossed ₹135 crore per annum from ₹41 crore in 2011. The report also observed: “As the annual recurring expenses are increasing by 10-15% every year, losses will further increase in the future, putting a huge pressure on the MC’s coffers.”The MC collects ₹90 crore per annum as water charges, but expenditure incurred to maintain the supply to its 1.8 lakh consumers is ₹225 crore, said the official. Struggling to even pay salaries to its employees because of a severe financial crunch, the civic body expects to earn an additional ₹60 crore from the hike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-water-tariff-hike-rollback-in-chandigarh-for-now-101613929878632.html
21-02-2021||Gurugram||Industries in authorised colonies complain about lack of civic infrastructure||For over 5,000 industries located in unauthorised colonies in different parts of the city, the lack of infrastructure and basic civic amenities, such as roads, water supply and sewage, is posing a major challenge. Industries located in Daulatabad, Khandsa, Kadipur, Behrampur, Basai and other industrial areas are also waiting to be regularised — a promise that was made two years ago but remains unfulfilled till date. The recent slowdown caused by Covid-19 pandemic has further hit the industry hard, and despite initiatives by the government to promote local industries, small-time manufacturers are facing a tough time, said city-based industry owners. Lack of civic amenitiesA visit to these industrial areas by HT reveal the squalid conditions in which these industries are operating — roads are non-existent; industries are dependant on private tankers for water supply, and there is no functional sanitation system in place. The industrial associations allege that reason for the mushrooming of such unauthorised industrial areas is that government agencies have given little thought to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Local unit owners say that most of them do not have the capacity to buy large plots developed by Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) and Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). As such, most of them have settled for plots ranging between 100 to 200 square yard plots in unauthorised areas. There are presently approximately 4,000 to 5,000 such units operating in the Gurugram district alone. Industrial associations also say that small and medium enterprises based in these areas provide employment to at least 75,000 to 80,000 workers and supply ancillary parts to auto companies, which are, in turn, original equipment suppliers to auto giants, such as Hero, Honda and Maruti, among others. “These industrial areas have been in existence for at least two decades but there is no proper water supply, roads, sewage and other basic amenities. In Daulatabad industrial area, there are 1,500 units employing thousands of workers. We pay crores in taxes, but in terms of facilities, we are deprived,” said major (retd) KC Sandal, a unit owner. Lack of authorisationIndustrialists located in these areas also complain that with the tag of being located in illegal colonies, it is difficult for them to raise loans. Banks and other financial institutions are also averse to dealing with them. “ Despite supplying parts and services to original equipment manufacturers and feeding engineering goods exporters, we are treated as fringe industries. It is difficult to avail bank loans and other government promotion schemes” said Sanjiv Bansal, a unit owner in Basai, who also alleged that while the government is concerned about large industries, MSMEs are often neglected. The unit owners also say that despite paying millions in taxes, the government and politicians ars not bothered about small units because they don’t have captive voting power. “A survey was started few years back to regularise these industrial areas but it remains stuck till date,” said Bansal. Demands by industriesIn order to provide industries in these unauthorised areas basic infrastructure, the Gurugram Industrial Association (GIA) has now approached the state government to consider these units on the lines of Deendayal Upadhyay scheme for plotted areas. “It has been learnt that Haryana government has recently launched a web portal for unauthorised residential colonies to provide them with basic infrastructure. Such a scheme should also be implemented for unauthorised industrial areas so that they too can get basic infrastructure,” said JN Mangla, president, GIA, adding that they have written a letter to Haryana CM in this matter on Thursday.The GIA also demanded that government should forego charges, as external and internal development charges and change of land use and other fees, in order to give a boost to MSMEs in these areas. Deepak Maini, general secretary, Federation of Indian Industry, Gurugram Chapter, said that all units located in these areas pay property tax and also have valid GST numbers. “These units also generate lot of revenue and it’s the duty of the government to provide basic amenities and create an enabling environment,” said Maini. Sudhir Singla, MLA, Gurugram, when asked about the matter, said that he has already submitted the demands raised by these industrial associations to the chief minister for pre-budget consultation. “I will pursue this matter with the government as the industrial units are demanding only basic amenities. They generate jobs and pay taxes and must be supported,” he said. Rakesh Daultabad, MLA Badshahpur, in whose area some of these areas fall, said that he was aware about the issues being faced by industry in these areas. “I will work with local agencies and government to ensure that basic amenities are created,” he said.Amit Arya, media advisor to chief minister said that genuine demands of the industrial units would be considered and problems being faced by them with regards to basic infrastructure will be resolved. “The issues raised by industry associations with regards to basic amenities will be resolved soon,” said Arya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/industries-in-authorised-colonies-complain-about-lack-of-civic-infrastructure-101613929819160.html
21-02-2021||Gurugram||Clothing company employee booked for abetment to suicide||An employee of clothing company was booked on Saturday for allegedly abetting the suicide of a 45-year-old man, his junior colleague in the same company, near Hero Honda Chowk on Friday morning. While the suspect worked as the in-charge of the manufacturing department, the junior was the quality controller in the same department. The wife of the man who died alleged that he was upset after he being fired by the in-charge for not supporting him in making money through contractors. He left home on Friday early for morning walk and hanged to death from a tree. The police said the couple and their children lived in a rented accommodation in the Khandsa area for the last 32 years and belonged to Pithoragarh in Uttrakhand. The husband worked with the clothing company and woman is a house wife. On Friday, when the man returned from work, he looked upset. He informed his wife that he has been fired and that he is very disturbed. “He told me that the in-charge, who is also a contractor, was selling the garments at higher prices under different labels. When my husband objected to this practice, he threatened to frame him under false charges and fired him,” said the wife. The victim’s wife said she tried to console him but he was disturbed and didn’t sleep well on Friday night. He woke up at 5am and left for morning walk.

Shailender Singh, station house officer(SHO) of Sector 37 police station, said that they have registered the case against the in-charge and are conducting investigation. “We have recorded the statements of the family members, but are yet to record the statement of the staff working in the company,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/clothing-company-employee-booked-for-abetment-to-suicide-101613929818517.html
21-02-2021||Gurugram||Sadar Bazar to become free from vehicular traffic for a week||Sadar Bazar — the oldest market in the city — will be completely free of vehicular traffic between February 26 and March 4, as a part of a one-week trial by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which will take a call on making this a permanent feature based on the response. Established in the 1930s, Sadar Bazar remains heavily congested, with over 20,000 people visiting the market on a weekend. It has around 1,500 shops and 400 street vendors.Earlier this month, the civic body had announced that a one-week trial of making Sadar Bazar free from vehicular traffic will be executed. However, they had not given any definite timeline for it and had kept the tentative date as February 22-29.Another key decision taken by the MCG is to incorporate e-rickshaws into the trial.“At least 10 e-rickshaws have been authorised by the MCG to ferry visitors to different corners of the market. Depending on the distance, the fares will vary between ₹5-10,” said Jitender Kumar, joint commissioner, MCG.Besides making the market vehicle-free, the MCG will clear the streets of encroachments and set up dedicated vending zones for hawkers. Each hawker will be issued a unique ID card. Additionally, streetlights and benches will be installed. Further, green belts will be revived during the week-long trial. “All the arrangements will be completed by coming Thursday night to ensure that the trial can commence from Friday onwards. We will also be conducting a meeting with concerned stakeholders to discuss and ensure that the remaining features and changes are implemented,” said Kumar.Kumar said that on Monday, he will be holding a meeting with representatives of Gurugram Police regarding the installation of barricades at all entry and exit points to ensure that vehicles can no longer operate in the 600-metre stretch of the market between Jama Masjid and the Head Post Office. Further, they will also be asking them to deploy a few police officials at these points as well.Kumar added that, on Monday, he will also be holding an internal meeting with various wings of the MCG, such as the enforcement wing, sanitation wing, and engineering wing for matters related to encroachment, cleanliness, and civil works.“Depending on the success of the trial, we will take a call on making the changes permanent. We will incorporate suggestions and recommendations of all stakeholders, shopkeepers, as well as Gurugram residents before executing any permanent feature,” said Kumar.As per MCG officials, privy to the matter, the week-long trial is expected to cost around ₹15 lakh.During the trial, however, commercial vehicles carrying goods to shops and various warehouses in the market will be able to access the market, during its closing hours, between 11pm and 6am. Further, with a few pockets of residential houses, MCG officials also said that a car sticker system will be introduced to ensure a limited number of vehicles can access the streets of the market. However, the main street will continue to remain pedestrian-friendly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sadar-bazar-to-become-free-from-vehicular-traffic-for-a-week-101613929817345.html
21-02-2021||Gurugram||GMDA proposes slew of measures to boost groundwater recharge, experts sceptical||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), in a bid to increase the city’s groundwater recharge capacity by up to five times, has proposed a slew of measures including channelising creeks, and creating check dams as well as eight new ponds. The GMDA proposed these measures while responding to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the preparation of an action plan to mitigate the effect of reduction in recharge capacity due to concretisation of the Badshahpur drain, which was sought after a petition was filed in the green court. As per the “report on abetment measures undertaken by GMDA to negate the adverse impact of concretisation of Badshahpur drain”, signed by Rajesh Bansal, superintendent engineer for infrastructure division of GMDA, a total of 19,620 metres of the drain has been concretised, with 5,770 metres left intact. A copy of the report was accessed by HT. The Badshahpur drain — downwards from Ghata village till the Najafgarh drain, passing along Badshahpur — was concretised around five years ago by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). In May 2019, the NGT had sought a report from the state pollution control board regarding the impact of the concretisation and boxing of drain on groundwater recharge, the flow of water in the drain and impact on urban sprawl. Responding to this, the pollution control board in October 2019 had informed the NGT that “concretisation reduces the groundwater recharge.” The NGT then directed that abatement measures are adopted to ensure that rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge are not affected and flooding is avoided. The report states, “Creation of new pondage areas by constructing check dams across creeks, channelization of creeks, creation of recharge wells and construction of new drain from Vatika Chowk along SPR up to NH-48 to cater the additional run-off that is generated because of increase in the urbanization...” To arrest the flow of water towards Golf Course Road, the GMDA has planned to create check dams in the zones, where urbanisation is not possible, and provide recharge wells “to recharge the groundwater through natural and artificial recharging of the ground, rather than constructing large drainage channels and allowing the run-off to flow ultimately into Najafgarh drain and Yamuna river during rains.” The development authority aims to create eight ponds across 951 acres. The GMDA has also proposed the construction of 183 additional recharge wells to arrest the flow of stormwater and to reduce the run-off from the area. The report states that 100 recharge wells, along with ponds and creeks, will be made to recharge around 1,088,640 cubic metres in a year. Eighty-three more recharge wells along with drains will help in additional recharging of around 272,954 cubic metres per year. The officials will also work on reviving 26 ponds under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram. “Total proposed recharge in to ground as per the scheme is about five times the assessed reduction in the recharge capacity. No natural drain will be concretised, and drains will only be constructed in urbanised area to tap the run-off into the natural drains. The intent is to tap the run-off and increase the recharge by creation of check dams and to avoid the flooding in the area by channelisation of creeks,” the report states. Sudhir Rajpal, the chief executive officer of GMDA, who has recently taken over the charge, said, “We are working with all departments and still assessing the situation.” However, environmentalists have raised concerns about the plan proposed by the development authority. Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist, on whose petition the NGT had asked the authorities concerned to prepare a plan, said, “The petition was about boxing and narrowing down of the Badshahpur drain, which has not been addressed in the report. The narrowing down of the drain has heavily led to the compromise of its carrying capacity and groundwater recharge capacity. The report talks about the creation of an alternate drain to increase carrying capacity of Badshahpur drain, which needs new land to be acquired and we do not know how many years that might take.” Rana further said that the report does not mention the Ghata Jheel, which is an existing pond of about 150 acres and an integral water body. “The report says that over 950 acres of land will be revived as ponds and lakes, but it does not mention anything about the Ghata Jheel which is an interlinking water body of the Badshahpur drain. There are encroachments to a great extent on the lake, but still, over 150 acres of land which is part of the Jheel, can be restored even now. This only shows how a deep study has not been done before preparing the report,” said Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-proposes-slew-of-measures-to-boost-groundwater-recharge-experts-sceptical-101613929758572.html
21-02-2021||Gurugram||Air quality remains poor||Air quality in the city remained in the poor category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) on Sunday, for the first time in a week, with a reading of 296 on the daily pollution bulletin. This is up from a reading of 256 (also poor) the day prior. As per official forecasts, pollution levels are expected to remain in the upper end of the poor to the lower end of the very poor AQI category for the next five days.The average level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 204 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Sunday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 350µg/m3. Both the readings were beyond the permissible limit of 60µg/m³.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre, said that pollution levels will continue to improve over the next week, with rising temperatures expected to lead to higher wind speeds and increasing the mixing height of pollutants — 0which refers to the vertical height at which suspended particles mix with the air.“The wind speed is expected to touch about 15 kilometres per hour, and increasing temperatures will cause upward movement of air and increase the ventilation index, which indicates the rate of dispersal,” said Shrivastava.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the ventilation index is likely to increase from approximately 9000 m²/s on 22.02.2021 to 10,000 m²/s on 23.02.2021. A ventilation index of 6,000 m²/s or more is necessary for the effective dispersal of pollutants.While the IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record the minimum temperature on Sunday, the IMD’s AWS at the Palam observatory in Delhi recorded the day’s minimum temperature at 11.8 degrees Celsius and the maximum temperature at 26 degrees Celsius.As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 29 and 14 degrees Celsius, respectively, over the next few days. Shallow to moderate episodes of fog will continue during the morning, despite being an atypical weather phenomenon for this time of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-remains-poor-101613929759179.html

21-02-2021||Kolkata||'Not scared of rats': Mamata Banerjee after CBI seeks to question nephew’s wife||“A tiger cub is not scared of fighting cats and rats… We have stood before guns,” West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee retorted at a public event on Sunday evening, hours after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) visited the south Kolkata residence of her nephew and Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee and served notice to his wife for questioning in connection with the coal smuggling case.“Muscle flexing or threats of jail sentence cannot scare us. We have stood before guns in the past. We won’t be scared of fighting rats. I will not surrender as long as I am alive. You cannot break our spine. A tiger cub is not scared of cats and rats,” Banerjee said at the cultural event in Kolkata on the occasion of International Mother Language Day.Abhishek Banerjee’s wife, Rujira, was not present at the Harish Mukherjee Road building, named Santiniketan, when the five-member CBI team arrived around 2 pm on Sunday. The couple tied the knot in 2012 and have two children, a boy and a girl.Abhishek Banerjee, too, retaliated by taking to Twitter and saying that he will not be "cowed down" while the TMC leadership alleged that the CBI is working under instructions from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before the assembly polls to be held in March-April.Banerjee tweeted an image of the notice that CBI additional superintendent of police Umesh Kumar left at his residence.Also read: India, Maldives sign agreements for developing naval harbour, boosting defence"At 2pm today, the CBI served a notice in the name of my wife. We have full faith in the law of the land. However, if they think they can use these ploys to intimidate us, they are mistaken. We are not the ones who would ever be cowed down," he tweeted.The notice, served under section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC), said a CBI team would come to his residence and question his wife at 3 pm. The case was registered on November 27 last year. CBI officials said they have plans to question Rujira Banerjee on Monday morning.“It is known that the BJP will try to scare us before the polls. We are not worried,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy.The CBI team's visit raised the political heat when CM Banerjee spoke strongly at the event held on the occasion of International Mother Language Day which coincides with Bhasha Diwas, or language day, observed in Bangladesh on February 21 to honour Bengali, the state’s official language.Without naming the BJP, the chief minister said, “I speak with such pride because I speak in Bengali. The language gives me the courage. Today, on the 21st, let us throw a challenge for 21 (the year). I will be the goalkeeper. I will fight even if I am thrown in jail. We must win. Don’t try to hurt Bengal… Bengal will witness a new sunrise.”The chief minister criticised the Centre for not acting on the state’s request to rename West Bengal as ‘Bangla’ and alleged that her state is facing a stepmother-like treatment.“We are told that the word Bangla sounds similar to Bangladesh. How in that case Punjab should be renamed since there is a Punjab in Pakistan too… Our state is always shown in a bad light. There is always an effort to crush our spine,” said Banerjee.TMC leaders also upped the ante during the day.“If the CBI is so keen on cracking cases why doesn’t it arrest BJP leader Mukul Roy in the Narada case or Suvendu Adhikari in the Saradha chit fund case? Both are suspects,” said TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh who himself spent around two years in jail custody as a suspect in the Saradha case.On December 31, the CBI raided three residences of businessman and TMC’s youth front general secretary Vinay Mishra in connection with the coal smuggling case. Mishra is missing since then and has been declared an absconder by the agency.Abhishek Banerjee is the president of the TMC’s youth wing. On July 20, he appointed 15 general secretaries, including Mishra.It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. Another prime suspect, Anup Majhi, alias Lala, is also absconding.In early December, the CBI also raided the home and office of Ganesh Bagaria, a Kolkata-based chartered accountant.The agency has not made any official statement before the media till date.Ever since the probe started in September, the BJP has been alleging that the money from the sales was whitewashed through shell companies and siphoned into the funds of the ruling party. The BJP has also alleged that the main beneficiary is Abhishek Banerjee.“The CBI probe will unearth the involvement of more TMC leaders in different scams. The entire state knows that ruling party leaders are involved in the coal scam,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/not-scared-of-rats-mamata-banerjee-after-cbi-seeks-to-question-nephew-s-wife-101613928685383.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai feels the heat as temperatures soar to 36.3° Celsius||The city recorded a hot Sunday as temperatures soared to 36.3 degrees Celsius, at par with the season’s highest maximum temperature. The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is indicative of the city’s temperature, recorded a maximum temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius, a good 5 degrees above normal. This was the same as recorded on February 2 when the city marked the highest maximum temperature of the winter season. The Colaba station recorded a maximum temperature of 34.6 degrees Celsius, 4.4 degrees above normal. Both stations recorded a steep rise in maximum temperatures from Saturday’s 34.7 degrees Celsius (Santacruz) and 33.3 degrees Celsius (Colaba). “Because of the lower-level easterly winds and the delayed setting of the sea breeze over Mumbai, the maximum temperature rose in the city. The trend is likely to continue for the next couple of days,” said Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD Mumbai. Minimum temperatures also remained above normal. Santacruz recorded a minimum temperature of 21 degrees Celsius, which was 2.3 degrees above normal. At Colaba, the minimum temperature was 23 degrees Celsius, 3.5 degrees above normal.

21-02-2021||Delhi||Farm laws are death warrant for farmers: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||AAP convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met farmer leaders from Western UP on Sunday and demanded that the BJP-ruled central government withdraw the three farm laws, terming them "death warrant" for farmers.The meeting came ahead of a 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' that Kejriwal is scheduled to address on February 28 in Western UP's Meerut. The AAP has already announced that it is contesting the Assembly polls in UP in 2022 and this will be the first major appearance of Kejriwal in the poll-bound state.Over 40 farmer leaders from Western UP region that has been active in the farm laws protests at Delhi borders, specially Ghazipur border point with neighbouring UP, attended the meeting held at Delhi Assembly premises."These anti-farmer laws are death warrants to the farmers. With the implementation of these laws the crops will go to the hands of a few industrialists and the farmers of India will become labourers in their own land. "The central government should immediately withdraw all the three black laws and extend legal guarantee of MSP on all the 23 crops following the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission," the AAP chief said.The government should talk to the farmers. If the government does not listen to the farmers then who will, he questioned.No representative of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is leading the protest against farm laws at Delhi borders for nearly three months, was present in the meeting, sources said. The outfit has already declared its agitation as non-political one."Meerut Kisan mahapanchayat on February 28 will be joined by the farmers in large numbers. Discussion on the three farm laws will take place during that Mahapanchayat where immediate rollback of these laws brought by the BJP-ruled central government will be demanded by the farmers," Kejriwal said. The BJP is continuously saying that these laws will benefit the farmers but its leaders have yet not clarified how, he added.Talking to the media, farmer leader Rohit Jakhar of Rashtriya Jat Mahasangh said that while the UP government cut electricity and water supply at the Ghazipur protest site, Kejriwal's government supported farmers' protest by providing them water and toilets."Our support will go to those who will talk about our problems. The BJP government has hurt our self respect, we will give our reply through our votes," Jakhar said. He said Kejriwal gave respect to the farmer leaders just as Lord Krishna gave respect to his friend, Sudama, and asserted the agitation will continue till the Centre fulfills farmers demands.Another participant of the meeting, Chaudhary Yashpal Singh, said, "Arvind Kejriwal has assured us support."The meeting was also attended by Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel, Cabinet ministers Kailash Gehlot and Rajendra Pal Gautam, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and MLA Dilip Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farm-laws-are-death-warrant-for-farmers-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-101613927464053.html

21-02-2021||Pune||Mission Jhunj: 23-year old MIT student spearheads cleanliness at historical sites||A 23-year-old mechanical engineering student Malhar Pandey has made it a mission to keep old historic sites clean and bring them back to their old glory. Pandey, a history aficionado is a third-year student at MIT ADT university. He along with a group of friends have begun “Jhunj Mohim” under which they will undertake the mission to clean historical sites in and around Pune.“I am deeply interested in history, politics, and other aspects related to social sciences more than my technical studies. I love to write about our history, especially Maratha history, and wish to propagate it around the world,” said Pandey who is deeply influenced by the life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, and Veer Savarkar.“Mohim” means campaign in Marathi. Jhunj is an organisation that was started by my friends and myself when we were exploring historical sites in Pune. All of us are extremely enthusiastic about our history. We found that the condition of our historical sites is really poor, and we thought it is our duty to conserve these sites so that millions of Indians will come to know about our grand and glorious history,” said Pandey.Pandey along with his friends, Saurabh Jagtap, Sushrut Kinge, and Ruturaj Kale began these cleanliness drives. “The first mohim that we undertook was cleaning of Sati Ramabai Peshwa Samadhi in Theur, on January 26, 2020. At that time, nearly 20 people joined us. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, we were not able to undertake any such mohim in the year 2020. With a reduction in Covid-19 cases, we have decided to undertake this mission of cleaning and restoring the samadhi ofNanasaheb Peshwa. We wrote a letter to Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol and he gave the permissions and readily offered the team of PMC to help us in this cause,” he added.The samadhi of Nanasaheb Peshwe had a special appeal for Pandey. “Nanasaheb Peshwa, a leader and Peshwa of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj always regarded Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as his role model. Under his leadership, the Marathas unfurled the saffron flag on the fort of Atak (presently in Pakistan). He is also the one who build many temples in and around Pune, seeing the disfigured samadhi of Nanasaheb Peshwa, we felt really bad and as torchbearers of this glorious history and citizens of Pune we took it upon ourselves to clean and restore it.”People from all age groups have joined the mission whose main goal is not just conservation of historical sites but in general to conserve the glorious history of ancestors. “Social media and specifically Twitter has played a massive role in promoting our organization,” he added.Now every Sunday, he and his friends go on cycle ride to unknown places around Pune, looking at part of history that is in despair and shortlisting their next cleanliness and restoration missions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mission-jhunj-23-year-old-mit-student-spearheads-cleanliness-at-historical-sites-101613927537281.html
21-02-2021||City||'Politics of appeasement carving Kerala': Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday raked up issues such as love jihad and Sabarimala temple row to attack the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress in Kerala. Adityanath said that both the parties were in a race to implement appeasement politics in the state.While inaugurating the ‘Vijay Yatra’ of state president K Surendran in north Kerala’s Kasaragod, ahead of the assembly elections, the UP CM said in 2009 when the Kerala High Court sought action against love jihad, the CPI(M) and the Congress were in a hurry to deny it. Today, many states, including Uttar Pradesh, have enacted a law against it, he added.“When the High Court ordered the police to investigate the love jihad issue in 2009, both these parties denied it and supported such elements. Appeasement politics was carving Kerala and the Bharatiya Janata Party will put an end to it,” he said.Adityanath said the CPI(M) was even planning to open a ‘Halal Bank’ in the state - he was mentioning the state government's support to open a Sharia-compliant banking institution in north Kerala.Also read: Pakistan unlikely to exit ‘grey list’ as FATF meets to decide its fate - Report“The High Court had said love jihad will turn Kerala into an Islamic republic. But the government was sleeping and encouraging these elements. Now many state governments have enacted a law to contain the scourge,” he said.He also criticised the Kerala government’s handling of the Sabarimala temple issue. “The government had hurt feelings of believers. I laud BJP workers who stood with devotees. While the state government was trying to destroy Sabarimala, in Uttar Pradesh we are building a temple that will be the sole property of the nation,” he said.Kerala witnessed unrest in 2018 when the government tried to implement the Supreme Court verdict on Sabarimala removing all restrictions on women of child-bearing age.The UP CM also took a dig at the state government over its Covid-19 pandemic control measures. “Kerala chief minister once laughed at UP citing its health infrastructure. Today, Kerala reports a high caseload and the world is laughing at it. The rise in cases here exposes the state government’s failure. In UP, we have a population of 24 crores and we managed the virus situation well,” he said.The Yatra is seen as the launch of the BJP’s election campaign in the southern state where it is in the third position. Union home minister Amit Shah will address the concluding session of the rally in Thiruvananthapuram on March 7. The party is planning to parade many national leaders, including Union ministers Nirmala Sitaraman and Smriti Irani, during the yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/politics-of-appeasement-carving-kerala-yogi-adityanath-101613923365106.html
21-02-2021||Patna||Bihar set to table ₹2.15 lakh cr annual budget on Monday||Deputy chief minister Tar Kishore Prasad is all set to table the annual budget of around ₹2.15 lakh crore for fiscal 2021-22 in the state legislature on Monday for seeking its approval during the ongoing Budget session.Prasad, who also holds the finance portfolio, said that the impact of Covid-19-induced lockdown and subsequent fall in revenue collection had compelled the state government to restrain the budget outlay.“The state government was wishing to enhance the total outlay, but the overall situation did not support us,” said the deputy CM, while refusing to hint at the exact volume of the budget estimate.Officials of the finance department, however, told HT that the committed expenditure would be increased nominally as compared to the last fiscal in keeping with the rise in establishment cost. “However, plan head expenditure has been kept more or less unchanged owing to the deficit in tax collection,” said an officer.Also read: 'Second wave knocking on our door' - Maha CM on fresh Covid-19 surge in stateThe committed expenditure (which was earlier called non-plan head) is likely to be around ₹1.10 lakh crore, while scheme expenditure (previously categorised as plan head) will be ₹1.05 lakh crore. Last year, the state government had tabled the annual budget estimate of ₹2,11,761 crore, which included ₹1.059 lakh crore as committed expenditure and ₹1.057 lakh crore as scheme head expenditure.With the internal revenue collections and central devolutions dipping in this fiscal year owing to economic contraction caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the fiscal deficit for 2020-2021 is set to go up and hover around the 4 per cent mark of the state gross domestic product (SGDP), said officials.Talking to media persons on Saturday, principal secretary, finance, S Siddharth had said that the fiscal deficit has been capped at around 4 per cent, which was well within the permissible borrowing limit of 5 per cent of the SDGP despite the adverse impact on the state finances due to the Covid-19 outbreak.The state government has already borrowed ₹26,000 crore till January this fiscal as against the target of ₹28,000 crore, owing to the dip in internal revenue and devolutions. There are projections that the internal revenue target of ₹39,900 crore would fall short by ₹9,000 to ₹10,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-set-to-table-rs-2-15-lakh-cr-annual-budget-on-monday-101613918832285.html

21-02-2021||Delhi||NDMC may grant legal status to makeshift temple at Chandni Chowk||New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) The BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation will explore granting "legal status" to a prefabricated Hanuman temple that has come up at Chandni Chowk where a temple was demolished by authorities in January, NDMC Mayor Jai Prakash said Sunday, even as police initiated action in the matter."I have planned to call a high-level meeting tomorrow with officials to discuss possible ways by which legal status could be given to the structure," he said.He termed the matter "very sensitive", but said the structure anyway is on the median verge of the road.The Delhi government's Public Works Department (PWD) Saturday lodged a complaint with the police seeking action on setting up of the prefabricated, steel structure on the median verge of Chandni Chowk by unknown people.While no FIR has been registered so far in the case, a police officer said, "We have received the complaint and necessary legal action has been taken in the matter."He did not specify what "legal action" was taken by the police.The PWD complaint filed at the Kotwali Police Station stated that some unknown people kept the prefabricated structure at the median near Kucha Mahajani in Chandni Chowk on the night of February 18."This structure is basically an obstacle in the theme of the (Chandni Chowk beautification) project and placed without permission from project executing authorities. In this regard, it is requested to take necessary action at the earliest so that the project can be completed within timeline," the PWD complaint said.The makeshift structure has come up on the central verge of the main Chandni Chowk road, close to where an old Hanuman temple existed that was demolished in January following a court order, to pave way for the beautification work.Meanwhile, locals have started visiting the makeshift temple and offering prayer. The Lord Hanuman idol from the old temple has been kept there now, and a priest has also been deputed to officiate the worship.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the January demolition of the "ancient" Hanuman Mandir had hurt the sentiments of local residents and traders in the business district.The sudden reestablishment of the Hanuman Mandir at an undisputed site just few meters away from the original temple site has made people very happy, he said.During the past two days thousands of devotees along with BJP, Aam Aadmi Party and Congress leaders offered prayers here, he said."People are upset that the PWD has written to the Delhi Police objecting to the Mandir structure. People who saw AAP leaders performing a Havana at the Mandir were angered to see that the Delhi government has complained against the Mandir," Kapoor said.He has also written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal protesting against the PWD's complaint and demanded it be withdrawnThe new temple site is "undisputed" and the Chief Minister should ask PWD minister Satyendra Jain, who also heads the Religious Committee, to review and approve the new Mandir, making it part of the beautification plan, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ndmc-may-grant-legal-status-to-makeshift-temple-at-chandni-chowk-101613918529026.html

21-02-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM requests Union govt for glacier research centre in state||In the aftermath of the disaster in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has requested the Centre to set up a glacier research centre to study the fall of glaciers in the Himalayas.Rawat raised the demand during the NITI Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with all the chief ministers on Saturday.According to the officials, privy to the development, "During the meeting, Rawat cited the recent Chamoli disaster, reportedly caused by a glacier burst and avalanche in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, and said that Uttarakhand is suffering from various natural disaster including flash floods, avalanche or landslide each year. If a centre for the study of glaciers is established in the state, it will help in monitoring the disasters and find ways to avert them."Rawat's demand has come months after the Central government's department of science and technology (DST), under the Ministry of Science & Technology and Earth Sciences, decided to discontinue the project of Centre for Glaciology (CFG) in Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) in Dehradun.Also read: Amid oppn chorus, petroleum minister explains why petrol, diesel prices are risingThe decision was communicated with the WIHG officials in a letter dated June 25, 2020, which was received by WIHG in July. Under the letter, the DST directed the CFG to be merged with the WIHG from July 1 and all its activities to be managed by the existing staff of the WIHG. It had also asked the WIHG to relieve all the staff involved in the project.The centre, inaugurated in 2009 during the UPA government in the WIHG which was appointed as its nodal agency, had aimed to carry a coordinated research initiative on Himalayan glaciology to understand the effects of climate on glaciers to develop strategies for climate change adaptability. The Centre was also assigned to carry programmes in setting up a specialised institute on glaciology named the India Institute of Glaciology in Mussoorie. The then government had planned a fund of about ₹500 crore to develop the institute of which about 23 crore was released.Now, after CM raised a demand for a similar centre, experts say that such a centre or institute is the "need of the hour considering the constant changes in the glaciers in the Himalayas."DP Dobhal, a retired scientist for glaciology in the WIHG, who was also the coordinator for the CFG project, said, "A dedicated centre for the study of glaciers is much needed with the changes happening in the glaciers in the Himalayas which are the lifelines of many major rivers flowing in our country."Informing that there are about 10,000 glaciers in Indian Himalayas in an area of about 37,000 sq-km, Dobhal said before the CM raising the demand on Saturday, "I and other scientists suggested him to do so in our meetings citing the disaster-prone state.""In the developmental works like hydel power projects in the Himalayan rivers, it becomes more vital to study the glaciers to know if it can lead to any disaster in future or even to make modifications in the project plan accordingly to avert any possible disaster," said Dobhal adding that the CM had requested a such a centre for the state but "if it's set up to study the glaciers for other glaciers in the Indian Himalayas then it will be significant."On the possibility of the Centre accepting the demand, he said, "With the recent disaster in Chamoli, we hope it will be accepted."However, few other experts feel that after the discontinuation of the CFG project, if a new centre is opened then the scientists will again have to work from scratch.One of the scientists working on glaciology in the WIHG, on condition of anonymity, said, "In the now discontinued CFG project, many researchers were being trained to carry detailed and dedicated studies on glaciers. But after the discontinuation move, all the hard work of their trainers and theirs went into vain as they were also relieved.""People don't understand that training researchers on glacial studies are not teaching ABCD to someone. It requires time and resources considering the vitality of the subject that too in the context of a mountain range like the Himalayas," he said, adding that "it is just ridiculous that after scrapping a running project, there is a demand for another one."Another prominent scientist, Dr BR Arora, former director of the WIHG who was attached with the CFG project from the beginning, said, "Discontinuing it, had surely slowed down the speed of the ongoing glacial researches as it was completely a scientific project to study the dynamics of glaciers which were not known yet."Arora said that once established, the CFG would have helped in answering many questions on the glaciers."We all say that the Himalayan glaciers are melting but nobody exactly knows why they are melting. Is it all because of only global warming or any other man-made factors also? Under the CFG project, we were studying all this. We had also studied the difference between North-facing glaciers and South-facing glaciers and the reason for their melting accordingly," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-cm-requests-union-govt-for-glacier-research-centre-in-state-101613916155444.html

The PPCB should issue necessary directions to the industry for utilisation of 100% of dry fly ash for various usages. Since water is used to keep wet huge stocks of ash, it requires detailed examination if leaching is impacting groundwater table in the area,” said justice Singh.The TSPL has been asked to develop a greenbelt of three rows of plants of broadleaf around its periphery within three months. It will undertake validation of online emission data captured by the online continuous emission monitoring system on a six-monthly basis and provide a report to the PPCB for further analysis.Also, a green buffer of appropriate width between the coal handling area and boundary wall of the industry towards the prominent wind direction will be provided with three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/talwandi-sabo-thermal-plant-liable-to-pay-rs-85-lakh-to-farmers-ngt-s-state-panel-101613915836600.html

The couple tied the knot in 2012 and have two children, a boy and a girl.A huge police contingent was quickly deployed around the house which remains heavily guarded round the year.Also read: Puducherry govt crisis - 1 more Congress MLA resigns ahead of govt's floor testAt 2pm today, the CBI served a notice in the name of my wife.

We are not the ones who would ever be cowed down. pic.twitter.com/U0YB6SC5b8Banerjee retaliated by taking to Twitter and saying that he will not be "cowed down" by such an event.Banerjee tweeted an image of the notice that CBI additional superintendent of police Umesh Kumar left at his residence."At 2pm today, the CBI served a notice in the name of my wife. We have full faith in the law of the land. However, if they think they can use these ploys to intimidate us, they are mistaken. We are not the ones who would ever be cowed down," Banerjee tweeted.The notice, served under section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC), said a CBI team would come to his residence and question his wife at 3 pm. The case was registered on November 27 last year.“A CBI team did go Abhishek’s home but they could not serve any notice. The team went back. The officers said they would come again. It is known that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will try to scare us before the polls. We are not worried” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy.Since Assembly elections in Bengal will be held in March-April, the CBI team's visit raised the political heat.“This is part of a well-prepared script. The entire BJP leadership has targeted the chief minister and Abhishek Banerjee. If the CBI is so keen on cracking cases why doesn’t it arrest BJP leader Mukul Roy in the Narada case or Suvendu Adhikari in the Saradha chit fund case. Both are suspects,” said TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.On December 31, the CBI raided three residences of businessman and TMC’s youth front general secretary Vinay Mishra in connection with the coal smuggling case. Mishra is missing since then and has been declared an absconder by the agency.It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. Another prime suspect, Anup Majhi, alias Lala, is also absconding.In early December, the CBI also raided the home and office of Ganesh Bagaria, a Kolkata-based chartered accountant.Ever since the probe started in September, the BJP has been alleging that the money from the sales was whitewashed through shell companies and siphoned into the funds of the ruling party. The BJP has also alleged that the main beneficiary is Abhishek Banerjee.Banerjee is the president of the TMC’s youth wing. On July 20, he appointed 15 general secretaries, including Mishra.“The CBI probe will unearth the involvement of more TMC leaders in different scams. The entire state knows that ruling party leaders are involved in the coal scam,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/wont-be-cowed-down-says-abhishek-banerjee-as-cbi-seeks-to-question-wife-101613907490874.html
21-02-2021||Pune||Only hold important classes on campus||Colleges have reopened across the city from February 15 with students allowed to attend classes in batches. The college management have put in place safety precautions related to the coronavirus. With Maharashtra seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases since Wednesday (February 10), suggest steps that the state, local and college authorities should take to prevent and avoid campus outbreaks.Strictly follow safety precautions Now that college campuses have reopened for students after 11 months, the coronavirus cases are reported to be on a rise in the city. Hence, masks should be made mandatory for students, teachers and staff as a precautionary measure on the campus. Sanitiser should be available for students on the premises of the college. Some lectures can be taken online while practical and important lectures can be taken offline. As college offices will be seeing a rush as students submit exam forms and fees, steps should be taken to ensure that social distancing and other Covid safety measures are in place.Gauri MarneThermal checks of students must College authorities should arrange classes in batches, making mask, sanitiser and social distancing norms mandatory on premises. The temperature and oxygen level of students (thermal checking) should be checked. Arrangements should be made to ensure prompt medical assistance to those found with possible Covid symptoms.Parnavi DeviContinue with online classes The intention of reopening college campuses for students may not be a good idea as Maharashtra is witnessing a rise in Covid infections. Hence, the authorities should continue online classes till June 2021 to check the possible next wave of the virus. This practical implementation would have served better for students to avoid the possible risk of getting infected and cleared their academic year exams by June 2021. Plus, I feel if the government tries to implement new rules in haste, many students will find the new restrictions distracting when they are preparing for exams. Hope the government takes adequate steps to check the possible spread of virus.Rahul UpadhyeAvoid unnecessary gathering at campusesProper sanitation system should be in place at colleges and students should be asked to follow sanitising norms, besides strictly wearing mask and following following social distancing at the campus. Colleges should try to hold maximum lectures online, and allow offline only for practical and important lectures. Colleges should avoid holding public functions on the campus. Relaxation must be granted to students on 75% compulsory attendance policy. Students should not be allowed to spend time at the campus unnecessarily. We should accept the “new normal” caused by the Covid pandemic and follow safety measures.Omkar ShendeColleges should have offline classes twice a weekIt is okay to reopen college campuses provided Covid guidelines are followed strictly. However, the classes should be limited to practical and problem solving sessions. The colleges should reopen twice a week with reduced classroom hours to facilitate students to complete courses with minimum Covid risk.Ajay KateFollowing prevention norms should be top priorityThough students are excited to meet teachers and friends on campuses after a long time, authorities should take steps to ensure they follow the Covid prevention norms. Teachers should undergo Covid test as they will be meeting students. Tables and chairs should be arranged at classrooms as per social distancing norms. Equipment used by students for practicals must be regularly sanitised. As many private coaching institutes have resumed offline classes by following the Covid prevention norms, likewise colleges can also resume classroom teaching.Mandar RajputStudents should avoid casual approach on social distancingUnless students follow the precautionary measures seriously, the efforts of educational institutes will not be fruitful. Although vaccine is out still it is not given to the general public and our lax attitude in following the Covid safety norms could cause a surge in cases in the city. Student movement at campuses should be strictly monitored. They should not be allowed to hangout after lectures. Casual approach and disregard for advisories issued by the authorities could pose virus spread risk.Sayali ShindeAuthority should promote self-care at campusWe are carrying out thermal check of every student at the gate and keeping a record. The student strength at classrooms has been limited to 50 per cent. Students have to sanitise hands every time they enter classrooms. Equipment used by students are sanitised after every class. Wearing a mask or covering you face is mandatory for students and staff. Students, teachers and staff who fall ill are asked to stay home. Self-care is promoted on campus by the college authority. Least physical interaction is allowed on campus, especially during in group projects and library reading. Also, we are offering yoga and health classes to students. Nutan Kanegaonkar KulkarniColleges must follow precautionary measuresWhile we desperately want to attend college in person and carry out our education via physical classes, there are still a number of students from our batch who are sceptical given the rising case count in Maharashtra, which is currently the largest contributor to the overall count in the country. Hence, things are still on the edge about the Covid situation but I believe all this can be handled well if proper sanitation and social distancing measures are put in place.Saloni DhumneFollow norms strictlyAfter passing my SSC (Class 12) exams, I was excited to go to college but the Covid pandemic limited our classes to online. Things were slowly returning to normal before the sudden surge in cases became a cause of concern. We are supporting the college authorities and following Covid guidelines. If students follow the prevention norms then offline classes can be conducted in a secured environment.Rajeshwari MarneCarry one extra mask on campus should be made compulsoryStudents and college authorities need to work together to check the spread of Covid at campuses. Closing campuses again should not be considered, but safety norms should be implemented strictly. Keeping one extra mask should be made compulsory for students. Hanging out in groups should be avoided.Piyush DeshmukhAs told to Jigar Hindocha||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/only-hold-important-classes-on-campus-101613906656239.html

Today, it is as important an area as Colaba." He said, referring to his residence at Matoshree in Kalanagar. He further said, "It's not like we are working only for elites. I am very proud of inaugurating a cycle track today.

The spread of the disease, which was slowing down, has once again accelerated the city.In September last year, when Covid-19 was at its peak, Mumbai recorded nearly 2,000 cases daily towards the end of the month, according to Maharashtra government's Covid-19 dashboard. The trend continued for a few weeks, but then the daily caseload started dropping.By November, the city was recording over 1,000 cases daily and the number fell further in December, with the average daily cases hovering between 600-700, according to the state government's dashboard.Buoyed by the falling number of Covid-19 cases, the Maharashtra government brought in some relaxations, allowing cinema halls to reopen from November 5. India's worst-hit state was on road to recovery.The trend continued till January, and the state government further opened the local trains in February.But in the last two weeks of this month, the cases have spiked again. An analysis of the daily number of cases in Maharashtra government's dashboard, the number of daily cases has risen from 599 to 897, the city's sharpest single-day spike since November 29 when the daily caseload stood at 940.On February 14, the daily Covid-19 cases in Mumbai were 645, by February 17, it had increased to 721. The number stood at 736 on February 18, 823 on February 19 and 897 yesterday, according to Maharashtra government's Covid-19 dashboard. Mumbai's Covid-19 tally now stands at 3,18,207.The doubling rate of cases in the city has dropped to 371 days, down from 393 on Friday, 417 on Thursday, 445 on Tuesday, and 455 on Monday. The growth rate of cases has now increased to 0.19%, up from 0.18% on Friday, 0.17% on Thursday, 0.16% on Tuesday and 0.15% on Monday.The areas of concern are the Mumbai suburban areas where the weekly cases have risen by 19 per cent. In Nagpur, Amravati, Nashik, Akola and Yavatmal the weekly cases have increased by 33 per cent, 47 per cent, 23 per cent, 55 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively, the ministry underscored.Maharashtra too is grappling with a spike in Covid-19 cases. On Friday, it reported 6,112 new cases, the highest daily addition in 84 days, taking the caseload to 20,87,632. The last time Maharashtra had reported over 6,112 cases was on November 27 last year (6,185 cases).Dr Sanjay Oak, who heads the coronavirus task force comprising senior specialist doctors, blamed the laxity shown by people. "People are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. They need to restrain themselves," he said.Dr Oak, however, ruled out that it is the "second wave" of the coronavirus pandemic in Maharashtra.Maharashtra Government's Principal Secretary (Health) Pradeep Vyas also blamed people's "indiscipline and negligence" for the spike."There is laxity in following protocols. People are not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour," he said."Authorities have to tell people that coronavirus is still around and the masses should not be lax and negligent," Vyas said.Between Monday and Friday, the state added 23,354 cases, much higher than the 15,149 cases that were added in the same duration the previous week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-10-days-mumbai-s-daily-covid-19-cases-near-nov-level-second-wave-fear-looms-101613900864923.html
21-02-2021||Bangalore||Panchamasali Lingayat seers give ultimatum to Yediyurappa govt over reservation||Thousands of members of the Panchamasali Lingayat community gathered in Karnataka’ Bengaluru on Sunday demanding reservations for the community and its inclusion under the Category 2A in the state quota, warning that if the BS Yediyurappa-led government fails to do so they will organise a massive protest march.“If Yediyurappa-led government doesn't respond by today, we will begin satyagraha and head towards the Vidhan Sabha,” J Mruthyunjaya Swami, one of the main members leading the protest, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The gathering amassed at Palace Grounds in Bengaluru after influential Panchamasali Lingayat seers led a week-long march from Kudalasangama in Bagalkote district, about 500km from Bengaluru, demanding that the Yediyurappa government take note of the reservation demands of the community. Several leaders from Congress and the BJP were also seen raising demands for the reservation for the community at the gathering.Yediyurappa has come under widespread criticism from various quarters, including his own party’s leaders as well as the opposition, who claim that the Karnataka chief minister has not given due consideration to the demands of the Panchamasali Lingayat community. The Panchamasali Lingayat community is one of the largest sub-sect within the Lingayat community.Karnataka minister Murugesh Nirani had said last week that the government should consider giving reservation to the Panchamasali Lingayats. “There is nothing wrong to include this community in the 2A category of the backward classes list and entitle them (15%) reservations in government jobs and education,” Nirani was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Yediyurappa along with state home and law minister Basavaraj Bommai said that they are listening to the inputs shared by fellow cabinet members as well as other lawmakers to address the issues raised by these communities while addressing the press on Thursday.“I have discussed it at the cabinet meeting, all the ministers have expressed their opinion, discussions are on regarding the way forward,” the chief minister was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The Yediyurappa-led government is also facing demands for reservation from the dominant Vokkaliga and Veerashaiva-Lingayat communities. It is also facing demands for reservation from the Kuruba community as well. The Karnataka government currently provides 15% reservation for communities who come under Scheduled Castes (SC), 3% reservation for Scheduled Tribes (ST) and 32% reservation for communities under the communities who come under the ambit of other backward classes (OBCs).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/panchamasali-lingayat-seers-give-ultimatum-to-yediyurappa-govt-over-reservation-101613900479934.html
21-02-2021||Bangalore||Yatnal sets Yediyurappa new timeframe for 2A reservation for Panchamasali||Basanagouda Ramanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand Bharatiya Janata Patil (BJP) legislator from Bijapur city (Vijayapura) on Sunday launched another offensive against the state government without naming chief minister B S Yediyurappa and demanded that Panchamasali community is included in the 2A category in the State OBC list by the end of the budget session."We have given memos. But this time we are here to take our reservation and not give another memo," Yatnal said in Bengaluru.The rally of Panchamasali community, a sect of the dominant Lingayats, are among several politically influential communities in the state including the Kuruba, Vokkaligas and Valmikis who have sought increase in existing reservations. Panchamasalis are categorised in 3B subdivision under the Backward Class (BC) category and are demanding inclusion in the 2A subdivision which offers 15% reservation in education and employment. Yediyurappa has referred the matter to the state backward classes commission and has assured to do all he can as he faces pressure from the sub-sect, who like others Lingayats, have firmly backed him and the BJP in Karnataka for at least the last two decades.Yatnal, a staunch critic of Yediyurappa, said that he will raise the issue on March 4 at the beginning of the budget session of the state legislature in Bengaluru. The Sunday demand seemed to have cut short the earlier three month time the community had proposed to give the government for affecting the change. Yatnal was speaking at a massive rally at the Palace Grounds, the culmination point for over 700 km long or march led by influential seers of the Panchamasali. The march started on 14 January from Kudalasangama in Bagalkot district and was attended by seers like Jaya Mruthyunjaya Swamy.Earlier, Yatnal was issued a notice by the BJP for repeated attacks on Yediyurappa and his family as well as talking about a change in leadership in the state."You cannot shut me up by issuing notices," Yatnal said, repeatedly referring to the Yediyurappa-led government as a "natak company". "If you think you can shut me up, you would be forced to vacate your chair," Yatnal said to loud roars from the thousands gathered at the rally. Thousands participated in the rally, holding flags and screaming "Jai Panchamasali", in what the seers described as "a show of strength".Also Read:Karnataka CM urges PM Modi to approve 6 canal modernisation project proposalsApart from prominent seers, senior BJP ministers like CC Patil and Murugesh Nirani and leaders from the Congress were also seen on the event stage. "We are doing all we can to get this 2A," said Nirani, Karnataka's minister for mines and geology.The rally also saw seers and leaders make a clear distinction between Lingayats and Panchamasali. Though there are at least 99 sub-sects under Lingayats, the distinctions made by speakers at the rally could add to Yediyurappa's challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/yatnal-sets-yediyurappa-new-timeframe-for-2a-reservation-for-panchamasali-101613900016963.html

She had later posted a video where she was seen assisting Nishad in rowing the boat.Nishad had informed Priyanka about issues that boatmen belonging to the Nishad community were facing, including brutality against them by police whom he alleged had destroyed their boats. The boatman requested her assistance in raising their voices against the oppression to which she agreed, party sources said.Sujit had said that several boats belonging to the Nishad community, an OBC (other backward class) caste, were damaged by police and administrative officials.The Uttar Pradesh government banned the use of boats in sand mining across the state on 24 June 2019. Suddenly millions of Nishads became unemployed. So there is anger among the caste. Lakhs of Nishads depend on rivers for their livelihood in Uttar Pradesh.In 2013, the NGT prohibited the extraction of sand from rivers using machines, but mining companies continue to extract it with Pokeland machines and the government levies tax.There has been a dispute between the mining mafia and Nishads in and around Ghurpur for about 15 years. Nishads have been in conflict with the police over it.In the Banswar village near Ghurpur, on January 30, there was Raj Contract which has now been shut down. On February 4, some people complained that illegal mining was being done here. The police came, damaged 16 boats and 30 people were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-gandhi-in-up-s-prayagraj-to-meet-boatmen-harassed-local-police-101613898869279.html

The Mamata Banerjee-led TMC tweeted a picture of a public event where a BJP leader is addressing the audience of only one man while the rest of the seats lie vacant. The original video has Pakistani influencer and content creator Dananeer Mobeen vacationing in a hilly location and in her 15-second video, she can be heard saying, "Ye humari car hai aur yeh hum hai aur ye humari pawri ho rahi hai (this is our car, this is us, and this is our party)". The TMC shared its parody targeting the BJP over state assembly elections slated for later this year. “Yeh @BJP4Bengal hai. Yeh unki jansabha hai. Aur yahaan inki pawri ho rahi hai!” the TMC tweeted. Yeh @BJP4Bengal hai.Yeh unki jansabha hai.Aur yahaan inki pawri ho rahi hai!🤭😂 pic.twitter.com/2mCB2aTedxThe authenticity of the image shared could not be verified. Several celebrities and even the Uttar Pradesh police came up with their own “pawri ho rahi hai” versions, urging residents to complain against those partying till late in the neighbourhood. “Late night #PawriHoRahiHai aur aap disturb ho rahe toh call karein 112 (If there’s late night party happening around and you are getting disturbed, call 112),” the police in Uttar Pradesh had tweeted. Late night #PawriHoRahiHai aur aap disturb ho rahe toh call karein 112 pic.twitter.com/vc74SmtDmFThe BJP and TMC are at loggerheads and the tensions between them have become even more intense as the assembly polls draw closer. On Saturday, the ruling Trinamool Congress launched its slogan for the upcoming assembly elections — ‘Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chay’ (Bengal Wants Its Own Daughter). The BJP hit back on Sunday with its counter slogan 'Bangla Didir Theke Mukti Chay’ (Bengal Wants Relief From Didi) and released it with an animation music video.A tune from Communist Italy, sung to protest against atrocities, echoes once again in West Bengal as people stand up to the injustices of the ruling dispensation.Our ideologies may differ, but the language of protest always rings true.#BanglaDidirThekeMuktiChay #PishiJao pic.twitter.com/32KN4395h6As the TMC pushes its 'insider-outsider' narrative, the BJP leadership has built suspense over its chief ministerial candidate for the eastern state. Union home minister Amit Shah, however, recently said the BJP's CM candidate will not be an outsider.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/tmc-catches-on-pawri-ho-rahi-hai-meme-takes-a-dig-at-bengal-bjp-101613898684814.html

Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh wrote a letter to the PMC and demanded to pay mining royalty based on the development work in the city. As per law, those who dig three feet below the surface have to pay a royalty of ₹400 per 200 cubic feet to the revenue department. In the city premises, this tax is collected by the tahsildar under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code 1965, 48(7). Deshmukh stated in the letter that there are development works being carried out by different governments, non-government bodies, and the local self-government in the city area. As per law, the government agency should add ₹400 per 200 cubic feet royalty to the contractor bill and deposit the funds to state government coffers. It has been found that the PMC has deposited a lesser royalty amount in comparison to the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) in spite of having more land under its jurisdiction than the PCMC. Therefore, the PMC should have checked development works and taken an appropriate decision. The letter was issued by the district collector on February 17, 2021. In the month of January 2021, the district Collector sent a similar letter to the PMC. In this letter, the collector mentioned the amount paid by the PMC contractors. It was ₹15. 54 crores whereas PCMC contractors paid ₹13.06 crore until November 2020. Dr Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner said,” We will look into the matter and respond to the district administration.” Suresh Jagtap, additional municipal commissioner said, “On the background of Covid-19 pandemic, the development work was hampered. Therefore, the amount is less. Now, the PMC has floated various development works and the royalty amount will reflect that in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/district-collector-questions-pmc-s-mining-royalty-amount-101613894418055.html

The commissioner has allocated ₹1 crore to develop amenity spaces under placemaking initiative in ten different parts of the city.Shivaji Lanke, superintendent engineer, Bhavan (construction) department, said, “Though the fund is allocated in budget-2021-22, we have to find amenity place to implement the concept. Therefore, ₹1 crore has been allocated.”The project will be implemented at Kothrud, Kharadi, Vishrantwadi, Bavdhan, Baner, Balewadi, Dhanori, Mundhwa, Sinhagad road and Warje Malwadi areasEarlier, PMC implemented some of the placemaking concepts in Wadgaonsheri and Bibwewadi areas with the theme of ecology and innovation. However, after its construction, it is lying unused as neither the Bhavan department (which developed it) nor the garden department is taking responsibility for maintaining the placemaking projects.In Wadgaon Sheri, the local corporation has demanded to convert placemaking into a hospital so that it can be used for a public purpose. While the Bibvewadi area, the place has been occupied by hawkers. The department had registered a complaint with the anti-encroachment department, but no action has been taken yet.“Due to lack of maintenance and Covid, two placemaking projects were lying idle. Now, we have floated a tender for maintenance of these two projects,” said Lanke.Civic activist, Kaka Kulkarni said, “It is wastage of public money. Instead of that, the corporation should use funds to improve health infrastructure amid the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/even-as-two-projects-lie-unused-pmc-decides-to-fund-10-such-proposals-101613894417227.html

In this case, a media statement is not required at all. The seizure of property is not supposed to happen either. We are going to move HC against this statement. Plus, if someone is repeatedly filing false cases against me, why will I stay at home and invite arrest?” said Advocate Vijaisinh Thombare, representing Marne. The eight arrested men were identified as Mehbook Mortuja Mohammad Syyed (33) a resident of Hyderabad road in Solapur; Rajshekhar Yelappa Basge (26) a resident of Marunji, Hinjewadi; Jayvardhan Jaipal Birnale (24) a resident of Shivaji Chowk area in Hinjewadi; Lakshman Eknath Alhat (40) a resident of Pimpri; Sunil Dnyanoba Kamble (30) a resident of a resident of Donaje village in Haveli; Rahul Vitthal Dalvi (35) a resident of Jaibhavani nagar in Wadgaon Sheri; Dhananjay Subhash Humbir (31) a resident of Wagholi; and Kiran Vijay Majhire (30) a resident of Bhukum in Mulshi, according to a statement issued by Pournima Gailwad, Deputy commissioner of police, Zone-3, Pune police.The seized cars included Toyota Land Cruiser, Ford Endeavour, Toyota Fortuner, Tata Nexon, KIA Seltos, Mercedes, and BMW.According to the statement, nine others booked in a Warje Malwadi case along with Marne were identified as Pradeep Dattatray Kendre (36), Bapu Shrimant Bagal (34), Ananta Dnyanoba Kadam (37), Ganesh Namdev Hundare (39), Rupesh Krushnarao Marne (38), Sunil Namdev Bansode (40), Shrikant Sambhaji Pawar (34), and Sachin Appa Takawale (34), and Santosh Shelar.

21-02-2021||Pune||Pune police release sensitive information of DSK investors online||The Pune police have released sensitive data of DSK investors with the intention of awareness about registration in the list of beneficiaries on police record. The police have released a list of registered unsecured loan holders and fixed deposit investors who had given their money to the companies run by Pune-based realtor Deepak Sakharam Kulkarni (DSK), his wife Hemanthi Kulkarni, their relatives, and colleagues. The police have a list of around 35,000 investors while the released list includes information of around 4,500 investors, according to assistant commissioner of police Shivaji Pawar who is investigating the case. The EOW is headed by deputy commissioner of police Bhagyashri Navatake. The Pune police Twitter handle has tweeted the link to the list of people, who filled out these forms, on their Twitter handle. The list gives away information like phone number, account number, bank name, and IFSC along with the name of the account holder. The two lists include 334 people who had made their investments through unsecured loans to DSK and 4,487 people who had invested money through fixed deposits. “Cell phone numbers are points of communication and it is also where you get the OTP. A person who has access to these three pieces of information, a person can call the account holder and coax them into revealing information about their accounts. It is irresponsible of the police to do this,” said Rizwan Shaikh, a cybersecurity expert, and chief technology officer at Prestine InfoSolutions Pvt Ltd. The realtor is now in jail along with his wife, son, and multiple employees and relatives. These were the investors who were promised regular returns by the realtor and his wife. While the business worked for multiple years and it turned into a source of side-income for many, the returns stopped coming in 2018. Eventually, a case for cheating and sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act was registered at Shivajinagar police station and taken over by the Economic offence wing of Pune police. DSK and his wife were arrested from a hotel in Delhi in February 2019. Eventually, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) got involved and multiple FIRs and cases were registered against the realtor in various parts of the country. “People in those lists have already lost their money. They are desperate to get it back one or the other way. This information can be combined with other information and then used to target the people in those lists. They could argue as this is a public hearing, the data has to be public. But they could have masked the numbers. The data can be used for setting up phishing campaigns. The number of people on that list it huge. Somebody is bound to fall for the scam,” said Sudhir Shirsath, an independent cyber security expert.The police have a record of 35,000 such investors based on complaints received during the registration of the FIR against DSK. “The aim was to let the ones who have no registered yet to register and for those who have already registered to verify the information that has been recorded. But we will think about this angle and make necessary changes too,” said assistant commissioner of police Shivaji Pawar of EOW Pune police who is investigating the case.As per a Maharashtra government resolution passed in February 2019 for digitisation of information, the complainants were asked to submit information in another format.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-release-sensitive-information-of-dsk-investors-online-101613894235581.html

21-02-2021||Bangalore||Sunil Raoh: My next release has a lot of firsts in Kannada films||Actor Sunil Raoh has been a part of Kannada films ever since he was a child, and then transitioned to doing films as an adult as well. He might have slowed down on the number of films he took up in the past couple of years, but his comeback is all set to be a fantasy film, called Thurthu Nirgamana which means emergency exit in Kannada.“It’s been in the making for three years, including the whole of last year. It’s not a VFX heavy film, but there are some things that have not been seen in Kannada films before, so that way there are a few firsts we have tried. It took some time, and none of it is there just for the sake of it,” he says.The actor says they have been waiting for it to get a theatrical release, which got stuck due to the Covid 10 pandemic lockdown in 2020. Raoh says, “Just an exclusive OTT release doesn’t make sense, keeping in mind the visuals we have created. It may not be on a grand scale, but once you watch it on the big screen, you will know why we waited for a theatrical release. The visuals will be able to create an experience for the film goer. Everybody will come out saying it’s good they didn’t watch it on a mobile or tablet.”Having begun his career at the age of five, he further reveals that since he belongs to a family of musicians, the original plan was to just sing for his first film, Elu Suttina Kote. “It was by chance. I sang for a film, and was asked if I would do a role too, and I took to acting till about my high school days. Then once I got back to acting in the first year of college, I did television. In 2003, I made my debut as a leading actor in films. I got a couple of small supporting roles in other films, that’s when I decided I am ready for bigger roles. Thankfully, I got some really good offers, and they worked out well for me. In 2010, I thought I should take a break, and that I was capable of more. I needed to sit back and take a look at where my career was going. It expected it to be a small break, and it ended up being quite a big one. Till about 2017 I was completely away from acting,” confesses Raoh.He adds that it was indeed a case of waiting for the right films to come his way, and that happened after there was a change in the kind of films being explored. The actor explains, “There was a change happening in Bollywood. What happens in Indian films, is sure to trickle down to Kannada films. A lot more younger, experimental, independent filmmakers with newer thoughts and working styles came up. That’s what I was hoping for and thankfully, that happened. I started again with a web series, Loose Connection in 2017, and then this film. It’s lovely to come back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/sunil-raoh-my-next-release-has-a-lot-of-firsts-in-kannada-films-101613893996452.html

"The charges against all the accused have been proven to be correct in the course of investigation. We will take further appropriate legal action," the SP said.The case was registered on February 2 after the minor girl, staying in a rented house at Kundwa Chainpur in Sikarahana subdivision in East Champaran district was reported to have been gang raped by four men on January 21and later murdered at her accommodation. The accused then allegedly connived with the then station house officer (SHO) Sanjeev Kumar to force the victim’s family to cremate her.Also Read:Patna’s more than 80% buildings are not earthquake resilient, warn expertsThe whole plot surfaced after an audio clip with the voice of the SHO went viral, prompting his suspension.

21-02-2021||Patna||Patna’s more than 80% buildings are not earthquake resilient, warn experts||More than 80% buildings in Patna are not earthquake resilient, experts said, and warned that they may not withstand a major tremor in future, causing huge loss of human lives and infrastructure.Bihar’s capital city is one of the most vulnerable to earthquakes as per the National Centre of Seismology (NCS), India Meteorological Department (IMD). Patna falls under Zone IV, classified as a severe zone by the NCS.With the latest one reported on February 15, the city receives aftershocks most times an earthquake shakes up Indo- Nepal border areas. On August 21, 1988, when a 6.9 magnitude quake hit Nepal near the Indian border, the entire north Bihar including Patna shook for 15 seconds and the tremors left behind cracks in thousands of buildings including the old secretariat in the capital.In 2015, an earthquake of 7.8 magnitude on Richter scale hit the capital in April, followed by another earthquake of 7.3 magnitude in May, though their epicentre was in Nepal. These quakes damaged many old structures in the city.Bihar Building Byelaws 2014 have guidelines for making new construction earthquake resilient, the state government decided to identify the vulnerabilities of old buildings and improve their strength with retrofitting.“But hardly a few state buildings have been covered under this programme,” Sunil Kumar Chaudhary, Bihar Engineering Service Association general secretary and former Bihar State Disaster Management Authority, official said.The plan was to first address issues with heavily populated important buildings like government offices, hospitals and schools, he added.“A large part of the state capital is yet to get this infrastructural makeover. Work in this direction has been moving at a snail’s pace,” he said. Even for new constructions people tend to ignore the guidelines. Buildings continue to come up in a haphazard manner, he added.“People fail to realize that the state is a seismically active zone and while eight districts fall under Zone V, which is a very severe seismic zone, altogether 24 districts including Patna come under Zone IV- the severe zone. Though it’s hard to say when and where the next earthquake will hit, scientists say big quakes are inevitable,” he said.The former BSDMA official said that since no major earthquake has been witnessed in the Himalayan area after the Nepal earthquake of 8.5 magnitude in 1934, when several districts including Munger, Sitamarhi, Madhubani and Darbhanga were decimated the next big earthquake in near future can’t be ruled out. “This long gap is the signal for another earthquake of similar magnitude in the coming years and if it happens, there will be huge loss of life and property,” he said.Atul Aditya Pandey, head of the geology department, Patna University, said, “The most unfortunate part is people tend to flout norms required for earthquake resilient constructions despite experiencing tremors. Visit the interiors of the colonies like Kankarbagh, Postal Park, Chandmari Road, Saidpur, Lohanipur in the city and you will find buildings have been constructed without leaving the minimum space,” he said.Also Read: One nation, one rate: Nitish Kumar pushes for uniform power rates for all statesBK Mishra, senior adviser (technical), Bihar State Disaster Management Authority, said the BSDMA has been working hard to improve things in the state. “It’s difficult to make all the existing buildings in the city earthquake resilient. Even then the BSDMA is providing technical support to various government departments to handle vulnerability assessment and retrofitting work.

21-02-2021||Kolkata||‘Pamela Goswami’s father says she’s a drug addict’, Kolkata Police claim||The father of Pamela Goswami, the flamboyant youth wing leader of the BJP arrested for alleged possession of cocaine, had told Kolkata police she had become a drug addict under the influence of a friend whom he wanted to be kept "under watch", police sources said Saturday.Sources in the city police said Goswami and her friend Prabeer Kumar Dey, who was arrested with her on Friday, were living together for some time.Clad in a red saree, a bespectacled Goswami created a flutter at a city court where she was produced, trying to wriggle out of the grasp of police and screaming that Rakesh Singh, a close aide of BJP's West Bengal pointsman Kailash Vijayvargiya, "plotted" her arrest.Goswami, a former fashion model and small-time actress, was remanded in police custody till February 25.Also Read: Pamela Goswami accuses BJP colleague of conspiracyVery active on social media platforms where she had taken on celebrities like singer Rihanna over the farmers protest, Goswami was arrested with Dey and her personal security guard Somnath Chatterjee on Friday after 90 gm of cocaine was allegedly found in her handbag and concealed in the car she was travelling."I want a CID investigation. Rakesh Singh is close to Kailash Vijayvargiya. Arrest him. This is his conspiracy. I have all evidence," Goswami shouted, as a battery of journalists followed her into the courtroom.Claiming that Goswami had been "brainwashed" by Kolkata police and the ruling TMC, Singh said he was not in touch with her for over a year. He said he was ready to face investigation by any agency."If I am involved, they can call me or Kailash Vijayvargiya or Amit Shah. I think the police have brainwashed her. I am not in touch with Pamela for more than one-and-a half-years now," Singh told PTI."It's possible that the Kolkata police is following the Trinamool Congress's instructions. They are conspiring against me. These are baseless accusations and I am ready to face any challenge," he added.The TMC was quick to grab the opportunity to berate the BJP, its challenger in the assembly election sweepstake."Earlier, one of their leaders was arrested for involvement in child trafficking. Now another has been arrested in a drugs case. This proves what the BJP and its leaders are up to," TMC secretary-general and state minister Partha Chatterjee said.He was apparently referring to the CID questioning BJP Rajya Sabha MP Roopa Ganguly in connection with an alleged child trafficking case in Jalpaiguri in 2017 in which the party's women cell general secretary Juhi Chowdhuri was arrested.The CID had claimed to have unearthed a child trafficking racket where children were sold, some to foreigners, in illegal adoption deals."No gentleman is associated with a party like the BJP. Only criminals, drug addicts and peddlers are associated with a corrupt party like the BJP," Firhad Hakim, a minister in the Mamata Banerjee cabinet, said.Vijayvargiya, the BJP general secretary incharge of West Bengal, said he has faith in the judical system and law will take its own course."I do not know about this incident and hence will not like to comment. I have full trust in our legal system. If someone is found guilty, law will take its own course," he told PTI.Meanwhile, Kolkata police said they had been keeping a vigilant eye on both Goswami and her friend Prabeer following a complaint by her father in April last year.In his letter to the city police chief Kaushik Goswami had alleged that Prabeer had turned Pamela into a drug addict. He had claimed Prabeer did not keep the promise he made to divorce his wife and get married to Pamela, while requesting police to "keep a watch" on his activities."We were keeping an eye on both of them and gathered information about their involvement in drug trafficking. We are questioning them and trying to find out who all are involved with them and whether they have links to inter-state or international drug rackets," a police officer said speaking on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, sources in the state BJP said Goswami was likely to be suspended from the party."Most likely the party will take some disciplinary action against her till she is proved innocent. This incident is damaging the party's reputation," a senior state BJP leader said.Goswami had joined the BJP in 2018 and was quite active as part of the Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM).In 2020, when Lok Sabha MP Saumitra Khan, a ruling TMC turncoat, was made West Bengal BJYM chief, she was appointed the state secretary and its observer for Hooghly district.She regularly attended the meetings of top BJP leaders and posted photographs on her Facebook page.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/pamela-goswami-s-fathers-says-she-s-a-drug-addict-kolkata-police-claim-101613880153084.html

He called me a traitor Muslim for joining the BJP,” Ilmi was quoted as saying by the news agency.She said that he barged into the conversation and despite people urging the BSP lawmaker to stop, he continued abusing her. “I am proud of my choices, no one has the right to question them.

21-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray warns of lockdown as state reports over 6,000 Covid-19 cases for 2nd day||As Maharashtra reported 6,281 fresh cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray once again warned the state’s citizens of another lockdown if they failed to keep their behaviour in check and follow Covid-19 protocols.Maharashtra Covid-19 infection tally has now surged past 2,093,913. This is the second time since December last year that the western state has witnessed a spike of more than 6000 cases in a day. A total of 51,753 people have died in Maharashtra due to the coronavirus disease.Though the government hasn’t yet called it a ‘second wave’, it has directed local authorities to take all preventive measures, including lockdown restrictions, to contain the spread of the virus amid fear of new mutations.Weekend curfews have been imposed in several districts including Amravati and Akola from Saturday night, whereas in Yavatmal, a 10-day curfew has already been imposed from February 18 that restricts a gathering of five or more people. Schools and colleges in Wardha have been ordered to remain closed until further notice.Thackeray chaired a meeting with the health minister, divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners and superintendents of police on the Covid-19 situation in the state on Saturday. Following the meeting, it was decided to put a cap on the number of people allowed to attend social gatherings such as weddings and functions, which have the potential to become super-spreader events.There would be a temporary hold on permissions for rallies, processions, protests; while guests in wedding ceremonies will be strictly limited to 50.“Even if there is laxity in people, the district administration should not let your guard down and enforce the norms strictly, he told the administration,” the chief minister said at the meeting. “It is up to the people to decide whether to follow the rules or go back to the lockdown again. So, more care should be taken in the future,” he added.Maharashtra has witnessed a sudden spike in cases over the past week and continues to worst affected in the country. According to a presentation given to Thackeray, five districts that need to be monitored closely include Amravati, Wardha, Akola, Yavatmal, and Buldhana. Amravati district has recorded a jump of 10.69% in new cases between February 8 and 14, followed by Wardha (4.62%), Akola (4.27%), Yavatmal (3.19%), and Buldhana (2.28%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-warns-of-lockdown-as-state-reports-over-6-000-covid-19-cases-for-2nd-day-101613874383330.html
21-02-2021||Kolkata||Bengal minister not target of blast, suspect sleuths; JMB under scanner||West Bengal’s deputy labour minister Jakir Hossain, who sustained bomb injuries along with 22 Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers at Nimtita railway station in Murshidabad district on Wednesday night, may not have been the actual target, suspect some senior officials probing the case. They suspect a larger terror plot by terror outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh.A senior officer associated with the probe said on condition of anonymity that examination of the remains of the exploded bomb clearly indicates that it was a socket bomb of high quality. It was kept in a bag that was lying on the platform.“We have doubts if common criminals in Murshidabad have the expertise to make this kind of bomb. Some of us suspect the involvement of the banned Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) as its operatives are experts in making these,” the officer said.“We suspect that JMB operatives might have brought the bomb to the station for a big terror attack, possibly an explosion in a packed passenger train. They might have had plans to trigger an explosion inside the Teesta Torsa Express that the minister was about to board. These angles are being explored,” the officer added.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has entrusted three state agencies including the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) with the probe while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have demanded a probe by Central agencies.Murshidabad, where Muslims comprise 66.28% of the population, the state’s highest, followed by 51.27 % in adjoining Malda district, shares border with Bangladesh.Local police and railway officials said before the Republic Day Central security agencies sounded an alert in reference to all stations in the Malda division of the Eastern Railway. Nimtita is one of these.Speaking on condition of anonymity, an officer of the state intelligence branch (IB) said, “Door frame type metal detectors were installed at Malda Town and Azimganj stations and additional forces are still posted at Farakka station. However, security is comparatively less at Jangipur, Dhulian Ganga and Nimtita stations.”“We suspect that taking advantage of this, the culprits brought the bomb to Nimtita,” said the IB officer mentioned earlier.Incidentally, on February 10, a Kolkata court of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) ordered a 29-year jail sentence for Kausar, founder of the JMB’s third unit in Bengal, for his role in the 2018 bomb blast in a rented house at Khagragarh in East Burdwan district. Two JMB operatives, who were making bombs in the rented house, were killed.Kausar, 31, who was arrested by the NIA from a guest house in Bengaluru in August 2018, is an accused in the 2018 Bodhgaya blast as well and he recruited several people. The Khagragarh blast exposed a network of Bangladeshi terrorists in the eastern state.The NIA and the Special Task Force (STF) of the state police have nabbed several JMB militants from Murshidabad district in recent years. The NIA has also nabbed several Al-Qaeda suspects from the district which shares a border with Bangladesh.A second IB officer said, “We think the culprits fled the platform when they saw the minister and his men entering the station. The bomb went off when one of the minister’s followers tried to remove the bag from his path. In the mobile phone video that surfaced, several men could be heard saying ‘there is a bag’ and then we saw the bomb going off.”On Saturday, officers of the Suti police station in Murshidabad recovered an abandoned gunny bag with more than 50 kg gunpowder near the electricity department office at Aurangabad.Local police officers said there are some firecracker factories in Suti that hoard gunpowder illegally. “After the Nimtita explosion several agencies and local police are conducting raids. It seems someone left the bag out of fear,” an officer from Suti police station said on condition of anonymity.Also Read: Ready to contest Bengal polls, says actor Yash Dasgupta days after joining BJPIn November last year, the NIA arrested Abdul Momin Mondal, 32, from Nazrana village in the Raninagar area of Murshidabad in connection with the probe into the Al Qaeda network in the state. In September last year, the NIA arrested 10 people from West Bengal and Kerala.“Investigation revealed that the accused Abdul Momin Mondal was working as a teacher in Raipur Darul Huda Islamia Madrasa in Murshidabad district and was found to be involved in a series of conspiratorial meetings convened by the members of the Al-Qaeda module. He was also trying to recruit new members for the group and was raising funds for furthering its terrorist activities,” the NIA said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-minister-not-target-of-blast-suspect-sleuths-jmb-under-scanner-101613874566067.html

She had later posted a video where she was seen assisting Nishad in rowing the boat.Nishad had informed Priyanka about issues that boatmen belonging to the Nishad community were facing, including brutality against them by police whom he alleged had destroyed their boats. The boatman requested her assistance in raising their voices against the oppression to which she agreed, party sources said.According to the program released by the party, Priyanka is scheduled to reach Prayagraj at 11 AM and will be visiting Banswaar village in the trans-Yamuna area of the district to meet members of fisherman community.Sujit said that several boats belonging to the Nishad community, an OBC (other backward class) caste, were damaged by police and administrative officials.The Uttar Pradesh government banned the use of boats in sand mining across the state on 24 June 2019. Suddenly millions of Nishads became unemployed. So there is anger among the caste. Lakhs of Nishads depend on rivers for their livelihood in Uttar Pradesh.In 2013, the NGT prohibited the extraction of sand from rivers using machines, but mining companies continue to extract it with Pokeland machines and the government levies tax.There has been a dispute between the mining mafia and Nishads in and around Ghurpur for about 15 years. Nishads have been in conflict with the police over it.In the Banswar village near Ghurpur, on January 30, there was Raj Contract which has now been shut down.On February 4, some people complained that illegal mining was being done here. Police came, damaged 16 boats and 30 people were injured. The police brought a number of dogs to create fear among the people including the Nishads.Nishads are angry about this. The BJP is upset about this. Sujit Nishad came here, but Nishads of the village drove him away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-gandhi-to-meet-boatman-who-accompanied-her-at-sangam-101613873873837.html

Work should be done in such a way that people should not lose their trust in you, said Pawar, while addressing an event at Baramati in Pune on Saturday.“First a probe by CID (criminal investigation department) was conducted when BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) was in power and we got a clean chit. ACB (anti-corruption bureau) also gave its clean chit after a probe. Meanwhile, the state cooperatives’ department had appointed a single-member committee to probe into the allegations but it found nothing. It was again alleged that we are the main conspirators and the department then appointed a retired judge for probe and by now you all would have known about its findings,” Pawar said in his address.On Thursday, retired principal district judge Panditrao Jadhav in his report submitted to the state cooperatives department found no evidence against Pawar and the other 75 accused. “The proceedings initiated under section 88 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, hereby fail and hence terminated. All delinquent deserves to be exonerated, and hence exonerated,” stated the report. The report will now be submitted to the state for further action.The bank board was dissolved by the then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan in 2011, following the directive of the Reserve Bank of India. The action was taken based on an inquiry report by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development which pointed to gross financial indiscipline while handing out loans, that left the bank with a negative net worth of ₹144 crore. The board of directors were replaced by two state-appointed administrators.Pawar said he could not visit MSC Bank despite becoming the deputy CM as a probe was initiated against him for being a trustee. “I have never allowed damage to any institutions I am associated with. I always work with an approach for their survival and have invested my own salary at times for the same. I believe people shouldn’t feel betrayed when they trust you,” he said.MSC Bank is the apex co-operative bank in the state that controls credit in the entire co-operative sector, and forms the backbone of the rural economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/msc-bank-scam-got-clean-chit-despite-probe-by-multiple-agencies-says-ajit-pawar-101613853133821.html

According to Puri, 290,518 passengers travelled by 2,360 flights on Friday. Puri praised the aviation sector for playing a key role in transporting essential and medical supplies as part of efforts against the Covid-19 pandemic.The aviation minister tweeted, “2,90,518 passengers on 2,360 flights on 19 Feb is within touching distance of Pre-COVID numbers & marks revival of the domestic sector. From transporting essential & medical supplies, to movement of vaccines, civil aviation sector plays a key role in efforts against COVID19 (sic).”His tweet further revealed that a total of 581,306 passenger footfall and 4,723 flight movements were witnessed on Friday alone.In a consultative committee’s meeting of the ministry held on Thursday, Puri said domestic air traffic is increasing day-by-day and has now reached about three lakh passengers a day.The minister had also said that with domestic air traffic expected to increase further in the summer season, the government may remove the fare band, apart from lifting other restrictions.The aviation industry has been one of the severely affected sectors owing to the lockdown last year. Following the Covid-19 outbreak, India’s domestic passenger traffic slipped to a seven-year low in 2020 due to a complete halt in air travel for two months.Commercial passenger flights resumed operations from May 25 with restricted capacity on local routes (45% between June and September and 80% from December).

He said that the competition should be with the world and not among the states, if India wants to become ‘Atmanirbhar (self-reliant)’. Thackeray, who was speaking at the 6th Governing Council Meeting of Niti Aayog, also sought a policy from the Centre for staggering work hours, as the battle against Covid-19 has not ended. Thackeray said that the “mindset of the 10 to 6 job has to change”. Thackeray took up issues of seeking greater assistance from the Centre to develop fishing, tourism and ports in the Konkan region of the state. He said that development at the cost of nature and environment is not ideal. Stating that Konkan region has natural wealth of environment and that the forests and environment should not be destroyed in the name of development, Thackeray sought Centre’s assistance on development of fishing, tourism and ports in the region. “There are beaches so the tourism is growing. Jungles are chopped off to make way for wider roads. But in my view, development should happen by keeping environment in mind. If the state gets adequate help of the Centre in Sagarmala Project, then a series of ports will be developed. We need Centre’s clearance for four major fishing ports and 19 fish landing centres in the region,” he said. The CM said that the projects will develop the fishing industry in the region and help generate employment. Speaking at the meeting via video-conferencing, Thackeray said that the Centre should promote healthy competition over the efficiency of state administration. “Our competition should be with the world with regards to bringing in business and there shouldn’t be cutthroat competition between the states. Some states offer subsidised electricity or better deal on land prices. There is bargaining [by the industries] that a particular state is providing concessions and so what is your state offering,” Thackeray said in the meeting. He said that for the country to become ‘atmanirbhar’ the focus should be in job creation through investments. “There should definitely be competition between the states but it should not be monetary based on concessions but there should be healthy competition on the administrative ability and the facilities available. Only then will the states benefit. The Centre must formulate a policy on the criteria with regards to investments,” Thackeray said. CM also said that labourers of the country need to get adequate protection from the laws as they are instrumental in turning the wheels of the economy. He said that ‘Jai Kamgaar’ should be added to the slogan, ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’. Thackeray also said that the farmers who face crop damage and losses due to natural disasters also must be compensated. He said the crop insurance scheme should also losses due to unseasonal rain, apart from flooding. He further said that the Centre should keep a check on the profits earned by the insurance companies. The Centre must define the level of profit and loss of the insurance companies as they continue to earn profits while farmers do not get their due compensation, said CM. He also sought the Centre’s assistance to set up a research centre for various fields in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/must-compete-with-world-not-other-states-maharashtra-cm-at-niti-aayog-meeting-101613851333756.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai reports 897 new Covid-19 cases||The city continued its upward Covid-19 graph on Saturday as it reported 897 new Covid-19 infections, its sharpest single-day spike since November 29 (940 infections), taking its tally to 318,207. Mumbai also reported three Covid-19 deaths, taking the toll to 11,440, at a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.5%. Amid the recent spike in cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sealed 1,305 buildings and floors in the past fortnight, with 71,838 households in them. A total of 2,749 cases have been reported from these sealed places. Mumbai has 5,466 active infections and its recovery rate is 94%.Reacting to the recent spurt in cases, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Thursday directed the civic administration to adopt a slew of measures to curb the spread of the infection, including tightening containment-zone rules, quarantine norms and strictly imposing fines on those not wearing masks in public places. The doubling rate of cases in the city has dropped to 371 days, down from 393 on Friday, 417 on Thursday, 445 on Tuesday, and 455 on Monday. The growth rate of cases has now increased to 0.19%, up from 0.18% on Friday, 0.17% on Thursday, 0.16% on Tuesday and 0.15% on Monday.On Saturday, Mumbai conducted 18,400 Covid-19 tests, 3,117,294 in total since the beginning of the lockdown (March 2020).In a statement on Thursday, Chahal had said, “Although the spread of Covid-19 in Mumbai is under control, there has been a surge in the number of cases in the past few days. Hence, all BMC machineries need to be extra vigilant.”Chahal said that in comparison to June-July 2020, the spread of Covid-19 in the city is still under control. “As public life returns to normalcy, it becomes all the more important for citizens to follow all prevention norms. It is also pertinent to take stringent action against offenders to limit the spread of the virus.”As of February 18, BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard showed there were 321 sealed buildings in the city. A ward officer, requesting anonymity, said, “We are now reporting to the head office data on sealed floors as well, along with sealed buildings. Hence the number has drastically gone up in two days, from 321 to 1,305 containment buildings and floors.”Ward officers implementing the tightened containment measures submit daily reports of action taken in their respective wards to the municipal commissioner The highest number of sealed buildings and floors, 233, are in T-ward corresponding to the area of Mulund, followed by 125 each in the P-South ward of Goregaon and the N ward of Ghatkopar. The D ward of Malabar Hill has 110 sealed buildings and buildings with sealed floors, followed by 106 in R-Central ward in Borivli.Over the next few days, BMC will double the number of clean-up marshals patrolling the city’s streets from the present 2,400 to 4,800, who will fine people if they do not wear masks in public places. On Friday, 13,592 people were penalised for not wearing masks and BMC collected ₹27,18,440 in fines in a single day. Fines totalling ₹31,79,43,400 were collected between March 2020 and February 2021, from 1,571,679 people found without masks in public spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-reports-897-new-covid-19-cases-101613850433946.html
21-02-2021||Other||The unforgettable legacy of Sahir Ludhianvi||It was inspired by Allama Iqbal’s tribute to Dagh Dehlvi ‘Is chaman mein honge paida bulbul-e-shiraz bhi, saikron sahir bhi honge, sahib-e-ejaz bhi’ that the legendry poet and lyricist, who was named Abdul Hayee by his feudal father, chose the pen name Sahir for himself. True to his pen name, Sahir, who was born on March 8, 1921, was a wizard of words. He was only eight years old when his mother was divorced and became his legal guardian. She enrolled him at Malwa Khalsa High School, Ludhiana, from where he matriculated in 1937. He joined Government College, Ludhiana, but left in 1941 without passing the bachelor of arts course he was pursuing. An anthology of his poems, Talkhiyan, was published in 1943 but his ambition was to become a film lyricist. So, off he went to Bombay. However, little notice was taken of his first film Azadi Ki Rah Pe (1948). In 1950, his college friend, Mohan Sehgal, advised him to meet SD Burman, who was looking for a writer who could pen a song for his new tune. Burman played the tune to Sahir, who on the spur of the moment, composed the evergreen song ‘Thandi hawayen lehra ke aayen’ for Noor Jahan (1951). It was, however, the film Baazi (1951) that made him famous. Pyaasa ranked one of 100 greatest films His association with Burman ended after Pyaasa (1957), which was adjudged by Time Magazine as one of the 100 greatest films of all times. Even former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was touched by his lyrics. In a career spanning around 30 years, Sahir wrote 718 songs for 111 films. Sahir said, “I have always strived to bring song writing close to literary poetry and use it to provide political and social perspectives to people.” He believed film songs made poetry accessible even to illiterate film goers. He incorporated many of his poems and ghazals in films. Pyaasa and Kabhie Kabhie became blockbusters because of such poems. His songs explored social evils and the plight of women in man-dominated society. Despite constraints under which a film lyricist has to work, Sahir put across his progressive and secular philosophy. Versatile oeuvreSahir’s songs are an epitome of youthful romance and the beauty of nature. They convey a message of hope and optimism. Despite being an atheist, he wrote memorable bhajans and qawwalis. He had no training in music but his songs lend themselves to musical tunes. He also had a great deal of self-respect. Once a music director had remarked ‘Sahir sahib without Lata’s voice your songs will be ineffective.’ He took a pledge there and then that for two years he would not write songs for films where Lata Mangeshkar would be a playback singer. His films succeeded nonetheless and Sudha Malhotra became a popular singer. He raised the status of film lyricists to such an extent that song writers’ name started appearing on gramophone records. All India Radio was made to announce the name of the songwriter along with the names of singer and music director. Sahir made it a point to charge a rupee more than the fee of the music directorThough, Sahir passed away on October 25, 1980 his songs remain as popular as they were forty years ago. Exemplifying Sahir’s genius on crafting the musings on human mortality is his iconic song from the film Kabhie Kabhie: ‘Mai pal do pal ka shayar hoon, pal do pal meri kahani hai, pal do pal meri hasti hai, pal do pal meri jawani hai’.

21-02-2021||Delhi||Only 50% covered, Delhi may continue jabs for health staff||Senior officials in the Delhi government said they are unlikely to close the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive for health care workers for now, with just over half of all registered beneficiaries in the category inoculated as on Saturday, underlining the hurdles that administrations face to overcome turnouts that have fallen short of the Centre’s expectations.“We cannot close the drive for health care professionals just yet because there is still a large proportion of beneficiaries who have not received a dose,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department, adding that vaccine hesitancy was still rampant among several eligible beneficiaries in the Capital.As per the Centre’s guideline all states were to freeze the immunisation for healthcare workers by February 20 and allow for an additional five-day period for a “mop up” round to immunise as many as possible. The Delhi administration is now likely to vaccinate people past this mop-up period as well, as per senior state government officials.With no vaccination drive on Sunday, this effectively left just four days for around 120,000 health care professionals in Delhi who are yet to get the shot. “This is unlikely to be enough. The central government had issued an advisory and Delhi is likely to continue the drive because many beneficiaries are still left,” said a second official, on condition of anonymity.Delhi has been vaccinating over 24,000 people, health care and frontline workers, each day for the last three days, a rise that has coincided with an increase in the number of vaccination centres.However, for the extended drive, the number of centres where health care workers can get the shot is likely to be restricted. Currently, there are about 306 vaccination sites across the city where medical staff can get a dose of their Covishield or Covaxin if their name is registered on the government’s CoWIN portal. A decision on how many centres will carry on vaccinating health care workers will be taken next week.“For now, we are focussing on getting as many people come out and receive the vaccination during the five-day mop up drive,” said a senior district official.“All heads of departments in hospitals have been asked to call up people working under them. Nodal officers in vaccine centres have been asked to ensure that all health workers registered at their centres who are yet to take their first Covid-19 shot,” said a third senior government official who did not wish to be identified.Delhi is among the seven states and union territories where the vaccine coverage for healthcare workers is less than 50%. As per the health ministry’s provisional data, only 48.2% had been immunised till Saturday evening when the vaccination drive was to close. However, Delhi government’s final data shows that 131,854 healthcare workers received the shot till Saturday evening, accounting for 50.7% of nearly 240,000 registered beneficiaries.The immunisation for frontline workers, on the other hand, has so far seen better turnouts, with 153,037 having already received their first shot. This accounts for 43.7% of the registered frontline workers in the city, according to Delhi government data.The immunisation for frontline workers started on February 2 across the country and will come to an end on March 1, after which a five-day mop-up period will be in place for beneficiaries under the group.“The vaccination among frontline workers has been faster. The healthcare workers, especially doctors, have been following the vaccine development and approval process closely and hence have more apprehensions,” said the first government official.As for the second shot, only 43.6% of those who had received the first shot over 28 days ago in Delhi have received it. “This is because of the strong message among the healthcare workers that delaying the second shot will provide better immunity,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/only-50-covered-delhi-may-continue-jabs-for-health-staff-101613849156349.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Kausa, Mumbra see poor response to Covid vaccine||THANEThough Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has completed 96 per cent immunisation, areas like Kausa and Mumbra have hardly seen 30 per cent vaccination. Owing to the low response, the civic body plans to rope in religious and political leaders to create awareness about the immunisation drive and to urge more people to come forward and get vaccinated.“There are a few who are sceptical about getting vaccinated. We ensure every week some officer or a well-known personality gets vaccinated so that people are in loop about the immunisation process. There are some who have registered for the vaccination. However, they are still not convinced to get the shot. For this, we have a team who talks to them and creates awareness about the vaccine,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner, TMC.As part of their efforts to create more awareness about Covid, the civic officials have roped in religious and political leaders. “We plan to take similar approach for the immunisation drive as well. The religious and political leaders or well-known faces help connect with the locals. This encourages them to follow their leaders and will hopefully lead to an increased number of vaccinations,” added a senior health officer, TMC.From among those who have registered for the vaccination are Class 4 government employees, sanitation staff, ambulance drivers and ASHA workers.Dr Abdul Raut, general practitioner, Mumbra, said, “Many of them remain sceptical about the vaccination process due to the various messages on social media and rumours about the side effects also make them nervous about the process. Most of us local physicians have repeatedly assured our staff about the vaccine and said that many top officials, senior doctors and non-medical staff have also taken the vaccine.”The vaccination drive began on January 16. By February first week, Thane city witnessed more than 100 per cent immunisation with some centres going beyond the target set for the day. Gradually, the civic body also increased the number of vaccination centres to 12 and roped in private mid-level hospitals as well. From February 4, the second booster doze of vaccination also began in the city. Thane city has completed 102 per cent vaccination till now. This includes 25,970 frontline and health care workers. Cops increase vigilance in twin cities Strict vigilance against those not following social distancing and not wearing masks has been initiated by the police in Kalyan and Dombivli.Vivek Pansare, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone 3, said, “We have been taking action since the last three days in residential areas and departmental stores that are seen flouting Covid protocols. We have filed three different cases under the epidemic act, more than five are booked and we will continue surveillance and take stringent action if rules are not followed. It has come to our notice that housing societies host parties and allow residents to invite guests in large numbers. Moreover, many departmental stores are not following screening and temperature check guidelines given by the government.”(Inputs by Anamika Gharat)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kausa-mumbra-see-poor-response-to-covid-vaccine-101613849235372.html
21-02-2021||Other||Decks cleared for expansion of Karnal airport||A high-powered land purchase committee, headed by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal, has approved the expansion and renovation of Karnal airport. As per information, the existing airstrip of the Karnal airport will now be expanded from 3, 000 ft to 5, 000 ft.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said that expansion will enable small and medium aircraft to land at the airport, which can be utilised for parking, basing and light maintenance and repair operations. This will, especially be useful as it is close to the Indira Gandhi International airport, Delhi. He said the total proposed land for this project is 172 acres, 3 kanal and 16 marla. Out of this, 106 acres, 6 kanal and 14 marla belongs to the government of Haryana while the remaining is being acquired from 24 landowners and shareholders of Kalwheri village. The landowners have reportedly voluntarily agreed provide their land, measuring 38 acres and five marla, by uploading their consent on e-Bhoomi portal of Haryana government, after a virtual interaction with the chief minister.The deputy commissioner said that as per the policy, the rate offered for land acquirement near a road is ₹87.25 lakh per acre while an agriculture land that is at a distance of more than 2km from a road, fetches ₹82.25 lakh per acre as compensation. Also, as per Clause 3 of the Haryana Act 28 of 2017, the Haryana Consolidation of Project Land (Special Provisions) 2017, where the state government owns or it has purchased 70% or more of the total land required for a project in a particular area (in this case more than 80%), the state government will consolidate the total project land from nearby pockets of private land to ensure the viability of such project.The remaining landowners of 27 acres, 4 Kanal and 17 Marla either be provided compensation or land of equal valuation in the same revenue estate and in case of non-availability of such land in the same revenue estate, in a neighbouring revenue estate, he added. As per the project, no construction will be allowed within 20 kms radius of the airport as per the norms of Ministry of Civil Aviation and after the approval of this project by the high-powered land purchase committee on Friday, a detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared by the department of civil aviation.It is worth mentioning here that the proposed expansion of Karnal airstrip was caught in red-tape as most farmers from these villages were unwilling to offer their land for the project. They had been alleging lack of transparency in the acquisition policy and less compensation for their land. After the government increased the area of notified land from 28 acres to 280 acres in May 2018, the affected farmers had alleged foul play and sought clarifications on three issues -- the purpose for land acquisition, what would be the price and how many acres of land was actually required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decks-cleared-for-expansion-of-karnal-airport-101613849233519.html

Since the fateful day of September last year when the Jilani Building in which he was staying collapsed in Bhiwandi, Qureshi is leaving no stone unturned to look for his son, whose body was never found at the site.Like Qureshi, the family of 28-year-old Shabnam Mohammad Ali Shaikh, too has not received their daughter’s body.Qureshi said, “I have not heard about my son Museb since the day of the crash. I have asked every authority. However, none of them is able to give me any answer. His body was never found among the debris. I don’t know if he is alive or dead.”The building collapse killed 38 and injured 25.Qureshi added, “I, along with my two sons who survived, shifted to a nearby building, though not a day goes without wondering what happened to Museb. My wife and daughter also died in the crash. Their bodies were recovered but Museb is still missing.”Qureshi has produced all the valid documents of his son to police and also lodged a missing complaint at Narpoli police station.Qureshi, who runs a mutton shop in the locality, had raised an alarm when the building started shaking and helped others to escape.Senior police inspector of Narpoli police station, MB Shinde, said, “Although a complaint of the child missing was raised by the family, we could not trace him yet. The investigation was carried out from all the angles, but the boy was not found.”In another such case, the family of Shabnam, 28, who died in the incident, also did not receive her body.“There was an unclaimed body at the hospital which police said was my sister’s. But I denied as it did not match my sister’s physique and features. How can I go wrong about my sister,” said Nilofer Mohammand Ali Shaikh, 34.Shabnam and her mother Zulelkha Shaikh, 52, lived in the building. While the mother survived the incident, Shabnam was crushed under the debris.“A DNA test was done to check if the unclaimed body was of my sister. But the test did not give any proper result. Also the police asked us to take away the unclaimed body and do the final rites. I had to do it thinking about my mother. But even today, I believe my sister’s body was misplaced by the police,” added Nilofer.“We did the DNA test but the report was inconclusive. The family agreed to take the unclaimed body and the matter was closed. There was no misplacement of bodies as we check it before giving it away to the families,” added Shinde.Deputy Commandant of National Disaster Response Force, Ashish Kumar, who worked throughout the rescue operations said, “When we take up the rescue operations, we only pull out the bodies and give it to the police. It is their job to further identify the body. Hence, we cannot actually comment if the body was misplaced. Even though the family claims the boy was missing, we had searched and cleared the debris completely and no one was found.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhiwandi-building-collapse-5-months-on-families-still-living-in-hope-101613848993491.html

The official spokesperson of the IOCL refinery said that they plan to plant over two lakh saplings on 700 acres near the refinery, under the environment sustainability initiative launched in association with the Haryana forest and wildlife department.Officials further claimed that IOCL has planted over 6.5 lakh trees in the area since the refinery was set up in 1998. “Now, the target is to plant over 2.02 lakh trees with ₹7.18 crore in the next few months,” the officials added.In 2018, the NGT had formed a joint committee to look into the complaints from residents of six nearby villages who had alleged that activities in the refinery were leading to severe air and water pollution which was impacting their health.The committee had found that the issues raised by the residents were true to some extent. A kutcha drain was to be the major factor behind pollution in the area and the refinery was discharging effluents into it, thus affecting the quality of water, the committee report stated.In May 2019, on the recommendations of the first assessment report of the joint committee, the NGT had directed the oil company to deposit ₹17.31 crore to the Central Pollution Control Board as interim compensation for restoration of the environment. Then again in July 2020, the Tribunal directed IOCL officials to deposit a sum of ₹25 crore as interim compensation for restoration of environment.The plantation drive is being seen as an effort by the refinery to counter the criticism against it. The refinery has also taken several other initiatives, including setting up of a waste water treatment plants and a 2G ethanol plant to convert tonnes of paddy waste into useful ethanol. Meanwhile, the NGT has formed a team to conduct health check-ups of all residents of the six nearby villages to find out the impact of the pollution on human health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/facing-environmental-penalties-iocl-s-panipat-refinery-launches-plantation-drive-101613848873462.html
21-02-2021||Chandigarh||When life got magnified under a lens||A little while ago, my niece got a new mobile phone, and she was over the moon about the multiple built-in cameras in the device. Well, the priorities have certainly changed over the last few years with smartphone companies jumping into the war of pixels and promising customers an in-depth pro-level photography experience.Surely, our lifelong friends Canon, Nikon and Sony must have felt cheated at having their area of expertise usurped from right under their noses, thanks to the technical revolution in mobile phones. “It broadens our photographing ability and captures more of the scene with the optical zoom!” exclaimed the devil’s advocate. Big words! For all I knew, one did not need a camera to see the world. It was as colourful to the eye as any camera could capture. Living under the unforgiving tyranny of the lens became difficult for a camera-shy person like me. I would shrink each time my movements came under the lens. Once she trained her weapon on me early in the morning and that really got my goat. I couldn’t quite comprehend, how my high-definition tatters would do any good to her photography! After all, she had no dearth of posers with everyone from the kids to the house helps ready to oblige her.A chip off the new blockThe latest addition to my niece’s modelling ramp was the by far the most surprising. My mother had become a chip off the new block! She would spend time laughing and giggling with her granddaughter. They also took to practising the best camera angle before a mirror. These partners in crime would often capture candid shots of me and remorselessly post them on the family group!I remember, in our times, the camera, would only come out on special occasions and only important events would be captured. We never stressed over how good we looked at parties. Rather, our preparations ahead of a get together included preparing a few couplets of poetry, interesting anecdotes, or a song if one could sing.Things have changed drastically, and I have had to become more conscious of my beauty than my brains as everyone is wielding a little camera in their pocket these days. I started fortifying myself with an extra dash of powder and rouse before a do, lest some paparazzi capture me with a dull countenance.The shutterbugs were getting wild and free , with everyone filling up their memory sticks with pictures and self-shot videos. We always had a friend or a relative who would insist on a video call. All aspects of life were getting magnified and larger than life.Filters become way of lifeOur plates of food looked more delectable in a filtered photograph. Most vacations had a single-point agenda: click beautiful pictures. Parties would not be complete without an elaborate photo session. My friends had learnt to pout and smile in that suitably tilted semicircle. Some people stretched it too far, when they got busy filming an accident, rather than helping around.My journey towards becoming camera savvy was a long one as I was yet to determine its usefulness in my life. I was the square peg in a round hole when it came to posing. Yet there were buddies who would drag me into the frame. But not any more. Social distancing put a brake on these things, and I was quite comfortable with it. The mask has been a saviour as it has helped me escape the limelight. With the world opening up, I am a little sceptical about facing those cameras again. I wonder if I could ask these camera companies to come up with a feature to automatically hide those who do not wish to be in the picture.

21-02-2021||Mumbai||Teaching quality, lack of job behind rise in vacant private engineering seats: Experts||As admissions to engineering colleges have been on the decline in the past five years, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) called for a two-year ban on new engineering institutes from academic year 2020-21. However, the move seems to have done little to arrest the problem of vacant seats. Data by AICTE has shown that the total intake capacity of engineering institutes across India has reduced by more than 21% in the past five years. From 3 million engineering seats (undergraduate, postgraduate and diploma included) in 2015-16, the intake capacity has dropped to 2.4 million in the 2020-21 academic year. Figures shared by the Maharashtra common entrance test (CET) cell have shown that nearly 45% seats in first-year undergraduate engineering (BTech) courses were vacant across Maharashtra this time. While seats in government-aided and university-managed institutes still found takers, almost 98% of the total vacant seats are in private unaided engineering institutes in the state this year. Of the 55,444 seats gone vacant across engineering institutes this year, 54,667 seats have gone vacant in unaided engineering institutes. Similarly, the vacancy in MTech courses stands at 55.2% this year. “Just putting a ban on new private engineering institutes will not be enough. The need of the hour is to ensure employment for engineering graduates, which is still not happening. The government has come up with various skill-based training courses but there needs to be more focus on ensuring employment,” said a senior official from the state CET cell. As per the figures shared by the AICTE, over 605,000 engineering graduates in the 2019-20 year were placed through campus placement against the enrolment of over 1.4 million. “Less than 50% engineering graduates are being placed every year and this definitely makes a big impact on the demand for engineering courses altogether,” added the official. Admissions to most professional courses got delayed by a few months this academic year, especially with the Covid-19 imposed lockdown affecting routine functions. While admissions in Maharashtra colleges are over, several states are still struggling to fill up even 50% of undergraduate engineering seats, and therefore, continue to conduct admission rounds.While AICTE is yet to collate admission and seat vacancy data for all the states (many are still conducting institutional admission rounds to fill up vacant seats), reports have highlighted the plight of engineering colleges across the country. In December 2020, nearly 60% of engineering seats in West Bengal institutes were vacant after three rounds of admissions. Similarly, around 75% seats in engineering institutes at Tamil Nadu remained vacant after three admission rounds, while in Karnataka, colleges approached AICTE for an extension in the admission deadline to fill up over 50% vacant seats in the last week of December 2020. “In most of the states, the seat vacancy is higher in private engineering institutes, especially because of the high fees demanded and the low quality of education imparted,” said a senior official from AICTE. With the implementation of the two-year blanket ban on new engineering institutes, AICTE witnessed closure of almost 100 institutes, while 32 others applied for withdrawal of approval. A staggering 595 institutes around the country did not apply for continuation of approval for the 2020-21 academic year. “The hope is that slowly, this ban on new institutes will control the increasing intake capacity, while at the same time, introduction of new-age courses will attract more technically inclined students to opt for engineering courses. Only time can tell how this move changes the demand for engineering courses in the future,” said Anil Sahasrabuddhe, director, AICTE. While demand for the new-age courses are continuously growing and more and more institutes are showing interest in wanting to introduce these courses at their institutes as well, experts have highlighted how this move could be short-lived, especially for newly introduced courses like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science and Analytics due to the evolving technology in these fields. “Most of the new-age courses introduced by AICTE this year are application-based technology and with every passing year, these sectors evolve and new trends emerge in them. At present, these courses might be in the position to offer many jobs to graduating students, there’s no guarantee the trend will stay for very long,” said SS Mantha, former chairperson of AICTE.Though core courses such as civil and mechanical engineering have witnessed a drop in applications in the past few years due to the lack of job opportunities after graduation, Mantha said an undergraduate degree in core engineering is very important for the students. “The shelf value of new-age courses could be limited, while basic knowledge in core engineering sectors will take students a long way,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/teaching-quality-lack-of-job-behind-rise-in-vacant-private-engineering-seats-experts-101613848393624.html

On Friday, Thane range forest officials and Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA) reached the spot to conduct the rescue operations of the reptile.Narendra Muthe, Thane Range Forest Officer, said, “We received complaints from people residing in the area and also from the disaster management cell of NMMC regarding the crocodile.. We have put up nets and also stationed volunteers at the spot. With the help of WWA, we would be rescuing the reptile and sending it to its natural habitat.”On Friday, WWA spotted the crocodile and put up nets on the outlet of the pond so that the reptile does not go to another pond adjacent to it. On Saturday, WWA was planning to put up a cage in the pond so as to get hold of the reptile and then release it to a place which the forest department suggests.“On Saturday afternoon, we spotted the crocodile and are looking for a location to put the cage with feed to attract the reptile. By evening, we could not locate the crocodile, hence we would return on Sunday with the cage. It will be a futile effort to keep the cage at a place where the crocodile is not there and hence we have to make sure of its presence before we place the cage,” Omkar Kolekar, from WWA said.Aditya Patil, President of WWA, said that it is suspected that the crocodile might have been displaced from the Juinagar creek. “In the past, a crocodile was spotted at Juinagar creek. We can’t be sure if it’s the same as it is not possible to identify the reptile individually. But we suspect that the same crocodile would have got displaced from there during high tide with the heavy current of water,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rescue-operations-on-to-relocate-crocodile-from-navi-mumbai-pond-101613848153574.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||There is undeclared Emergency in India: Sanjay Raut on Disha Ravi arrest||Reacting for the first time since the toolkit controversy broke, the Shiv Sena slammed the Centre over the arrest of 22-year-old activist Disha Ravi and said there is an “undeclared Emergency” in the country. Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the country is so weak today that the government thinks it is in danger of 22-year-old climate change activist. The Sena leader also said that Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies — the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Sena — will contest Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal polls together.Slamming the Union government, the Sena leader said, “When Emergency was declared by Indira Gandhi, she said so openly and the President signed it. Today there is Emergency but it is an undeclared one. I have seen the Union home minister’s statement supporting the action against the activist. He thinks that our country is in danger because of such activists who work in the field of environment; is our country so weak? There should be an open debate on this issue.” Raut, who was speaking to reporters in Pune, said deliberations within the MVA have begun to contest the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal elections in an alliance. He said that NCP, which has a greater presence in Pune region, will get lion’s share of the seats to contest in the polls. Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies will go to polls in early 2022. He added that they will discuss with the Congress leadership to contest together.Both Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies are currently controlled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Raut said that contesting in an alliance will bring a change of power in these cities. He said the discussions between the two parties have started. “Our discussions have started and it has been decided to contest in an alliance of Sena and NCP. We are discussing how to take the Congress along. It has been decided that whichever party has the greater presence in the area must lead the coalition in that election,” he said. “For instance, in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, Kalyan-Dombivli, Sambhaji Nagar [Aurangabad], the Sena has a strong presence. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, NCP is stronger. We are in discussion as to how we can contest elections in these cities. NCP will have more seats. The idea to contest together will definitely bring a change of power,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/there-is-undeclared-emergency-in-india-sanjay-raut-on-disha-ravi-arrest-101613847973409.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees over 6,000 Covid-19 cases for second day in a row||Maharashtra on Saturday reported more than 6,000 new Covid-19 infections for a second day in a row, pushing the count to 2,093,913. The number of active cases stood at 48,439, following 2,567 recoveries in the past 24 hours.India’s worst-hit state’s death toll reached 51,753 after 40 more casualties were reported, of which 13 were in the past 48 hours and 12 were in the last week. The other 15 deaths were from the period before last week, officials said.With the steady, yet alarming spike in infections, the state government has directed local authorities to take all preventive measures to arrest the virus’ spread, which includes bringing back lockdown restrictions. However, the state government is yet to call it a ‘second wave”, saying that it is too early to reach such a conclusion.From Saturday night, weekend curfews have been imposed in districts such as Amravati and Akola, whereas in Yavatmal, a 10-day curfew has already been imposed from February 18, restricting a gathering of five or more people at a place. Schools and colleges in Wardha have been ordered to remain closed until further notice.On Saturday, 1,607 cases were recorded in these four districts, of which, Amravati (both city and district) reported the highest number — 1,055. Akola saw 348 cases, Wardha 112 and Yavatmal 92. It means over 25% of the day’s caseload was from these four districts, which are in Vidarbha region. The region has reported 41% (2,609) of Saturday’s cases.The rise in daily cases can be gauged from this statistic: In the first 10 days of this month(February 1 to 10), 25,854 cases were reported, but in the past ten days (February 11 to 20), a total of 44,305 cases have been reported, which is a rise of 58% (18,451 infections). A comparison with last month’s figures showed a rise in cases as well.As of February 20, a total of 70,159 cases have been reported in the state, while in January 63,770 infections were reported in the corresponding period, according to official figures.Dr Archana Patil, director, directorate of health services (DHS), said they were focusing on improving the existing health infrastructure to deal with any situation, considering the spurt in cases along with bringing restrictions, wherever required. “It would be early to use the term ‘second wave’ as the growth in cases is not exponential and limited to certain areas. We still have to wait for some time to assess and analyse the rise,” Dr Patil said.“Moreover, we are focusing on improving the health infrastructure to be prepared in case of further increase in cases. We are increasing the number of beds, oxygen supplies, ICU beds, medicine supplies etc. to deal with any situation. We are also in the process of increasing Covid Care Centres (CCC), Dedicated Covid Health Centers (DCHC) and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) for management of patients. CCC, DCHC and DCH were reduced as the number of cases had gone down too low,” she stressed.The state had decided to start CCC for all asymptomatic positive patients without comorbidity, DCHC for patients with mild symptoms and DCH for serious patients.Amid the rise in cases, the district administrations in Nagpur, Buldhana, Parbhani and Jalna have also either restricted gatherings to less than five people or have started to strictly implement the standing government standard operating procedure (SOP) that was meant to facilitate unlocking from Wednesday.A few more districts are likely to impose similar restrictions to contain the spread, the officials said. “The state is imposing these measures in targeted areas where the virulence of the virus is more and some more districts may follow them as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the local bodies to take all the necessary steps to break the chain,” said a senior official, privy to the development.Meanwhile, Maharashtra covered 897,413 beneficiaries through its vaccination drive after 37,030 people were inoculated on Saturday. Of them, 24,534 were given the first shot of vaccine, while 12,416 were administered second shots, who have completed a mandatory gap of 28 days. Starting from January 16, the state has covered the first shots of 608,829 health workers (HCWs) and second shots of 40,241 HCWs. Similarly, it has completed the first shots of 248,343 frontline workers (FLWs) till date, according to a release issued by the state health department on Saturday.Maharashtra has around 800,000 HCWs and 580,000 FLWs registered on the centralised CoWIN app.The third phase of the drive is likely to be started next month, the officials said. “The decision for starting the third phase has to come from the Centre. We were informed that it would start from March. We were also asked to complete the first shot of healthcare workers by February 20 and frontline workers till February 28,” he said, wishing not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-over-6-000-covid-19-cases-for-second-day-in-a-row-101613847915067.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Sanpada school cancels offline classes as Navi Mumbai civic body steps in||A private school in Sanpada cancelled its offline classes on Saturday after the intervention of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC).Several parents of the known chain of schools in Sanpada had approached the school seeking withdrawal of its decision to start offline classes and examinations for Class 9 and 10. Parents claimed that it was not possible for the students to reach with no transport available along with other difficulties. While some of the parents reached out to the school via email, some tried meeting the principal on Saturday with no response from the administration, the parents claimed.Read more: Navi Mumbai civic body to take strict action, impose fines against those not following Covid norms“The pandemic is still there. Sending children to school is a risk. Moreover, there is no transportation provided. The parents are working, so how will children go to school?” a parent who did not wish to be named said.The offline classes for Class 10 started on February 16 and for Class 9 on February 17. The exams are scheduled in March.“Very few students who stay nearby attended the offline classes while the rest of them missed it. When the offline school was conducted, there was no online school, so the ones who did not attend missed the lectures,” the parent added.After various complaints, NMMC education department contacted the principal of the school and informed them that they are not allowed to conduct physical classes. After NMMC intervened on Saturday, the school sent a message to the parents stating that the physical classes have been cancelled, however there was still no clarity about the exams.“We have conveyed the message that the school cannot conduct classes or call the students to school as it is still not permitted. The principal has been asked to meet us on Monday, wherein we convey the same face to face,” deputy municipal commissioner, Yogesh Kaduskar, said.The principal remained unavailable for comment when contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sanpada-school-cancels-offline-classes-as-navi-mumbai-civic-body-steps-in-101613847733504.html
21-02-2021||Chandigarh||Why fusion of modern, alternative medicine is unfeasible||Doctors across the country have decried the concept of ‘mixopathy’, which refers to the integration of different systems of medicine such as ayurveda, homeopathy, unani, siddha, yoga and naturopathy with allopathy (modern system of medicine).The debate began when provisions under Section 50 of the National Medical Commission Act, 2020 mandated that educational modules for interface between the modern system of medicine, homeopathy and ayurveda be prepared through joint meetings of the Central Council of Indian Medicine, Central Council of Homeopathy and National Medical Commission. These provisions aim to promote pluralism in medical education.The National Education Policy, 2020, in its medical education component, lays emphasis on a holistic approach. The government think-tank NITI Aayog is perusing through a variety of reform ideas in the health sector, including aligning traditional and modern approaches for the ‘larger good’, for which the Aayog has formed four committees. These committees are in the areas of medical education, clinical practice, public health, medical research and administration.No common groundHowever, this concept of integrating different systems of medicine raises serious questions about its practicability as each medical system has its own unique method of diagnosis, reasoning for causation and protocols for treatment.The modern medicine system is an internationally recognised system of treatment whereas other systems have regional acceptance and dominance. Just as different regional languages cannot be integrated to make one language, it is similarly not possible to formulate one common system of treatment.Case in point: How can the anti-microbial concept of modern medicine system be integrated with the ‘tridosha theory’ of Ayurveda? Or the homeopathic concept, which says dilution increases the potency of a biologically active substance be reconciled with modern pharmacology? The homeopathic principles that substances retain memory on dilution has not stood the scrutiny of biology, chemistry, physics and related sciences. It would be difficult to explain the logic of the yogic concept of alternate nostril breathing (anulom vilom) to a student of modern anatomy and physiology because both nostrils have identical structures?More research neededFurthermore, it is not possible to treat one patient with different systems simultaneously. Scientists and clinicians are yet to study drug interactions between medicines from different systems inside the complex human machine, which may be undergoing different metabolic changes due to the stress of trauma, operative procedure or recovery from anaesthetic agents apart from the onslaught of infections and immune factors. All such issues need to be sorted out through scientific research, both in experimental laboratories as well as in clinical practice before any type of integration exercise is put into action, by independent expert groups. Or else, we shall be putting the proverbial cart before the horse.Unlike the modern system of medicine, the indigenous systems of therapy are not evidence-based. And hence, have no common grounds to meet and mix.Shortage of qualified doctors has often been cited as one reason for such integration. However, as nearly 80,000 MBBS doctors are now being trained by 642 medical colleges every year such an argument may not be valid anymore. Rather, there may be many unemployed MBBS doctors few years from now. There is no dearth of postgraduate doctors too, 36,192 doctor of medicine (MD) and master of surgery (MS) seats were available for the year 2020-21. Over 44,000 specialist doctors are also being prepared by medical colleges and 60 exclusive post graduate medical institutes every year.Better infrastructure needed in rural areasAnother argument made in favour of the integration is that doctors of the modern system of medicine are not keen on providing services in remote or underdeveloped areas. However, the non-availability of qualified doctors in rural areas can be attributed to non-availability of other essential services as well. Qualified doctors would love to serve the ailing masses in rural areas if infrastructure and social milieu to practice modern medicine is made available by the government.Policy makers must work on correcting the basic lacunae in infrastructure first, rather than making stop-gap arrangements to meet the demand and supply gap, if any, by either integrating different systems of treatment or by imparting modern surgical training to ayurveda graduates, as per the CCIM notification, (Amendment Rules 2016) dated November,19 2020. Let each system of treatment be developed in an individual manner by established scientific research methodology, to make it evidence-based and acceptable to those with scientific temperament. Mixopathy is unscientific, unrealistic, unreasonable, and an onslaught on the uniqueness of individual systems of treatment. Let diversity of different systems prevail and flourish.(Views expressed are personal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/why-fusion-of-modern-alternative-medicine-is-unfeasible-101613847675466.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police to get gangster Ravi Pujari’s custody on Monday||The Mumbai Police is set to get gangster Ravi Pujari’s custody on Monday after a special court in Karnataka sanctioned the same. Pujari has around 50 criminal cases filed against him in Mumbai of around 200 cases across India.Earlier, efforts by Mumbai Police’s crime branch to take the gangster’s custody failed due to various legal hurdles. Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had, after taking over as commissioner last year, said that more efforts would be taken to take Pujari’s custody.Police sources said at the time of Pujari’s extradition, authorities in Senegal, from where the gangster was extradited, were informed by Karnataka Police only about their cases. Due to this, Pujari’s lawyer opposed his custody to the Mumbai Police.However, the same was cleared after the ministry of home affairs and ministry of external affairs intervened and represented their case before authorities in Senegal and sought permission for granting Pujari’s custody to Mumbai Police.Senegal authorities then permitted Mumbai Police to take the custody and the documents were accordingly submitted before the special court in Bengaluru, which passed an order on Saturday, said officers.Milind Bharambhe, joint commissioner of police (crime), said, “After compliance of all legal procedures, we approached a special Bengaluru court which granted Pujari’s custody to us. Mumbai Police will get his custody on Monday, following which he will be brought to Mumbai and produced in the court.”The anti-extortion cell (AEC) of the Mumbai Police will take Pujari’s custody in connection with an October 2016 firing case at a hotel in Vile Parle which was allegedly done on the instructions of Pujari for extortion. The police had arrested seven members of the Pujari gang in the case including the shooter while Pujari was shown as wanted accused in the case.Crime branch sources said a special team of officers would interrogate the gangster. Given the track record of the gangster, additional security arrangements are being made at the crime branch lock up, said a police officer.A crime branch officer said Pujari is wanted accused in 52 cases including murder, extortion and shootouts in Mumbai over the past 24 years.Pujari has been named in at least 200 cases across the country. He was arrested in Senegal in West Africa in January 2019, but he jumped bail and fled to South Africa where he was involved in drug trafficking and extortion racket.Sources in Indian Intelligence said he was hiding as Anthony Fernandes, a Burkina Faso passport holder, and was located in a remote village of South Africa.Based on a tip-off from the Indian external intelligence agency, Senegal police caught the gangster. He was then brought to India by a team of officers, including senior IPS officers from Karnataka, where he has 79 cases.After his arrest, Mumbai Police’s anti-extortion cell (AEC) compiled a dossier with details of 20 cases against him in Mumbai for his extradition. “The selected cases were mostly registered under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Act (MCOCA),” said an AEC official. “All case papers were written in Marathi and were translated in English, which took at least two months. Apart from the documents, we collected biometric proof, including DNA samples collected from his family,” the officer added.A senior crime branch officer said police in Karnataka, Kerala and Gujarat and other cities have also prepared similar dossiers which were submitted to the home ministry, from where these were sent to the authorities in Senegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-to-get-gangster-ravi-pujari-s-custody-on-monday-101613847673680.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP chief draws flak for claiming PM Modi made Kalam prez||Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Chandrakant Patil drew criticism from the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra after he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi made Dr APJ Abdul Kalam the president of India. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said Modi was not in national level politics then while the Congress criticised Patil saying next that he would give credit to Modi for how the universe came into being. Raut criticised Patil and the BJP saying they wanted credit for everything that has happened in the country.Patil made the controversial claim while speaking to BJP’s Yuva Morcha held in Pune on Friday. He said that Modi never discriminated against Muslims and claimed that Modi made Kalam the president in 2002. Patil had said, “Narendra Modi has given a place to all Muslims. He had also made Abdul Kalam the president. He was not made the president because he was a Muslim, but because he was an accomplished scientist.”Dr Kalam was elected as the President of India in 2002 during Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government, while Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat.Raut dismissed the claim and said it was a masterstroke by late Vajpayee. “This was a masterstroke by Atal Bihari Vajpayee; and Pramod Mahajan too was involved in it. All parties had supported the candidature of Dr Kalam. I only know that Modi was not in the national political scene then. My knowledge or information might be inadequate, but was he [Kalam] Vajpayee’s choice, which was backed by everybody. It is laughable that some people are taking credit for everything that has happened in the country,” Raut said.State Congress secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “Today, neither APJ Abdul Kalam nor Vajpayee are alive. Tomorrow Chandrakant Patil may even say that the universe came into being because of Modi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-chief-draws-flak-for-claiming-pm-modi-made-kalam-prez-101613847313510.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai civic body to take strict action, impose fines against those not following Covid norms||With increasing Covid cases, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has decided to implement penalties more stringently so as to make sure that everyone followed the norms.The NMMC chief, Abhijit Bangar, said, “It’s noticed that people have stopped taking the pandemic seriously. In the beginning of the pandemic, we were still unaware about the seriousness of the virus. But now, everyone knows about it. So, not following the norms is not acceptable.”In order to ensure that marriages are being conducted by following the norms, the civic body has decided to penalise not just the organiser but also the owner of the marriage or banquet hall if rules are flouted.“Penalising the organiser or the event manager of the marriage was the norm followed usually. Now, we have decided to penalise even the hall owner so that at least he makes sure that the event is organised keeping the safety measures in mind,” Bangar said.He added that the penalty would be charged anywhere between ₹20,000 and ₹50,000, depending on the norms flouted.Ever since the pandemic struck, the highest number of positive cases in a day was recorded on August 20 with 477 cases. The numbers had started coming down from November 9 with the cases going below 100. But this month, the cases started seeing a surge with the cases crossing the per day 100 mark on February 18 with 104 cases, which increased to 126 on February 19.“We have also formed teams at ward level with NMMC officials and police who would be penalising the people flouting norms more stringently,” Bangar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-to-take-strict-action-impose-fines-against-those-not-following-covid-norms-101613847133438.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 9 arrested for posing as cops, robbing ₹12 crore||Vile Parle police arrested nine people for allegedly robbing ₹12 crore from two persons at a five-star hotel in Vile Parle. The accused posed as police officers and under the pretext of a raid, “seized” the cash and escaped from the hotel.Manjunath Shinge, deputy commissioner of police, zone 8, confirmed the development but refused to divulge details as the accused are being interrogated and efforts are on to recover the stolen cash.A police officer said that victims had come from outside the city and were staying in the hotel in Vile Parle (East). The two were waiting for some other people who are in hawala transactions as wanted to send ₹12 crore to someone in Canada through hawala. On February 17, two people undertaking hawala transactions visited them. While the cash was being counted for hawala transactions, four people posing as police personnel barged into the room around 4pm, said the officer.“Under the pretext of a police raid, the four accused seized the cash. They told the four people in the room that the money in their possession has been obtained through illegal activities and hence was seized. After some discussions, the fake policemen agreed to a settlement against some monetary consideration,” said a senior police officer. The victims later learnt that they were imposters. Anand Ingale, 29, alerted local police about the incident. Ingle is a labour contractor and a social activist. The police registered an offence and multiple police teams swung into action. Enquiry revealed that the policemen had showed their (fake) identity cards while entering the hotel.“Based on the leads obtained from the enquiry with hotels staff and CCTV footage, police zeroed in on some suspects and on Friday arrested nine accused who reportedly admitted their involvement in the robbery,” said the police officer.Police booked all the nine people under sections 392 (robbery), 170 (personating public servant) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. A local court has remanded them in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-9-arrested-for-posing-as-cops-robbing-12-crore-101613847073499.html
21-02-2021||City||Gujarat transwoman painter fears for her life, alleges abuse for refusing to beg||A 21-year old transwoman, who is a Warli artist and works with slum-dwellers, was allegedly kidnapped, beaten and forced to strip in public by another group of transgenders on February 15 night in Rajkot, she claimed.The incident came to light on Thursday after the alleged assailants made a video of the incident and spread it across certain social media groups.“They mercilessly pulled my hair, kicked me in my private parts, called names. They first beat me up at home, in the autorickshaw when they were taking me and then near the hotel (on Gondal Road). They also shot a video of me stripping and as they thrashed me,” she said.She said she was beaten and abused as she didn't want to beg for money. “I didn’t want to beg for money. I have a talent and that is adequate to lead a proper life and so I kept away from the others. What happened was some members of their group (who had assaulted her) left them and joined my group of the LGBTQ community. Some are learning Warli art with me, while all of us work to help the slum-dwellers in the city as social work. As more transgenders, who didn’t want to beg on the streets, joined me, the others were angry and did this to me.”She wasn’t willing to talk till a Pune-based LGBTQ activist Damini Sinha asked her to. Sinha said, “She was too scared to lodge an FIR but also determined to move the police. If unchecked, such incidents would increase.”She did not approach the police as the group of assaulters took her to the police station.“See their guts and police connections. After doing all that to me, they took me to the police station. The cops there won’t listen to me. The only help and that time was a PCR van which dropped me home at 2 am,” the Warli painter said.Sinha said her assaulters had taken her to A-Division police station where they did not listen to her nor were willing to register a case, saying since she was kidnapped from her home in Malviya Nagar, the FIR would be lodged there.Also read: India, Maldives sign 5 deals, EAM hands over 1 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccinesDeputy Commissioner of Police, Manoharsinh Jadeja, said, “we are on election duty, check with the police station.” Police Inspector KN Bhukan of Malviya Nagar claimed, “This girl never came to our police station. It is not possible for us to refuse to take her complaint.”The victim said she would lodge a complaint on Saturday with the help of a woman activist, who is also a teacher in Rajkot and associated with NGO Samajik Ekta Jagruti Mission. “Now, I have her support to step out of home and lodge a complaint,” she added.On Saturday, before she could step out of her home to go to the police stations, a group of eunuchs knocked on her door early in the morning. “I was scared, I knew if I opened they might even kill me. I didn’t open the door and called the police,” she told Hindustan Times.A van from the Malaviya Nagar police came soon and took her and the eunuchs at her house to the police station to lodge her FIR in the incident.“At the police station, they created a huge scene and demanded that I should be thrown out of Rajkot. When the police tried to cool off the matter and were ready to take my FIR, the group of eunuchs stripped, staged demonstrations and shouted slogans against the police,” she recounted the incident. Local Gujarati media even recorded the incident live.The police recorded her statements about the entire incident right from February 15 night. However, being a tribal, she wanted to lodge the complaint under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.“Since I wanted to register the case under the atrocities act, I would need a caste certificate which I did not have at that time. I will have to go to my native village in Surendranagar district to get it,” she said. Once she gets the certificate, she would be able to lodge the complaint.“I have told the police that I fear for my life and these people may attack me again anytime and so will need security. They told me once the FIR is lodged, they will provide me with security. Till then, if I need help, they promised they are there,” the Warli painter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gujarat-transwoman-painter-fears-for-her-life-alleges-abuse-for-refusing-to-beg-101613846606312.html
21-02-2021||Mumbai||University of Mumbai schedules PG exams 6 weeks after course begins||Barely six weeks since colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai (MU) started first-year classes for masters courses, the university is now asking all colleges to complete their first-semester exams on or before March 10. Colleges said not only is the varsity flouting the 90-day working period before conducting exams, but is also offering very little clarity to colleges about the exams. “Most colleges were completing the admission process for first-year Master of Commerce (MCom), Master of Arts (MA) and Master of Science (MSc) courses until January 15, and classes began only in the third week of January. Now the latest circular by university’s examination department is asking us to conduct exams before March 10 and announce results by March 15. How is this possible?” said the coordinator of the MCom department of a suburban college. This year, admissions to most courses in higher education sector got delayed due to the Covid-19 lockdown and confusion over reservation quotas. In colleges that managed to fill up their seats through the in-house quota, admissions to postgraduate courses were completed by December 2020 and classes began in the first week of January 2021. However, in many cases, colleges had to wait until January 15 this year to complete the admission process and start regular classes. “While MCom and MA lectures have been conducted online, students from the MSc-IT department have barely completed 40% practical classes. How can we conduct examination for these students without even completing basic curriculum?” asked the principal of a south Mumbai college on condition of anonymity. Officials from the Board of Examinations and Evaluation (BoEE) said the circular is not binding in terms of the date mentioned. “We have told colleges to hold the examination by March 10 but in case colleges approach us seeking an extension of examination deadline, we will consider their case,” said Vinod Patil, director BoEE, MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-schedules-pg-exams-6-weeks-after-course-begins-101613846833493.html

Khan was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on January 13 in connection with a drug case. Khan’s name cropped up in connection with the seizure of 200 kilogrammes of marijuana after the agency arrested British national Karan Sejnani from Khar as well as Rahila and Shaista Furniturewala from Bandra on January 9.The prosecution said that the narcotic substance was to be used by Sejnani who was developing a product based on tobacco, marijuana and CBD spray. It further claimed that Khan was to invest in the business.Khan, in his defence while seeking bail, claimed that it was a herbal product and he was not aware about anything else.

21-02-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal likely to meet farm leaders today in Delhi Assembly||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is scheduled to meet some farm leaders on Sunday to discuss the three contentious farm laws, which have evoked vociferous protests across the country, a senior official in the chief minister’s office said on Saturday.“The CM’s meeting with the farmer leaders will take place over lunch at the Delhi Assembly on Sunday. The three farm laws and other related concerns will be discussed in the meeting,” said the official, who did not wish to be identified.The chief minister’s office and Delhi government spokespersons refused to share names of the leaders to whom invites have been sent for Sunday’s meeting. HT spoke to many farm unions but none of them confirmed to have received an invite from the Delhi chief minister’s office.Sunday’s meeting plan comes a week ahead of Kejriwal’s scheduled visit to Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut, where he is supposed to address a kisan mahapanchayat (farmers’ meeting) on February 28.Office bearers of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha – a collective of more than 30 farmer groups which are leading the ongoing protests – said that none of the leaders associated with the group has received any invite for a meeting with Kejriwal.Thousands of farmers from states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have gathered at Delhi’s borders for nearly three months now, to voice concerns against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which were passed in the Parliament in September last year. The protesting farmers have blocked the interstate highways at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur demanding that the government repeal the three farm laws.While the government says that the new laws are supposed to reform the agriculture sector in the country, the protesting farmers fear that the laws will do away with agricultural markets, favour industrialists, and affect prices of crops, which would further bring down their income.Kejriwal, who is also the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), has stood in solidarity with protesting farmers since the onset of the protest. The AAP voted against the three contentious laws in both houses of the Parliament.Before Kejriwal, other senior AAP leaders — such as deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, and health minister Satyendar Jain, among others — have met the farmers at the Delhi borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-likely-to-meet-farm-leaders-today-in-delhiassembly-101613843953125.html
21-02-2021||Delhi||Police file second case against two south Delhi child care homes||The Delhi Police on Saturday said their Economics Offences Wing had registered a case against two child care homes for financial irregularities, cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust, following a complaint received from the National Commission for Protection of Child Right (NCPCR).This is the second case against the two child care homes in a fortnight. The police identified the two homes as Umeed Aman Ghar, a home for boys, and Khushi Rainbow Home, a residence for girls -- both based south Delhi and established by the Centre for Equity Studies (CSE). The CSE is being run by trustee member Harsh Mander, a retired IAS officer.An officer from the EoW said that the second case was registered on Thursday under various Indian Penal Code Sections.“The NCPCR had filed a complaint against the two homes mentioning financial irregularities. After preliminary examination, which indicated financial irregularities, we registered a case. We would now be issuing notices to the concerned homes and members of their management seeking their availability to join the probe,” the officer said.Mander could not be reached for a comment on the allegations despite repeated attempts.At that time, chairperson of NCPCR Priyank Kanoongo, had said that the two homes are run by Centre for Equity Studies where activist Harsh Mander is a director. Kanoongo accused the officials of the two homes of trying to “derail” the enquiry process by saying that Mander was not connected to them.Kanoogoo, as well as the findings of an inspection by NCPCR on October 1, had pointed to alleged irregularities in the financial aspects of the two homes, the living conditions of the children and found them to be flouting several applicable laws.When HT had sought a comment on these allegations, the management of the homes had sent a response in which they had denied any financial irregularities and that Mander only conceived the Rainbow Homes Programme (HRP) under which the children are cared for.The management had said the NCPCR was trying to malign the reputation of HRP as Mander is a “known critic of the government and its policies”, they added that Mander was no longer associated with the “day-to-day running” of the programme.Earlier this month, a first information report (FIR) was registered under against the two care homes for children under the Juvenile Justice Act and the section 188 (disobedience to an order passed by a government servant) at the Mehrauli police station, after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) reported a host of abuse and irregularities such as sexual abuse, using the children for anti-CAA protests, not providing them the right living conditions, Covid-19 norms violations, among others, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-file-second-case-against-two-south-delhi-child-care-homes-101613843892694.html
21-02-2021||Other||MSC Bank case: EOW did not consider proof, Anna Hazare tells court||Social activist Anna Hazare on Saturday claimed before a special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court that he had on the basis of documentary evidence revealed the involvement of several political leaders in the alleged fraud at Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank, but the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police “did not even touch the allegations”. Advocate Satish Talekar submitted that Hazare was the first person to raise the issue of large-scale irregularities at MSC Bank, especially with regards to the sale of the mortgaged cooperative sugar factories. Talekar added that on the basis of documentary evidence, Hazare had pointed out to high court the involvement of several political leaders. However, the investigating agency has claimed that there was no evidence of any criminality, without considering the material submitted by the social activist. Talekar was arguing the protest petition filed by Hazare, opposing a report submitted by EOW, seeking to close the criminal case involving elected representatives of almost all political parties in the state. Mumbai Police’s EOW had last September filed a closure report in the alleged Rs25,000-crore MSC Bank fraud case. The police filed a C summary (closure report) in the special ACB court after EOW’s special investigation team (SIT) found no criminal aspect to be investigated in the case. The original complainant, along with other activists, had filed a protest petition asking the court to reject the report. Along with this, Hazare too approached the court earlier this week pleading it to discard the report and asked the police for further investigation, claiming that the closure report is filed under political pressure. Hazare has claimed that he is the original complainant in this case and had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in 2018. He has alleged that the report has been filed without taking his statement. “The IO (investigating officer) has deliberately given a colour of civil liability to the criminal acts pure and simple. The mens rea [criminal intent] as well as actus reus (criminal act) being present in the criminal actions of the accused, no other conclusion than commission of offences can be inferred,” Hazare has claimed in the petition. The petition further stated that, “The illegalities committed either in sanction of illegal loans or illegal sale of sugar units were part of the larger conspiracy. The modus operandi of granting illegal loans in the name of a cooperative, Sugar Sahakari Karkhana (SSK), though intended for personal use of directors, non-repayment of dues causing sickness of SSKs and sale of SSKs at throwaway prices to their asides and associates who were on the earlier board of directors of the SSK or the MSC Bank or their kin or their party men was nothing but criminal conspiracy within the meaning of section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.” The special court has now posted the matter for further hearing on March 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-state-cooperative-bank-case-eow-hasn-t-taken-proof-into-consideration-anna-hazare-to-court-101613838132250.html
21-02-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana seeks Centre’s help to resolve SYL Canal issue||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday sought the Union government’s intervention in resolving the long-pending issue of Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) and Hansi-Butana Link canal so that the state could get its legitimate share of river water. “To overcome the water shortage problem in the state, the government will soon be signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the Kishau dam. Besides this, MoUs have already been signed with the Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh governments for the Lakhwar and Renuka dam,” Khattar said during the sixth governing council meeting of the Niti Aayog, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi through video conferencing. Apprising the Prime Minister of the steps taken by the state to promote water conservation, Khattar said that at present, large parts of the state are in the dark zone and if the SYL and Hansi-Butana Link Canal issue is resolved, Haryana’s problem of water scarcity will be addressed. Highlighting the fact that though in GST collection, Haryana is at the forefront but despite that due to input tax credit, the state gets only 20% GST, the chief minister urged the Prime Minister to formulate a plan for incentivising states having the maximum GST collection. He said efforts are on for the successful implementation of the first of its kind Parivar Pehchan Patra scheme to ensure that the person standing last in the queue gets the benefit of government schemes. He said at present, export business worth ₹85,000 crore is being done, which includes basmati and automobile parts. Agricultural reforms Khattar said that for promoting agriculture, aligning cropping system to agro-climatic conditions at district levels is being done for optimum resource use. He said under Mera Pani Meri Virasat scheme, alternative crops like maize, cotton, bajra, pulses, vegetables, and fruits were being grown. ₹7, 000 is being given as incentive to farmers for adopting crop diversification, said the chief minister. He said for water conservation, Haryana water resource authority and Haryana pond and wastewater management authority have been constituted. Khatar said at present, Haryana is giving the highest price of ₹350 per quintal to sugarcane farmers. Apart from this, various crops such as gram, mustard, sunflower, bajra and maize are being procured on MSP by the state government, he added. While 17, 216 hectares has been brought under fish culture which has produced 1.91 lakh MT fish in the state, production of white shrimp in saline affected areas is becoming popular. He said the state government has planned to convert paddy straw into compressed biogas and for this, 100 compressed biogas (CBG) plant will be set up in the first phase with the help from Centre. He said that to further strengthen the storage system after harvesting, warehouses will be set up under the warehousing scheme, which will be notified as deemed mandis so that the produce can be sold from these mandis. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-seeks-centre-s-help-to-resolve-syl-canal-issue-101613825172117.html
21-02-2021||Other||Startup mantra: Technology and defence create a whole new battlefield for innovation||When news of the Chamoli glacier burst broke earlier this month, several rescue and relief teams were rushed to the spot by authorities. While the rescue operations were being conducted, the NDRF sought help from startups– some of them from Pune – to deal with the situation. These entrepreneurs, while working with the tri-services, are addressing many such problem statements with their innovative products and indigenous technologies. With more than 30 defence establishments in and around Pune, the city-based defence startups are availing benefits with direct access to these establishments. The Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture’s (MCCIA) defence committee is also running a “defence procurement assistance programme” series for startups and MSMEs. The committee members also facilitate meetings with the College of Military Engineering (CME) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) officials, where entrepreneurs get an opportunity to present and demonstrate their products. Tech Mahindra is establishing a Makers Lab at CME to provide cutting-edge, next-generation technologies for the forces.What the founders say“The focus of our work is biosensors. We are planning to make a drug delivery vehicle product like for example a “painless drug delivery agent”. Small children are vaccinated, and it is quite a painful experience for them. Our drug delivery vehicle will ensure that the vaccine is delivered, and it won’t cause pain to the children. We are yet in the research stage and it will take another four to five months for the finished product launch. We are also in talks with some pharmaceutical companies for this product.“Another product is in the sensors-related domain. We are planning to develop a soldier’s health monitoring system which is non-invasive. We will measure maximum health related parameters such as blood pressure, haemoglobin, serum content, and platelet count of the individual using an IoT device and interfacing it further to a display or mobile. This product will take about a year for launch as it requires multidisciplinary expertise.“Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) has started a fully equipped innovation and incubation centre and is providing all infrastructural facilities to the incubated startup. They might consider internal funding to the incubated startups, but the policy decision is yet to be taken. We are also seeking government grants from Department of Science and Technology, Biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) scheme of BIRAC. For guidance in availing these grants, DIAT is taking help from NCL Venture Centre. DIAT vice- chancellor Dr C P Ramanarayanan, along with Dr Suvarna Datar and Dr Thakur have been instrumental in making all this happen. “Infrastructural support from institutes and universities is available to startups. A startup founder needs takers and indigenous technologies will be developed if there are any takers for it. Hence, institutes should try to improve and increase the industry interface, only then a startup will become successful. I have raised this issue multiple times on several national platforms. There should be a common platform/ industry interface where the industry can say that they require a technology and they are ready to fund it and find out whether the startups can do it for them.”-Prof Dr Sangeeta Kale, founder of Navyukti Innovations; director, Policy and Planning at Defence Institute of Advanced Technology---“We work in the security domain and our products are unmanned ground systems or vehicles. These products help the armed forces undertake reconnaissance, surveillance and take appropriate action for physical interventions with the enemies. We have also designed a logistics robot and demonstrated its capability. It can carry 30kg to 40kg of payload. We have also designed a small spherical robot which can be used in counter-insurgency operations in northern command. “So far, we have received funding of ₹1 crore from various government departments, Science and Technology Park Pune, and SINE IIT Mumbai. Recently we also received a grant from the Ministry of Electronics and Telecommunication grant for a project which we had undertaken during the lockdown period. We have also pitched to SIDBI fund of funds.“In the last year, two to three startups have moved to Pune. The ecosystem in Pune is pretty good for hardware startups. There are other institutes like DIAT, CME which help entrepreneurs in terms of access and reach. CME is helping us to take a proposal ahead with Army Training Command. It is certainly benefiting start-ups.”- Ganesh Pandit Suryawanshi, founder, Combat Robotics India---Mentor speak“Government of India has started two schemes for startups and MSMEs. One is the technology development fund (TDF) scheme where the users (the three services) give requirements to the directorate of futuristic technology management (DFTM) at the DRDO headquarters. TDF floats a problem statement on its website. It gives up to ₹10 crore grant. Startups or MSMEs invests only 10 per cent in development. So almost all development is funded by DRDO. They give handholding support like testing the product on site. They review the progress every two months and give feedback. DRDO also offers mentor support from their laboratories.“The other scheme that government has given is the IDEX scheme. This is directly run by the department of defence production. In this scheme too, all problem statements are put online. The limit is ₹3 crore with 50 per cent funding provided. So, startups have a matching contribution in IDEX.“The best thing that has happened last year is that both the schemes have been included in the new defence acquisition procedure. As per the new DAP, the tri-services are bound to purchase items developed by startups or MSMEs under these schemes in the future. The biggest problem faced in the past regarding buyers has been addressed under the innovation purchase in the policy document. The only problem with these schemes is that they may take more time than a startup would like.“In the defence sector, the market is very uncertain and hence, venture capitalists are not keen to invest in companies unless until there is demand from the end customer, that is the ministry of defence. “As far as ecosystem is concerned, there is too much of mentoring, but collaboration is not happening. Many of us in the startup ecosystem feel that we will do everything. This is causing people to invest in efforts which somebody could have done much faster. Start-ups should worry about profitability and not the quantum of work.”-Abhishek Jain, VP, Strategic Partnerships, Zeus NumerixBest defence is attackCombat Robotics India Founded in 2015 by Ganesh Pandit Suryawanshi•Design and manufacturing of defence-grade robots that empower and enhance human abilities.

21-02-2021||Mumbai||'Follow Covid norms or face lockdown', warns Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Amid a spurt in Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday directed district authorities to strictly enforce the standard operating procedures (SOPs) laid down to facilitate unlocking in the state. Taking a serious note of the laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour across the state, Thackeray warned that lockdown would have to be imposed again if people do not prevent crowding or do not follow masking in public places.In a meeting chaired by Thackeray with the health minister, divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners and superintendents of police on the Covid-19 situation in the state, it was decided to control social gathering such as weddings and functions, which can turn into super-spreader events. There would be a temporary hold on permissions for rallies, processions, protests; while guests in wedding ceremonies will be strictly limited to 50.During the meeting, Thackeray said that declining cases has led to a carelessness among citizens. “Even if there is laxity in people, the district administration should not let your guard down and enforce the norms strictly, he told the administration.” A day after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that tough decisions might have to be taken to prevent spread of coronavirus in the state, Thackeray said, “It is up to the people to decide whether to follow the rules or go back to the lockdown again. So, more care should be taken in the future,” he added.On Tuesday, Maharashtra recorded 3,663 new Covid-19 cases with 461 fresh cases in Mumbai. The state recorded 39 deaths, taking the toll to 51,591, while Mumbai added three fatalities. Maharashtra’s active caseload stood at 37,125, while Mumbai had 4,238 active cases. For Mumbai, there was no discussion of imposing lockdown in the city, said officials present in the meeting. However, strict enforcement of Covid rules, including fines for face mask violation, will be done.In the past couple of weeks, the state is seeing an increase in fresh Covid-19 cases from many districts. The daily average of cases recorded in first 15 days of February is more than the average number of cases recorded in January. Between February 1 and 15, the state has averaged 2,926 cases daily, while the average in January was 2,973.Alarmingly, Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur districts have added 3,739, 3,709 and 3,011 new cases between February 9 and 15. While Amravati district added 2,843 infections, followed by Thane district (2,303) and Nashik district (1,359) between the same period. In the past six weeks, although the overall active case count has gone down in the state, active cases in 15 districts have gone up. For instance, Amravati district saw active cases go from 1,144 on January 4 to 3,090 on February 15—a jump of 170% in six weeks.Five districts that need to be watched closely, according to a presentation given to Thackeray, include Amravati, Wardha, Akola, Yavatmal, and Buldhana. Amravati district has recorded a jump of 10.69% in new cases between February 8 and 14, followed by Wardha (4.62%), Akola (4.27%), Yavatmal (3.19%), and Buldhana (2.28%).Thackeray further said that the Covid-19 norms are not being followed in public places across the state. “So, rallies, processions and agitations should not be allowed. Also, it should be checked whether the attendance limit at the wedding ceremonies is followed,” said Thackeray. The CM has asked to take action against the owner of the establishment, if people are found not following Covid-appropriate behaviour or if any rules are flouted.Thackeray also allowed district collectors and superintendent of police to make their permissions mandatory for weddings to keep a tab on the number of people attending the ceremony. “The police permission is not made mandatory. However, the district authorities can decide, if they wish to. It was a suggestion that came from one of the districts, which the CM liked,” said an official requesting anonymity.For Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is going to introduce additional squads to man railway stations to ensure people wear masks. Special teams are expected to be formed to check venues for wedding ceremonies by the civic body, said an official.A senior official said that lockdown would not be practical at this moment, while stricter enforcement of the existing rules will help contain the spread. “People have become lax in taking precautionary measures. Right now we want to keep social gatherings under control. The super-spreader events such as weddings and social gathering will be strictly restricted to 50 people. The 50-people rule has been there but there have been instances where there have been 500-600 attendees,” the official said requesting anonymity.Similarly, Thackeray directed local authorities to check if restaurants and hotels are following the rules. If not, then he has asked them to take immediate action against the establishment. Thackeray added that the administration should also hold a dialogue with all the business organisations and associations, who sought relaxations from the lockdown, to ensure that the SOP is being enforced strictly.Thackeray directed local authorities to recheck on the people, who have been recorded to have six types of comorbidities under the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign. He further instructed that the local bodies should carry out disinfection of public places, toilets, bus stands, parks in rural and urban areas. The containment zones should be demarcated if need and implement them, he added.Meanwhile, Maharashtra vaccinated 27,698 beneficiaries across 655 centres in the state. Of these, 4,437 were healthcare workers who were administered their second shot of the vaccination. On Tuesday, 7,884 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 15,377 frontline workers (FLWs) were inoculated.So far, 741,370 beneficiaries, including FLWs and HCWs along with those who have got their second dose, have been inoculated. The state has completed vaccination for 567,087 (53.76%) of the total registered healthcare workers and vaccinated 165,167 (27.78%) of the total registered frontline workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-follow-covid-norms-or-face-lockdown-101613501158216.html
21-02-2021||World||Over 51,000 people evacuated in southern Philippines as storm approaches||The Philippines have moved over 51,000 people to safer grounds as the approaching tropical storm Dujuan flooded parts of the southern and central Philippines, a government disaster agency said on Sunday.The Office of Civil Defense said the government has evacuated over 51,000 people in the provinces of Surigao del Sur, Surigao del Norte, Agusan del Norte, and Dinagat Islands Sunday morning due to massive flooding.Dujuan, the country's first storm this year, is expected to make landfall on Monday morning, the state weather bureau said in a bulletin.As of 7:00 p.m. local time, the weather bureau said Dujuan was located 275 km east of Surigao City in Surigao del Norte province in the southern Philippines. It is moving northwestward at 25 km per hour, packing maximum sustained winds of 65 km per hour with gusts of up to 80 km per hour, the bureau said."(Dujuan) is forecast to maintain its strength in the next 12 hours. However, the likelihood of weakening into a tropical depression before it makes landfall is not yet ruled out," the weather bureau added, warning of heavy rains and rough seas."Under these conditions, isolated to scattered flooding (including flash floods) and rain-induced landslides are likely during heavy or prolonged rainfall especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards as identified in hazard maps," the bureau said.Dujuan will affect several provinces in the southern Luzon island, the central Philippines, and the Mindanao region in the southern part of the country, the bureau warned.Typhoons and tropical storms regularly batter the Philippines from June through December, claiming hundreds of lives and cause billions of dollars in damages.Located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is among the most disaster-prone countries, including active volcanoes, frequent earthquakes, and an average of 20 typhoons a year, causing floods and landslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-51-000-people-evacuated-in-southern-philippines-as-storm-approaches-101613929096429.html

We have lost four infected people," Eugene Syalita, the provincial health minister in North Kivu province in the DRC's east, told AFP.Syalita said one person died Friday and another on Saturday, while the two others died in early February.Two patients are receiving care at an Ebola treatment centre in Katwa near the major city of Butembo, he added.Syalita complained that the region's residents were not taking the new outbreak seriously enough."Some families categorically refuse to have their homes disinfected or to hold dignified and safe funerals," the doctor said."People have not yet understood that Ebola has reappeared. Everything is not yet clear for them."A vaccination drive was launched last Monday, but as with past outbreaks, people in the region doubt the existence of Ebola and reject measures aimed at checking its spread, including not to touch sick people and not to wash the dead.The 10th epidemic, which was declared on August 1, 2018, was finally eradicated on June 25 last year after being exacerbated by ongoing armed conflicts and resistance to anti-Ebola measures.With more than 2,200 deaths recorded, it is considered the most serious in the history of Ebola in the DRC since the scourge fist appeared in 1976, named after a river in the former Belgian colony, which was known as Zaire at the time.An 11th outbreak of the virus, which is believed to reside in bats, was declared over in November after claiming 55 lives in the northwestern province of Equateur.- Outbreak in Guinea, too -Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.Funeral practices often include washing, touching and kissing bodies that are still capable of transmitting Ebola, and may have particularly high levels of the live virus in excretions.The virus has also resurfaced in Guinea, where it has already killed five people in the first outbreak in West Africa since a 2013-16 epidemic that left more than 11,300 people dead in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.The United States last week said it would work with the affected governments and the World Health Organization over the outbreaks."The world cannot afford to turn the other way. We must do everything in our power to respond quickly, effectively," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ebola-toll-hits-4-in-dr-congo-as-people-resist-health-measures-101613917890488.html
21-02-2021||World||Pakistan unlikely to exit ‘grey list’ as FATF meets to decide its fate: Report||Pakistan is unlikely to exit the 'grey list’ of the FATF as some European countries have taken the stand that Islamabad has not fully implemented all the points of a plan of action set by it, a media report said on Sunday, on the eve of the plenary meeting of the global watchdog for money laundering and terror financing.The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to Covid-19 pandemic.The virtual FATF plenary will be held in Paris from February 22 to 25 to consider cases of various countries on the grey list, including Pakistan, and a decision will be made at the conclusion of the meetings, Dawn newspaper reported.In the last plenary held in October 2020, the FATF concluded that Pakistan will continue in its “grey list” till February 2021 as it has failed to fulfil six out of 27 obligations of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog that include failure to take action against two of India's most wanted terrorists – Jaish-e Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar and Jamaat-ud-Dawah head Hafiz Saeed.Azhar and Saeed are most wanted terrorists in India for their involvement in numerous terrorist acts, including 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks and bombing of a CRPF bus at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir last year.An official source close to these developments told the paper on Saturday that Pakistan had complied with the six recommendations and also submitted details to the FATF secretariat.The members would now evaluate Pakistan’s responses during the meeting, the source said, adding that the decision would be taken after a consensus among the members.The paper, quoting a journalist covering the FATF said that some European countries, especially the host France, had recommended to the FATF to continue to keep Pakistan on the grey list and had taken the position that not all points had been fully implemented by Islamabad.Other European countries are also supporting France, he said.France was not happy with the recent response of Islamabad on the cartoon issue, he said.Pakistan has not even posted a regular ambassador in Paris, he said, adding that diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries were not up to the mark.The US has also expressed concern over the acquittal the accused in American journalist Daniel Pearl’s kidnapping and murder case.It is feared that the US may also lobby for continuation of Islamabad on the grey list at least until June this year.Pakistan’s Supreme Court last month ordered release of British-born al-Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three aides in the 2002 Pearl murder case, a judgement denounced by the American journalist's family as "a complete travesty of justice.".An official, who is not willing to be quoted, told the paper that Pakistan had submitted a compliance report to the FATF.“We can’t say what will be their response to it; let’s wait for the day,” he said.The official said Pakistan had already done major legislation regarding punishment of terror financing, which was around one year in the old legislation.In October 2020, Minister for Industries and Production Hammad Azhar, who is the government’s point man on the FATF, announced that Pakistan had made progress across all action plan items and had now largely addressed 21 of the 27 action items.When the minister was approached for comments on the implementation status of the remaining six recommendations, he said he would make no comment until the plenary was over.“There is a strict confidentiality rule,” he said.With Pakistan's continuation in the 'grey' list, it is increasingly becoming difficult for Islamabad to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the debt-ridden nation which is in a precarious financial situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-unlikely-to-exit-grey-list-as-fatf-meets-to-decide-its-fate-report-101613920683072.html

Afghan police officials says that an investigation were underway.The Islamic State group’s local affiliate has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks, but many go unclaimed, with the government blaming the Taliban. The insurgents have denied responsibility for most of the attacks.Afghanistan has seen a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings and violence on the battlefield as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled. It’s been over a month since the sides last met to discuss how to proceed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roadside-bombs-in-afghanistan-kill-3-wound-20-says-report-101613920108129.html

That level will probably be reached Sunday or Monday.“It’s something that is stunning when you look at the numbers, almost unbelievable, but it’s true,” Fauci said. “This is a devastating pandemic, and it’s historic. People will be talking about this decades and decades and decades from now.”On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Fauci said the U.S. could be approaching normality toward the fall or winter of this year.Cases, hospitalizations and deaths have fallen considerably since peaking in early January. The pace of vaccinations is on the rise, with more than 60 million doses given so far, according to a state-by-state tally.Close to 13% of of the U.S. population has had at least the first of two doses, although the rollout has been criticized for leaving much of the minority population behind.At the current pace it would take an estimated nine months to cover 75% of Americans with a two-dose vaccine. But a one-dose version, from Johnson & Johnson, could be approved in the U.S. within weeks, which may start to break the logjam.Discussing the recent sharp decline in new Covid cases in the U.S., Fauci said it was “the natural peaking and coming down.”“I don’t think we’ve vaccinated enough people yet to get the herd immunity,” he said. “What I don’t and none of my colleagues want to see, is when you look at that slope to come down and to say, ‘Wow, we’re out of the woods now. We’re in good shape.’”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-says-weather-delays-to-covid-19-vaccinations-to-be-quickly-reversed-101613919746915.html

"First responders are at the scene. Sadly, all 7 personnel on board died in the crash."The chief of the air force has ordered an investigation into the accident, Daramole said.In scrubland just outside the airport perimeter, dozens of military and airport officials picked through the charred remnants of the fuselage as fire engines and ambulances stood by.The smell of burning chemicals lingered in the air but no fire or smoke were visible. Onlookers watched the rescue efforts from behind a cordon."As he (the plane's pilot) was going down, he struggled to go back to the airport, at the end he just crashed," said Alaba Lawal, who said she witnessed the accident."I just saw the whole thing explode, fire and smoke together... When I got there I saw dead bodies on the ground."The air force did not provide the identities of those killed in the crash.The Beechcraft King Air 350i is a twin-propeller aircraft made by Textron Aviation, a unit of the US-based Textron Inc conglomerate.

But CSA declined to say when it would be able to establish whether CGTN transmits to satellite from a ground station in France and therefore falls under the country's jurisdiction, the FT report added.Earlier this month, China barred Britain's BBC World News from its television networks and Hong Kong's public broadcaster said it would stop relaying BBC World Service radio, after Britain revoked CGTN's broadcast licence.The FT said Britain had been CGTN's European broadcasting hub.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-state-broadcaster-applies-to-france-for-right-to-air-in-europe-report-101613916397054.html

21-02-2021||World||Washington taps pastors to overcome racial divide on Covid-19 vaccine||Stately and deliberate, with a distinctive white streak in his black hair, the Rev. Wallace Charles Smith started his Valentine's Day sermon at Shiloh Baptist Church by talking about love and vaccinations.“That's what love's all about. When you get a vaccination, you are saying to everyone around you that you love them enough that you don't want any hurt, harm or danger to befall them,” he said. “In the spirit of love, keep at it until you get your vaccination. That’s the only thing that’s going to erase this terrible scourge."The church was empty except for a camera crew and a tiny choir. Thanks to Covid-19, Smith’s Sunday sermons are now virtual affairs.Still, health officials in the nation's capital are hoping that Smith and other Black religious leaders will serve as community influencers to overcome what officials say is a persistent vaccine reluctance in the Black community. Smith and several other local ministers recently received their first vaccine shots.Black residents make up a little under half of Washington’s population, but constitute nearly three-fourths of the city's Covid-19 deaths. The District of Columbia is now offering vaccinations to residents over age 65, but numbers show that seniors in the poorest and blackest parts of Washington are lagging behind.Officials partially blame historic distrust of the medical establishment, especially among Black seniors, who vividly remember medical exploitation horrors such as the Tuskegee syphilis study, where hundreds of impoverished rural Black men suffered syphilis effects with minimal treatment for decades as part of the medical study.“We know we need to focus on Black and brown communities,” Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, the director of the district's health department, said earlier this month. "Let’s not give up on communities of color being interested in the vaccine. Let’s continue to answer their questions. Let’s continue to be very thoughtful in how we answer their questions.”The D.C. government is giving priority for vaccine registration to predominantly Black ZIP codes and running public information campaigns, including the clergy vaccinations. The latest numbers show the gap is narrowing, but the southeastern core of the city's Black community is still getting vaccinated at the slowest rate.“There's distrust in our community. We can't ignore that,” said Rev. James Coleman of All Nations Baptist, who was vaccinated along with Smith. “The church, and particularly the Black church, is essential. ... That's what pastors do.”Coleman said he has worked to create a vaccine-positive atmosphere among the seniors in his church. Before a recent Sunday morning sermon, conducted via audio conference call , elderly parishioners in Coleman's church updated one another on their progress and congratulated those who had been vaccinated.“There was some nervousness to overcome at first,” Coleman said. "People outside the Black community sometimes can't relate to that sensitivity.”Health departments nationwide are dealing with the same challenges, and other jurisdictions also are calling on religious leaders to help dispel vaccine fears.“Our role as clergy and as faith-based leaders is to be optimistic and hopeful. We say to our people that these vaccines are the gift of life. We believe in the science,” said Rev. HB Holmes Jr. of Bethel Missionary Church in Tallahassee, Florida.Holmes has gotten vaccinated, and his church has hosted vaccination drives.“We knew that because of hesitation and reluctance that we needed trusted voices. So we brought together persons of great influence in Black and brown communities, particularly from our community, to say, you know, I’m going to take the vaccine and roll up our sleeves and do that publicly." he said.In Washington, the Pennsylvania Avenue Baptist Church has been designated a “faith-based vaccination partner,” with a portable vaccination trailer set up in the church's parking lot twice a week. The vaccinations have gone smoothly. But showing that vaccine skepticism transcends racial lines, a white D.C. resident, Kathy Boylan, crossed the city on a recent icy day to stand on the sidewalk outside the church with a sign saying “Danger: Covid Vaccine Say No!”The city's community influencer campaign is targeting more than just religious leaders.Prominent Black Washington figures such as Vice President Kamala Harris, local radio host Kojo Nnamdi and Doug Williams, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback for the Washington football team, have all received their injections at southeast Washington's United Medical Center and used their public platforms to encourage others to follow suit.“I honestly believe that more people want to take it than don’t,” said hospital official Toya Carmichael, who said several people have asked for the same nurse that vaccinated Harris.But some D.C. officials are insisting that simple cultural reluctance, while real, doesn't fully explain Washington's racial vaccination lag. Interviews with Black residents revealed a common set of complaints: seniors failing to navigate the online registration system or sitting on hold only to be informed that all appointments had been filled.Lisa Chapman had to overcome both personal reluctance and logistical obstacles in order to schedule vaccinations for her parents, Walter Coates, 82, and Rosa Coates, 80.First she had to persuade them.“I just wasn’t certain. I wanted to wait and see for a while,” said Rosa Coates. ”But (Lisa) convinced me. She just kept talking to me about it.”Then it took waiting on hold for more than 90 minutes, leaving the phone on speaker and then leaping back on when a human answered.“That's a really long time to wait. I think a lot of people do want to get it. They just can't get through,” Chapman said.D.C. Council Member Kenyan McDuffie laid part of the problem at the feet of the government. In an interview, McDuffie, who represents southeastern Ward 5, called the city's vaccine rollout “overwhelmingly inequitable” and said talk of vaccine reluctance was obscuring a reality of vaccine frustration, made worse by the digital divide.“I think there is a larger percentage of people who want to receive the vaccine and have had challenges with scheduling appointments and being able to receive the vaccine,” he said. "My fear is that some of those residents have simply given up."Smith, in his Valentine's Day sermon, spoke not just of the fear but also the logistical hassles of a confusing process."I know many of you have tried to get the vaccine, but there have been so many challenges ... waiting for hours, only to find that what you thought was available is not there,” he said.Given the community reluctance, city health officials say they cannot afford to frustrate or discourage those seeking vaccination.Nesbitt said a new registration model would go into effect in March that would bring a further “equity lens” to the vaccination process. Also, officials have organized teams of “senior vaccine buddies” to go to the homes of seniors and help them get through the online process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-taps-pastors-to-overcome-racial-divide-on-covid-19-vaccine-101613914615009.html
21-02-2021||World||WHO’s draft recommendation on Wuhan Covid-19 probe triggers disbelief: Report||The two key lines of inquiry recommended in the World Health Organisation’s preliminary report on the origin of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has caused surprise and disbelief among independent experts, according to a CNN report. A team of experts sent by the UN health agency returned from China’s Wuhan earlier this month after a four-week trip to investigate the origin of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.The WHO panel is set to recommend further contact tracing of the first known Covid-19 patient, also known as “patient zero”, and an immediate investigation into the supply chain of the Huanan seafood market. Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team that visited Wuhan, reportedly said that the first known patient had no connection to the Huanan seafood market, a place initially believed to be connected to the early virus outbreak.Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, told CNN it was implausible that such rudimentary investigative work wasn’t already done by Chinese scientists while looking for the origin of the virus months ago. "It's not realistic, given they have world-class scientists there, and the technology invested in over the last 20 years. They are sophisticated, they understand transmission pathways, and have been working on them for years," Miller was quoted by the US media network as saying.The team also discovered several signs of a much wider outbreak in December 2019 than it was reported earlier. WHO expert Peter Ben Embarek, who led the team in Wuhan, had earlier said in an interview that the investigators are seeking access to hundreds of thousands of blood samples from the Chinese city that Beijing has not allowed them to examine.The Chinese scientists presented the visiting WHO team with 174 Covid-19 cases detected from in and around Wuhan in December 2019, which, according to Embarek, suggested the virus could have infected more than 1,000 people in the Chinese city in that month, given the “vast majority are mild cases” that are not noticed by doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whos-draft-recommendation-on-wuhan-covid-19-probe-triggers-disbelief-report-101613914187310.html

21-02-2021||World||Texas freeze led to release of tons of air pollutants as refineries shut||The largest U.S. oil refiners released tons of air pollutants into the skies over Texas this week, according to figures provided to the state, as one environmental crisis triggered another.Refiners and petrochemical plants along the US Gulf Coast scrambled to shut production as an arctic air mass spread into a region unused to frigid temperatures.The extreme cold, which killed at least two dozen people in Texas and knocked out power to more than 4 million at its peak, also hit natural gas and electric generation, cutting supplies needed to run the plants.Shutdowns led to the refineries flaring, or burning and releasing gases, to prevent damage to their processing units. That flaring darkened the skies in eastern Texas with smoke visible for miles."These emissions can dwarf the usual emissions of the refineries by orders of magnitude," said Jane Williams, chair of the Sierra Club's National Clean Air Team.She said U.S. regulators must change policies that allow "these massive emissions to occur with impunity."TOP POLLUTERSThe five largest refiners emitted nearly 337,000 pounds of pollutants, including benzene, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, according to preliminary data supplied to the Texas Commission on Environment Quality (TCEQ).Valero Energy said in a filing with the TCEQ that it released 78,000 pounds over 24 hours beginning Feb. 15 from its Port Arthur refinery, citing the frigid cold and interruptions in utility services.The 118,100 pounds of emissions from Motiva's Port Arthur, Texas, refinery between Feb. 15 and Feb. 18 were more than three times the excess emissions that it declared to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the whole of 2019.Marathon Petroleum's Galveston Bay Refinery released 14,255 pounds over less than five hours on Feb. 15, equivalent to about 10% of its total releases above permitted levels in 2019.Exxon Mobil said its Baytown Olefins Plant emitted nearly one ton of benzene and 68,000 tons of carbon monoxide, citing in its disclosure the halting of "multiple process units and safe utilization of the flare system."Exxon blamed the shutdown of two Texas refineries on the freezing weather and loss of natural gas supplies. A spokesman said its petrochemical plants in Texas and Louisiana have supplied 560 megawatts to local communities, helping power about 300,000 homes.Valero did not have an immediate comment. Motiva and Marathon did not respond to requests for comment.Final figures on pollution releases are due to be submitted to the state in two weeks.'NO SAFE AMOUNT'The flaring continued through the week as refiners kept plants out of service."We had six or seven flares going at one time," Hilton Kelly, who lives in Port Arthur, home to refineries operated by Motiva, Valero and Total SE, said on Friday. "It's still happening now."Sharon Wilson, a researcher at advocacy group Earthworks, said the releases are alarming, in part because "there is no safe amount of benzene for human exposure."State data showing oil and gas producers were flaring methane this week "is just making things worse, and it could have been prevented" by winterizing facilities, she said.Texas oil and gas companies filed 174 notices of pollution releases above permitted levels between Feb. 11 and Feb. 18, four times the number the prior week, according to TCEQ data.Total pollution at Houston-area facilities during the cold snap totaled approximately 703,000 pounds, about 3% of the total pollution over permitted amounts for all of 2019 and almost 10% of 2018's releases, according to TCEQ data analyzed by advocacy group Environment Texas.(Reporting by Laura Sanicola in New York and Erwin Seba in Houston; Editing by Gary McWilliams and Daniel Wallis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-freeze-led-to-release-of-tons-of-air-pollutants-as-refineries-shut-101613913606140.html

Israel's military said it was deploying thousands of soldiers to help with the effort. Authorities warned everyone else to keep their distance until further notice.Environmental groups called it an disaster. Attesting to the cost to wildlife, they posted pictures of tar-covered turtles.The event began last week during a winter storm, which made it harder to see the tar approaching and deal with it at sea, Israeli officials said.Together with European agencies, Israel was looking as a possible source at a Feb. 11 oil spill from a ship passing about 50 km (21 miles) from shore. Satellite images and modelling of wave movements were helping to narrow the search.Nine ships that were in the area at the time are being looked at, said Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel."There is a more than reasonable chance that we will be able to locate the specific ship," she told Ynet TV.If found, Israel could take legal action. One course would be to sue insurance companies for compensation to help deal with the ecological fallout, she said, which could cost tens of millions of shekels.Late last week a 17-metre-long (55ft) fin whale was found washed up on a beach in southern Israel. The Nature and Parks Authority said on Sunday that an autopsy had found oil-based material in the whale's body, with further tests pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-beaches-blackened-by-tar-after-offshore-oil-spill-101613913325655.html
21-02-2021||World||Huge crowds in Myanmar undeterred by worst day of violence||Huge crowds marched in Myanmar on Sunday to denounce a Feb. 1 military coup in a show of defiance after the bloodiest episode of the campaign for democracy the previous day, when security forces fired on protesters, killing two.The military has been unable to quell the demonstrations and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes against the coup and the detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others, even with a promise of new elections and stern warnings against dissent.Tens of thousands of people massed peacefully in the second city of Mandalay, where Saturday's killings took place, witnesses said."They aimed at the heads of unarmed civilians. They aimed at our future," a young protester told the crowd.Military spokesman Zaw Min Tun has not responded to attempts by Reuters to contact him by telephone for comment.He told a news conference on Tuesday the army's actions were within the constitution and supported by most people, and he blamed protesters for instigating violence.In the main city of Yangon, thousands of mostly young people gathered at different sites to chant slogans and sing."Us young people have our dreams but this military coup has created so many obstacles," said Ko Pay in Yangon. "That's why we come out to the front of the protests."In Myitkyina in the north, people laid flowers for the dead protesters. Big crowds marched in the central towns of Monywa and Bagan, in Dawei and Myeik in the south, Myawaddy in the east and Lashio in the northeast, posted pictures showed.At the tourist spot of Inle Lake, people including Buddhist monks took to a flotilla of boats holding aloft portraits of Suu Kyi and signs saying "military coup - end".The more than two weeks of protests had been largely peaceful until Saturday, unlike previous episodes of opposition during nearly half a century of direct military rule to 2011.The violence looked unlikely to end the agitation."The number of people will increase ... We won't stop," protester Yin Nyein Hmway said in Yangon.'AGGRESSIVE PROTESTERS'The trouble in Mandalay began with confrontations between the security forces and striking shipyard workers.Video clips on social media showed members of the security forces firing at protesters and witnesses said they found the spent cartridges of live rounds.U.N. Special Rapporteur for Myanmar Tom Andrews said he was horrified by the deaths of the two, one of them a teenaged boy."From water cannons to rubber bullets to tear gas and now hardened troops firing point blank at peaceful protesters. This madness must end, now," he said on Twitter.The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said the strikers sabotaged boats at the city's river port and attacked police with sticks, knives and catapults. Eight policemen and several soldiers were injured, it said."Some of the aggressive protesters were also injured due to the security measures conducted by the security force in accordance with the law," the newspaper said without mentioning the deaths.Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) condemned the violence by security forces in Mandalay as a crime against humanity.A young woman protester, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, became the first death among the demonstrators on Friday. She was shot in the head on Feb. 9 in the capital Naypyitaw.Hundreds of people attended her funeral on Sunday.Military media said the bullet that killed her did not come from any gun used by police and so must have been fired by an "external weapon".The army says one policeman has died of injuries sustained in a protest.'COORDINATING HARM'The army seized power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections that the NLD swept, detaining Suu Kyi and others. The electoral commission dismissed the fraud complaints.Facebook deleted the military's main page for repeated violations of its standards "prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm" and Western countries that condemned the coup decried the violence.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was "deeply concerned".France, Singapore, Britain and Germany also condemned the violence while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said lethal force was unacceptable.The United States, Britain and others have announced limited sanctions, focusing on military leaders, but the generals have long shrugged off foreign pressure.Suu Kyi faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Her next court appearance is on March 1.A rights group said 569 people have been detained in connection with the coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-crowds-in-myanmar-undeterred-by-worst-day-of-violence-101613913313865.html
21-02-2021||World||UK accelerates vaccine rollout as end of lockdown in sight||The UK government on Sunday vowed to offer a first coronavirus vaccine dose to every adult by the end of July, as it readied to announce a gradual easing of its third lockdown in England.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will outline the lockdown review in parliament on Monday, said the faster inoculation campaign would seek to offer a first dose to everyone aged over 50 by mid-April.The previous targets in the world-first campaign were to inoculate over 50s by May, and all adults by September."We will now aim to offer a jab to every adult by the end of July, helping us protect the most vulnerable sooner, and take further steps to ease some of the restrictions," Johnson said, while stressing the exit would be "cautious and phased".Britain, one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 120,000 deaths, was also the first nation to begin a mass vaccination campaign, in December.More than 17 million people have now received at least a first dose -- one-third of the UK population.But with infection rates and hospitalisations soaring after an easing of restrictions over Christmas, the government imposed a third lockdown at the start of January, closing schools, non-essential businesses and hospitality venues across England.Case numbers are falling again and early evidence suggests the vaccinations are helping to reduce serious illness, while political pressure is building on the government to return to normality.Johnson was meeting with senior ministers on Sunday to finalise his House of Commons statement, which is expected to endorse the reopening of English schools on March 8 -- although teaching unions say allowing all pupils to return on the same day is "reckless".- 'Last lockdown' -Johnson is expected to lay out a gradual easing more widely after March 8, including for outdoor activities. But the full reopening of retail and pubs, and attendance at sporting events, will be delayed until later."All of us understandably want to go back to normal, but it is right to be cautious," Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News on Sunday, noting that nearly 20,000 people remain in hospital with Covid.Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour party, said he disagreed with the teaching unions' opposition but urged the government to widen extra-hours access so that children can catch up ahead of summer exams."We all want this to be the last lockdown so we've got to come out of it in a measured way, but make sure we are not back where we started in a number of weeks or months," he added on Sky News.The devolved governments of Scotland and Wales, which administer their own health policy, are letting some younger pupils return to school this week. In Northern Ireland, the administration is resuming younger classes on March 8 but has extended its overall lockdown to April 1.- 'Risk of resurgence' -John Edmunds, an epidemiologist and government advisor from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: "The vast majority of us are still not immune."Easing up too quickly will increase pressure, cases will increase again. We're not through this yet."Edmunds also called for the acceleration of vaccine trials on children, stressing "there is significant risk of a resurgence" until the entire population is inoculated, not just adults.The government and expert advisors are also watching carefully for the emergence of new Covid variants, such as ones first detected in Brazil and South Africa, which may be more resistant to vaccines.Hancock's health ministry said Sunday it was introducing mass testing in an area of Essex, east of London, after a single case of the South Africa variant was confirmed there.The UK's predominant strain is one that emerged in the southeast county of Kent last September and then spread rapidly, after the first wave of Covid had waned.jit/tgb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-accelerates-vaccine-rollout-as-end-of-lockdown-in-sight-101613913096224.html
21-02-2021||World||Prince Charles visits father Prince Philip in London hospital||Britain’s Prince Charles was driven to the London hospital where his father, Prince Philip, was admitted for “precautionary” reasons earlier in the week and spent half an hour by his bedside.Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has been at the King Edward VII's hospital since Tuesday and according to the BBC, the 99-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II is likely to remain there into next week.A sombre-looking Charles, 72, was seen entering the hospital wearing a facemask on Saturday and his Clarence House office later said that the Prince of Wales was then driven back to his Highgrove residence in Gloucestershire, south-west England.The exact reason for Prince Philip’s admission has not been disclosed but his stay is not related to coronavirus.He and the Queen had received their first dose of a vaccine to protect against Covid-19 last month.Under England's current coronavirus lockdown rules, visiting someone in a hospital is considered a "reasonable excuse" to leave home, although visits are being allowed on a case by case basis by most hospitals.The Queen, 94, remains at Windsor Castle and performed her first face-to-face event of the year on Thursday, when she knighted a royal aide during a private socially-distanced ceremony at her south-east England residence in Berkshire.Earlier, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had sent his best wishes to the royal, with a Downing Street spokesperson saying: “The Prime Minister sends his best wishes to the Duke of Edinburgh as he undergoes a few days of rest in hospital.”The Queen and her husband have been spending the recent lockdown in England at Windsor Castle with a small household staff, nicknamed “HMS Bubble”.The Duke, who turns 100 in June, was admitted to the same London hospital as a "precautionary measure" for treatment for a "pre-existing condition" in December 2019. He spent four nights in hospital at the time.In November 2020, the Queen and Prince Philip marked their 73rd wedding anniversary by releasing a photograph of themselves opening a card made for them by their great grandchildren, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis – the children of Prince William and Kate Middleton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-charles-visits-father-prince-philip-in-london-hospital-101613912828196.html
21-02-2021||World||French city of Nice asks tourists to stay away amid Covid-19 surge||(Adds government spokesman)PARIS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The mayor of Nice in southern France called on Sunday for a weekend lockdown in the area to reduce the flow of tourists as it battles a sharp spike in coronavirus infections to triple the national rate.The Nice area has France's highest Covid-19 infection rate, with 740 new cases per week per 100,000 residents, according to Covidtracker.fr."We need strong measures that go beyond the nationwide 6 p.m. curfew, either tighter curfew, or a partial and time-specific lockdown. A weekend lockdown would make sense," Mayor Christian Estrosi said on franceinfo radio.Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Saturday the government would decide this weekend on tightening virus control measures in the Mediterranean city.Before ordering a second national lockdown in November, the government imposed curfews some cities and closed restaurants in Marseille, but it has generally refrained from regional measures due to protest from local politicians and businesses."We do not rule out local lockdowns," government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on LCI television.He added that the trend in new cases was not good in recent days and that there was no case for loosening curfew."The weather is nice, everybody rushes to come here. A weekend lockdown would put a stop to that, without halting economic activity in the city," Estrosi said.Estrosi said infection rates had leapt due to the massive inflow of tourists over the Christmas holiday. International flights to the city had jumped from 20 a day before Christmas to 120 over the holiday - all this without people having virus tests in their country of origin or on arrival."We will be happy to receive lots of tourists this summer, once we win this battle, but it is better to have a period while we say 'do not come here, this is not the moment'. Protecting the people of Nice is my priority," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-city-of-nice-asks-tourists-to-stay-away-amid-covid-19-surge-101613912824826.html

21-02-2021||World||Still no details from Tanzania on its Covid-19 response: WHO chief||The head of the World Health Organization urged Tanzania on Sunday to share information on its measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, saying the authorities there had repeatedly ignored his requests.President John Magufuli's sceptical approach towards Covid-19 has caused alarm among WHO officials. A government spokesman told Reuters on Feb.12 that Tanzania had "controlled" the outbreak, but it stopped reporting new coronavirus infections and deaths in May last year. At the time it had registered 509 cases and 21 deaths.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sunday that Tanzanians testing positive for Covid-19 abroad underscored "the need for Tanzania to take robust action both to safeguard their own people and protect populations in these countries and beyond."Tedros also repeated a call he made with Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's Africa head, in late January for Tanzania to bolster public health measures against Covid-19 and prepare to distribute vaccines.He added that since then he had spoken with several authorities there to no avail."This situation remains very concerning. I renew my call for Tanzania to start reporting Covid-19 cases and share data," Tedros said in a statement on WHO's website.Tanzania government spokesman Hassan Abbasi did not respond to a Reuters message seeking comment on Tedros' remarks.In a statement later on Sunday, Magufuli's office said the president wanted Tanzanians to follow measures to protect themselves against coronavirus. However, it also said that:"Magufuli wants Tanzanians to ... trust and put God first, given that wearing masks, social distancing and lockdowns have been seen to be insufficient as countries that implemented them have lost thousands compared to Tanzania."Magufuli attended a funeral service on Friday for a senior official in his office whose cause of death was not made public, and declared three days of national prayer.On Sunday, Magufuli said Tanzanians should wear only use locally-made face masks, saying foreign-made ones may be unsafe.On Monday, Oman's health minister said his country was considering suspending flights from Tanzania, after 18% of travellers arriving from Tanzania tested positive for Covid-19.Thailand reported on Monday its first case of the highly contagious Covid-19 variant first identified in South Africa, in a Thai man who arrived from Tanzania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/still-no-details-from-tanzania-on-its-covid-19-response-who-chief-101613906715419.html

The second shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) under the name Covishield, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in the capital city of Kathmandu on Sunday afternoon.Earlier, India had provided one million doses of the Covishield vaccine as ‘gift’ (free of cost) to the Himalayan nation in January after which Nepal had kicked off its vaccination drive on January 27 with doses being administered to the medical and frontline workers on a priority basis. The campaign aims to eventually inoculate 72 per cent of its total population of over 29 million. The government is now working towards administering doses to those above the age of 55 from March.Nepal: One million doses of made in India vaccines purchased by the Government of Nepal arrived at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu today. pic.twitter.com/e76193HGxQNepal’s health and population minister Hridayesh Tripathi had told Reuters on Thursday that the government was purchasing the AstraZeneca shots for $4 each. “We have received a good price... we must not miss this opportunity to purchase it,” Tripathi added.Nepal has recorded 2,73,351 cases of Covid-19 till now out of which 2,061 people have died while nearly 270,000 have recovered, according to worldometers.info figures.

I have suffered great financial loss," said Ali Fatullah, a fruit seller in the town of Bekasi on the outskirts of Jakarta.He said furniture and electronic devices were damaged by the water.Kurnianto said some 1,700 people remained in shelters, though many residents had started returning to their homes.Floodwaters had hit 200 neighbourhoods in the region, and 40 were still under at least one foot of water on Sunday.Jakarta saw some of its deadliest floods in years in January last year after downpours that also triggered landslides.At least 67 people in the capital and nearby cities were killed in that disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/severe-floods-kill-five-in-indonesia-s-capital-jakarta-says-report-101613905024641.html
21-02-2021||World||Israel's Covid-19 vaccination pass opens fast track to normal life||Israel reopened swathes of its economy including malls and leisure facilities on Sunday, with the government saying the start of a return to routine was enabled by Covid-19 vaccines administered to almost half the population.Shops were open to all. But access to gyms, hotels and theatres was limited to people with a "Green Pass": those who have had both doses of the vaccine more than a week prior, or recovered from the disease with presumed immunity.Pass-holders could prove their status by presenting a vaccination certificate or downloading a Health Ministry app linked to their medical files.Coming exactly a year after Israel's first documented coronavirus case, Sunday's easing of curbs was part of a government plan to open the economy more widely next month, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is up for reelection."We are the first country in the world that is reviving itself thanks to the millions of vaccines we brought in," he tweeted. "Vaccinated? Get the Green Pass and get back to life."Mask-wearing and social-distancing were still in force. Dancing was barred at banquet halls. Synagogues, mosques or churches were required to halve their normal congregation sizes.Elementary schoolchildren and pupils in the last two years of high school resumed classes in towns with contagion rates under control. Middle-school pupils were still home-learning, however, prompting some to stage a sit-down protest in a mall."I haven't been in school in a year," said 14-year-old demonstrator Rotem Bachar. "How does it make sense to open malls up to crowds, while we can't attend class if even they are capped at 15 to 20 pupils and have other precautions?"Israel has administered at least one dose of the Pfizer Inc vaccine to more than 46% of its 9 million population, the Health Ministry says. The ministry said on Saturday that the risk of illness from Covid-19 dropped 95.8% among people who received both shots.Israel has logged more than 740,000 cases and 5,500 deaths from Covid-19, drawing criticism of Netanyahu's sometimes patchy enforcement of three national lockdowns. The government has pledged that there will not be a fourth.But Nachman Ash, a physician in charge of the country's pandemic response, told Army Radio that another lockdown "is still possible ... Half of the population is still not immune."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-covid-19-vaccination-pass-opens-fast-track-to-normal-life-101613905584676.html
21-02-2021||World||Israel buys Covid-19 vaccines for Syria to secure release of prisoner: Reports||Israel paid Russia $1.2 million to provide the Syrian government with coronavirus vaccine doses as part of a deal that secured the release of an Israeli woman held captive in Damascus, according to Israeli media reports.The terms of the clandestine trade-off orchestrated by Moscow between the two enemy nations remained murky. But the fact that Israel is providing vaccines to Syria — an enemy country hosting hostile Iranian forces — has drawn criticism at home. It has also drawn attention to Israel’s refusal to provide significant quantities to millions of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Speaking at a news conference Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “not one Israeli vaccine” was involved in the deal. But he did not address the issue of whether Israel paid for Russian vaccines, and he said Russia insisted on keeping details of the swap secret.The Prime Minister’s Office has declined further comment.Israel announced Friday it had reached a Russian-mediated deal to bring home a young woman who had crossed the border into neighboring Syria earlier this month. In exchange, Israel said it had released two Syrian shepherds who had entered Israeli territory.As part of the prisoner swap mediated by Moscow, Israel paid Russia to supply Syria with an undisclosed number of doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, according to Israeli media reports. The Russian Direct Investment Fund, which bankrolled the development of Sputnik V, said in November it will cost less than $10 per dose on international markets.In turn, Syria released an Israeli citizen who entered the country illegally and Israel returned two Syrian shepherds that had entered the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, according to the reports.The Syrian state news agency has denied the existence of such a deal.The released Israeli woman returned to Israel via Moscow and was questioned by Israel’s Shin Bet internal security agency. The 25-year-old woman hails from the predominantly ultra-Orthodox town of Modiin Ilit and had previously attempted to cross Israel’s borders with the Gaza Strip and Jordan, according to Israeli media.The woman reportedly crossed into Syrian territory from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981, a move not widely recognized internationally.Her identity and motivation for crossing into Syria were not released by Israeli officials.Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu ally who is now running to unseat him in upcoming Israeli elections, said Sunday the government’s “censorship of something that Damascus and Moscow know about, and Israeli citizens don’t, is incomprehensible.”Israel and Syria remain in an official state of war and Israeli citizens are officially prohibited from visiting Syria. Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Iranian-linked targets in the country since the start of its civil war a decade ago. Israel considers Iranian entrenchment on its northern frontier to be a red line and has repeatedly struck Iran-linked facilities and weapons convoys destined for Hezbollah.At the same time that Israel has paid for Syria to receive Covid-19 vaccines, the government has refused to provide large quantities of vaccines to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, drawing outcry from human rights organizations.The disparities have drawn criticism from UN officials and rights groups, and have shined a light on the inequities between rich and poor countries getting access to vaccines.These groups contend that Israel is responsible for vaccinating the Palestinians in the occupied territories. Israel has argued that under the Oslo Accords signed with the Palestinians in the 1990s, the Palestinian Authority must see to vaccinating its own population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-buys-vaccines-for-syria-to-secure-release-of-prisoner-reports-101613904682496.html

21-02-2021||World||Niger voters return to polls in second round for president||Polls opened Sunday morning in Niger for the second round of voting in the country's presidential elections, after none of the 28 candidates won an absolute majority in December's vote.Former foreign affairs minister Mohamed Bazoum, who received about 39 per cent of the vote in the first round, is running against former president Mahamane Ousmane, who won nearly 17 per cent of the vote, according to the National Independent Electoral Commission.The winner of Sunday's vote will succeed President Mahamadou Issoufou who is stepping down after serving two terms, in accordance with Niger's constitution.Issoufou's decision to respect the constitution has been widely hailed and paves the way for Niger's first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since its independence from France in 1960. The West African nation has seen four coups.Issoufou's chosen successor is Bazoum, 71, a longtime Cabinet minister who is from Niger's small ethnic Arab minority.Of Niger's 23 million people, some 7.4 million are registered to vote. In the parliamentary and presidential elections which took place on December 27 turnout was approximately 67 per cent.Niger's next president will have to deal with major problems, including rising attacks linked to Islamic extremists. In January at least 100 people were killed when extremists attacked two villages near the border with Mali.Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced despite the presence of thousands of regional and international troops.”(There's) a significant risk that extremist groups will launch attacks to disrupt the poll,” said Alexandre Raymakers, senior Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk consultancy.While the new administration is unlikely to achieve rapid success against these groups, a peaceful transition of power would be a strong sign to western countries to continue supporting Niger's counter-terrorism operations, he said.The candidates are trying to entice voters through various campaign promises.A teacher by training, Bazoum who is of the ruling Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism, has promised to build boarding schools for girls to encourage them to remain in school longer, which he said would help reduce child marriage in a country with many teenage pregnancies.But peace is what locals say they really want from the country's next leader.“The new president needs to focus on our security at the borders and in our cities,” said Abdou Razak, a resident of the capital, Niamey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/niger-voters-return-to-polls-in-second-round-for-president-101613902131892.html
21-02-2021||World||Pak judge lashes out at SC order barring him from hearing cases against Imran||Pakistan Supreme Court Justice Qazi Faez Isa has called the apex court's order of barring him from hearing matters on Prime Minister Imran Khan as an attempt to undermine the judiciary.According to a report by The News International, Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Gulzar Ahmed on February 11 had issued orders restraining Justice Qazi Faez Isa from hearing matters involving the Prime Minister.On Saturday, Justice Qazi Faez Isa said that the order was pronounced without even consulting his colleagues on the bench.According to The News International, the Justice further said that without informing the two-member bench, which was already hearing the matter, it was ordered to reconstitute the bench, expand it and exclude Justice Maqbool Baqar from it."The order was sent to a junior judge while the said judge, his senior, was bypassed," Justice Faez Isa said.He further said, "Paragraph 6 of the order is unconstitutional as it was not passed under any of the different jurisdictions of the Supreme Court stipulated in the Constitution".He also said that the order of the court was not written, not signed and was uploaded on the Supreme Court website before a judge had seen it, let alone had the opportunity to agree/disagree with it, The News International reported."What commenced as an attempt to prevent corrupt practices and bribery ended with a Judge being rebuked and restrained," Justice Faez Isa said."It is about something far more important; the Constitution, the people's rights and their monies," he said.The News International reported that the judge said that the prime minister's reported statement had said that money from the public purse would be disbursed for apparent political patronage at a time when the Senate elections were on the horizon, therefore, notice was issued by the two-member bench, however without a proper determination, and without ascertainment of the veracity and effect of the documents, the matter was abruptly disposed of.The Judge concluded his letter by saying, "In conclusion, I must say that it has been extremely painful for me to write this order. I apologise if anything herein has hurt or offended as that has not been my intention.

But UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Sunday that “we now think that we have the supplies” to speed up the vaccination campaign.More than 17.2 million people have been given the first of two doses of vaccine since the UK inoculation campaign began on December 8.The news comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets with senior ministers Sunday to finalise a “road map” out of that national lockdown that is due to be announced on Monday.Britain has had more than 120,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-speeds-up-covid-19-vaccinations-aims-all-adults-by-july-31-101613902288716.html
21-02-2021||World||Decision ending snap inspections by IAEA does not breach 2015 nuclear deal: Iran||Iran's decision to end snap inspections by UN inspectors on Feb. 23 would not mean abandoning its 2015 nuclear deal, but the United States must still lift sanctions on Tehran to rescue the pact, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday."All our steps (to breach the deal) are reversible...The move on Feb. 23 is not abandoning the deal," Zarif said in a televised interview with Iran's English Language Press TV.Under a law enacted by hardline Iranian lawmakers last year, the government is obliged on Feb. 23 to limit IAEA inspections to declared nuclear sites only, revoking its short-notice access to any location seen as relevant for information-gathering, if other parties did not fully comply with the deal.President Joe Biden's administration said on Thursday it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the accord, which aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons while lifting most international sanctions. Former President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran.But Iran and the United States have been at odds over who should take the first step to revive the accord. Iran insists the United States must first lift U.S. sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.Zarif reiterated Iran's stance that Washington should take the first step by lifting all sanctions, if it wants to revive the accord."The United States must return to the deal and lift all sanctions ... The United States is addicted to sanctions but they should know that Iran will not yield to pressure," he said. "We are not seeking nuclear weapons."Zarif also said that "for all practical purposes" the Biden administration is pursuing the same policy of "maximum pressure" as Trump.Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency who is in Tehran to discuss the agency's "essential verification activities" met on Sunday with Iran´s atomic chief, state media reported.Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, said on Saturday that the agency's concerns over Iran's ending the implementation of the IAEA's Additional Protocol - which entails snap inspections - will be discussed during his meeting with Grossi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decision-ending-snap-inspections-by-iaea-does-not-breach-2015-nuclear-deal-iran-101613901577505.html

This move was met with large scale public resistance. Protestors had gathered at major cities and held demonstrations against the junta rule.During one such protest on Saturday in the city of Mandalay, the armed forces opened fire on the public causing chaos amidst the crowd. Two people were killed in the firing, according to reports. Many international agencies and governments, including the United Nations, have condemned the use of force by the military.Also read | Myanmar protesters' resolve strengthens following death of activistsHere is what has happened in Myanmar since the military’s coup:1. On February 1, 2021, the military took control of governance for a period of one year. A statement from them said “The voter lists which were used during the multi-party general election which was held on the 8th of November were found to have huge discrepancies and the Union Election Commission failed to settle this matter,” Reuters reported.2. The ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) leader Aung San Suu Kyi was detained along with other national leaders. The military promised to return their powers after a free and fair election.3. After minor protests by the citizens initially, the military on February 9, 2021, issued orders prohibiting public demonstrations in some areas of Yangon and Mandalay cities and warned of action against protestors, the Associated Press reported. Many people gathered in the streets in defiance of the rules, demanding restoration of power to the elected government.4. Internet services were cut off by the military several times to hinder the protests. Facebook on Sunday took down the military’s “Tatmadaw True News Information Team Page.”5. The UN has adopted a resolution against the military coup, demanding the immediate return of power to the government. The US government too had issued sanctions against Myanmar on February 12, according to a Reuters report. Many countries, including India, Japan and Australia have called for the return of democracy in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-on-after-2-demonstrators-shot-dead-in-myanmar-what-has-happened-so-far-101613901296841.html

We want to have a strong neighborhood.”The UAE and Bahrain last year normalized their ties with Israel in a historic shift for the Middle East as the Jewish state achieves official legitimacy and broad commercial ties in the heart of the Persian Gulf. Underpinning the rapprochement was a shared distrust of Iran, its nuclear program and its growing influence in the Middle East through a network of militant proxies.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last year the UAE’ decision to normalize ties with Israel was a betrayal of the Arab and Muslim worlds and unlikely to last.“If they believe they can buy security from Netanyahu, they can be my guest,” Zarif said on Sunday, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-ready-for-talks-with-arab-states-without-preconditions-101613900334187.html

They could've been. It costs money, and the trade off was made, and it didn't work out, and it's tragic that it has lead to people dying," Gates told CNN late on Saturday.Snowfalls, sub-zero temperatures and biting wind continue to test the United States' southwest and Texas, in particular, for a few weeks now. Earlier on Saturday, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesperson Tiffany Young told Sputnik that nearly 15 million local residents were affected by the cold-caused disruption of water supply systems. Tens of thousands of households are still without electricity.

Lignadis, 56, was being held pending an appearance before a magistrate.According to media reports, at least three people have made allegations against Lignadis, including a 25-year-old man who accused him of having raped him in 2010.Lignadis has denied the accusations.Rumors of his alleged sexual misconduct swelled in recent weeks, leading to Lignadis' resignation two weeks ago as artistic director of Greece's National Theater, a post he had held since 2019.Revelations earlier this year by an Olympic gold medalist that she had been raped by a sailing federation official back in 1998 have sparked a #MeToo movement reckoning in Greece.People have come forward to accuse well-known figures in the entertainment of sexual harassment, assault and rape. Well-known actors and directors have come under fire, but Lignadis is the first to be arrested.The case has taken on political dimensions. The political opposition accused the Greek government of failing to follow up on complaints, while the culture minister responded Friday by accusing Lignadis of being a “dangerous man” who had “deceived” her with his acting ability.Culture Minister Lina Mendoni said she asked a Supreme Court prosecutor to investigate all abuse allegations in Greece's theater community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-greek-actor-director-arrested-charged-with-rape-101613898289383.html

21-02-2021||World||'I thought we were done': Parts fall from sky in plane scare||David Delucia was settling back into his airplane seat and starting to relax on his way to a long-awaited vacation when a huge explosion and flash of light interrupted an in-flight announcement and put him in survival mode.The Boeing 777-200, headed from Denver to Honolulu on Saturday with 231 passengers and 10 crew aboard, suffered a catastrophic failure in its right engine and flames erupted under the wing as the plane began to lose altitude.As Delucia and his wife prepared for the worst, people in this Denver suburb reacted in horror as huge pieces of the engine casing and chunks of fiberglass rained down on a sports fields and on streets and lawns, just missing one home and crushing a truck. The explosion, visible from the ground, left a trail of black smoke in the sky, and tiny pieces of insulation filled the air like ash.The plane landed safely at Denver International Airport, and no one on board or on the ground was hurt, authorities said. But both those in the air and on the ground were deeply shaken.“When it initially happened, I thought we were done. I thought we were going down,” said Delucia, who stuffed his wallet in his pocket so he could be easily identified if the plane did go down. “The pilot did an amazing job. It was pretty unnerving.”The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the airplane experienced a right-engine failure shortly after takeoff.Video posted on Twitter showed the engine fully engulfed in flames as the plane flew through the air. Freeze frames from different video taken by a passenger sitting slightly in front of the engine and posted on Twitter appeared to show a broken fan blade in the engine.Incredible footage of UA 328 flight whose right engine caught fire soon after takeoff. The 777 safely landed back at Denver Airport. A passenger captured the moment. pic.twitter.com/WWAKrou2V9The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. Authorities have not released any details about what may have caused the failure.United said in a separate statement that most passengers on United Flight 328 were rebooked on a new flight to Hawaii, but some chose to stay in a hotel overnight instead.The Broomfield Police Department posted photos on Twitter showing large, circular pieces of debris that appeared to be the engine cowling leaning against a house in the suburb about 16 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver. Police asked anyone injured on the ground to come forward.Tyler Thal, who lives in the area, told The Associated Press that he was out for a walk with his family when he noticed a large commercial plane flying unusually low and took out his phone to film it.“While I was looking at it, I saw an explosion and then the cloud of smoke and some debris falling from it. It was just like a speck in the sky, and as I’m watching that, I’m telling my family what I just saw and then we heard the explosion,” he said in a phone interview. “The plane just kind of continued on, and we didn’t see it after that.”Kirby Klements was inside with his wife when they heard a huge booming sound, he said. A few seconds later, the couple saw a massive piece of debris fly past their window and into the bed of Klements' truck, crushing the cab and pushing the vehicle into the dirt.He estimated the circular engine cowling at 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. Fine pieces of the fiberglass insulation used in the airplane engine fell from the sky “like ash” for about 10 minutes, he said, and several large chunks of insulation landed in his backyard.“If it had been 10 feet different, it would have landed right on top of the house,” he said in a phone interview with the AP. “And if anyone had been in the truck, they would have been dead.”Based on initial photos and videos posted by passengers, aviation safety experts said the plane appeared to have suffered an uncontained and catastrophic engine failure.Such an event is extremely rare and happens when huge spinning pieces inside the engine suffer some sort of failure and breach an armored casing around the engine that is designed to contain the damage, said John Cox, an aviation safety expert and retired airline pilot who runs an aviation safety consulting firm called Safety Operating Systems.“That unbalanced disk has a lot of force in it, and it’s spinning at several thousand rotations per minute ... and when you have that much centrifugal force, it has to go somewhere,” he said in a phone interview.Pilots practice how to deal with such an event frequently and would have immediately shut off anything flammable in the engine, including fuel and hydraulic fluid, using a single switch, Cox said.Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall called the incident another example of “cracks in our culture in aviation safety (that) need to be addressed."Hall, who was on the board from 1994 to 2001, has criticized the FAA over the past decade as “drifting toward letting the manufacturers provide the aviation oversight that the public was paying for.” That goes especially for Boeing, he said.The last fatality on a U.S. airline flight involved such an engine failure on a Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas in April 2018. A passenger was killed when the engine disintegrated more than 30,000 feet above Pennsylvania and debris struck the plane, breaking the window next to her seat. She was forced halfway out the window before other passengers pulled her back inside.In that case, the breakdown was blamed on a broken fan blade in an engine of the Boeing 737. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to step up inspections of fan blades on certain engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France’s Safran S.A.In 2010, a Qantas Airbus A380 suffered a frightening uncontained engine failure shortly after takeoff from Singapore. Shrapnel from the engine damaged critical systems on the plane, but pilots were able to land safely. The incident was blamed on the faulty manufacturing of a pipe in the Rolls Royce engine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-thought-we-were-done-parts-fall-from-sky-in-plane-scare-101613897414573.html
21-02-2021||World||Head of UN nuclear watchdog meets Iran nuclear chief in Tehran||The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog met Sunday with Iran’s atomic chief ahead of plans to partly suspend United Nations inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities, state TV reported.Iran’s parliament in December approved a bill that would suspend part of U.N. inspections of its nuclear facilities under a 2015 nuclear deal if European signatories do not provide relief from oil and banking sanctions by Feb 23. It would also halt the implementation of an additional protocol that allows the IAEA inspectors to carry out more intrusive inspections to Iran’s nuclear facilities.Following the 2015 deal, Iran voluntarily agreed to implement the additional protocol.On Saturday, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Iran’s nuclear department, said he and Rafael Grossi would meet Sunday to discuss the U.N. agency’s concerns over the halt of the inspections as well as Iran’s cooperation with the agency.The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week the visit was aimed at finding “a mutually agreeable solution for the IAEA to continue essential verification activities in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/head-of-un-nuclear-watchdog-meets-iran-nuclear-chief-in-tehran-101613897462057.html
21-02-2021||World||UK to speed Covid-19 vaccine program, to offer shots to all adults by July-end||The U.K. will significantly accelerate its Covid-19 vaccination program, offering shots to all adults by the end of July and everyone over 50 by mid-April as the government beefs up efforts to contain one of the world’s worst outbreaks of the coronavirus.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out the new targets on Monday when he reveals his “roadmap” to easing lockdowns. It is the first time the government has given a firm target for offering all adults their initial dose, having previously said it hoped to do so by autumn. The previous goal set for over-50s was the end of May. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky TV Sunday the U.K. had enough supply to meet the new targets.So far, more than 17 million people have been inoculated, around 30% of the adult population, making Britain a world leader in Covid vaccinations. The success of the program contrasts with the government’s failure to contain the initial outbreak and spread of Covid-19. The U.K. now has Europe’s highest death toll with more than 120,000 victims of the pandemic.The U.K. is now more than a month into its third national lockdown with schools closed and most businesses shuttered. With the economy suffering its worst recession in more than 300 years and cases and deaths falling rapidly, the prime minister is under growing pressure to lift lockdown curbs. Johnson, who was hospitalized with Covid-19 in April of last year, insists he will proceed with caution to make sure the current lockdown is the country’s last.Cases surged to record levels in the U.K. early this year as an easing of social distancing during the holiday period coincided with the spread of the highly-infectious U.K. variant. The latest lockdown, coupled with the vaccine program, has reversed that trend. Health authorities reported 10,406 new cases on Saturday, down from the peak week in January when cases averaged almost 60,000 a day.Going forward, Johnson is planning to complement the rapid-fire vaccination program with mass testing in workplaces, schools, shopping centers and theaters to help chart Britain’s way out of the pandemic crisis.Johnson said Britain had already achieved a significant milestone recording 15 million vaccinations by Feb. 15 to meet the government’s initial target, but the rollout needs to “go further and faster in the coming weeks.“But there should be no doubt -- the route out of lockdown will be cautious and phased, as we all continue to protect ourselves and those around us,” he said in an emailed statement.The government has yet to outline how it will roll out vaccinations to the under-50s and whether it will stick to age as the dominant criteria or prioritize other groups, such as critical workers including police and firefighters and teachers.Jonathan Ashworth, a Labour member of parliament and shadow health secretary, said the government needs to prioritize by occupation in the next rollout phase or explain why it can’t.“It’s perfectly reasonable for teachers, police officers and other key workers who haven’t been able to stay at home in the lockdown to ask when their turn will be,” he said in an emailed statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-speed-covid-19-vaccine-program-to-offer-shots-to-all-adults-by-julyend-101613897359129.html

A funeral was also held for a young woman killed earlier by police.Mya Thwet Thwet Khine was the first confirmed death among the many thousands who have taken to the streets to protest the Feb. 1 coup that toppled the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The woman was shot on Feb. 9, two days before her 20th birthday, at a protest in the capital Nayptitaw, and died Friday.About 1,000 people in cars and bikes gathered Sunday morning at the hospital where her body was held amid tight security, with even the victim's grandparents who had traveled from Yangon, five hours away, denied entry. When her body was released, a long motorized procession began a drive to the cemetery.In Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, about 1,000 demonstrators honored the woman under an elevated roadway.“I want to say through the media to the dictator and his associates, we are peaceful demonstrators," said protester Min Htet Naing. “Stop the genocide! Stop using lethal weapons!”Another large protest took place in Mandalay, where police shot dead two people on Saturday near a dockyard as security forces were trying to force workers to load a boat. The workers, like railway workers and truckers and many civil servants, have been taking part in a civil disobedience campaign against the junta.Shooting broke out after neighborhood residents rushed to the Yadanabon dock to try to assist the workers in their resistance. One of the victims, described as a teenage boy, was shot in the head and died immediately, while another was shot in the chest and died en route to a hospital.Several other serious injuries were also reported. Witness accounts and photos of bullet casings indicated that the security forces used live ammunition, in addition to rubber bullets, water cannons and slingshots.The new deaths drew quick and strong reaction from the international community.“The shooting of peaceful protesters in is beyond the pale,” said British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Twitter. “We will consider further action, with our international partners, against those crushing democracy & choking dissent.”Britain last week froze assets of and imposed travel bans on three top Myanmar generals, adding to already existing targeted sanctions.Singapore, which together with Myanmar is part of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, issued a statement condemning the use of lethal force as “inexcusable.”Urging “utmost restraint” on the part of security forces, it warned that “if the situation continues to escalate, there will be serious adverse consequences for Myanmar and the region.”Another shooting death took place Saturday night in Yangon in unclear circumstances. According to several accounts on social media, including a live broadcast that showed the body, the victim was a man who was acting as a volunteer guard for a neighborhood watch group. Such groups were established because of fears that authorities were using criminals released from prison to spread panic and fear by setting fires and committing violent acts.Another live broadcast on Facebook showed the wife of actor Lu Min describing to neighbors how her husband was arrested and taken away from their home shortly after midnight. He was one of six high-profile people in the entertainment industry charged last week with inciting civil servants to stop work and join the protest movement, which he and the others have publicly championed.On Sunday, Facebook announced it took down the page run by the Myanmar military information unit “for repeated violations of our community standards prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm.” It had already taken down other accounts linked to the military.The junta took power after detaining Suu Kyi and preventing Parliament from convening, saying elections last November were tainted by voting irregularities. The election outcome, in which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won by a landslide, was affirmed by an election commission that has since been replaced by the military. The junta says it will hold new elections in a year’s time.The coup was a major setback to Myanmar’s transition to democracy after 50 years of army rule that began with a 1962 coup. Suu Kyi came to power after her party won a 2015 election, but the generals retained substantial power under the constitution, which was adopted under a military regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-protests-and-funeral-follow-deadly-shootings-in-myanmar-101613897150446.html

Nearly all private bank branches have closed, while automated teller machines are running out of cash amid surging demand.“We expect to see the biggest crowd of people across the country on Monday,” said Aung Kyaw Kyaw Oo, a lower house lawmaker representing the National League for Democracy. “We need to keep fighting against the brutal military.”Myanmar has seen nationwide demonstrations since the military seized control of the country on Feb. 1, with protesters ignoring a ban on public gatherings. A 20-year old student who was shot in the country’s capital of Naypidaw was the first casualty last week. Two men were killed and more than 20 people were injured on Saturday as authorities fired shots to disperse demonstrators in Mandalay.In an apparent warning to protesters, state-run television carried a broadcast notice on Sunday that said while peaceful demonstrations are lawful, undermining stability is not, and authorities may take action.The youth-led movement has mobilized supporters peacefully in major cities with three main demands: the release of civilian leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi, recognition of the 2020 election results that showed her party won, and a withdrawal of the military from politics. Suu Kyi’s first court hearing began earlier than expected last week, without her lawyer present.The military has ordered internet blackouts in recent nights as it tightens its grip on power. Facebook Inc. has pushed back against the coup, with Reuters reporting that the company removed the military’s main social media page for violations of community standards prohibiting the incitement of violence and coordinating harm.Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in statement on Saturday that the use of lethal force against unarmed civilians was “inexcusable.”Some automatic teller machines have run out of cash within the first few hours of each day as citizens rush to get a hold of money, according to Pe Myint, a senior consultant at Co-operative Bank.On top of this, bad traffic has prevented bank employees from going to their offices and changes in the senior management at the central bank may also complicate matters, he said. “It is still unlikely to see the reopening of all private banks before the end of February.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-resolve-strengthens-following-death-of-activists-101613894640158.html

Dujuan, locally known as Auring, is forecast to make landfall on the Dinagat Islands-Eastern Samar-Leyte area, about 600 to 700 kilometers south of Manila, between Sunday evening and Monday morning.The storm was 320 km east of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur and has started moving northwestward at 15 km/h. It is expected to bring heavy rains and trigger landslides, although it may weaken into a tropical depression before it makes landfall.An average of 20 typhoons pass through the Philippines every year, in most cases forcing the evacuation of thousands of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/storm-dujuan-51-400-filipinos-evacuated-across-5-provinces-101613893972895.html

He was jailed on Feb. 2 for violating parole on what he and the Western countries said were trumped-up charges. He lost an appeal on Saturday.Leonid Volkov, Navalny's chief of staff, told Reuters on Saturday he believes Putin would only consider releasing him if hit by sanctions."Putin is a dictator, but he is quite rational. If the upsides of having Navalny in prison become less than the downsides, he will change his decision," said Volkov."If many of his closest allies become unhappy, this can be dangerous to Putin and this could lead him to decide to change his mind," Volkov added. "Or maybe not - but sanctions is the best thing that Europe can do now."In Brussels on Sunday at the invitation of Lithuania, where he has been sheltering since 2019, Volkov said he will tell policymakers to use the "language of power" towards the Russian government, as he believes Putin sees bridge-building attempts by the West as a sign of weakness.Asked to comment on Navalny’s political future after the court decision on Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, “It is absolutely none of our business.”Navalny's allies have published a list of 35 people they believe should be sanctioned.His supporters are now gearing up to organise a "huge peaceful protest" in Russia this spring, Volkov said.Navalny's organization will then attempt to prevent Putin's party from achieving a comfortable win at elections in September by campaigning for its rivals, said Volkov.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalny-ally-volkov-says-language-of-power-sanctions-can-free-kremlin-critic-101613892238083.html

The move will raise an expected 12 billion pounds ($16.8 billion) a year, the report added.According to the report, at least 1 pence is set to be added to the bill for business from this autumn, at a cost to business of 3 billion pounds, with further rises in subsequent years.Allies of Sunak clarified he would not increase corporation tax higher than 23%.These measures will be helpful in paying for an extension to the furlough scheme, VAT cuts and business support loans until at least August.Also read| Britain to offer all adults a Covid-19 vaccine by end of JulyUnlike the 2010 Conservative-led government, which pursued spending cuts to rebalance the economy after the global financial crisis, Sunak is expected to defer most of the toughest decisions about how to pay for that support in his budget speech."The corporation tax hike will be higher than expected and the extension of the support schemes will be longer than most people expect," the newspaper quoted a source as saying.Insiders indicated the stamp duty holiday on property purchases would also be extended in line with the other coronavirus support measures, the report said.Britain's economy had its biggest slump in 300 years in 2020, when it contracted by 10%, and will shrink by 4% in the first three months of 2021, the Bank of England predicts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-rishi-sunak-to-raise-business-tax-to-pay-for-covid-19-support-101613889716994.html

21-02-2021||World||Frozen pipes, electric woes remain as cold snap eases grip in Texas||Higher temperatures spread across the southern United States on Saturday, bringing relief to a winter-weary region that faces a challenging clean-up and expensive repairs from days of extreme cold and widespread power outages.In hard-hit Texas, where millions were warned to boil tap water before drinking it, the warm-up was expected to last for several days. The thaw produced burst pipes throughout the region, adding to the list of woes from severe conditions that were blamed for more than 70 deaths.By Saturday afternoon, the sun had come out in Dallas and temperatures were nearing the 50s. People emerged to walk and jog in residential neighborhoods after days indoors. Many roads had dried out, and patches of snow were melting. Snowmen slumped.Linda Nguyen woke up in a Dallas hotel room Saturday morning with an assurance she hadn’t had in nearly a week: She and her cat had somewhere to sleep with power and water.Electricity had been restored to her apartment on Wednesday. But when Nguyen arrived home from work the next evening, she found a soaked carpet. A pipe had burst in her bedroom.“It’s essentially unlivable,” said Nguyen, 27, who works in real estate. “Everything is completely ruined.”Deaths attributed to the weather include a man at an Abilene health care facility where the lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible. Officials also reported deaths from hypothermia, including homeless people and those inside buildings with no power or heat. Others died in car accidents on icy roads or from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.Roughly half the deaths reported so far occurred in Texas, with multiple fatalities also in Tennessee, Kentucky, Oregon and a few other Southern and Midwestern states.A Tennessee farmer died trying to save two calves from a frozen pond.President Joe Biden’s office said Saturday he has declared a major disaster in Texas, directing federal agencies to help in the recovery.U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, tweeted Saturday that she helped raise more than $3 million toward relief. She was soliciting help for a Houston food bank, one of 12 Texas organizations she said would benefit from the donations.The storms left more than 300,000 still without power across the country on Saturday, many of them in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.More than 50,000 Oregon electricity customers were among those without power, more than a week after an ice storm ravaged the electrical grid. Portland General Electric had hoped to have service back to all but 15,000 customers by Friday night. But the utility discovered additional damage in previously inaccessible areas.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown ordered the National Guard to go door-to-door in some areas to check on residents' welfare. At its peak, what was the worst ice storm in 40 years knocked out power to more than 350,000 customers.In West Virginia, Appalachian Power was working on a list of about 1,500 places that needed repair, as about 44,000 customers in the state remained without electricity after experiencing back-to-back ice storms Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. More than 3,200 workers were attempting to get power back online, their efforts spread across the six most affected counties on Saturday.In Wayne County, West Virginia, workers had to replace the same pole three times because trees kept falling on it.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott met Saturday with legislators from both parties to discuss energy prices as Texans face massive spikes in their electric bills after wholesale energy prices skyrocketed while power plants were offline.“We have a responsibility to protect Texans from spikes in their energy bills” resulting from the weather, he said in a statement.Water woes added misery for people across the South who went without heat or electricity for days after the ice. Snow storms forced rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.Robert Tuskey was retrieving tools from the back of his pickup truck Saturday afternoon as he prepared to fix a water line at a friend’s home in Dallas.“Everything’s been freezing,” Tuskey said. “I even had one in my own house … of course I’m lucky I’m a plumber.”Tuskey, 49, said his plumbing business has had a stream of calls for help from friends and relatives with burst pipes. “I’m fixing to go help out another family member,” he said. “I know she ain’t got no money at all, but they ain’t got no water at all, and they’re older.”In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 lacked running water, and officials blamed city water mains that are more than 100 years old and not built for freezing weather.The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking. But residents had to pick it up, leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.Incoming and outgoing passenger flights at Memphis International Airport resumed Saturday after all flights were canceled Friday because of water pressure problems. The issues hadn't been resolved, but airport officials set up temporary restroom facilities.Prison rights advocates said some correctional facilities across Louisiana had intermittent electricity and frozen pipes, affecting toilets and showers.The men who are sick, elderly or being held not in dormitories but in cell blocks — small spaces surrounded by concrete walls — were especially vulnerable, according to Voice of the Experienced, a grassroots organization founded and run by formerly incarcerated people. The group said one man at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, just south of Baton Rouge, described a thin layer of ice on his walls.Cammie Maturin said she spoke to men at the 6,300-inmate Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola who were given no extra provisions to protect themselves from the cold.“They give them no extra blankets. No extra anything. For them, it’s just been fend for yourself,” said Maturin, president of the nonprofit H.O.P.E. Foundation.In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.As of Saturday, 1,445 public water systems in Texas had reported disrupted operations, said Toby Baker executive director of the state Commission on Environmental Quality. Government agencies were using mobile labs and coordinating to speed water testing.That’s up from 1,300 reporting issues Friday afternoon. But Baker said the number of affected customers had dropped slightly. Most were under boil-water orders, with 156,000 lacking water service entirely.“It seems like last night we may have seen some stabilization in the water systems across the state,” Baker said.The Saturday thaw after 11 days of freezing temperatures in Oklahoma City left residents with burst water pipes, inoperable wells and furnaces knocked out of operation by brief power blackouts.Rhodes College in Memphis said Friday that about 700 residential students were being moved to hotels in the suburbs of Germantown and Collierville after school bathrooms stopped functioning because of low water pressure.Firefighters extinguished a blaze at a fully occupied 102-room hotel in Killeen, Texas, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Austin, late Friday. The hotel’s sprinkler system didn’t work because of frozen pipes, authorities said Saturday.Flames shot from the top of the four-story hotel, and three people required medical care. Displaced guests were taken to a nearby Baptist church.Texas electrical grid operators said electricity transmission returned to normal after the historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand that buckled the state's system.Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now can provide power throughout the system.Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached breaking point.The blackouts resulted in at least two lawsuits filed against ERCOT and utilities, including one filed by the family of an 11-year-old boy who is believed to have died from hypothermia. The lawsuits claim ERCOT ignored repeated warnings of weaknesses in the state's power infrastructure.Also, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued civil investigative demands to ERCOT and electric utility companies. His investigation will address power outages, emergency plans, energy pricing and more related to the winter storm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frozen-pipes-electric-woes-remain-as-cold-snap-eases-grip-in-texas-101613888467750.html

Its True News page was no available on Sunday.The military spokesman did not respond to a Reuters phone call seeking comment.Two people were killed in Myanmar's second city Mandalay on Saturday when police and soldiers fired at protesters demonstrating against the overthrow of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, emergency workers said, the bloodiest day in more than two weeks of demonstrations.Facebook in recent years has engaged with civil rights activists and democratic political parties in Myanmar and pushed back against the military after coming under heavy international criticism for failing to contain online hate campaigns.In 2018, it banned army chief Min Aung Hlaing - now the military ruler - and 19 other senior officers and organisations, and took down hundreds of pages and accounts run by military members for coordinated inauthentic behaviour.Ahead of November elections, Facebook announced it had taken down a network of 70 fake accounts and pages operated by members of the military that had posted either positive content about the army or criticism of Suu Kyi and her party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-takes-down-main-page-of-myanmar-military-101613877044175.html
21-02-2021||World||UN experts: Trump ally, UAE firms violated Libya sanctions||American security contractor Erik Prince, a close ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, violated the U.N. arms embargo against Libya along with three United Arab Emirates-based companies and their top managers during an operation to help a rebel military commander take the capital Tripoli, U.N. experts said.In a key section of a report to the U.N. Security Council obtained Saturday by The Associated Press, the panel of experts outlined “a well-funded private military company operation” called “Project Opus” designed to provide military equipment to eastern-based commander Khalifa Hifter.“The Project Opus plan also included a component to kidnap or terminate individuals regarded as high value targets inThe plan was first reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post.Oil-rich Libya was plunged into chaos after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi and split the country between a U.N.-supported government in Tripoli and rival authorities based in the country’s east, each side backed by an array of local militias as well as regional and foreign powers.In April 2019, Hifter and his forces, backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, launched an offensive to try and capture Tripoli. His campaign collapsed after Turkey stepped up its military support of the U.N.-supported government with hundreds of troops and thousands of Syrian mercenaries. An October cease-fire agreement has led to an agreement on a transitional government and elections scheduled for Dec. 24.The panel of experts report said it identified “Project Opus” in June 2019.It was designed to have private military companies provide Hifter’s forces with “armed assault rotary wing aviation, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, maritime interdiction, cyber, UAV, and intelligence fusion and targeting capabilities,” the experts said,Prince became involved when Jordanian authorities became aware of elements of the plan “and suspended the auction” of surplus military helicopters to Hifter on June 18, 2019, according to the experts.“This required the Project Opus team to initiate a contingency plan to rapidly identify and procure new aircraft,” the panel said.“These included three medium utility helicopters from a South African company and three light utility helicopters from a United Arab Emirates company,” the experts said. “Also purchased within a tight time frame were an Antonov AN-26B from a Bermudian company, a LASA T-Bird light attack aircraft from a Bulgarian company, and a Pilatus PC-6 ISR aircraft from an Austrian company.”The panel said the Antonov, LASA light attack aircraft and Pilatus “were deployed before any payment and the normal due diligence took place, thus demonstrating that a fourth individual, Erik Dean Prince (USA), who controlled the companies owning the aircraft, assisted in procurement for the operation.”“No one else was in a position to arrange the sale of these aircraft within such a short time frame,” the experts said.The panel said further investigations “identified that Erik Prince made a proposal for the operation to Khalifa Hifter in Cairo, Egypt on, or about, April 14, 2019.”The panel said it therefore “finds that Erik Prince” violated the 2011 Security Council resolution imposing an arms embargo against Libya “in that, at the very least, he ... assisted in the evasion of, the provisions of the arms embargo in Libya.”Prince, founder of the controversial security firm Blackwater, soared to notoriety after Blackwater employees in 2007 shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians in central Baghdad during the Iraq war. After the scandal, the company’s name was changed and Prince sold his shares to a private equity fund. He reportedly now heads a private equity fund focused on investments in frontier emerging markets.Prince was accused of acting as a back channel on behalf of Trump. His sister, Betsy DeVos, was the secretary of education in the Trump administration.The panel of experts said “three United Arab Emirates based companies were primarily used for the planning, management and finance of the operation” under Project Opus.It identified them as Lancaster 6 DMCC, L-6 FZE, and Opus Capital Asset Limited FZE.The companies were “controlled and managed” by Christiaan Paul Durrant of Australia and Amanda Kate Perry of the United Kingdom, with the ground team leader being Stephen John Lodge of South Africa.The panel said “all three companies and individuals were found ... to have violated” the 2011 council resolution “in that they had each violated, or assisted in the evasion of, the provisions of the arms embargo in Libya.”It said the UAE, which could provide a lot of assistance to the panel, has not responded to any panel requests for information, “and the responses from Jordan and South Africa provided little of the substantive information requested by the panel.”According to the experts, the helicopter and maritime interdiction component of Operation Opus was aborted on June 29, 2019, when Lodge decided to evacuate a team of 20 private military operatives to Malta using two special forces “rigid hulled inflatable boats” for the 350 nautical mile voyage from the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi to Malta’s capital Valetta.“The decision to evacuate was taken as Hifter was unimpressed with the replacement aircraft procured for the operations and made threats against the team management,” the experts said.The panel said the Pilatus aircraft deployed to Libya on June 25, 2019 and was available for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ISR operations in Libya from Benghazi, Al Jufra and Brak Shati from at least June 26, 2019 to Dec. 24, 2020. Its capabilities provided Hifter with “a force multiplier” for these operations and targeting activities, the experts said.The panel said Project Opus private military operatives were deployed to Libya for a second time in April and May 2020 ’’in order to locate and destroy high value targets, but this time planning to use military equipment supplied by the UAE.”The operation was aborted, it said, because any helicopter assault would be “highly vulnerable to interdiction” by Libyan government air defense capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-trump-ally-uae-firms-violated-libya-sanctions-101613874367089.html

21-02-2021||World||Privacy faces risks in tech-infused post-Covid-19 workplace||People returning to work following the long pandemic will find an array of tech-infused gadgetry to improve workplace safety but which could pose risks for long-term personal and medical privacy.Temperature checks, distance monitors, digital "passports," wellness surveys and robotic cleaning and disinfection systems are being deployed in many workplaces seeking to reopen.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here Tech giants and startups are offering solutions which include computer vision detection of vital signs to wearables which can offer early indications of the onset of Covid-19 and apps that keep track of health metrics.Salesforce and IBM have partnered on a "digital health pass" to let people share their vaccination and health status on their smartphone.Clear, a tech startup known for airport screening, has created its own health pass which is being used by organizations such as the National Hockey League and MGM Resorts.Fitbit, the wearable tech maker recently acquired by Google, has its own "Ready for Work" program that includes daily check-ins using data from its devices.Fitbit is equipping some 1,000 NASA employees with wearables as part of a pilot program which requires a daily log-in using various health metrics which will be tracked by the space agency.Microsoft and insurance giant United HealthCare have deployed a ProtectWell app which includes a daily symptom screener, and Amazon has deployed a "distance assistant" in its warehouses to help employees maintain safe distances.And a large coalition of technology firms and health organizations are working on a digital vaccination certificate, which can be used on smartphones to show evidence of inoculation for Covid-19.'Blurs the lines' With these systems, employees may face screenings even as they enter a building lobby, and monitoring in elevators, hallways and throughout the workplace.The monitoring "blurs the line between people's workplace and personal lives," said Darrell West, a Brookings Institution vice president with the think tank's Center for Technology Innovation."It erodes longstanding medical privacy protections for many different workers."A report last year by the consumer activist group Public Citizen identified at least 50 apps and technologies released during the pandemic "marketed as workplace surveillance tools to combat Covid-19."The report said some systems go so far as identifying people who may not spend enough time in front of a sink to note inadequate hand-washing."The invasion of privacy that workers face is alarming, especially considering that the effectiveness of these technologies in mitigating the spread of Covid-19 has not yet been established," the report said.The group said there should be clear rules on collection and storage of data, with better disclosure to employees.A delicate balanceEmployers face a delicate balance as they try to ensure workplace safety without intruding on privacy, said Forrest Briscoe, professor of management and organization at Penn State University.Briscoe said there are legitimate reasons and precedents for requiring proof of vaccination. But these sometimes conflict with medical privacy regulations which limit a company's access to employee health data."You don't want the employer accessing that information for work-related decisions," Briscoe said.Biscoe said many employers are relying on third-party tech vendors to handle the monitoring, but that has its risks as well."Using third-party vendors will keep the data separate," he said."But for some companies their business model involves gathering data and using it for some monetizable purpose and that poses a risk to privacy."The global health crisis has inspired startups around the world to seek innovative ways to limit virus transmission, with some of those products shown at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show.Taiwan-based FaceHeart demonstrated software which can be installed in cameras for contactless measurement of vital signs to screen for shortness of breath, high fever, dehydration, elevated heart rate and other symptoms which are early indicators of Covid-19.Drone maker Draganfly showcased camera technology which can be used to offer alerts on social distancing, and also detect changes in people's vital signs which may be early indicators of Covid-19 infection.A programmable robot from Misty Robotics, also shown at CES, can be adapted as a health check monitor and can also be designed to disinfect frequently used surfaces like door handles, according to the company.But there are risks in relying too much on technologies which may be unproven or inaccurate, such as trying to detect fevers with thermal cameras among moving people, said Jay Stanley, a privacy researcher and analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union."Employers have a legitimate interest in safeguarding workplaces and keeping employees healthy in the context of the pandemic," Stanley said."But what I would worry about is employers using the pandemic to pluck and store information in a systematic way beyond what is necessary to protect health."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/privacy-faces-risks-in-tech-infused-post-covid-19-workplace-101613887821322.html
21-02-2021||World||Explained: What is H5N8? Strain of bird flu virus 1st to infect humans in Russia||Russia has reported the world's first case of a strain of bird flu virus that has infected humans via birds. The outbreak of the H5N8 strain has been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. What is the H5N8 strain?The strain is a subtype of the influenza A virus that causes flu-like symptoms in wild birds and poultry. It poses a low risk to people, but it is fatal for birds. This was found in crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Until recently, it was not known to have affected humans. Humans infected Seven workers at a poultry plant in Russia's south were infected with the H5N8 strain after an outbreak in birds in December last year, Popova said, adding that they all felt fine now. “Russia reported the case of human infection to the WHO several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results," she was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters. Where else has the H5N8 strain been reported? Outbreaks of the H5N8 strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and North Africa in recent months but so far only in poultry. Several states in India had also reported the outbreak of avian flu in January but there was no report of transmission to humans. Experts had said the outbreak was caused by the H5N8 strain, though there are other strains circulating globally. A series of outbreaks have been reported in Europe in the past weeks, with wild birds suspected to be spreading the disease, they had said in early January. According to experts, both H5N1 (another strain of avian influenza) and H5N8 have high pathogenicity or the ability of a pathogen to cause disease, but they don’t infect humans very effectively. However, past outbreaks among farm birds have needed extensive slaughtering programmes.How was H5N8 transmitted to humans in Russia?"Preliminary information indicates that the reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks," Reuters said citing an email from WHO's European arm. They were asymptomatic and no onward human to human transmission was reported. "We are in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and assess the public health impact of this event," the email added.Is eating poultry safe? The majority of human bird flu infections have been associated with direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered to be safe, Reuters reported. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-h5n8-strain-of-bird-flu-virus-1st-to-infect-humans-in-russia-101613885803710.html

21-02-2021||World||Myanmar police arrest actor Lu Min after two killed in protests||Myanmar police arrested a famous actor wanted for supporting opposition to a Feb. 1 coup, his wife said on Sunday, hours after two people were killed when police and soldiers fired to disperse protests in the second city of Mandalay.The violence in Mandalay on Saturday was the bloodiest day in more than two weeks of demonstrations in cities and towns across Myanmar demanding an end to military rule and the release from detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others.The demonstrations and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes and disruptions show no sign of dying down with opponents of the military sceptical of an army promise to hold a new election and hand power to the winner.The actor, Lu Min, was one of six celebrities who the army said on Wednesday were wanted under an anti-incitement law for encouraging civil servants to join in the protest. The charges can carry a two-year prison sentence.Lu Min has taken part in several protests in Yangon.His wife, Khin Sabai Oo, said in a video posted on his Facebook page that police had come to their home in Yangon and taken him away."They forced open the door and took him away and didn't tell me where they were taking him. I couldn’t stop them. They didn’t tell me."Military spokesman Zaw Min Tun, who is also the spokesman for the new military council, has not responded to repeated attempts by Reuters to contact him by telephone for comment.An activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, said on Saturday 569 people have been arrested, charged or sentenced in connection with the coup.In another incident in Yangon on Saturday night, a night watchman was shot and killed. The Burmese service of Radio Free Asia said police had shot him but it was not clear why.Communities have been posting more guards in fear of sweeps by the security forces.'DEEPLY CONCERNED'The more than two weeks of protests had been largely peaceful, unlike previous episodes of opposition during nearly half a century of direct military rule, which ended in 2011.Members of ethnic minorities, poets, rappers and transport workers marched on Saturday in various places, but tension escalated quickly in Mandalay where police and soldiers confronted striking shipyard workers.Some of the demonstrators fired catapults at police as they played cat and mouse through riverside streets. Police responded with tear gas and gunfire, and witnesses said they found the cartridges of live rounds and rubber bullets on the ground.Two people were shot and killed and 20 were wounded, said Ko Aung, a leader of the Parahita Darhi volunteer emergency service.Police were not available for comment.A young woman protester, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, died on Friday after being shot in the head last week as police dispersed a crowd in the capital, Naypyitaw, the first death among anti-coup demonstrators.The army says one policeman has died of injuries sustained in a protest.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was "deeply concerned" by reports that security forces had fired on protesters and continued to detain and harass demonstrators and others."We stand with the people of Burma," Price wrote on Twitter. Myanmar is also known as Burma.Britain said it would consider further action against those involved in violence against protesters, and the French foreign ministry called the violence "unacceptable.""The shooting of peaceful protesters in Myanmar is beyond the pale," British foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Twitter. "We will consider further action, with our international partners, against those crushing democracy & choking dissent."The United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand have announced limited sanctions since the coup, with a focus on military leaders.State television MRTV's evening news broadcast made no mention of the protests or casualties.The army seized back power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy swept, detaining her and others. The electoral commission had dismissed the fraud complaints.Nevertheless, the army says its action is within the constitution and is supported by a majority of the people. The military has blamed protesters for instigating violence.Suu Kyi faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Her next court appearance is on March 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-police-arrest-actor-after-two-killed-in-protests-101613872105040.html
21-02-2021||World||Big US companies slash donations to politicians after Trump election challenge||Ten US corporations slashed donations to candidates seeking federal office by more than 90% in January, after pledging to cut off giving to the Republicans who supported former President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn his election defeat.None of the political action committees of 10 major companies reviewed by Reuters, including Microsoft Corp , Walmart Inc, AT&T Inc and Comcast Corp , donated to any of the 147 congressional Republicans who voted to support Trump's claims just hours after his supporters launched a deadly assault on the US Capitol.Disclosures to the Federal Election Commission ahead of a Saturday filing deadline showed the group of corporate PACs affiliated with those 10 companies made $13,000 in new donations to candidates in January. The reports were the first by the PACs to detail contributions made since the January 6 Capitol attack.The money donated during the month was less than one-tenth the roughly $190,000 the 10 company PACs gave candidates in January 2017, and tiny relative to the roughly $10 million donated to candidates during the 2019-2020 election season. The 147 lawmakers who voted to overturn President Joe Biden's victory had received more than $2 million from those 10 PACs during the last two-year political cycle.Also read: A dozen Republican senators to oppose certification of Joe Biden’s winAlso read: US justice department probes if staff tried to alter election outcomeOnly committees tied to two of the companies - General Electric Co and American Express Co - reported any new giving to federal candidates in January.American Express' PAC gave $5,000 to Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota, while GE's gave $5,000 to Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a prominent Republican Trump critic, and $1,000 to Representative Rick Larsen of Washington, a Democrat.Political giving usually slows down in the months after a US general election and money from corporate political action committees is a small slice of the funds raised by political campaigns.But the paucity of corporate-affiliated giving in January points to a slower start in one corner of political finance ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.Corporate PACs cannot donate money from the company treasury but generally serve as a conduit for contributions from managers and shareholders.Committees affiliated with Best Buy, State Street Corp, Dow Inc and Nike Inc did not report new donations to any candidates in January.While more than a thousand PACs are associated with corporate America, the 10 reviewed by Reuters include major companies which made clear public statements that they would throttle back donations following the January 6 Capitol attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-us-companies-slash-donations-to-politicians-after-trump-election-challenge-101613871247241.html

21-02-2021||World||Why a predictable cold snap crippled the Texas power grid||As Texans cranked up their heaters early Monday to combat plunging temperatures, a record surge of electricity demand set off a disastrous chain reaction in the state’s power grid.Wind turbines in the state’s northern Panhandle locked up. Natural gas plants shut down when frozen pipes and components shut off fuel flow. A South Texas nuclear reactor went dark after a five-foot section of uninsulated pipe seized up. Power outages quickly spread statewide - leaving millions shivering in their homes for days, with deadly consequences.It could have been far worse: Before dawn on Monday, the state’s grid operator was “seconds and minutes” away from an uncontrolled blackout for its 26 million customers, its CEO has said. Such a collapse occurs when operators lose the ability to manage the crisis through rolling blackouts; in such cases, it can take weeks or months to fully restore power to customers.Monday was one of the state’s coldest days in more than a century - but the unprecedented power crisis was hardly unpredictable after Texas had experienced a similar, though less severe, disruption during a 2011 cold snap. Still, Texas power producers failed to adequately winter-proof their systems. And the state’s grid operator underestimated its need for reserve power capacity before the crisis, then moved too slowly to tell utilities to institute rolling blackouts to protect against a grid meltdown, energy analysts, traders and economists said.Early signs of trouble came long before the forced outages. Two days earlier, for example, the grid suddenly lost 539 megawatts (MW) of power, or enough electricity for nearly 108,000 homes, according to operational messages disclosed by the state’s primary grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).The crisis stemmed from a unique confluence of weaknesses in the state’s power system.Texas is the only state in the continental United States with an independent and isolated grid. That allows the state to avoid federal regulation - but also severely limits its ability to draw emergency power from other grids. ERCOT also operates the only major U.S. grid that does not have a capacity market - a system that provides payments to operators to be on standby to supply power during severe weather events.After more than 3 million ERCOT customers lost power in a February 2011 freeze, federal regulators recommended that ERCOT prepare for winter with the same urgency as it does the peak summer season. They also said that, while ERCOT’s reserve power capacity looked good on paper, it did not take into account that many generation units could get knocked offline by freezing weather.“There were prior severe cold weather events in the Southwest in 1983, 1989, 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2010,” Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and North American Electric Reliability Corp staff summarized after investigating the state’s 2011 rolling blackouts. “Extensive generator failures overwhelmed ERCOT’s reserves, which eventually dropped below the level of safe operation.”ERCOT spokeswoman Leslie Sopko did not comment in detail about the causes of the power crisis but said the grid’s leadership plans to re-evaluate the assumptions that go into its forecasts.The freeze was easy to see coming, said Jay Apt, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center.“When I read that this was a black-swan event, I just have to wonder whether the folks who are saying that have been in this business long enough that they forgot everything, or just came into it,” Apt said. “People need to recognize that this sort of weather is pretty common.”This week’s cold snap left 4.5 million ERCOT customers without power. More than 14.5 million Texans endured a related water-supply crisis as pipes froze and burst. About 65,000 customers remained without power as of Saturday afternoon, even as temperatures started to rise, according to website PowerOutage.US.State health officials have linked more than two dozen deaths to the power crisis. Some died from hypothermia or possible carbon monoxide poisoning caused by portable generators running in basements and garages without enough ventilation. Officials say they suspect the death count will rise as more bodies are discovered.THIN POWER RESERVEIn the central Texas city of Austin, the state capital, the minimum February temperature usually falls between 42 and 48 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 9 degrees Celsius). This past week, temperatures fell as low as 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14 degrees Celsius).In November, ERCOT assured that the grid was prepared to handle such a dire scenario.“We studied a range of potential risks under both normal and extreme conditions, and believe there is sufficient generation to adequately serve our customers,” said ERCOT’s manager of resource adequacy, Pete Warnken, in a report that month.Warnken could not be reached for comment on Saturday.Under normal winter conditions, ERCOT forecast it would have about 16,200 MW of power reserves. But under extreme conditions, it predicted a reserve cushion of only about 1,350 MW. That assumed only 23,500 MW of generation outages. During the peak of this week’s crisis, more than 30,000 MW was forced off the grid.Other US grid operators maintain a capacity market to supply extra power in extreme conditions - paying operators on an ongoing basis, whether they produce power or not. Capacity market auctions determine, three years in advance, the price that power generators receive in exchange for being on emergency standby.Instead, ERCOT relies on a wholesale electricity market, where free market pricing provides incentives for generators to provide daily power and to make investments to ensure reliability in peak periods, according to economists. The system relied on the theory that power plants should make high profits when energy demand and prices soar - providing them ample money to make investments in, for example, winterization. The Texas legislature restructured the state’s electric market in 1999.LOOMING CRISISSince 2010, ERCOT’s reserve margin - the buffer between generation capacity versus forecasted demand - has dropped to about 10% from about 20%. This has put pressure on generators during demand spikes, making the grid less flexible, according to North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a nonprofit regulator.That thin margin for error set off alarms early Monday morning among energy traders and analysts as they watched a sudden drop in the electrical frequency of the Texas grid. One analyst compared it to watching the pulse of a hospital patient drop to life-threatening levels.Too much of a drop is catastrophic because it would trigger automatic relay switches to disconnect power sources from the grid, setting off uncontrolled blackouts statewide. Dan Jones, an energy analyst at Monterey LLC, watched from his home office in Delaware as the grid’s frequency dropped quickly toward the point that would trigger the automatic shutdowns."If you're not in control, and you are letting the equipment do it, that's just chaos," Jones said.By Sunday afternoon about 3:15 p.m. (CST), ERCOT's control room signaled it had run out of options to boost electric generation to match the soaring demand. Operators issued a warning that there was "no market solution" for the projected shortage, according to control room messages published by ERCOT on its website.Adam Sinn, president of Houston-based energy trading firm Aspire Commodities, said ERCOT waited far too long to start telling utilities to cut customers' power to guard against a grid meltdown. The problems, he said, were readily apparent several days before Monday.“ERCOT was letting the system get weaker and weaker and weaker,” Sinn said in an interview. “I was thinking: Holy shit, what is this grid operator doing? He has to cut load.”Sinn said he started texting his friends on Sunday night, warning them to expect widespread outages.‘SECONDS AND MINUTES’Early Monday morning, one of the largest sources of electricity in the state - the unit 1 reactor at the South Texas Nuclear Generating Station - stopped producing power after the small section of pipe froze in temperatures that averaged 17 degrees Fahrenheit (9 degrees Celsius). The grid lost access to 1,350 MW of nuclear power - enough to power about 270,000 homes - after automatic sensors detected the frozen pipe and protectively shut down the reactor, said Victor Dricks, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.About 2:30 a.m. (CST), the South Plains Electric Cooperative in Lubbock said it received a phone call from ERCOT to cut power to its customers. Inside the ERCOT control room, staff members scrambled to call utilities and cooperatives statewide to tell them to do the same, according to operational messages disclosed by the grid operator.Three days later, ERCOT Chief Executive Bill Magness acknowledged that the grid operator had only narrowly avoided the calamity of uncontrolled blackouts.“If we hadn’t taken action,” he said on Thursday, “it was seconds and minutes (away), given the amount of generation that was coming off the system at the same time that the demand was still going up."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-a-predictable-cold-snap-crippled-the-texas-power-grid-101613868661448.html

"I also encouraged the sharing of data in light of reports of Covid-19 cases among travellers," he said.Tanzanian authorities were not immediately available for comment.Tanzanian President John Magufuli has a reputation as one of the national leaders most sceptical of efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.On Wednesday, a senior politician died of Covid-19, his party said, adding to concern about a hidden epidemic running rampant in a country that insists it has no local transmission of the disease and says it has no plans to receive vaccines.Also read| Britain to offer all adults a Covid-19 vaccine by end of JulyOn Friday, during a funeral service for a senior aide, Magufuli urged Tanzanians to remove fear, take precautions and put God first. He also announced three days of national prayer, according to a statement by the presidency.The government stopped reporting data on new coronavirus infections and deaths in May last year when it had registered 509 cases and 21 fatalities.WHO's Tedros said in his statement that he has spoken with several authorities in Tanzania since January but "WHO is yet to receive any information regarding what measures Tanzania is taking to respond to the pandemic."He called on the country to implement "public health measures that we know work in breaking the chains of transmission, and to prepare for vaccination."And he said Tanzanian travellers testing positive for Covid-19 abroad underscored "the need for Tanzania to take robust action both to safeguard their own people and protect populations in these countries and beyond."On Monday, Oman's health minister said his country was considering suspending flights from Tanzania, after 18% of travellers arriving from Tanzania tested positive for Covid-19.Thailand reported on Monday its first case of the highly contagious Covid-19 variant first identified in South Africa, in a Thai man who arrived from Tanzania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-still-has-no-details-from-tanzania-on-its-covid-19-response-101613864292086.html
21-02-2021||World||US President Biden approves Texas disaster declaration after deadly freeze||President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Texas on Saturday as the state struggles with the fallout from a winter storm that killed at least two dozen people and caused widespread blackouts and water shortages.Millions of residents in the United States' biggest oil and gas producer have had to contend with days of electricity outages, and nearly half of all Texans are still suffering from disruptions to their water service.Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in Harris County, which encompasses Houston, said on Friday authorities were reporting 10 deaths due to hypothermia. Officials said an accurate death toll will take time to establish.The action by the Biden administration makes federal funding available to affected individuals, including assistance for temporary housing and home repairs and low-cost loans.Biden is also weighing a trip to Texas to survey the federal response to the first new crisis to develop since he took office a month ago. The White House is working closely with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican who did not initially acknowledge Biden's November election win.Read more: Dozens protest in support of anti-migrant group in ParisAbbott thanked the president for approving the major disaster declaration, saying in a statement that it was "an important first step." But, he added, individual assistance had only been approved for 77 counties, not all the state's 254 counties as he had requested.FROM RESPONSE TO RECOVERYWith all the state's power plants back online, millions of Texans were finally able to turn on the lights and heat their homes again. However, outages persisted and more than 78,000 homes remained without electricity as of Saturday morning.With the weather set to improve and temperatures expected to return to normal in the coming days, the main concern has shifted from power to water.More than 1,200 public water systems have reported service disruptions, many of them leading to boil water notices, said Gary Rasp, a spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ.) He said 14.3 million people in 190 counties were affected as of Saturday morning.Toby Baker, TCEQ's executive director, said the agency will do a full review of the regulations governing the state's water systems."I'm not aware of ever having issues of this magnitude from a water system standpoint in the history of the state," he said at a press conference on Saturday. "We're going to take full advantage of this event to learn."At his home in Houston, plumber Jay Farrell said he would have "rather gone through a hurricane than this freeze."Read more: Texas homes hit with thousand-dollar bills after winter woesFarrell said he has not been able to take showers and for days has been using buckets of water from his hot tub to flush the toilet. As Texas shivered in the dark during the freeze, he said the temperature in his house dropped to 22 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 5.5 Celsius).In Houston, officials struck a more optimistic tone after power was restored to most residents and with mass distributions of bottled water under way."Things are looking up... We are headed in the direction of normalcy," Hidalgo said in a video address on Friday. "Right now it's about shifting from response to recovery."Meanwhile, Abbott said he was convening an emergency meeting with officials on Saturday to discuss the spike in energy bills received by many residents following the power outages.FINGER POINTINGThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a cooperative responsible for 90% of the state's electricity, has come under fire after the power grid collapsed as demand spiked during the freeze.Abbott lashed out at ERCOT last week, saying the corporation had told officials before the storm that the grid was prepared.A lawsuit against ERCOT was filed on Friday in Nueces County court in Corpus Christi alleging the council failed to heed warnings and take action to address weaknesses in the power infrastructure.Separately, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued civil investigative demands to ERCOT and other power companies regarding power outages, emergency plans, energy pricing and more related to the winter weather.In a statement on Friday, Paxton said the companies "grossly mishandled" the weather emergency, and vowed to "get to the bottom of this power failure."On Saturday, Senator Tina Smith wrote to federal regulators calling for an investigation into any price gouging by natural gas producers and suppliers."I urge you to launch an investigation into the conditions in the natural gas market over the last week," Smith said in the letter to the Department of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Smith said the effects of the crisis in Texas could be felt in the region, including natural gas spot prices that in some cases rose to nearly 100 times usual levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-approves-texas-disaster-declaration-after-deadly-freeze-101613866580850.html

21-02-2021||World||Texas homes hit with thousand-dollar bills after winter woes||After enduring a wretched week of Arctic storms, hunger and cold, several Texans were handed another pain point -- massive electricity bills.Houston resident David Astrein, 36, a human resources director at a manufacturing company, said he’s been charged $2,738.66 so far this month versus $129.85 in January for a three-bedroom home with a detached garage apartment. He and his wife stopped using their dishwasher, washer and dryer, and turned on as few lights as possible at night. They kept the heat on for their 5-month old son.Astrein is one of a swath of consumers facing sky-high payments in the aftermath of the storm -- many took to social media to show electricity bills ranging as high as $8,000. According to their screen shots, most are customers of Griddy Energy, a power supplier with a unique business model.The Macquarie Energy-backed company charges electricity based on real-time prices in wholesale power markets, therefore exposing consumers to the full swings. Griddy saw the problem developing and even urged its retail customers last weekend to switch to another provider. By Sunday, 20% managed to do so. But not Astrein.Also read| Dozens protest in support of anti-migrant group in Paris“We were stuck with Griddy and those astronomical prices,” he said by phone. “The failure in Texas as a whole to plan for this adequately is now a financial emergency for all of these customers on a program like Griddy.”But for some Griddy watchers, the furor comes as scant surprise after the scorching summer of 2019 also resulted in eye-watering bills. The phenomenon is unique to Texas, where the retail power industry is entirely deregulated.State ProbeTexas Governor Greg Abbott convened an emergency meeting for Saturday to address the latest spike. He said he’s working with members of the legislature to develop solutions to “ensure Texans are not on the hook for unreasonable spikes in their energy bills,” according to a statement.State Attorney General Ken Paxton has already opened a probe into the power failures and issued civil investigative demands to companies including Griddy.In a Feb. 18 blog post, Griddy said the prices were sky high because the Public Utility Commission of Texas forced wholesale prices to $9 a kilowatt-hour, about 300 times more than normal.“We know you are angry and so are we,” the blog said. “We intend to fight this for, and alongside, our customers for equity and accountability.”Also read| Covid-19 pandemic makes prostitution taboo in Nevada's legal brothelsGriddy referred a request for comment on Saturday to its blog post, and to Friday’s statement that it was seeking relief from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, and the PUCT for customers who were exposed to the high prices.As power is restored in Texas, new websites have sprung up to help organize potential class-action lawsuits. At least four of the new domains signal the target may be Ercot, which says it operates about 75% of the state’s electricity.Astrein plans to pay the bill out of his own funds and said Griddy hasn’t reached out to him with any relief or remedy plan. Griddy said on its website that starting next month, it will have “price protection” aimed at removing the risk from any future price events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-homes-hit-with-thousand-dollar-bills-after-winter-woes-101613864366141.html
21-02-2021||World||Trump eyeing return to spotlight with address to conservative meeting||Former US President Donald Trump will seek to return to the political spotlight in an address to a major meeting of conservatives, a source familiar with his plans said on Saturday, as the Republican plots his post-White House moves.Trump plans to speak to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 28, the last day of their meeting, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity."He’ll be talking about the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement. Also look for the 45th President to take on President (Joe) Biden’s disastrous amnesty and border policies," the source said.Trump's tumultuous four years in the White House ended shortly after he was impeached on a charge of inciting his supporters' deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, where lawmakers were gathering to certify Biden's victory in the Nov. 3 election.After spending two months falsely claiming his election loss was the result of widespread fraud, Trump was acquitted in an impeachment trial held in the Senate after he left office. The 57-43 vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for a conviction.Read more: Warmer temps bring relief as cold-weary South starts cleanupTrump has expressed anger at the 17 Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate (swapped the order back for two reasons: It's chronological order, House voted before Senate and more people in House voted that way. If you want to keep it Senate first, need to reverse the order of impeach or convict later in sentence)who voted to impeach or convict him, and on Tuesday he aimed his rhetorical fire at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the nation's most senior elected Republican.The loss of both the White House to Biden and control of the Senate - which Democrats picked up in a pair of upset Georgia election runoff victories last month - has left Republicans on edge as they plot how to win back control of Congress in 2022.Trump and McConnell parted ways in the weeks after the November election, with Trump irked that the Kentucky Republican had recognized Biden as the winner in mid-December. They have not spoken since, a former White House official said this week.Trump called McConnell "a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack" this week and warned that if Republican senators stayed with him "they will not win again."The gap between Trump and McConnell widened when the latter declared after the Senate's acquittal of the former president that Trump was "practically and morally responsible" for the Capitol siege.A number of top Republicans who are considered possible candidates for the party's 2024 presidential nomination are also due to speak at CPAC, including Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota.Two notable Republicans from the Trump administration not on the CPAC speaker list are former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence.Another source told Reuters that Trump had rebuffed a request by Haley to meet with him recently after she was critical of him in a Politico article.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-eyeing-return-to-spotlight-with-address-to-conservative-meeting-101613863934769.html
21-02-2021||World||French President Macron's approval rating 'stable' as country awaits virus curbs||French President Emmanuel Macron’s approval rating was nearly steady in February as the country braces for announcements on new measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic.Macron’s approval rating rose by 1 percentage point to 41%, its highest since November, according to the latest Ifop poll for French weekly newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche. The increase was within the poll’s margin of error of about plus or minus 2 percentage points.Approval of Prime Minister Jean Castex remained flat at 37%, equal to its lowest level since he took office in July.Ifop surveyed 1,954 people by email and telephone from Feb. 11 to Feb. 18.Macron will decide within eight to 10 days whether to relax or tighten the nation’s pandemic restrictions.France, which has been battling the spread of the coronavirus while attempting to avoid a third national lockdown, has been faced with a surge in cases in the Nice area, prompting Health Minister Olivier Veran to call for tighter local restrictions as soon as this weekend.Overall daily cases fell sharply sharply from their early-November peak, but have remained mostly stable over the past month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-s-approval-rating-stable-as-country-awaits-virus-curbs-101613863947740.html
21-02-2021||World||Despite end of one-child policy, birth rates declined in China during Covid-19||Contrary to what population experts had expected, birth rates declined in China during the Covid-19 lockdown even though the communist nation has ended the one-child policy and given incentives to couples to have two children.When Covid-19 first broke out in China, many speculated and some government officials and demographers hoped that the widespread lockdowns, which confined millions of Chinese people to their homes, would yield a boom of quarantine babies, SupChina reported.Citing preliminary data, SupChina reported that the birth rates declined between 9 per cent and 32.6 per cent in the second half of 2020 compared with 2019 in some Chinese cities, including Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, and Hefei in Anhui Province.SupChina reported that the actual situation is likely to be less bleak than what these figures portray because they don't include children born in violation of China's family planning policies, which have been relaxed but not abolished in recent years.However, some researchers stressed that the data to fully gauge the number of lowered birth rates won't be available for a few months, many population experts are convinced that the pandemic had led to a sizable reduction in children born in 2020.Also read| Britain to offer all adults a Covid-19 vaccine by end of July"Judging from the numbers that have been released so far, it's quite obvious that China's fertility rate has continued to drop. The downward trend is still in force," SupChina quoted Lu Jiehua, a sociology professor at Peking University. He also warned that in the long term, declining birth rates could leave China without enough workers, making the country unable to fund welfare programs for senior citizens.The country's birth rates have been steadily falling for years now, mostly because young people can't afford to have kids, and more financially independent women have decided to embrace a single, childless lifestyle.The combination of low fertility rates and an aging population has driven the government to roll out a wide range of policies to encourage births, including relaxing its decades-long one-child policy and offering extended benefits to couples having a second child, reported SupChina.In an article published in December last year, Civil Affairs Minister Li Jiheng urged the government to introduce more effective measures to boost the country's "dangerously low" birth rate.Moreover, in an online poll (in Chinese) involving nearly 57,000 Weibo users, Sina Finance found that more than 75 per cent of the respondents cited "high living costs" as the primary reason for their decisions to not have babies, reported SupChina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-end-of-one-child-policy-birth-rates-declined-in-china-during-covid19-101613864626445.html

Iran insists the United States must first lift former President Donald Trump's sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested earlier this month a way to overcome the U.S.-Iranian impasse over who goes first in returning to the nuclear deal, saying EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell could “synchronize” or “choreograph” the moves."We are studying Josep Borrell's proposal to hold an informal meeting of the 4 1 (nuclear deal members) with the United States and Iran, and we are consulting with our partners, including Russia and China, and we will respond to this proposal in the future," Araqchi said in an interview with state TV.Read more: Dozens protest in support of anti-migrant group in Paris"However, we believe a U.S return to the nuclear accord does not require a meeting and the only way for it is to lift the sanctions," Araqchi said.An Iranian government spokesman said earlier that Iran believes U.S. sanctions will soon be lifted despite continued "diplomatic wrangling" over reviving the nuclear deal, signalling Tehran's desire to end the impasse while not offering a new position.The White House said on Friday the United States plans to take no additional actions in response to pressure from Iran before potential talks with Tehran and major powers about returning to the deal.However, government spokesman Ali Rabiei was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency on Saturday:"We predict with confidence that diplomatic initiatives will result in a favourable outcome despite the diplomatic wrangling, which are a natural prelude to the return of the parties to their commitments, including the lifting of all sanctions in the near future."Under the deal with major powers, Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Washington reimposed sanctions after Trump quit the deal in 2018, and Iran responded by violating some of the deal's nuclear limits.Adding to pressure for a resolution to the impasse, a law passed by the hardline parliament obliges Tehran on Feb. 23 to limit the sweeping access given to U.N. inspectors under the deal.The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, arrived in Tehran on Saturday on a scheduled visit, Iran's envoy to the agency, Kazem Gharibabadi, said on Twitter.Grossi is due to discuss ways to work with Iran in light of the possibility of scaling back cooperation.Rabiei said the law "does not go against our commitment" to the agreement, nor is it "an obstacle to our appropriate response to American actions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-considers-eu-hosted-informal-meeting-with-us-says-minister-101613864458739.html

We are only concerned about this and will not let corporate control crops in the country,” he said.Tikait was presented with a “charkha” (spinning wheel) by the visiting group from Gandhidham in Gujarat.“Gandhiji had used charkha to drive the British out of India. Now, we will use the charkha to drive out corporates. We will soon go to Gujarat and mobilise support for the farmers’ protest for repeal of the new laws,” he added.Meanwhile, over 20 women from Rohtak district of Haryana also joined the stir at Ghazipur and assured their support to the movement.Thousands of farmers are camping at Delhi border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur with a demand that the Centre repeal the three new farm laws and make a new one guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) for crops, fearing the legislations would hurt their livelihood.The government, which has held 11 rounds of formal talks with the protesting farmers unions, has maintained the laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-soon-visit-gujarat-to-mobilise-support-for-farmers-protest-rakesh-tikait-101613929895286.html

But decisions on the basis of talks could be taken when objections (over the new farm laws) are pointed out," the Agriculture Minister told reporters here when asked about the protest.The unions should tell as to what is anti-farmers in the new laws, he added."You flatly say revoke the laws...It doesn't happen that crowd gathers and the laws get revoked," he said.Farmer unions should tell the government what provisions are against the farmers. The government is ready to understand this and make amendments even today. The prime minister himself has said this, the minister added."Now, if the agitating unions are well-wishers of the farmers, then they should make it clear which provisions are creating problems to them," he said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crowd-gathering-doesn-t-lead-to-revocation-of-laws-agriculture-minister-tomar-101613928036764.html

Five other agreements, including one for a $25-million line of credit for the development of roads, were signed on Saturday.The agreement between India’s EXIM Bank and the Maldivian government for the defence line of credit will facilitate capability building in the maritime domain, Jaishankar said without giving details.Cordial meeting with Defence Minister @MariyaDidi. Useful exchange on our defence cooperation. India will always be a reliable security partner for Maldives. pic.twitter.com/0TTZVAMRfJJaishankar and Maldives defence minister Mariya Didi signed the agreement to “develop, support and maintain” the Coast Guard harbour in Uthuru Thila Falhu. The two ministers also reviewed various facets of defence and security cooperation during their meeting. Jaishankar said India "will always be a reliable security partner".Didi said the harbour and dockyard will mark “another significant milestone” in bilateral defence cooperation, while Jaishankar said the facility will strengthen the capability of the Maldivian Coast Guard and facilitate regional humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts.The Maldives doesn’t have a navy and the Coast Guard functions as the armed maritime component of the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF). There is strong maritime cooperation between India and the Maldives, and in the past, New Delhi has provided patrol vessels and maritime surveillance aircraft to bolster MNDF’s capabilities.In addition to the harbour and dockyard, India will support the development of other infrastructure, communications resources and radar services at Uthuru Thila Falhu and provide training to Maldivian personnel. MNDF officials told the media that no foreign military personnel will be stationed at the facility, which will be used to dock, maintain and repair Coast Guard vessels.A joint statement said the agreement on developing the harbour was in line with several requests made by the Maldives since 2013 for India’s support to enhance the capability of its defence forces to effectively control and conduct surveillance in its exclusive economic zone.The agreement is also in line with a bilateral action plan for defence cooperation signed in April 2016 and subsequent discussions held during 2016-19.Jaishankar held a joint meeting with Maldives' finance minister Ibrahim Ameer, national planning minister Mohamed Aslam and economic development minister Fayyaz Ismail to review various infrastructure projects and economic activities being undertaken in the Maldives with Indian support.Also read: Pakistan unlikely to exit ‘grey list’ as FATF meets to decide its fate - ReportDuring a meeting with Jaishankar on Saturday, Maldives’ foreign minister Abdulla Shahid sought a second tranche of funding under India’s “high impact community development projects” scheme.

India is backing major infrastructure projects under two lines of credit worth $1.2 billion. New Delhi also extended budgetary support of $250 million last year to help the Maldives cope with the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The five agreements signed on Saturday included a letter of intent between India’s EXIM Bank and local authorities on financing a housing project of 2,000 units, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a grant of $500,000 for a fish processing plant, and an MoU on sustainable urban development.Jaishankar also handed over 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines as a grant.

21-02-2021||India||AP gram panchayat elections: Final phase concludes with more than 81% polling, isolated incidents of violence||A few incidents of violence, mostly in Guntur district, marred the fourth and final phase of elections to the gram panchayats in Andhra Pradesh on Sunday, which saw 81.78 per cent polling. Police made lathi charge at a couple of places in Guntur district to quell clashing mobs while polling agents of candidates were allegedly beaten up in some places, police sources said. In Sattenapalli constituency, agents of rival candidates clashed with each other inside a polling station and suffered injuries. Both were rushed to the hospital for treatment. At Mutluru village near Guntur, a polling agent attempted to immolate himself after rivals allegedly thrashed him inside a polling station, the sources said. This led to tension in the village as villagers alleged that police remained mute spectators while the miscreants jumped over the polling station compound wall and carried out the attack on the agent. "Some stray incidents do happen but we have acted swiftly. We will bring the culprits involved in the violent incidents to book," Guntur Urban district Superintendent of Police Ammi Reddy told reporters. He said a strong police force was deployed under the direct supervision of a Deputy Superintendent of Police to prevent untoward incidents, given the sensitive nature of the polling station. In East Godavari district, two old-aged men collapsed and died after exercising their franchise in separate villages, in what was suspected to be cases of heart attack. Rain did not dampen the spirit of voters as they lined up in good numbers to exercise their franchise in some mandals in SPS Nellore district, sources in the State Election Commission here said. In the fourth phase, polling was held to elect 2,743 village sarpanches and 22,423 ward members in 3,299 gram panchayats. Already, 554 sarpanches were declared elected unopposed. According to the State Election Commission, more than 80 per cent polling was recorded in each of the four phases of elections to the panchayats. After a protracted stand-off between the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government and the State Election Commissioner N Ramesh Kumar and the resultant legal battle, elections to the gram panchayats, the lowest tier in the Panchayat Raj structure, were completed in four phases between February 9 and 21. Though the panchayat elections were conducted on an apolitical basis, the ruling YSR Congress claimed to have won more than 82 per cent of the village bodies. The main opposition Telugu Desam Party, however, said the panchayat polls proved the people rejected the draconian rule of Jagan Mohan Reddy. Elections to the urban local bodies, scheduled for March 10, will be a direct fight between the political parties, as also the polls to mandal and zilla parishads the second and third tiers of the Panchayat Raj structure will also showcase the real strength of the parties. The SEC is yet to announce the dates for the mandal and zilla parishad elections, which have been abruptly deferred in March last year due to Covid-19 outbreak, as it is seeking legal opinion on the way ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-gram-panchayat-polls-over-81-polling-recorded-in-final-phase-101613919414023.html

The Budget 2021 of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government was criticised by various quarters over lack of stimulus for a pandemic-impacted economy and higher borrowing.Also read: 'Second wave knocking on our door' - Maha CM on fresh Covid-19 surge in stateThe finance minister said that the government's borrowing was largely aimed at providing a boost to sectors like infrastructure where public expenditure was involved.She stressed the need for uninterrupted yet sustainable growth.Sitharaman said that the budget plays the role of a facilitator to enable the private sector as the key driver of economic growth in the country.“The most important component or input required here is the participation of the private sector. Unless the private sector is energised and facilitated enough, India is just losing a very big opportunity,” she said.The finance minister said that the Covid-19 health crisis is an example of how the private sector and the government can come together to achieve common goals.She mentioned India's proactive approach to provide vaccines to other countries where the government plays the role of a facilitator."If that is the way India approaches its responsibility, it will be incomplete unless the government plays its role, that of a facilitator, and the private sector plays its role as a key driver. So that’s the message this budget has talked about,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-well-aware-of-fiscal-management-fm-nirmala-sitaraman-101613919763079.html

21-02-2021||India||Centre, UP govt working for big business houses’ welfare: Priyanka Gandhi||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday said the central and Uttar Pradesh governments were working for the welfare of big business houses and not for those who had voted them to power.Interacting with members of the Nishad community at Baswar village in the trans-Yamuna region here, Priyanka targeted the Centre and said like the three new farm laws, the laws applicable to rivers were for the benefit of industrialists rather than fishermen and boatmen.The Congress leader visited Baswar village to meet members of the Nishad community, who have alleged that they were recently beaten up and their boats damaged when a team of district administration and police took action against illegal sand miners in the area.Addressing locals, the Congress general secretary said, “Farmers are agitating against the unjust farm laws in the country and here you people were targeted. All this is because the government has forgotten that it was your vote which has given them power to rule and now they have forgotten you (voters) and instead are working for the welfare of industrialists, neglecting your welfare.”Priyanka assured them of fighting for their rights on sand mining and ensuring that the issue is raised in Parliament.“Taking cover under the National Green Tribunal’s orders, the BJP government is providing benefits to mining mafia and big industrialists, who are exploiting the natural resources,” she said.On February 4, a team of officials, accompanied by heavy police force, had raided the ghats in Baswar and Mohabbatganj in a crackdown against illegal sand mining. The villagers later alleged that policemen assaulted them, including women and damaged their boats. However, the police denied the allegations and said persons involved in illegal mining pelted them with stones. An FIR was also lodged against locals in this connection.This was Priyanka’s second visit to Prayagraj in the last 10 days. She had visited Sangam and taken a dip in the holy water on Mauni Amavsya on February 11.Referring to her Ganga Yatra in 2019, she said “When I undertook the Ganga Yatra, I was informed how you people were earlier given lease of resources of the river so that you could earn your livelihood. Now, the present government has snatched away the rights of those who live near the rivers, affecting the livelihood of thousands of families. Policy makers across the world understand that people dependent for their livelihood on the forests or rivers can never harm them. However, in contrast, big business houses are not directly dependent on these resources and, therefore, exploit these natural gifts without caring about the welfare of the rivers, forests and animals.”Congress legislature party leader Aradhana Mishra, who accompanied Priyanka along with party’s state president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior party leader Pramod Tiwari, said the party would raise the issue in the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-up-govt-working-for-big-business-houses-welfare-priyanka-gandhi-101613917504738.html
21-02-2021||India||Bengal withdraws criminal cases against TMC’s ally, Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung||The West Bengal government has started withdrawing criminal cases slapped against Bimal Gurung, president of one of the two factions of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) and hundreds of his followers who took part in the 2017 Gorkhaland movement that witnessed violence.Charged under several sections of the Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), Gurung appeared in public last year after remaining underground for three years and offered to support chief minister Mamata Banerjee and help her win the assembly seats in Darjeeling and other parts of north Bengal. He has already been provided security cover by the state.Binoy Tamang, Gurung’s rival and leader of the GJM’s other faction, is an ally of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) since 2017. Tamang, however, is opposed to Gurung’s re-entry in hill politics.Gurung earlier supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and helped it win the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009. After resurfacing in Kolkata on October 21 last year he took a U-turn and accused the BJP of betraying the Gorkhas.The process of withdrawal of the cases against him, his supporters and GJM general secretary Roshan Giri has started, said lawyers in Darjeeling.A senior lawyer, who did not want to be named, said, “It is not Gurung alone who is being spared. Cases slapped against Binoy Tamang and Anit Thapa, general secretary of the other faction, too are being withdrawn as well.”Thapa is chairman of the board of administrators of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA).Pranoy Rai, public prosecutor at the Darjeeling district court, said around 80 cases have already been withdrawn.“More than 156 cases were pending against Gurung. The state law department had asked for my opinion. I gave my views and an application was sent to the governor which is legally required. Around 80 cases have already been withdrawn,” said Rai.Under Section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC), a public prosecutor in charge of a case may, with consent of a court, withdraw the case before the judgment is passed.The process of withdrawal of cases has also started at other courts in Kurseong, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar. The last submission for withdrawal of all pending cases is likely to be made on Monday, lawyers aware of the developments said.A legal expert, who did not want to be named, said that under section 321 the accused first makes a submission before the state, seeking withdrawal of charges. The executive order is subsequently issued by the law department and public prosecutors file petition before the court.Lawyers representing Gurung, Giri, Tamang and Thapa said most of the cases slapped against them are political in nature and hence their withdrawal will not be a difficult process.As far as the UAPA cases are concerned, the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition from Gurung last year, ordered a stay on all investigations under scheduled offences of the National Investigation Agency Act including UAPA. The interim order passed by the Supreme Court is still in force. “No action should be taken until further orders on it are passed,” said Rai.Roshan Giri said, “We do not know anything about this since nothing has been communicated to us officially.”BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “Mamata Banerjee is taking desperate measures to win the elections but nothing can change the outcome of the coming polls. People have made up their minds.”Asok Bhattacharya, senior CPI (M) leader and legislator from Siliguri, said “Mamata Banerjee, who framed the charges, has now decided to withdraw them since Gurung is campaigning for the TMC.”Gautam Deb, senior TMC leader from north Bengal and tourism minister, said, “I will not comment on this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-withdraws-criminal-cases-against-tmc-s-ally-gorkha-leader-bimal-gurung-101613914371850.html

It has already lost its majority,” he told reporters.DMK MK Venkatesh also submitted his resignation to the Speaker saying he was dissatisfied with the government.The ruling alliance MLAs are scheduled to meet to decide on Monday’s course of action. “We have to take a decision on whether to attend the trust vote tomorrow or submit our resignation to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G),” said a Congress leader in Puducherry.In the 33-member House, there are 30 elected members and three nominated members belonging to the BJP. The Congress presently has 9 MLAs. It includes assembly Speaker S P Sivakolundhi who isn’t allowed to vote unless there is a tie. The Congress has the support of two DMK MLAs and an independent MLA from Mahe. The opposition has seven MLAs from All Indian NR Congress led by former chief minister N Rangasamy, four of AIADMK and the three nominated members of the BJP who are allowed to vote.Newly appointed Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundarajan has asked the Congress to prove its majority by 5 pm on Monday. The voting will take place by a show of hands. If all ruling and opposition MLAs are present in the House, the Congress government will lose as it will get only 12 votes.“Elections are less than two months away so we will work towards the elections where people will give us the majority,” said a senior Congress leader not wishing to be named.A senior BJP leader in Puducherry said on condition of anonymity that they may not stake claim to form the government. “In a week poll dates will be announced so what is the point of running a government for about 60 days?” the BJP leader said.A spell of President’s rule seems imminent in the current scenario.The Congress alleged that the BJP used money and threats to destabilize the government.“The BJP has used muscle and money power and threatened the MLAs,” said Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee president A V Subramanian.Since January four other Congress MLAs including two ministers have quit. Two legislators - A Namassivayam and E Theepaindan resigned in January and joined the BJP. Another Congress MLA, N Dhanavelu, was disqualified in July last year for anti-party activities. Chief minister V Narayanasamy had earlier said that the party is yet to accept the resignation of health minister Malladi Krishna Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-govt-in-puducherry-faces-exit-as-2-more-mlas-quit-ahead-of-floor-test-101613915604709.html

Addressing the state virtually, Thackeray said that cases were increasing and it would be ascertained in two weeks whether there is a second wave of Covid-19 or not.“We want to keep everything open, but the cases are on the rise. There is a sudden spike in cases over the last two weeks,” said Thackeray.Speaking about the decision of the state government to impose lockdown in some districts of Maharashtra to curb the spread of Covid-19, the chief minister said that nobody likes to be placed under lockdown but some restrictions would have to be followed.Also Read| Social gatherings banned, special drive to be launched: Maharashtra under curbsThe chief minister said that lockdown is known to break the chain of transmission of the virus but pointed out that it would be very difficult to implement it again. “If we do not follow the norms, we will have to impose the strictest lockdown,” Thackeray said during the virtual address adding that a decision in this regard would be taken in the next eight days after reviewing the overall situation.Lockdown has already been imposed in districts such as Amravati and Yavatmal which have been among the major contributors in the state’s recent Covid-19 surge. Amravati, which saw 806 cases on Saturday, has been placed under one-week lockdown starting Monday while a 10-day lockdown had earlier been imposed in Yavatmal on February 18.If the (COVID-19) situation deteriorates, then we have to impose lockdown.

The state government has also started taking strict action against wedding and banquet halls in Mumbai and other areas for violating virus related restrictions, Thackeray said.Maharashtra on Sunday had recorded 6,971 coronavirus (Covid-19) disease cases and 35 more deaths which pushed the overall tally to over 2.1 million. This is the third consecutive day that cases have remained above the 6,000-mark.

21-02-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi writes 3-page letter to PM Modi on fuel prices. Read full text here||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the record-breaking prices of fuel being sold in the country and accused the government of profiting from people's misery and suffering.The letter from the Congress chief comes a day after petrol price reached an all-time high of ₹97 in Mumbai, while diesel was selling at ₹88.06 in the country's financial capital. The fuel prices have been rising in the city for the last 12 days. Petrol was sold for ₹96 per litre on Wednesday and diesel ₹87 on Thursday.Petrol prices have already touched ₹100 in two states of the country - Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The petrol price touched ₹100 a litre in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar district and rose to record highs elsewhere on Wednesday.Drawing parallels with the UPA government, Gandhi said, "What baffles most citizens, is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of International crude oil. To put it in context, the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA Government’s tenure."Here is the full text of the letter written by Sonia Gandhi:Dear Prime Minister,I hope this letter finds you well.I write to you to convey every citizen’s anguish & deep distress regarding the spiralling fuel & gas prices. On one hand, India is witnessing systematic erosion of jobs, wages and household income. The middle class and those at the margins of our society are struggling. These challenges have been compounded by run away inflation and an unprecedented rise in price of almost all household items and essential commodities. Sadly, in these distressing times, the Government has chosen to profiteer off people’s misery & suffering.Fuel prices are at an historic and unsustainable high. In fact, Petrol has breached the ₹100/litre mark in many parts of the country. The surging price of Diesel has added to the escalating woes of millions of farmers. What baffles most citizens, is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of International crude oil. To put it in context, the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA Government’s tenure. Therefore, your Government’s act of raising prices (continuously for 12 days till February 20th) is little less than a brazen act of profiteering.I fail to understand how any government can justify such thoughtless and insensitive measures directly at the cost of our people. Your Government has increased excise duty on Diesel by 820% & on Petrol by 258% over and collected upwards of ₹21 lakh crore in the last six and a half years. This unaccounted-for windfall is yet to be passed to the people for whose benefit it was ostensibly collected.As I had expressed earlier, it was cruel on the Government’s part to refuse to reduce fuel prices even when global crude oil had crashed to $20/barrel last year. The whole principle of deregulation & dynamic pricing is predicated on the principle that reductions in crude oil prices will proportionately benefit the end consumers. The fact that your Government fails to do so implies a deliberate and conscious decision to deny the common man his legitimate due.Instead, ironically, your Government has been unreasonably over-zealous in levying excessive excise duty on Petrol and Diesel, i.e., ₹33 on every litre of Petrol and ₹32 on every litre of Diesel, which is higher than the base price of these fuels. This is nothing short of extortion to cover up economic mismanagement. As the principal party in opposition, I urge upon you to follow ‘Raj Dharma’ and reduce fuel prices by partially rolling back excise duty.The astronomical rise in domestic non-subsidised LPG Gas cylinder to ₹769 in Delhi (and over ₹800 in many states like Uttar Pradesh) is even more cruel and has impacted every household. Can there be any justification for the Government increasing the price of a cylinder by ₹175 in two and a half months since December 2020?The truth is that as GDP nose dives, the prices of Gas, Diesel & Petrol continue to rise unchecked.What is equally distressing is that despite being in power for almost 7-years now, your government continues to blame previous regimes for its own economic mismanagement. To set the record straight, domestic crude oil production has fallen to an 18-year low in the year 2020.Governments are elected to ease the burden of our people and at the very least, not work directly contrary to their interests. I urge you to roll back these increases and pass on the benefit to our middle & salaried class, our farmers & poor and our fellow citizens. It is they who are battling an unprecedented economic slowdown, widespread unemployment, wage reductions & job losses, high prices and erosion of income.I hope you will agree that it is time for your Government to focus on solutions instead of looking for excuses. India deserves better.With good wishes,Yours Sincerely,Sonia Gandhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-writes-3-page-letter-to-pm-modi-on-fuel-prices-read-full-text-here-101613911102646.html

And, hence, such people become a protective layer between the infected person and unaffected people, thereby breaking the chain of viral transmission.Guleria here also gave the example of Brazilian city Manaus which even after having achieved the herd immunity in October is now battling the second Covid-19 wave."They (Brazil) had claimed that they got heard immunity with almost 70 per cent of the population being protected because of the past infection, and yet because of the Brazilian variant and waning immunity a large number of people got infected again. And now they are in a very bad situation because of resurgence of cases," he noted.Here, he also asserted that no sero surveys done so far has suggested India being "anyway near" achieving the herd immunity.Over 21 per cent of the population, aged 10 years and above, showed evidence of past exposure to Covid-19 in the Indian Council of Medical Research''s (ICMR) latest national sero-survey out on February 4.Stressing on the importance of vaccination, which he said is essential in India's fight against the coronavirus, he said they too will change with time tackling not only the "emerging variants" but giving more robust immunity lasting for a longer period of time."What we have today is not the only vaccine, we will have better vaccines as time moves on and as research moves on. But right now we should take what we have if we want to really make sure that the situation in our country does not deteriorate," he added.The JLF, now in its 14th edition, features over 300 speakers and performers representing around 25 Indian and 18 international languages and over 23 nationalities. Some of the big names making it to the festival this year include the likes of American linguist Noam Chomsky, 2020 Booker Prize winner Douglas Stuart, Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Malala Yousafzai, Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates, and actor-author Priyanka Chopra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/herd-immunity-difficult-to-achieve-aiims-director-randeep-guleria-101613910417999.html

We have urged Satish Poonia to ensure that all are given equal opportunity,” said a senior MLA on condition of anonymity.Adjournment motion is to draw the attention of the House to a recent matter of urgent public importance. The budget session of the assembly that began on February 10 is currently on.“Some of the old and experienced MLAs are feeling ignored. I agree with them and so I have signed the letter. Floor management is the responsibility of the leader of opposition and whip and the MLAs feel they are being ignored,” Meghwal said.He said the MLAs feel that they are not being given the importance they deserve in the assembly proceedings. “This feeling should come to an end all be given equal chance,” he said.Senior BJP MLA Narpat Singh Rajvi said, “I have signed the letter as I didn’t like the idea that an adjournment motion should come up after a nod from the leader of opposition when it should be the Speaker’s prerogative. This is against the practice of assembly and has never happened in the last 70 years.”Another signatory to the letter questioned how could the leader of opposition or deputy leader of opposition decide which MLA would bring an adjournment motion. He claimed that only those MLAs who are in sync with the leader of opposition are allowed to bring in an adjournment motion.“There is resentment among the MLAs as their voices have been muzzled,” he said.Deputy leader of opposition, Rajendra Rathore refuted the allegations. “There is no such thing and everyone is given a chance to speak. Around 47 MLAs spoke on the Governor’s speech,” he said.On raising an adjournment motion, he said it is the prerogative of the assembly Speaker. “I am not aware of any such letter. There might be some misunderstanding,” said Rathore.BJP state chief Satish Poonia who is in Delhi to attend a party meeting could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaundhara-raje-s-loyalist-mlas-complain-of-being-sidelined-in-rajasthan-assembly-101613910729470.html
21-02-2021||India||Rise in fuel prices 'not too much overall', says Haryana CM Khattar||As the fuel prices in India are breaking past records by touching all-time high levels, Haryana chief minister ML Khattar on Sunday said that the increase is not too much overall."Fuel prices increased by around 10%-15% in the last 4-5 years. Overall, it is not too much but govt is keeping an eye on it," Khattar was quoted as saying by ANI.Explaining that the revenue collected by the government will reach people eventually, Khattar said, "Whatever revenue is collected by the government, it is used for people," the chief minister said.He added that the Value Added tax or VAT in Haryana is comparatively lower than other states.Taxes account for more than 60% of the pump prices of fuel. A part of these is central taxes and the other part is taxes levied by the state.Also read | 'Govts elected to ease burden of people': Sonia Gandhi to PM on fuel price hikeThe remarks by Khattar come a day after petrol price reached an all-time high of ₹97 in Mumbai, while diesel was selling at ₹88.06 in the country's financial capital. The fuel prices have been rising in the city for the last 12 days. Petrol was sold for ₹96 per litre on Wednesday and diesel ₹87 on Thursday.Petrol prices have already touched ₹100 in two states of the country - Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The petrol price touched ₹100 a litre in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar district and rose to record highs elsewhere on Wednesday. ₹100 per litre retail price was the first time the fuel was sold at rates in the three digits anywhere in the country.Mounting criticism on the government, the opposition has been attacking the central government by questioning the record-breaking surge.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who had increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by a record margin last year to mop up gains arising from international oil prices plunging to two-decade low, remained non-committal on cutting taxes to give relief to consumers.Also read: West Bengal govt reduces tax by Re 1 per litre on petrol, diesel"This is a very vexatious issue. An issue in which no answer except reducing the price (of fuel) will convince anyone. I know I am treading on an area and whatever I may say, to bring in the reality into picture, will only sound like I am obfuscating," the finance minister had said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rise-in-fuel-prices-not-too-much-overall-says-haryana-cm-khattar-101613908017298.html

21-02-2021||India||Delhi appears to be heading towards reopening, taking on challenges of post-Covid era||With the number of coronavirus cases in the national capital coming down, Delhi appears to be heading towards reopening completely and taking on challenges of the post-Covid era.From schools to colleges, courts to public transport, the places and services which were partially functioning so far in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, are getting into action towards a complete reopening.According to Saturday’s health bulletin, Delhi recorded 152 fresh coronavirus cases, recording a marginal dip in the positivity rate while one death was reported.According to officials, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is likely to hold a meeting on Monday to decide the future course of action with regards to Covid preparedness and precautions.Various Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), however, have cautioned that the government should take a safe approach and not open everything completely yet.The Delhi Court has announced that from March 15, all of its judges will hold physical hearing of cases and the existing system under which only 11 benches -- two division benches of two judges each and nine single-judge benches -- hear matters via the physical mode will continue till March 12.The high court had, on March 25, 2020 restricted its functioning as well as that of the district courts till April 14, 2020.It was subsequently extended from time to time till January 16, 2021. The high court had, on March 25, 2020 restricted its functioning as well as that of the district courts till April 14, 2020.It was subsequently extended from time to time till January 16, 2021.The Delhi Transport Corporation has also sent a proposal for consideration in a DDMA meeting to allow travel by commuters in the aisle or standing position in public transport buses in view of the declining Covid-19 cases in the city.The DDMA had in November last year had allowed the running of DTC and cluster buses with full seating capacity. Before that, the service of public transport buses was resumed under unlockdown relaxations in May at half their seating capacity.Similarly, the metro services resumed in September last year allowing commuters to travel while following Covid protocols.Schools in the national capital, which closed in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown, reopened for class 10 and 12 students from January 18 followed by class 9 and 11 from February 5. The Centre had allowed schools to reopen from October 15 last year, however, Delhi government delayed the move till cases came down to a lower level.The CBSE has already announced that the board exams will be conducted from May 4, three months later than the usual time.The Delhi government which was earlier contemplating scrapping nursery admissions this year so children do not spend another year before mobile and computer screens, has also given a go ahead to the admission process and the application window opened on February 18.Universities like DU and JNU have also reopened partially for students. While JNU began phasewise reopening of campus in November last year, Delhi University began the process earlier this month.Various departments under Delhi government, are also working with full strength now. Various markets, both regular as well as weekly markets are also opening now.According to Himanshu Vaish, President Panchshila Cooperative Housing Society RWA, in view of the severity of the virus and lives lost to it, caution must be maintained."People themselves have learnt a lot of lessons in the pandemic and so it would be better to take forward the safety measures and precautions till there is a final solution to the Covid-19," he said.Echoing his views, Pankaj Agarwal, general secretary, Safdarjung RWA, said, the cases of Covid-19 are rising in some states like Maharashtra."After lockdown relaxations some people have become casual towards the safety measures. The government has to face pressure from different quarters to lift restrictions but I think the suggestions of experts must be followed," he said.The overall infection tally in the city stands at 6,37,755, while the death toll is at 10,898. On Friday, 158 cases and one death were registered.No death due to Covid-19 was recorded in Delhi on Wednesday, the third time single-day fatality count stood nil in February.On February 9 too, no fatality from the infection was registered in the national capital, first time this month, and after a gap of nearly nine months.No death from Covid-19 was recorded on February 13 as well, the second time in the month when the single-day fatality count was nil.Delhi recorded 94 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, the lowest in over nine months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-appears-to-be-heading-towards-reopening-taking-on-challenges-of-post-covid-era-101613908777229.html
21-02-2021||India||'Govts elected to ease burden of people': Sonia Gandhi to PM on fuel price hike||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over rising prices of petrol and diesel, accusing the central government of "profiteering off people's misery and suffering".Also Read: West Bengal govt reduces tax by Re 1 per litre on petrol, dieselIn the three-page letter, Gandhi lashed out at the central government saying it has been "unreasonably over-zealous in levying excessive excise duty on petrol and diesel"."On one hand, India is witnessing systematic erosion of jobs, wages and household income. The middle class and those at the margins of our society are struggling. These challenges have been compounded by run away inflation and an unprecedented rise in price of almost all household items and essential commodities. Sadly, in these distressing times, the government has chosen to profiteer off people’s misery & suffering," Gandhi said in the letter."What baffles most citizens, is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of International crude oil. To put it in context, the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA government's tenure. Therefore, your government's act of raising prices (continuously for 12 days till February 20th) is little less than a brazen act of profiteering," she further said.Watch: Sitharaman on hike in prices of petrol and dieselThe Congress president also said that the Centre has increased excise duty on diesel by 820 per cent and on petrol by 258 per cent and collected upwards of ₹21 lakh crore in the last six and a half years.The deregulation of fuel prices, said Gandhi, was meant to benefit the common man. "The fact that your government fails to do so implies a deliberate and conscious decision to deny the common man his legitimate due.""The astronomical rise in domestic non-subsidised LPG gas cylinder to ₹769 in Delhi (and over ₹800 in many states like Uttar Pradesh) is even more cruel and has impacted every household. Can there be any justification for the Government increasing the price of a cylinder by ₹175 in two and a half months since December 2020?" Gandhi said in the letter.The senior politician also said that governments are elected "to ease the burden of our people and at the very least, not work directly contrary to their interests".The prices of petrol and diesel have seen relentless hike in the last few weeks. At some places, petrol has even crossed the  ₹100-mark.Gandhi's letter further intensifies the Congress' protest against rising fuel prices. The party took out marches and observed bandh at several places on Saturday to attack the Centre.In Rajasthan, Congress leaders were seen riding on tractors, camels and elephants besides participating in foot marches and raising slogans against PM Modi.In the national capital, activists of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) staged a protest at Shastri Bhawan and demanded the resignation of Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Meanwhile, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman called the the price hike a "vexatious issue" and said that the Centre and state governments will have to together work out a mechanism to bring retail rates to reasonable levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-price-hike-sonia-gandhi-writes-letter-to-pm-modi-101613908819936.html

21-02-2021||India||Delimitation in J-K is BJP’s exercise to divide communities, says Mehbooba Mufti||Jammu and Kashmir’s former chief minister and People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday alleged that the delimitation exercise in the union territory was a part of Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) plan to divide communities and religions and pit them against each other.Mufti raised apprehensions at the hurry in carrying out the delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir.“The tearing hurry with which GOI is railroading delimitation in J&K has raised genuine & serious apprehensions about the motives of this exercise. It’s a part of BJPs larger plan to divide & pit regions, religions & communities against each other,” she said in a tweet.The delimitation commission for the union territory was formed by the Union government on March 6 last year, just six months after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was revoked and the erstwhile state split into two union territories – J-K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. Earlier the delimitation of the constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir was scheduled to be held in 2026. However following the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act increased the number of voting constituencies for J&K from 87 to 90.Justice (retired) Ranjana Prakash Desai is the chairperson of the Commission while Election Commissioner Subash Chandra and State Election Commissioner KK Sharma are its members.The commission has five associate members including three National Conference MPs and two BJP leaders - Union Minister Jitendra Singh and Jammu MP Jugal Kishore. Of the five, three member parliaments (MPs) from National Conference (NC) – Farooq Abdullah, Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi have already announced to dissociate from the exercise on the grounds that the J&K Reorganization Act 2019 is under scrutiny in the Supreme Court.In a letter to the commission chairperson after being called for a meeting scheduled on Thursday, the NC members had written that “it would not be in tune with the mandate and spirit of the constitution of India to associate with the proceedings taken in exercise of the powers under an Act, the constitutional validity whereof is under challenge…”.They also wanted the commission not to go ahead with the exercise. “We would also respectfully request the honorable chairperson, a renowned legal luminary of the country, not to go ahead with the proceedings…,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-in-j-k-is-bjp-s-exercise-to-divide-communities-says-mehbooba-mufti-101613907331563.html
21-02-2021||India||West Bengal govt reduces tax by Re 1 per litre on petrol, diesel||The West Bengal government on Sunday announced a reduction of tax by Re 1 per litre on petrol and diesel."West Bengal government decides Re 1 cut in prices of petrol and diesel to be applicable from midnight," news agency ANI quoted West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra as saying.Mitra said that the move will provide some respite to people stung by burgeoning prices of fuel.The prices of petrol and diesel are increasing continuously for more than 10 days; in some states, the price of petrol has even crossed the ₹100-mark.In Mumbai, petrol is at all-time high of ₹97 per litre, while diesel rate crossed ₹88-mark.Congress and other opposition parties have been slamming the central government for rising fuel prices. The Congress even took out marches and observed bandh at several places on Saturday to protest against rising fuel prices.In 12 days (till February 20), retail petrol prices rose by ₹3.63 a litre, a record since the pricing was deregulated in 2010, and diesel rates went up by ₹3.84."The Centre earns ₹32.90 per litre in taxes from petrol, while the state gets ₹18.46 only. In case of diesel, the central government's earning is ₹31.80 per litre as against ₹12.77 for the state," Mitra said on Sunday.The bengal government's move comes a day after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that Centre and state governments will have to together work out a mechanism to bring retail rates to reasonable levels.However, Sitharaman, who had increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by a record margin last year to mop up gains arising from international oil prices plunging to two-decade low, remained non-committal on cutting taxes to give relief to consumers."This is a very vexatious issue. An issue in which no answer except reducing the price (of fuel) will convince anyone. I know I am treading on an area and whatever I may say, to bring in the reality into picture, will only sound like I am obfuscating," she said.As much as 60 per cent of the retail price of petrol and about 56 per cent of diesel prices is made up of central and state taxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-govt-reduces-tax-by-re-1-per-litre-on-petrol-diesel-101613906860525.html

All arrangements were made to provide medical facilities. He had said his government is dedicated to the poor in 2014,” Singh said.India’s response to the Chinese aggression in Ladakh was also discussed.The political resolution also took note of the Bihar assembly elections where the BJP-led NDA returned to power. “The outcome of the Bihar elections saw people refusing to give a chance to those with negative thinking. In Kashmir, people have shown faith in democracy. Upcoming Elections were discussed and the support that the BJP is getting, in West Bengal shows people are fed up. In Assam, the government is hopeful of winning with a mandate,” Singh said.Referring to Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Singh said the party organisation has been strengthened. “In this meeting, the PM and party president were thanked for giving the party a new direction,” he said.A resolution on Atmanirbhar Bharat is also expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-passes-political-resolution-on-centre-s-covid-19-response-101613905516147.html

21-02-2021||India||Alappuzha, Nagpur, SBS Nagar: Centre names 'cause of special Covid-19 concerns'||The Covid-19 situation in India has come to a point where a sudden spurt of daily cases is being noticed only in a few pockets of a district or a state. A day after the ministry of health identified the states of Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh where the cases are on the rise, the ministry on Sunday zeroed in on the areas which need to exercise special caution.These areas are reporting a higher weekly positivity rate than the national average. The weekly positivity rate is the percentage of people testing Covid-19 positive in a week out of all those getting tested. The national average is 1.79 per cent which denotes that only 1.79 per cent of people out of all those who are getting tested in a week in India are testing positive. Some of the districts, identified by the ministry as areas of concern, are reporting even an eight per cent weekly positivity rate.Centre tells states to scale up testing as Covid-19 trajectory witnesses surgeAlappuzha: This Kerala city is reporting around 400 daily Covid-19 cases, which is not the highest in Kerala. Kozhikode, Ernakulam, Malappuram have more daily positive cases. But Alappuzha is a cause of special concern, according to the ministry, as its weekly positivity rate has increased to 10.7 per cent.In the last four weeks, the weekly positivity rate in Kerala has ranged from 13.9 per cent to 8.9 per cent, the ministry said.Nagpur: Nagpur on Saturday reported 725 fresh Covid-19 cases and six deaths. On Friday, the number was 754. According to the health ministry, weekly cases have increased by 33 per cent in Nagpur.Amravati: In Maharashtra's Amravati, which is observing weekend lockdown this Saturday, Sunday, weekly cases have increased by 47 per cent. Amravati is one of the major contributors to the increasing number of the daily caseload in Maharashtra.Nashik: On Saturday, the Nashik division's cumulative case tally stood at 2,84,160. Nashik has registered a 23 per cent weekly increased in the number of fresh cases.Akola: Akola division's weekly increase of Covid-19 case is around 55 per cent. On Saturday, the Akola division, which includes the Amravati district and Amravati municipal corporation, reported 1,726 fresh cases.Yavatmal: Yavatmal has registered a 48 per cent rise in weekly Covid-19 cases. It is under a 10-day lockdown till February 28.Overall, Maharashtra's weekly positivity rate has increased from 4.7 per cent to eight per cent.SBS Nagar: In Punjab's SBS Nagar, the weekly positivity rate has become 4.9 per cent from 3.5 per cent and the weekly cases have more than doubled from 165 to 364.Apart from these specific areas, Chandigarh, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra have weekly positivity rate higher than the national average.The sudden increase in the number of cases in a particular area indicates that either a more contagious mutant strain is behind the new infections or there is laxity in containment. The ministry has asked all the states to strengthen both surveillance and monitoring of the mutant strains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alappuzha-nagpur-sbs-nagar-centre-names-cause-of-special-covid-19-concern-101613904654051.html

Once the e-vidhan is implemented then the agenda will also become paperless, and the question and answers will also become paperless."At this time, it will be only the budget, which will be paperless, rest of the things are yet to be made paperless including the agenda and copies of bills," Dixit said.He also informed that as the finance minister will read his budget speech on his tablet and the MLAs will be able to see it on their tablets.To a question on whether e-Vidhan will be implemented by the Monsoon Session of the Assembly, Dixit said, "Nothing can be said as of now. It may or may not be implemented. But, the Centre wants that it should be speedily implemented. We also want that it should be implemented at the earliest."Implementation of e-Vidhan will help in putting many things including the agenda in the public domain."Things which the public used to know through the newspaper will be known to them rather fast. 60 per cent of cost will be borne by the Centre, while 40 per cent of the cost will be borne by the state," he said.'e-Vidhan' is one of the 44 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) under Digital India Programme launched by Government of India with a vision to transform the country into a Digitally Empowered Society and knowledge economy.The Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs has been made the 'Nodal Ministry' for the implementation of e-Vidhan MMP re-designating it as National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) in all the 31 States/ UTs with Legislatures on the line of Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly to make the functioning of State Legislative Houses paperless.e-Vidhan software of Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha was upgraded as National eVidhan Application (NeVA), a single application covering all 39 Houses (Lok Sabha Rajya Sabha 31 Assemblies 6 Councils) to bring all the legislatures of the country together, on one platform, thereby creating a massive data depository without having the complexity of multiple applications.Earlier this month, the Uttar Pradesh government had asked members of the state''s legislative assembly and council to purchase tablets for a paperless budget session.On February 2, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had directed that the state cabinet should hold a virtual meeting in future for which ministers must be given training.Adityanath had said, "Modern technology is extremely helpful in performing various works quickly and in a transparent manner. Ministers should be imparted training for e-cabinet meetings at their official residence and office. Information regarding the security features for the e-cabinet meeting should be given to them."He said the initiative will help the state cabinet go paperless."Efforts should also be made to make the state budget paperless on the lines of the Union Budget," he had said.On February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had read out the Union Budget speech in the Lok Sabha from a tablet instead of a conventional paper document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/everything-including-agenda-of-house-questions-answers-to-become-paperless-up-assembly-speaker-101613904260727.html
21-02-2021||India||Govt working on law to regulate social media: Ram Madhav||Senior BJP leader Ram Madhav said that social media has become so powerful that it can even topple governments, leading to anarchy and weakening democracy, and solutions to tackle this are needed to be found within the constitutional framework.Speaking at the launch of his new book 'Because India Comes First', Madhav said democracy is stressed and facing new challenges with the rise of "non-political" and "non-state" forces."Social media is so powerful that it can even topple governments and regulating them is difficult as they are borderless. These forces can promote anarchy, which will weaken democracy but solutions should be within the constitutional framework," he said at the event hosted by the Prabha Khaitan Foundation on Saturday evening.The existing laws are not adequate for this, he said."We require new rules and laws to tackle and manage. The government is already working in this direction," he added.Madhav's comments come amid a row between the government and Twitter over blocking of accounts with Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad asking the micro-blogging site to follow the Indian law.Besides, the Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Centre and Twitter on a plea, seeking to regulate hate content and to make a law as per which action can be initiated against Twitter and their representatives in India for willfully abetting and promoting anti-India tweets and penalise them.Madhav said that in his new book he has penned his observations on several decisions of the Modi government.Answering a question on Gandhi, he said the RSS does not undermine any leader's contribution.Gandhi was a great leader and his mantra of Ahimsa has been adopted by many global leaders, he said."There may be differences of opinion, which we even find between Nehru and Gandhi from the letters exchanged between them but that does not mean we disrespect a national leader. In the RSS morning prayer, we have Gandhi's name along with other leaders," Madhav said.On Kashmir, he said that with the abrogation of Article 370, grassroot leaders are coming up against the hegemony of a few families.He also emphasised that it is the responsibility of the people of the country to make Kashmiris feel that they are part of the 1.3-billion-strong family."Kashmiris are victims of propaganda for long. Things are changing but may take some time," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-working-on-law-to-regulate-social-media-ram-madhav-101613903608637.html

"Firms will be privatised in sectors other than atomic energy, space and defence; transport and telecommunications; power, petroleum, coal and other minerals; and banking, insurance and financial services," she had said in her budget speech.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government ministers had praised the budget saying it will help the country's economy and create a lot of employment opportunities. The opposition, however, criticised the privatisation plans. "Modi Govt plans to hand over India's assets to his crony capitalist friends," Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said.Meanwhile, bank unions staged a protest in all the state capitals on Friday against the government's privatisation of public sector banks. About 10 lakh bank employees and officers under the banner of United Forum of Unions consisting of nine unions including All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), agitated against government's proposal.

This is the second resignation party has seen in one week.Talking to news agency ANI, the former Congress MLA said, "I took this decision because the party didn't give me due recognition in the government and in the organisation."Not ruling out his chances of joining other parties in the UT, Lakshminarayanan said, "I will be joining, as per decision of people of my constituency."Lakshminarayanan said he has also resigned from the party membership. The MLA's resignation comes on a day when the ruling party members are slated to meet CM Narayansamy to discuss the future course of action, though similar discussions on February 18 yielded no results."This government led by Narayanasamy has lost the majority," Lakshminarayanan told reporters.A slew of resignations has put the Congress government on thin ice in the Union territory as the party scrambles to hold onto power.The party has witnessed resignations from four Congress MLAs, including ex-ministers A Namassivayam (now in BJP) and Malladi Krishna Rao had quit, while another party legislator was earlier disqualified.The BJP, in coalition with other opposition parties, has shown signs of dominance in the UT to form the government as it has a comfortable majority mark with 14 MLAs.The process to hold floor test in Puducherry was fast-tracked this week after former Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, who was handed over the additional charge of Puducherry, directed Narayanasamy to prove the majority on February 22.Shortly after the Congress MLAs resignation, Puducherry Assembly Speaker VP Sivakolundhu said, "I have received resignations from two MLAs. I have informed the Chief Minister and the Assembly secretary about it. I am examining their resignations."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-govt-crisis-1-more-congress-mla-resigns-ahead-of-govt-s-floor-test-101613902502818.html

Under this technology, 1.2-metre QDA (V Sat) and 1.2-metre V-SAT very small aperture terminal is used.The expert team was formed by Uttarakhand’s chief secretary Om Prakash and includes scientists from Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, Geological Survey of India and others apart from officers from the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and the SDRF.The team reached the lake area on Saturday and are now analysing the lake to find out ways to drain it so that it doesn’t breach in future and lead to another tragedy like the one in Chamoli on February 7 when a glacier broke off to trigger a devastating that killed dozens. Many others are still missing.“The experts will analyse the lake and direct the SDRF and ITBP men to drain it out by widening its mouth,” SDRP spokesperson Praveen Alok said.Ridhim Agarwal, DIG SDRF Uttarakhand said an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter took two Navy divers to the lake on Saturday to measure its depth.“The chopper hovered over the lake and Navy divers descended close to the lake surface and used their hand-held echolocation devices for measuring the depth of the lake. The lake depth has been found to be around 8 to 9 metres”.Agarwal said they knew the other dimensions of the lake and to understand the quantum of water, they needed to know the depth of the lake. “Now as we know the depth, we are roughly aware of the quantum of water there. Our experts are looking into how this water can be drained out by widening its mouth”, she said.In October last year the Uttarakhand SDRF had acquired the QDA technology to effectively tackle the challenges from disasters and reach out to affected people in the remote areas of the Himalayan state at the earliest.The state government has already distributed 248 satellite phones in the remote areas of the state so that timely communication is possible between authorities involved in dealing with disasters and emergencies and the people living in remote areas with poor or no mobile phone connectivity. To further strengthen the communication, the SDRF has now acquired QDA technology.“SDRF has procured six QDA systems including three static and three mobile ones. The static QDA will be set up at SDRF headquarters in Dehradun while mobile QDAs can be sent to the affected area by a helicopter so that communication regarding the disaster, rescue and search and other emergencies could be established quickly. This will help in effectively managing rescue and search operations in real time and will help the authorities here in reducing casualties due to various disasters”, Agarwal said.In October last year, a trial of QDA systems was conducted by establishing communication between SDRF control room in Dehradun and Gunji area in Pithoragarh, Malari area in Chamoli and Tiuni area in Dehradun district. After the successful trial, the QDA technology was inaugurated by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, who interacted with the village heads and others in these areas through QDA and discussed the main problems facing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-prepare-to-drain-lake-in-uttarakhand-after-chopper-delivers-special-gear-101613902019037.html

The lawyer has to deposit the amount with the Welfare Fund of High Court Bar Association, as per the order.“Every profession has certain dress code and people belonging to a particular profession are recognized by their attires. The lawyers’ dress code is governed by the rules prescribed under the Advocates Act, 1961, making it mandatory for lawyers to wear black robe or coat with white shirt and white neck band. The Rule framed under Section 49(1)(gg) of the Advocates Act, 1961 prescribes the dress code for Advocates irrespective of designated Senior Advocates or other Advocates,” HC judge justice SK Panigrahi noted in his order while imposing the penalty.“The profession is solemn in nature and its profundity is complemented by its attire. Being an Advocate, he is expected to appear before the Court in a dignified manner with proper dress, even if it is a virtual mode,” the order said.Soon after the Covid-19 lockdown was announced in March, the Orissa high court switched to virtual hearing from March 26 with a limited number of judges taking up cases by virtual mode as per the roaster assigned by the chief justice.During the virtual court system, the HC had waived off its dress code of black coat and gown and advised the lawyers to wear plain white shirt / white salwar-kameez / white saree, with a plain white neck-band.Also Read: Odisha cop forges judge's signature to release murder suspect, arrestedIn a similar order, the high court in September last year expressed its unhappiness over lawyers’ conduct during virtual hearing asking the State Bar Council and High Court Bar Association to advise the lawyers to maintain basic decorum and decency in court proceedings while appearing via video conferencing.The HC took exception to a lawyer arguing his case from inside a moving car instead of his home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orissa-hc-lawyer-fined-rs-500-for-not-wearing-neck-band-during-hearing-101613901326721.html

It is the same configuration like Chandrayaan-2 but it will not have an orbiter. The orbiter launched during Chandrayaan-2 will be used for Chandrayaan-3. With that we are working on a system and mostly the launch will be next year in 2022,” Sivan told PTI.Chandrayaan-2, aimed at landing a rover on unchartered Lunar South Pole, was launched on July 22, 2019 on board the country's most powerful geosynchronous launch vehicle.However, the lander Vikram hard-landed on September 7, 2019, crashing India's dream to become the first nation to successfully land on the lunar surface in its maiden attempt.Chandrayaan-3 is critical for ISRO as it will demonstrate India's capabilities to make landing for further interplanetary missions.He said ISRO is targeting December to launch the first unmanned mission under the Gaganyaan project. The mission was originally scheduled to launch in December last year.It will be followed by another unmanned mission and the third leg is the main module, he said.Gaganyaan envisages to send three Indians to space by 2022. The four test pilots selected for the mission are currently undergoing training in Russia.When asked about the launch of the third module of Gaganyaan -- the manned mission -- Sivan said, “A lot of technology needs to be demonstrated.

Gambhir has agreed to join the investigation tomorrow while Rujira is yet to respond to the CBI summons.Though the probe has been going on since November, the CBI move comes close on the heels of Abhishek lodging a defamation case against Union home minister Amit Shah. A designated MP/MLA court in West Bengal issued summons to Shah on Friday to appear either personally or through a lawyer before it on February 22. The defamation case pertains to Amit Shah's statements against Abhishek Banerjee at a rally in Kolkata on August 11, 2018.In the coal theft case, CBI on Friday conducted searches at 13 locations in four districts — Purulia, Bankura, Paschim Bardhaman and Kolkata.In December, the CBI raided the residences of Vinay Mishra, a TMC leader, businessmen Amit Singh and Niraj Singh. It has been alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited operates several mines.BJP has also alleged that the kickbacks reached Abhishek through Vinay Mishra, who was appointed by Abhishek.In November, the agency had registered an FIR against Anup Manjhi alias Lala, one of the suspected kingpins of the racket, Eastern Coalfield Ltd General Managers Amit Kumar Dhar (of then Kunustoria area now Pandaveswar area) and Jayesh Chandra Rai (Kajor area) besides ECL Chief of Security Tanmay Das, area security inspector, Kunustoria Dhananjay Rai and SSI and security in-charge Kajor area Debashish Mukherjee.This is not the first time Abhishek's wife got embroiled in a controversy.

I also appreciate your continued efforts to support and strengthen the COVAX Facility to ensure more equitable access.”COVAX is is a global initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.On Wednesday, India, which has been hailed as the pharmacy of the world, announced the gift of 200,000 COVID-19 doses for UN peacekeepers.“Keeping in mind the UN Peacekeepers who operate in such difficult circumstances, we would like to announce today a gift of 200,000 doses for them,” Jaishankar said, addressing the UN Security Council open debate on the implementation of resolution 2532 (2020) on the cessation of hostilities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Quoting the Bhagavad Gita, Jaishankar had said “Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind.”He told the meeting that it is this spirit in which India approaches the COVID challenge and urged the Council to work collectively to address its different dimensions.The 200,000 doses essentially mean that it will be possible to administer the required double doses of COVID vaccines to all UN peacekeepers across missions.According to UN Peacekeeping, currently, a total of 94,484 personnel are serving in 12 peacekeeping operations across the world led by the Department of Peace Operations.A total of 121 nations are contributing uniformed personnel to the UN peacekeeping missions. India is traditionally among the largest troop-contributing countries to peacekeeping missions.Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General, had told PTI in response to a question on the Secretary General's thoughts on the announcement by India, said that Guterres is “extremely grateful” for the gift of 200,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses for UN peacekeepers and the distribution will be operationalised by the UN's Department of Support.“We are extremely grateful for this donation announced today by the Indian delegation. The distribution will be operationalised by the UN's Department of Support,” Dujarric had said.Earlier this week, two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine were given WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL). The versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, produced by AstraZeneca-SK Bioscience (AZ-SKBio) and the Serum Institute of India (AZ-SII), are now available for global rollout through the COVAX Facility.The vaccine Covishield is the version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin is the indigenously developed vaccine by pharma company Bharat Biotech.Jaishankar said these two vaccines have already been granted emergency authorisation and additionally, as many as 30 candidates are under various stages of development.Under the initiative “Vaccine Maitri”, which translates into Vaccine Friendship, India is providing vaccines to the world.Last month, Guterres had said that the vaccine production capacity of India is “one of the best assets the world has today”, and had applauded India for supplying COVID-19 vaccines to nations around the world.“I would like to say how much we count on India. I mean, India has one of the most advanced pharmaceutical industries. India played a very important role in the production of generics for use that was a very important element of democratisation of access to medicines all over the world,” Guterres had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-chief-voices-appreciation-for-india-s-leadership-in-fight-against-covid19-101613882134740.html

21-02-2021||India||After petrol price hike, Maruti to cash in on increased demand for CNG vehicles||Amid skyrocketing prices of petrol and diesel, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) is looking to cash in on the accelerated demand for its CNG vehicles, expecting nearly 50 per cent growth in the ongoing fiscal year, according to a senior company official.The company, which offers CNG options in eight models out of total 14 available in the Indian market, is also actively working to expand the portfolio."This year CNG (vehicles) in the industry has grown almost 37 per cent at a time when the overall growth is negative (18 per cent decline) in April-January period. It means CNG is growing very well," Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI.Explaining why the demand for CNG vehicles has gone up, he said as the prices of petrol and diesel as a fuel have gone up dramatically, the running costs have also increased."The cost of running CNG is only ₹1.5 per km whereas for petrol and diesel it is almost ₹4 per km. People are now preferring CNG as the running cost is very low so there is a growth in sales of CNG vehicles," Srivastava said.Also read| Hyundai aims to strengthen its SUV lineup in IndiaCiting Maruti Suzuki's own example, he said,"In the models that we have CNG, the penetration level is almost 21 per cent. Our CNG volumes last year were around 1,06,000 units. If you look at 2020-21 we have already crossed 1,19,000 units and we will end up the year with about 1,55,000 units. It will be almost 50 per cent increase."In Mumbai and Pune, the CNG penetration of Celerio and WagonR is almost 70 per cent. In Delhi, CNG penetration of WagonR is 50 per cent, he added.Stating that the growth of CNG sales was 18 per cent last year, Srivastava said in the last five years, MSI's CNG vehicle sales were at about 75,000 units in 2016-17, which grew to about 106,000 units last fiscal year.Another reason for the rise in demand for CNG vehicles is the increase in the number of cities under CNG stations network, he said adding four years ago, the number of CNG stations in India was 1,200, which has doubled to 2,400 at present."By next year the number of stations will be 4,500. So if you look at it, in four years it will go up from 1,200 to 4,500. Also the number of cities covered will go up. It has already gone up from 145 four years back to 240 this year," he said.Also read| UK's Rishi Sunak to raise business tax to pay for Covid-19 supportMoreover, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said in the Budget that the government would increase it to 100 more cities. In March 2022, it is expected that there will be almost 375 cities covered, he noted."The network is also increasing. Thus the availability of CNG is getting better...The government is also helping by expanding the CNG network. We can sell in new cities where CNG was not previously available. Then the waiting time for CNG filling is also going down as the number of stations are going up," he said.Also, he said consumer's concerns over safety and performance of CNG vehicles have been addressed with the company offering factory fitted vehicles where "there is no compromise in performance as well as safety. Now the customers know that there is no difference and the running cost is lower".When asked if Maruti Suzuki is planning to tap the favourable conditions for CNG vehicles by increasing the number of offerings, he said,"We have a plan to expand the CNG portfolio, to get CNG in other models also. We have 14 brands out of which eight have CNG and over a period of time we are trying to get CNG in other models also."While he did not share details, Srivastava said,"We have a time-based plan to get other vehicles into the CNG. We are actively working on it. CNG is a very good option when the petrol and diesel prices are very high. We are very focussed on this and consumers are reacting very positively to this as the numbers show."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-petrol-price-hike-maruti-to-cash-in-on-increased-demand-for-cng-vehicles-101613892019319.html

21-02-2021||India||Centre tells states to scale up testing as Covid-19 trajectory witnesses surge||As India’s active Covid-19 caseload witnessed a rise this week, pushing the country’s disease curve upwards, the Centre on Sunday wrote to states and Union territories advising them to step up testing to contain the spread of the virus at the earliest. The central government has asked states to work on five major areas—improve the overall testing numbers by focusing on increasing the proportion of RT-PCR tests, refocus on strict and comprehensive surveillance as well as stringent containment in selected districts, regular monitoring of the mutant strains through testing followed by genome sequencing and monitoring of the emerging cluster of cases, focus on clinical management in districts reporting higher deaths and all negative rapid antigen test results to be mandatorily followed by RT-PCR test. The instructions come as the country witnessed a spike of 86,711 cases of the coronavirus disease this week taking the infection tally close to 11 million. Of the 10,991,651 positive cases, 145,634 are active, which accounts for 1.32% of the total confirmed cases. The upward trend rides on the back of a sudden upsurge of cases in Kerala and Maharashtra. The Union ministry of health and family welfare said that more than 74% of the active cases are in these two states. “Of late it is seen that there has been a spike in the daily cases in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh also. Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir too are witnessing a surge in daily new cases,” it added. Maharashtra continues to report the highest daily new cases at 6,281 while Kerala added 4,650 new cases. Only two states – Maharashtra and Kerala account for 77% of daily new cases reported over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said.Pointing towards weekly data, the ministry stated that in Kerala the average weekly cases have fluctuated between a high of 42,000 to a low of 34,800 in the last four weeks. The weekly positivity in Kerala has ranged from 13.9% to 8.9% during the same period. According to the government, the southern state’s Alapuzha district is a cause of special concern where the weekly positivity rate has increased to 10.7% and weekly cases have increased to 2,833.Meanwhile in Maharashtra, the weekly cases have increased from 18,200 to 21,300 in four weeks and the corresponding positivity has also increased from 4.7% to 8%. The areas of concern are the Mumbai Suburban areas where the weekly cases have risen by 19%. In Nagpur, Amravati, Nashik, Akola and Yavatmal the weekly cases have increased by 33%, 47%, 23%, 55% and 48% respectively, the ministry added.Five states and UTs of Chandigarh, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Maharashtra -have weekly positivity rates higher than the national average. While the national average is 1.79%. Maharashtra has the highest weekly positivity rate with 8.10%, the health ministry stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-tells-states-to-scale-up-testing-as-covid-19-trajectory-witnesses-surge-101613891950491.html

21-02-2021||India||India-China 10th round positive, detailed roadmap to tackle residual issues next||The marathon 10th round of dialogue between military commanders of India and China recorded a positive movement with both sides agreeing to work towards a road map to address residual issue along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.“The 16-hour long meeting went off well. However, the two sides will need to continue discussing details of addressing residual issues pertaining to disengagement in Gogra-Hot Springs and patrolling rights in Depsang bulge area,” a senior official said about the talks held on Saturday.Although the disengagement from friction points of Gogra-Hot Springs on the banks of Chang Chemmo River, a tributary of Shyok, is not expected to be contentious, the related force deployments along the Khugrang river, another tributary, will need to be worked out mutually step by step.Depsang bulge is a 2013 legacy issue with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) trying to muscle out Indian Army patrols from patrolling points 10 to 13 by blocking the ingress route at Raki and Jeevan nullah. While the Indian Army claims to be patrolling these points, Depsang is a continuous source of friction and a possible trigger to future military escalation.Also watch | Why China blinked after months of deadlock. Shishir Gupta explainsWhile the military commanders on the ground are working towards disengagement in east Ladakh, the alignment of the LAC in the western sector has been left to the special representatives of the two countries on boundary resolution. However, the Indian prerequisite to special representatives level dialogue is that both sides restore the status quo ante on the LAC and neither unilaterally disturbs the status quo by use of force.Also read | Special representatives’ talks on cards, India, China to restore status quo anteEven though the two sides have withdrawn their armour from the Pangong Tso, both armies will remain wary of each other as Indian troops will not forget the transgression through use of force by PLA on finger four in May 2020 and the Chinese will not forget the Indian counter on north and south banks of Pangong Tso on August 29-30. The PLA may have also learnt a lesson of high-altitude deployment and the havoc rising glacial waters of River Galwan can play on troops deployed on its banks for military operations.It is quite evident that PLA wanted to enforce the 1959 line, rejected by India at that time, on Ladakh LAC, but the Indian political and military response was more than a match for the expansionist Chinese army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-10th-round-positive-detailed-roadmap-to-tackle-residual-issues-next-101613889696029.html

21-02-2021||India||At 16-hour meet, India, China discuss further disengagement in eastern Ladakh||Military commanders of India and China on Saturday discussed further disengagement at other friction points in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in a meeting that lasted for nearly 16 hours.The meeting of the corps commander-ranked officers, at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC to ease tensions in the Ladakh sector, began at 10am on Saturday and went on till 2am Sunday.The 10th round of military dialogue comes a day after the Indian Army and China’s People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Friday completed the disengagement process at the tense Pangong Tso sector of Ladakh. Outstanding problems with the PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra - friction points on the contested border - were on the agenda during Saturday’s meeting, people familiar with the development said. “The proposals discussed during the talks to normalise the border situation will be put up by both sides before their higher authorities. The agreement on the next steps of disengagement will be finalised after that. We expect disengagement at the remaining friction points to proceed smoothly as it did in the main trouble area (Pangong Tso heights),” a person tracking the developments told HT before the meeting concluded.During the ninth round of talks, it was decided that the Chinese PLA will move its forces to the east of Finger 8 on the north bank while the Indian troops will move to its base near Finger 3, defence minister Rajnath Singh had told Parliament earlier this month, adding that the two sides have also agreed to temporarily suspend their regular patrolling activities on the north bank of Pangong Lake. The Indian claim line extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4.The India-China border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre along with advanced weaponry. PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year.Earlier this week, for the first time the Chinese army admitted that four of its soldiers were killed, and an officer was injured in the clash between the troops of both sides at Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-16-hour-meet-india-china-discuss-further-disengagement-in-eastern-ladakh-101613877366611.html

He took to Twitter in English, Hindi, Punjabi, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam, Bengali, Telugu, Odia among other Indian languages to send his message on International Mother Language Day.“My greetings on International #MotherLanguageDay. Linguistic diversity has always been one of the foundational pillars of our civilization. More than just a means of communication, our mother languages connect us with our heritage and define our socio-cultural identity,” he tweeted in English.“We must promote the use of mother tongue in all spheres - from primary education to governance. We must encourage the creative expression of our thoughts and ideas in our own languages!” he added.We must promote the use of mother tongue in all spheres - from primary education to governance. We must encourage the creative expression of our thoughts and ideas in our own languages! #MotherLanguageDayNaidu’s tweets come a day after he had written to the members of Parliament and urged them to contribute towards the promotion of Indian languages. The vice president described the first learned and spoken mother tongue as the 'soul of life' and made a passionate appeal to all MPs in a three-page letter. "I request you to be an active facilitator in promoting native languages in the large area you represent in the Parliament. Given your standing among the people you represent, your efforts could give a fillip to the promotion of Indian languages. I sincerely hope that you would agree with me on the need for preservation and promotion of all Indian languages and do whatever is possible to enrich them," he wrote in his letter.Since 2000, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) has led the world in celebrating languages with a view to promoting linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism.“Every two weeks a language disappears taking with it an entire cultural and intellectual heritage. At least 43% of the estimated 6000 languages spoken in the world are endangered. Only a few hundred languages have genuinely been given a place in education systems and the public domain, and less than a hundred are used in the digital world. Multilingual and multicultural societies exist through their languages which transmit and preserve traditional knowledge and cultures in a sustainable way,” the UN has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-int-mother-language-day-naidu-calls-for-promotion-of-linguistic-diversity-101613876053121.html

21-02-2021||India||‘Confident of completing housing for all in time’, says Nagendra Nath Sinha||The performance of the central government in providing housing has stood the test of the Covid-19 pandemic, rural development ministry secretary Nagendra Nath Sinha tells Saubhadra Chatterji. Edited excerpts:The ministry data said that in FY19-20, 56.6% houses of the annual target were completed whereas in FY20-21, so far only 4.16% of the annual target has been completed.We have to look at this data with the totality of the situation. The houses that are sanctioned in a financial year, their completion rate should be looked at only in the next financial year even as the ministry is encouraging the states and the beneficiaries to build houses as early as possible. Normally, we allow a year for completion of the houses, and treat a house as delayed only when the construction does not get completed in that period. We have cases where houses have been completed in just three months. We are happy that about 26 lakh houses have been completed so far in this financial year. This including those sanctioned last year and 2.65 lakh houses from this year’s targets.For almost six months, the state governments have had their operations paralysed due to Covid-19 pandemic. So, most of the new PMAYG houses were sanctioned only after August and beneficiaries got only 5-6 months to build their houses in this financial year. In fact, we should celebrate that despite difficulties presented by Covid-19 and attendant circumstances, beneficiaries were able to complete 2.65 lakh houses in a period of less than six months.We started this year with 1.42 crore sanctions and now we are at 1.91 crore of sanctions. Thus almost 49 lakh units have been sanctioned in this year. We are in the process of sanctioning more for which the states are being vigorously pursued.A performance audit paper says pace of sanction has slowed down drastically due to as Covid-19, elections and saturation of SC/ST beneficiaries.The availability of manpower in government offices had also been an issue. The other factor is that in some states, the Covid-19 situation seems to again look serious. So, the panic is still there. Another big problem is availability of land. The Centre is working with the states on this but after a series of land distribution programmes, there is very little land available near habitable areas. Some states have relaxed land norms, while some have allowed multistoried houses for the scheme.Some states have also indicated financial constraints and have been very slow in sanctioning PMAYG houses. Some states have returned targets allocated to them. But even despite Covid-19, sanction of about 49 lakh houses is not a mean achievement. There are still 40 days left in this financial year and more houses will get completed.Are you confident to achieve Housing for All by August 2022?First of all, I dispute the way completion rate is measured. It should be measured against the sanctions of a year ago, while 4.16% achievement is against the current years’ sanction. In fact, we should see this achievement vis-a-vis the last year’s sanction. What you are mentioning as low performance, in fact should be counted as a superior performance in the exceptional circumstances of Covid-19, as these houses have been completed in less than 6 months’ time.We started out with the permanent waiting list based on the SECC. We are confident of providing houses for all PW by the said period. Those who have come late through Awaas +, their houses will require some more time... Also, the states have been massively affected by Covid-19.The PMAYG started with a target to build 2.95 crore houses. What is the progress on that target?The SECC found 4.04 crore people didn’t have houses or had kaccha houses with not more than two rooms. The figures were verified by Gram Sabhas and the number came down to 2.95 crore. This was the target for PMAYG. Sanction of the houses is subject to verification as someone who didn’t have a house in 2011 SECC survey might have built a house in the intervening period, some people might have migrated permanently or died. Meanwhile, as Awaas+ survey has been undertaken where 3.57 lakh people claimed to be left out of SECC, 2011. We have asked states to conduct physical verification. Once completed, genuine claimants can be determined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/confident-of-completing-housing-for-all-in-time-101613858652786.html
21-02-2021||India||India, China’s special reps to meet over LAC||With India and China agreeing to restore status quo ante on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), a meeting between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, both special representatives on boundary resolution, will take place soon to sort out differences in perception over the undefined border, according to people aware of the developments.While the 10th meeting between military commanders took place on Saturday, the backchannel talks between the special representatives have ensured that no side will unilaterally alter the status quo along the 3,488km-long LAC and the status quo will be restored on all points, the people quoted above said. Doval and Wang had a video conference on June 7, 2020, and have kept in touch with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, holding the diplomatic end of conversations with Beijing.Although both Indian and Chinese military commanders have stood firm during the 10-month stand-off, the governments on both sides are taking a step forward to normalise relations on a reciprocal basis.It is understood that the Indian side has made it clear that it will stand up to any use of force to alter the status quo but is willing to discuss and build a positive atmosphere for sorting out all outstanding issues related to the LAC.“We have conveyed that the two sides can sit together and work their way towards resolving differences in perception over the LAC after China has created positivity by restoring status quo ante on Pangong Tso. There can be no dialogue if PLA uses force but if China can persuade that India is wrong or vice versa on border perception, then the two sides can mutually adjust to the perception line,” said a senior official in the know of the developments.According to national security planners, it is for China to create a positive atmosphere for recording forward movement in bilateral ties as India will respond in kind and more.“The trajectory that India and China ties take from Pangong Tso disengagement depends on Beijing but the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) withdrawal has been taken in the right spirit in New Delhi,” said a former Indian Army chief, asking not to be named.After the disengagement from Pangong Tso, the military commanders on Saturday were working out the modalities of withdrawal of armour and artillery from friction points at Gogra-Hot Springs and working out the modalities for restoring full patrolling rights to the two sides in the Depsang Bulge area, south of Daulet Beg Oldi sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-s-special-reps-to-meet-over-lac-101613858375747.html
21-02-2021||India||Interview| ‘Did not block any welfare scheme, ensured transparency’: Kiran Bedi||Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi, who was removed as Puducherry lieutenant governor (L-G) on February 16, spoke to Ramesh Vinayak about the powers of the L-G in the Union territory and the allegations of non-cooperation levelled against her by CM V Narayanasamy. Edited excerpts:The constitutional framework for the lieutenant governor of Puducherry provided that you had to work on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. But CM V Narayanasamy alleged that you did not?In terms of Section 44 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, read with Rules of Business from time to time made thereunder, all decisions taken by the cabinet are to be placed before the L-G before they are acted upon by the concerned administrative department. In 95% of the cases, I went along with the decisions taken by the cabinet. In case of difference of opinion, the L-G is required to refer the matter to the central government and the decision of the Centre is binding.Your interpretation of the 2018 Supreme Court order in the case related to powers of the Delhi government and the L-G was totally different from the CM. You said that it provided the L-G the powers to intervene in day-to-day functioning of the government. Why do you think you were right?The administrative set-up of the UT of Puducherry is not that of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The UT of Puducherry is governed by the provisions of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963. In respect of the Government of NCT of Delhi, it is governed by the constitutional provisions. The Supreme Court has categorically ruled that the NCT of Delhi is a sue generis (of its own kind) among the UTs, and therefore its order is applicable only to DelhiThe CM had alleged that you did not approve funds for building a dam or providing relief to fishermen and blocked almost every proposal of his government. How true is this?I did not block any welfare scheme but ensured diligence in public spending and transparency and fair deal in welfare assistances.How do you see your long-running confrontation with the CM, who was from the Congress?Their political needs were in variance with the rule of law.How do you respond to the Congress government’s charge that you had reduced the L-G office to an extension counter of the BJP?This is a blatant lie.The perception is that you have been eased out ahead of the assembly elections to blunt the Congress government tirade that you didn’t let it perform at the behest of the BJP.It is a presumption.What is your next plan? Would you like to revert to politics?The speed at which life unfolds, I am wondering who is the architect?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-not-block-any-welfare-scheme-ensured-transparency-101613855242370.html

The government had identified nearly 10 million health care workers for the programme. India also crossed the milestone of administering vaccine to over 10 million people on Saturday.Puducherry recorded the lowest vaccine coverage among health care workers, with only 31.9% of the registered beneficiaries receiving the shots till Saturday evening, followed by Chandigarh with 35.6% and Punjab with 38.7%. The national capital was also among the seven states and Union Territories with less than 50% vaccination coverage for the health care workers. According to the data shared by the Delhi government, 50.7% of the health care workers were immunised till Saturday evening.Among the 20 million frontline workers identified by the government for the drive, 3.6 million received the vaccine.So far, 10 states and UTs have vaccinated 50% of their frontline workers. Topping the list was Dadra and Nagar Haveli that has already vaccinated 89.6% of its registered frontline workers, followed by 84.6% in Rajasthan and 80.2% in Gujarat.Meanwhile, a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in states such as Maharashtra and Punjab has experts worried, with most suggesting that the vaccination coverage has to be ramped up to curb the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/635-health-staff-get-shots-govt-says-drive-to-run-another-5-days-101613854763888.html

The girl is still not in a condition to speak to the police and narrate the incident, the DIG said.Three Dalit girls, aged 13, 15, and 16, were found unconscious in a field near their home in Unnao district late on Wednesday. Two of them died soon after, and the third, the oldest, was shifted to a Kanpur hospital in critical condition.UP Police also found out on Saturday that one of the two accused arrested on Friday for the killing of two girls is a major from the information on his Aadhar card.SP City, Unnao, VK Pandey said he has been sent to 14-day judicial custody in place of juvenile home.During the questioning he maintained that he was a minor but his Aadhar card showed his age to be 19-years-old. The court was informed accordingly and he was produced along with another accused Vinay Kumar alias Lambu, he said.In a related development, the police added section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) in the FIR, which was originally registered under sections 302 and 201.Meanwhile, Congress leader Udit Raj was booked on Saturday for his tweet over the death of two girls in Unnao, with the police alleging he propagated fake news that the teenagers were raped and their bodies cremated against the will of their family.Superintendent of Police Anand Kulkarni said the post was an attempt to create anger through “misleading” rumours.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unnao-poisoning-minor-taken-off-ventilator-101613854242057.html
21-02-2021||India||Ex-defence personnel hit by phishing attack||The devices of multiple former defence personnel may have been compromised in a phishing attack launched through a government domain email address, according to technical evidence accessed by HT and disclosures by some of the victims, the latest in a string of attacks that have exploited privileged @gov.in and @nic.in email addresses.The new attack, which was through an email from an @gov.in address sent on Thursday afternoon, targeted a group of 43 former officers of the army, navy and air force who were part of the 56th course of the National Defence Academy. The sender lured some of them into clicking on a purported invitation for a dinner, which led to a set of malware.“Some 15-20 people said in our WhatsApp group that they had clicked on the link and were honest about it,” said one of the 43 people, who asked not to be named. Two other persons who clicked on the links themselves told HT that they had, and found suspicious files being downloaded.HT reported on Thursday that at least two government ministries — external affairs and defence — have sent out alerts this month to their employees, warning about the use of two specific email addresses that belong to the official nic.in and gov.in domains run by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). NIC runs the official email service, handing out accounts to departments, ministries and public sector units run by state and central governments.Also read: US still unraveling 'sophisticated' hack of 9 government agenciesThe people targeted on Thursday said they were not sure how their details may have leaked. One of the people HT spoke to said the 56th course alumni included some people who were also in senior positions in private companies. The three services chiefs, general MM Naravane, admiral Karambir Singh and air chief marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria too belong to the same NDA batch, although their email addresses were not among those targeted.If accessed through a mobile phone, the link that was sent in the latest attempt prompts users to install a malware disguised as an app for armed forces personnel. In the background, the programme links up with a ‘command and control’ server, and begins uploading any data — photos, documents, audio and video files — stored on the device.“It also sends WhatsApp files and documents and activates the microphone, records calls and uploads those as well as calls logs,” said Yash Kadakia, the founder of Security Brigade, after he and his team analysed the link and the malware at HT’s request. Kadakia said the malware appeared to only target Android phones, although another set of engineers HT reached out to said people who visited the link using a desktop computer too would be compromised, with anything they type being recorded.“This malware appears to be new and tailor-made for targets who are associated with the Indian military. None of the commercially available anti-malware products appears to flag it as yet,” Kadakia said, explaining that this was likely to be the first time this hacking tool was spotted in the wild.On Friday, a government official who asked not to be named said a third alert has been issued about a separate compromised @gov.in email address. It is not yet clear how these email addresses have been breached, and how many more there may be. Altogether, HT is aware of four NIC domain addresses – three with @gov.in suffixes and the fourth an @nic.in one – which are not being disclosed in order to protect any investigations there may be.When contacted by HT, NIC said phishing attacks “originate from spoofed or compromised accounts,” without responding directly to the specific cases. “State-of-the-art Security controls and measures are deployed to detect and mitigate phishing attacks at NIC. Additional measures such as mandatory multifactor authentication are being deployed to mitigate unauthorised access to user email,” it said in a statement.“Security measures for authentication of senders to avoid spoofing and to block malicious emails are deployed as per global best practices in NIC / government networks,” it said, adding that security measures “are continuously reviewed and steps are taken to mitigate emerging cyber-attacks”.The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-IN), which investigates incidents of cyber breaches, did not respond to requests for a comment.Two senior officials involved with the country’s cyber security said such attacks are not new or uncommon. “No government data has been compromised since sensitive systems are sequestered,” said one of these officials.The second person added that these incidents are the result of poor cyber hygiene and people fall victims to such methods the world over.The use of compromised government domain accounts also offers hackers the ability to appear more authentic to their targets and bypass system filters that typically divert suspicious emails to junk folders or label them as risky.“Any attack impersonating a government official is worrying. There is a greater chance that someone will click on a link that looks like it came from an official, increasing the likelihood of such campaigns being successful,” said Gunjan Chawla, programme manager, technology and national security, at Centre for Communication Governance, National Law University Delhi. “Such attacks also risk undermining trust in government’s digital infrastructure,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exdefence-personnel-hit-by-phishing-attack-101613851786543.html

The borrowings are being done through this window by the Centre on behalf of states and UTs.Under the special window, the Centre has been borrowing in government stock with tenor of 3 years and 5 years. The borrowing made under each tenor is equally divided among all states as per their GST compensation shortfall.With the current release, the proportionate pending GST shortfall with respect to borrowing under 5 years tenor has been concluded for 16 states and 2 UTs.Till now, 91 per cent of the total estimated GST compensation shortfall has been released to states & UTs with Legislative Assembly (Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir & Puducherry), the statement said.“An amount of ₹1,00,000 crore has been borrowed by the Central Government through the special borrowing window at an average interest rate of 4.83 percent....Out of this, an amount of ₹91,460.34 crore has been released to states and an amount of ₹8,539.66 crore has been released to the 3 UTs with Legislative Assembly,” it said.Total 17 rounds of borrowings have been completed so far starting from October 23, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-releases-5k-cr-to-meet-gst-dues-of-states-total-compensation-at-1lcr-101613851475631.html
21-02-2021||India||From revenue deficit to special status: What CMs focussed on||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired a virtual meeting of the governing council of Niti Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, with chief ministers. About 25 chief ministers spoke during the video conferencing and a majority of them raised the issue of fall in revenues which was affecting development in the states.“The Centre should compensate for the revenue loss due to Covid-19 so that development works can be carried out. There was also revenue shortfall due to slowing down of the economy,” said Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, adding to what several CMs highlighted during the interaction with the PM.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asserted the need to pace up the manufacturing sector in the country. “In the last 70 years, our country has never given importance to the manufacturing sector; our country is lagging behind in manufacturing which is why China has captured our markets,” he said.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren demanded a separate religious code for the tribals in the upcoming national Census, and suggested universalisation of old age pension and increasing wages of MGNREGA workers.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan outlined that the state undertook agricultural reforms.Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy reiterated his demand for special status for the state, asserting that industrialisation was yet to gain the required momentum due to several constraints post-bifurcation.Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, however, hit out at the “politicisation” of all actions of an elected government and pointed out that it was making development difficult. “Every crime is being politicised, every action of an elected government is being viewed from a poll angle. This kind of an atmosphere is one of the biggest threats to the pace of development and peace in the country,” he said in an apparent dig at the controversy over draft heritage bylaws issued by National Monument Authority for the Jagannath temple in Puri and Anant Basudeva temple and Brahmeswar temple of Bhubaneswar.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar suggested ‘One Nation, One Rate’ on electricity supplied to states by Centre power plants. “We purchase very costly power as a result of which the state government has to give more as a subsidy,” he said.Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot demanded that East Rajasthan Canal Project be declared a project of national importance, as promised by the PM during election rallies in the state on 7 July 2018 and 6 October 2018.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath highlighted that his state is the first in the country to inoculate 1 million people. He also highlighted how UP moved from 12th position to second in the country in Ease of Doing Business Rankings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-revenue-deficit-to-special-status-what-cms-focussed-on-101613851167362.html
21-02-2021||India||Need to give equal chance to private sector to grow: Modi||Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi questioned whether IAS officers should run fertilizer factories or airlines, he told a meeting of the governing council of the Niti Aayog that the government has to “honour the enthusiasm of the private sector”. He said in the goal of self-reliance, every person and institution gets the opportunity to grow. His comments on the private sector came against a backdrop of the government’s ambitious target for strategic sale of several public sector units this year, including Air India, oil major BPCL and some banks.In the virtual meeting, attended by chief ministers and senior officials, Modi said the Union budget presented on February 1 evoked a “positive response” and added, “We are also seeing how the private sector of the country is coming forward with more enthusiasm in this development journey of the country. As a government, we also have to honour this enthusiasm, the energy of the private sector, and give it as much opportunity in the self-reliant India campaign.”The PM’s comments came days after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the government of working on a “Hum do, Hamare do” policy that benefits a handful of industrialists but not the people of India. Gandhi had accused Modi of promoting crony capitalism.Modi’s speech on Saturday was aimed at refuting these charges as he said, “Self-reliant India is a step towards a new India where every person, every institution, every enterprise gets an opportunity to grow beyond its full capabilities.”In the Union budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman set a disinvestment target of ₹1.75 lakh crore for FY21-22. In her budget speech, Sitharaman said, “We have kept working towards strategic disinvestment. A number of transactions namely BPCL, Air India, Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, IDBI Bank, BEML, Pawan Hans, Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, among others, would be completed in 2021-22.”“Other than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in the year 2021-22,” Sitharaman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-give-equal-chance-to-private-sector-to-grow-modi-101613850865226.html
21-02-2021||India||India, China discuss next phase of disengagement||Senior military commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies on Saturday met in eastern Ladakh to discuss the road map for further disengagement of their troops at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), with the talks taking place after the completion of the first round of disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector, people tracking the developments said on condition of anonymity.The corps commander-ranked officers met at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC for the 10th round of military dialogue to ease tensions in the Ladakh sector. The talks began at 10am and were in progress when this report was filed.Outstanding problems with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra — friction points on the contested border — were on the agenda, said one of the persons cited above.“The proposals discussed during the talks to normalise the border situation will be put up by both sides before their higher authorities. The agreement on the next steps of disengagement will be finalised after that. We expect disengagement at the remaining friction points to proceed smoothly as it did in the main trouble area (Pangong Tso heights),” said a second person aware of the matter.The India-China border standoff began last May and saw both sides deploy 50,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre along with advanced weaponry.PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year. The Pangong disengagement took place on strategic heights on both banks of the lake. It saw the two armies pull back their frontline troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns under an agreement reached earlier this month. The disengagement began on February 10.“I think we should not expect very speedy results (in other areas). Depsang, in particular, is one area where discussions to arrive at a consensus could be protracted,” former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda said on the eve of the military talks.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points. The first round of disengagement at Pangong Tso involved the pulling back of troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline at heights of almost 18,000 feet as well as withdrawing soldiers holding positions on the Kailash range on the south bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-discuss-next-phase-of-disengagement-101613850273085.html
21-02-2021||India||PM calls for cooperative federalism||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called for “synergy” in the Union and state budgets, taking “competitive, cooperative federalism” down to the district-level and said that a better understanding between the Centre and the states in their policy framework was very important for the country’s development.Addressing a governing council meeting of the Niti Aayog, the Centre’s policy think tank, Modi also asked the states to reduce the compliance burden on the public, defended the reforms in the agriculture sector and asked for reduction in the import of edible oil worth billions of dollars.The PM maintained that India’s self-reliance (atma-nirbharta) will benefit from Centre-state synergy. Asking the states to take “full benefit” of the new performance-linked incentives that have been announced for the manufacturing sector and the cut in corporate tax rates, Modi pointed out the states have a 40% share in the National Infrastructure Pipeline announced in the budget. “Therefore, it is imperative that the states and the Centre jointly synergise their budgets, make plans, and set priorities,” he said.The presentation of the Union budget has been advanced from the earlier schedule in March to February 1 since 2017. Modi referred to the calendar that helps early planning and commencement of work, and said, “Now the central government has pre-poned its budget a month earlier. There are three to four weeks between the state budget and the Union budget. If the budget of the states is formed in the light of the budget of the Centre, then together they move in one direction.”The PM said he would like to see the budget of the states discussed in this direction. “States whose budget is yet to come, they can do this work on priority. Along with the Union budget, the state budget is equally important in speeding up development and making the states self-sufficient,” he said.The meeting also saw the PM defend the new agriculture laws once again. While the protests against the laws are still on, Modi said, “Reforms are very important in the farm sector to make sure our farmers get finance, better infrastructure and modern technology.” He added that even as agriculture has immense capabilities, the truth is that despite being called an agricultural country, “today we bring about 65-70 thousand crores of edible oil from outside. We can stop this. Money can go to our farmers’ account. This farmer is entitled to our money. But for this, we have to make our plans like that,” while pointing out how the import of pulses had reduced considerably.The PM referred to the abolition of 1,500 archaic laws and simplifying other processes, saying, “There are thousands of compliance requirements that now apply to common people, which can be eliminated. We have technology. There is no need for asking people to furnish the same things time and again. Let us remove this compliance burden on the people. This is also important for ease of living.”Expanding the idea of “healthy”, competitive, cooperative federalism, the PM said that businesses, MSMEs and start-ups need to be strengthened. Pointing out every state has its own merit and that each district boasts of its own talent, the PM added, “We can see different potentials. The products of hundreds of districts are shortlisted and promoted for their value addition, marketing and export. This has just started a healthy competition among the states but it has to be taken forward.”He said the export performance of a state can be replicated in the district levels to see how we can give special emphasis on this export in every state and every district. “We also have to carry this experiment between districts and blocks. We have to make full use of the resources of the states, we should earnestly take account of the exports from the states every month and increase it,” Modi said.In the meeting attended by chief ministers and senior officials, the PM referred to several steps taken to reduce poverty and said the use of technology was absolutely essential in improving governance at the grassroot level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-calls-for-cooperative-federalism-101613849999623.html
21-02-2021||India||Order on Disha’s bail reserved for Tuesday||A Delhi court on Saturday reserved its order on the bail plea of 22-year-old Disha Ravi, who is facing sedition charges for allegedly amplifying violence during a farmers’ protest by creating an online “toolkit”, even as the climate activist’s counsel said there was no evidence to show that the document was responsible for the violence on January 26.Even as additional sessions judge (ASJ) Dharmender Rana asked the Delhi Police to present anything that could link the “toolkit” with the violence and, consequently, the conspiracy for which Ravi was charged, the police said the case was still being investigated.Ravi was arrested from Bengaluru on February 13 by Delhi Police for allegedly creating and sharing the protest toolkit backing the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws. Delhi Police claimed on Monday that Ravi, along with Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob and Pune engineer Shantanu Muluk, created the toolkit and shared it with others “to tarnish India’s image” and that “pro-Khalistani” elements were included in the document. The two have already been granted transit anticipatory bail by the Bombay high court.If highlighting the farmers’ protest globally was sedition, then she was “better in jail”, activist Ravi told the Delhi court.During the three-hour hearing, the judge asked the police whether they had any evidence that the “toolkit” incited violence during the tractors’ rally. “How is the toolkit connected to the violence? What is the evidence? Is there is any evidence or are we acting on the basis of surmises and conjectures?” the judge asked the police.To this, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju told the court that in a conspiracy, people could have different roles. He said that someone inspired by the toolkit could have been instigated to commit violence. Raju told the court that the document will have to be read along with the hashtags and links it contained, which were meant to “instigate people asking them to come on streets thus resulting in public disorder”. He said that because of the toolkit, some elements put a flag on the Red Fort as the document had a list of tasks to be undertaken to support the cause of the Khalistani movement.“First is the violence…Toolkit precedes the violence. Go inside Delhi, do this, do that,” Raju said.The court asked the ASG: “What’s ‘do this and that’? What is the link? Unless I satisfy my conscience, I don’t move ahead”.Raju contended that the “toolkit” had to be read along with the hashtag and links, which were of seditious nature.“It is not a simple message. The links are inciting people. Asks them to march into Delhi…. People are being told there is genocide in Kashmir… It defames the armed forces and talks about Assam.“The result was public disorder and disturbance of public peace… The toolkit showed India is bad country, it is killing Muslims. The flag was hoisted… We still want to investigate. We will certainly discover other things… We will be required to have a second look,” Raju said.The court, however, said: “What exactly is the evidence against this lady connecting her with the violence? Please don’t be repetitive. Apart from Khalistani link and that she was in touch… How do you connect the actual actors with these conspirators,” the court said.The investigating officer said that Ravi was connected to Poetic Justice Foundation, a Vancouver-based organisation. “The execution of conspiracy is different from the conspiracy. Conspiracy is meeting of minds. The requirement of law is that conspiracy is complete. Others have different roles. My intention was that a person reads the toolkit and gets swayed by it,” Raju said.The judge sought to know from the police whether the actual actors were arrested or not and whether any link was established. It asked whether there is any link between the conspiracy and the offence. “Should I assume that for now, there is no direct link? Have you arrested the actual actors? Have you established any link? Either I’ve not framed my query correctly or you don’t want to answer it. What is connecting in link between the conspiracy and the offence,” the judge said.Additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed told the court that the “toolkit” had embedded links which directed readers to various anti-India websites.The court sought to know whether there was a documentary evidence to show that the “toolkit” had incited violence. It also sought to know how “chai” and “yoga” were used to tarnish India’s image, as alleged by the probe agency.The police said that it was the entire “toolkit” of which “chai” and “yoga” were also a part, which are symbols being used to defame India. The police said that after the “toolkit” was leaked on social media, a cover-up operation was carried out and many of its parts were deleted. After this, sections 201 and 204 of the Indian penal Code (IPC) – which deal with destruction of evidence – were added against the activist. The ASG also said that the “toolkit” had a cheatsheet which contained information which defames the Indian Army and had nothing to do with the farmers’ protest.“Ravi had the right to edit the toolkit and she later deleted everything. This is the working of a guilty mind,” said the lawyer, adding that the “toolkit” was part of a “sinister design”. He said that a co-accused, Shantanu, was sent to Delhi to ensure the proper execution of the “toolkit”.During the hearing, the court also sought to know the past antecedents of Mo Dhaliwal and Anita Lal, founders of Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) and asked as to how the police were ascertaining that they were supporting the Khalistani movement.Advocate Siddharth Aggarwal told the court that Ravi’s work and her cause were meant to save the environment and she did not intend to “sow disaffection”. “There is no disaffection being spread by the toolkit. It is just a digital document. My history has nothing to do with Khalistan. My connection is not with Sikhs For Justice or PJF. In this case, it is clear that thinking otherwise is attracting sedition,” Ravi’s lawyer Aggarwal told the court on behalf of his client.“I have no connection with the Khalistan movement, whatsoever. There is no single chat or conversation between me and the (banned organisation) Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) produced by the Delhi Police,” the counsel argued. He also contended that speaking to a secessionist did not make Ravi one too.The court reserved its order and said that it would pronounce the verdict on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-on-disha-s-bail-reserved-for-tuesday-101613848565577.html
21-02-2021||India||BJP leader held with cocaine accuses party colleague of hatching conspiracy||BJP youth wing leader Pamela Goswami, who was arrested with cocaine from south Kolkata on Friday, alleged that it was the conspiracy of another BJP leader Rakesh Singh.“I want a CID probe. BJP leader Rakesh Singh, who is close to Kailash Vijayvargiya, should be arrested. This is his conspiracy. I have all evidence,” said Goswami.In a video that went viral, Goswami could be seen raising the allegations while she was being taken to courtGoswami, 29, was arrested from a posh area in south Kolkata on Friday. Police had recovered around 90 grams of cocaine, worth nearly ₹10 lakh, from the car. Her friend Prabir Kumar De, 38 who was with her, was also arrested along with another youth Somnath Chatterjee, 26. De is also a BJP worker.“Today she is taking the name of Kailash ji. Tomorrow she may take the name of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi. I can face a CBI or CID investigation. I think she has been brain washed by the police and the TMC to say these things so that they can implicate me and the BJP,” said Rakesh Singh, a BJP leader.A senior BJP leader said that Goswami had joined the BJP in July 2019 along with two others, actor Surojit Choudhury and actor Rimjhim Mitra.“I didn’t have any contact with the woman over the past one and half years. How did I become a part of the conspiracy then? Am I a ghost that I will go there and place the cocaine?” said Singh.The police said that Goswami’s father Kaushik Goswami had sent a letter to the police commissioner and joint commissioner of police (crime) alleging that De, who was arrested with Pamela, had introduced her to drugs.In the letter, Goswami (Pamela’s father), stated that De was married and has a daughter who is 8-9 years old. He also alleged that De had first started a business with Pamela as a partner and then introduced her to drugs."We would definitely request you to kindly keep a watch upon this person so that he may not fleece any other girl or woman as he has done with our own daughter. We have further information that he has collected a lot of cash from the market running into a few crores of rupees," Kaushik Goswami wrote in his letter to the police commissioner.HT has a copy of the letter but repeated calls on Kaushik Goswami's number went unanswered.“If someone has been arrested with drugs then law will take its own course. Let the police investigate and the truth will come out” said Partha Chatterjee, state minister“I am not aware of this and hence don't want to comment. But more than 1000 of our workers have been put behind bars in narcotics related cases. We have full faith on the legal system,” said Kailash Vijayvargiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-held-with-cocaine-accuses-party-colleague-of-hatching-conspiracy-101613847323806.html
21-02-2021||India||Man murders 17-year-old girl in Begumpur||A 17-year-old girl was bludgeoned to death with a hammer on Friday evening at her home in outer Delhi’s Begumpur by a man whose proposal she had recently turned down, the police said on Saturday.Police are on the lookout for the suspect, 25-year-old Laik (identified by the police by his first name), who is a long-time family acquaintance.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Rohini, PK Mishra said, “Laik was very close to the girl’s family and had known them for the last five years. He was a frequent visitor to their home and had even lived with the family for two months when they moved from Bawana to Begumpur. He would often help the family with their day-to-day affairs,” he said.The girl’s father worked at a manufacturing unit and the family had moved to Begumpur from Bawana a year ago after building a house in the northwest Delhi neighbourhood.Laik, who too works at a factory, belongs to Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh and lived in Delhi with his uncle.Police said Laik was on good terms with the girl’s family until recently when he started developing feelings for the teenager. “Recently, he proposed to the girl, but she had turned him down,” the DCP said based on the police’s interactions with her cousin.On Friday evening, when the girl’s parents were away at work and her two brothers were in the market to buy vegetables, Laik visited her house.“We suspect that an argument ensued between the girl and Laik over her rejecting his proposal and that led to him beating her to death with a hammer,” the DCP said.After the murder, Laik allegedly locked the house from outside and left with the bloodstained hammer in hand.“While Laik was walking with the hammer, the girl’s brother saw him from a distance, but didn’t make much of it. But when the brothers returned home, they found the door locked from the outside and believed that the girl had left with Laik. But when they made a phone call to their sister and found her phone ringing inside the house, they suspected something amiss and broke open the lock,” the officer said.Inside, the girl was lying unconscious and injured. She was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was declared brought dead.The officer said that a murder case has been registered and multiple teams have been formed to catch Laik.The case figured prominently on social media platforms all through Saturday since the victim and the accused belonged to different religions. However, DCP Mishra said religion had nothing to do with the murder.“The man would have killed her even if he belonged to the same religion as the victim,” said Mishra.The officer said that the police have spoken to the girl’s parents who, too, did not see any communal angle in the murder. “We are looking to nab Laik at the earliest. While there is no communal tension, we are keeping a watch in the area,” the officer said.Last week in Mangolpuri, the death of a 25-year-old man who was stabbed to death by a group of men took a communal turn after his affiliation with some Hindu outfits came to light. Many political leaders visited the house of the deceased as Delhi Police increased security in the area and transferred the case to the crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-murders-17-year-old-girl-in-begumpur-101613844072501.html
21-02-2021||India||Seminar addresses challenges faced by entrepreneurs with disabilities||Experts working with entrepreneurs with disabilities held a digital conference earlier this month, where they stressed on the need to focus on the challenges specific to the community.The virtual conference — titled Business Beyond Barriers-Empowering Entrepreneurs with Disabilities —was held on February 6 by Alliance To Promote Abilities and Rehabilitation (ATPAR), Network of Entrepreneurs with Disabilities for Assistance and Rehabilitation (NEDAR), National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), and the National Handicapped Finance and Development Corporation (NHFDC). The conference aimed at highlighting the contribution of disabled entrepreneurs and address the challenges faced by them.Thilakam Rajendran, founder ATPAR, which works on entrepreneurship for persons with disabilities across India, said that the community was invisible despite having the same dreams and contributions as other entrepreneurs.“It is time we move beyond perception blocks. All stakeholders should come together to enable and empower through convergence and inclusion to recognise their contributions and make them visible,” he said.Lack of financial inclusion, support and acknowledgment from the entrepreneurial ecosystem have proved to be the major challenges for the field, the experts said. They also said that world over, participation of persons with disabilities in employment is lesser than those without disabilities. Persons with disabilities are pushed into taking up self employment or entrepreneurship for survival, without any adequate skills, knowledge, financial inclusion, enabling eco-system, among other factors.Around 2000 attendees were present for the national conference, which included stakeholders from ministries, industry associations, corporates, and banking and skilling sector.Arman Ali, executive director, NCPEDP pointed out that disability could no longer be a barrier for people to be a part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem and to do business.To boost entrepreneurial options in the community, ATPAR also launched a business directory of NEDAR members. NEDAR was started in 2019 by ATPAR and currently has over 100 member-entrepreneurs and an online store — called “ATPAR Mall” on the Instamojo platform to sell products of entrepreneurs with disabilities.“Most people today are able to connect to the two words Persons with Disabilities or Divyangjan, but when we say ”Entrepreneurs with Disabilities”, there is a degree of disconnect. It takes an effort for us to explain that they have created an identity for themselves beyond just being Persons with Disabilities and today among many other identities they are artisans, artists, self-employed and entrepreneurs with disabilities who have carved a niche in conducting their business beyond barriers and are also contributors to the society,” the directory states in the preface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seminar-addresses-challenges-faced-by-entrepreneurs-with-disabilities-101613844073033.html
21-02-2021||India||PWD asks police to lodge case against new makeshift temple at Chandni Chowk||Leaders of three major political parties — the Aam Aadmi Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress — on Saturday made a beeline for the new makeshift Hanuman temple that has come up on the central verge of Chandni Chowk main road, even as the Public Works Department (PWD) wrote to the Delhi Police asking them to take action against the construction.The PWD in its complaint to the Delhi police, however, did not mention the word “temple” anywhere instead referring to it as a “prefabricated structure”.“This is to inform you that last night (Thursday) some unknown person brought a prefabricated structure and placed at planter top in the median near Kucha Mahajani at Chandni Chowk road. In this regard it is requested to take necessary action at the earliest so that the project can be executed within the timeline,” the PWD complaint letter to the police said.A police officer, who did not want to be named, said, “Legal action has already been initiated in the matter.”Delhi government could not be reached for a comment on the issue despite repeated attempts.The old temple, which was located on the pavement of the carriageway towards Red Fort, had been demolished by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on the directions of the Delhi high court on January 3. The PWD in its complaint clearly mentioned that the structure has come up without any permission from any of the agencies executing the project.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s Chandni Chowk MLA Parlad Singh Sawhney and Delhi Congress vice president Mudit Agrawal and Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor visited the makeshift temple on Saturday and offered prayers at the temple.On Saturday, senior AAP leader and party’s MCD in-charge Pathak visited the new temple and offered prayers along with locals. He said that the North Delhi Municipal Corporation had demolished this temple of “Lord Hanuman” but the people had re-built it with their faith.“It is very sad that this temple of Sankat Mochan Lord Hanuman in Chandni Chowk was demolished. By doing so, the MCD played with the faith of devotees. But the devotees have re-built this temple. The AAP stands with devotees, and we have come here to pray before Lord Hanuman that he gives sanity to all,” Pathak said.He also took potshots at the BJP-ruled civic bodies and said that the BJP has betrayed the people of Delhi during its 15-year tenure in the MCD.Responding to Pathak’s allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Kapoor said that it is sad that AAP leader Durgesh Pathak has vitiated the atmosphere by giving a political statement while visiting the Hanuman mandir rebuilt by the locals of Chandni Chowk. “The original temple at Chandni Chowk was demolished as a part of Delhi government’s beautification plan on court’s order. Locals made several appeals to the government to save the original temple but they did nothing,” Shankar said.Delhi Congress vice-president Mudit Aggarwal on Saturday too visited the newly built temple and trained guns at both the MCDs and the Delhi government for the temple’s demolition. “Both the Delhi government and the BJP considered the temple a hindrance and engaged in manipulating the public by hurling allegations at each other,” Aggarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pwdasks-police-to-lodge-case-against-new-makeshift-temple-at-chandni-chowk-101613843952532.html
21-02-2021||India||Day after PLA deaths are announced, hate messages target Indian embassy||A barrage of hate messages directed at the Indian embassy’s Chinese social media account, an outpouring of grief from Chinese citizens, and more write-ups in official media blaming New Delhi for the military standoff with India – all these marked an uneasy Saturday, a day after information about the deaths of four People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers was released for the first time.Thousands of abusive messages have targeted the Indian embassy’s Twitter-like Weibo account since information about four soldiers being killed and one injured in the deadly Galwan Valley clash last June was published in the PLA Daily newspaper on Friday.Many of the abusive messages on the tightly-censored Weibo account are peppered with expletives.Also read : Special representatives’ talks on cards, India, China to restore status quo anteEmotion is running high among Chinese netizens over the soldiers’ deaths, while state media reported that a person was arrested in Nanjing city for publishing insulting remarks about the PLA troopers.On Friday, multiple videos purportedly showing the lead-up to the Galwan Valley clash between Indian and Chinese troops in June last year were uploaded on several websites, and shared and viewed hundreds of millions of times.The edited videos show Chinese soldiers outnumbered by Indian troops. The message for the domestic audience was clear – Chinese troops showed restraint and valour while taking on Indian servicemen.None of the videos claim that 20 Indian soldiers had died in the clash.Photos of the four dead PLA soldiers circulated online, and evoked a strong reaction from Chinese citizens.For hundreds of millions of Chinese, it was the first time they learnt about their country’s soldiers dying in a battle.The Chinese government seemed set to mine the people’s emotion by allowing state media outlets to publish photos of the deceased from when they were young students.The news website, thepaper.cn, ran several photos of two of the deceased soldiers - Chen Hongjun and Xiao Siyuan - from their days at Northwest Normal University and Henan Agricultural Vocational College.Both universities announced on social media they would mark the deaths of their two former students by allowing teachers and students to pay tributes and carry out “mourning activities”.The nationalistic tabloid, Global Times, published an editorial to give its view on why information about the PLA soldiers has been made public now - eight months after the clash.“Back to the Galwan Valley clash last year, given the tense situation at that time, avoiding a comparison of casualties was more conducive to the stability of the border situation. Now that the round of border standoff has ended, we must make public the heroes’ deeds so that all Chinese people could admire and commemorate them to understand the weight of peace,” the Global Times editorial said.“Before the Galwan Valley clash, China had not seen soldiers sacrifice in clashes with foreign troops for quite a long time. The sacrifice of young soldiers including those born after 1995 and 2000 has shocked the nation.”The editorial also said that another reason for eventually releasing the information was to reveal the truth.“India has been trumpeting its ‘victory’ in the border provocations against China to cater to and encourage surging domestic nationalism. The unveiled number of casualties from China has debunked the lies of India, making it hard for India, who suffered heavy losses in the Galwan Valley, to continue to fool the domestic public,” the editorial added.Shanghai-based military expert, Ni Lexiong, said China did not release the PLA casualty statistics earlier because it did not want to provoke reactions.“China is not prepared to expand the border conflict with India, and so it did not immediately report casualties in order to avoid provoking anger among the Chinese,” he said.“Now that the two sides have reached an agreement on withdrawal and disengagement, the incident has been formally resolved. The Chinese side will be able to handle the casualties normally and it will not affect the settlement of the border conflict. This shows that China is rational and calm,” Ni added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/day-after-pla-deaths-are-announced-hate-messages-target-indian-embassy-101613818571651.html
21-02-2021||Today's||Bitcoin stocks are possibly the dumbest Bitcoin play||If you believe in Bitcoin, you buy Bitcoin. And if you’re wary, you stay away. That’s about the simplest way of calculating your investment options when it comes to the world’s most infamous speculative bet. Of course, you can join the hoards of Telegram and Reddit groups claiming to understand and predict the twists and turns in the cryptocurrency’s price, making you just that much smarter than everyone else. Well done.But there is another option: invest in stocks of Bitcoin-related companies, including those that supply the “miners” — the computers that solve the complex algorithms which underpin the cryptocurrency network. That is, buy shovels in a gold rush. That could be the dumbest bet of all, though. Take Canaan Inc. the largest member of the Elwood Blockchain Global Equity Index. The Hangzhou-based company makes chips and equipment used in miners. You’d think that since Bitcoin price, and ergo demand, keeps rising then people would be clamoring to buy more rigs. The major incentive to do so is that if you run such a machine you can yourself get Bitcoin as a reward, and as the price rises the value of such a prize also climbs.It’s not working out that way. Canaan’s sales in the June and September quarters dropped and it posted four straight quarters of losses. That’s over a period in which Bitcoin’s price rose a sedate 30%. According to Bloomberg data, there’s no sell-side analysts left to even guess at its revenue outlook or share price target.Such equity investments are not about the bottom line, though, they’re about share returns. In that regard, Canaan has done well by rising 200% over the past year. Tesla Inc.’s announcement earlier this month that it had got into Bitcoin, followed by Canaan telling investors it had secured long-term orders, accounted for almost all of that gain.This huge return over the past year is minuscule compared to the rise in Bitcoin itself — which is five times higher than a year ago. In fact, on aggregate, betting on related equites — as tracked by the Elwood Blockchain index — would make you a laggard.There are a few exceptions. MicroStrategy Inc. is a provider of business-analytics software. But now it’s gone all-in on Bitcoin and this past week raised around $1 billion through a convertible-bond sale for the sole purpose of buying more. That big bet drove the stock to outperform even the cryptocurrency itself in the past few weeks.Unfortunately, as my Bloomberg News colleagues Crystal Kim and Tom Contiliano pointed out, its shares trade at about a 50% premium to the price of Bitcoin — and that was after a 25% plunge in the stock from its Feb. 9 high. It would be akin to buying Bitcoin at $75,019 apiece when it was trading at $49,000, they wrote. Clearly, that’s not the smartest of investments.And that’s the problem. Without a doubt there’ll be times when individual stocks, or even a collection of them, will be a solid investment strategy. But over the long term, if you truly think Bitcoin is a winner, then there’s really just one clear way to bet on it.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

21-02-2021||Today's||The solution to the farm impasse lies in federalism||The current imbroglio over the farm laws highlights the Centre’s growing intrusion into what are constitutionally state subjects. But they also highlight another uncomfortable reality. Many of the most serious economic afflictions facing the country — agriculture, water, power, land, health and education — are state subjects. And the failures of the states to do justice on subjects that are well within their constitutional obligations have created space for an activist Centre to weigh in.Take power. The bleeding of the distribution companies (discoms) has had enormous opportunity costs for state finances. The attempts to stem the bleeding are a veritable alphabet soup – the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme (APDRP), the restructured-APDRP, Integrated Power Development Scheme, Financial Restructuring Plan and Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY). But, despite the enormous resources poured into them, their impact is, at best, modest and, at worst, an abject failure. The Fifteenth Finance Commission (FFC) has once again attempted to clean the Augean stables of state power finances by recommending extra annual borrowing space based on certain performance criteria in the power sector. Hope springs eternal.Take another example. “Public Order” and “Police” fall under the “State List” of the Seventh Schedule, putting the onus on state governments for the maintenance of the law and order in their respective states. In 1999, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs (chaired by late President Pranab Mukherjee) observed that “of late the dependence of State Governments, all over, on the Central Para Military Forces in dealing with difficult situations arising on the law and order front has increased significantly… This changing trend over the years has given rise to a situation of dichotomy wherein while on the one hand the State Governments tend to demand more and more power and autonomy, on the other hand they appear to be prepared very inadequately to perform..one of the most primary duties of maintaining law and order and peace and normalcy in their respective State. On every incident of minor or major proportion they tend to seek help of the central police forces, which only throw poor light on the preparedness of their police forces in dealing with adverse situations.”Little has changed. Over the past two decades, even as the states continued to underinvest in their police, the size of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) doubled, thereby ensuring the creeping federalisation of a state subject.The story is similar in agriculture. For the vast majority of India’s farmers, the tiny size of their farms means that there is simply no way they can make a decent income on farming alone unless their incomes are artificially boosted by a plethora of input subsidies, price or income supports — or if they are part of the privileged few who have large farms. All the policy options being debated and passed as saviours are — for the vast majority of farmers — “post-dated check on a crashing bank”, as Gandhi once said of a British proposal.The only viable long-term answer for the majority of India’s farmers, as BR Ambedkar observed a century ago, is to get out of farming. At that time, India’s population was a fifth of what it is today and land fragmentation correspondingly less. Public policies of input subsidies (especially on fertilisers and water) that underpinned the Green Revolution certainly benefited the country broadly, in terms of both aggregate output as well as farmer incomes. But their sell-by date is well-past. Once farm incomes rose, the rural surplus should have provided the springboard for structural transformation, especially in industry. Instead, it has become a trap slowly asphyxiating the sector.The basic thrust of the farm laws was in the right direction. But their specific details and the manner in which it was done without broad deliberation and building consensus — let alone the manner in which the government has lashed out at critics — has been completely self-defeating. Public policies need to have broad legitimacy among those that it affects and the reality is that these farm laws simply don’t.A way out of this turmoil might lie in respecting India’s federalism more fully. The Centre should not pass farm laws that affect agriculture markets within states, but this should also mean no central government Minimum Support Price (MSP) and no central government procurement. The states say that agriculture is a state subject. It is. And they should have complete say in what subsidies they want to give their farmers, for which crop, and how. The states that strongly believe in MSP and procurement should have complete ownership of both.The Centre’s involvement in procurement today is inextricably linked to its obligations under the Right to Food Act. That Act had the right intentions but its cereal obsessiveness is having deeply damaging consequences for agriculture and agro-ecology. As FFC notes, within agriculture, the more the government intervention, the lower the growth. Crops, especially cereals, are lavished with subsidies while fisheries, livestock and horticulture have grown much faster — and are more nutritious.The Centre should move to replace the Act with a Right to Nutrition Act that eschews specifying the exact cereal and instead offers broad nutritional guarantees from a basket specific to different regional contexts. That change will take time. Until then, the Centre should buy, in the open market, the rice and wheat needed for the public distribution system after the kharif and rabi harvests and maintain buffer stocks for price stabilisation. If states think that the private sector will be exploitative, they can and should do their own procurement. It is only then that they will think hard about crops and costs.The Centre’s involvement in agriculture markets should be to smoothen pan-India commerce — no state should be able to block inter-state movement of a commodity. For its part, the Centre should not be able to ban agriculture exports if prices rise. Why should farmers not get the upside of prices when they have to suffer the downside when prices go down? If the government is worried about consumer reaction, it should either compensate farmers commensurately or subside the consumer directly, but not force the farmer to do so. And if agriculture is truly to be a state subject, either the Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) in the new budget should be discontinued or whatever money is raised should be handed over to the states.But all this cannot be done overnight. There needs to be an exit ramp for farmers and states to adjust. Here, the Centre should provide a clear road map along with performance-based incentive financing to ease the transition over three to four years.The farm laws are illustrative of an uncomfortable reality. There are many important issues that states are fully empowered to handle. But they don’t. Problems arise. Then there is a clamour that “the government” should do more. But, inevitably, that means the central government. Of course, the Centre loves this, because it then exercises more power. And that has slowly, but surely, tilted the already imbalanced Union-state relationship even more in favour of the former.The best bulwark against a hegemonic Centre is stronger federalism. But, for that to occur, states will have to up their game. Fundamentally, unless they bite the bullet and move to develop their non-farm sectors, most farmers will have increasingly precarious livelihoods. And the Centre can best help farmers by assisting states make that transition.Devesh Kapur is the Starr Foundation South Asia Studies Professor and Asia Programs Director at the Paul H Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University, Washington, DC.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-solution-to-the-farm-impasse-lies-in-federalism-101613827756030.html
21-02-2021||Today's||India’s vaccine strategy needs transparency||Isn’t it odd the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine — known to us as Covishield — is our main one and yet we are uninformed of the international debate about its efficacy and dosage? I’m not referring to the confusion created by AstraZeneca’s results when it claimed 62% efficacy after two full doses, but 90% after half a dose followed by a full one. Even though unresolved, that’s slipped into history. My concern is two recent issues and the fact that our government hasn’t said a word about them.The first is an official guidance issued by the World Health Organization on February 10: “In the light of the observation that two-dose efficacy and immunogenicity increase with a longer interval, WHO recommends an interval of 8 to 12 weeks between the doses”.Gagandeep Kang, perhaps our top vaccine scientist, has explained the reasons behind this. Because of delays in availability of the second dose, 59% of the efficacy trial sample got the second dose between four and eight weeks after the first, 22% between nine and 12 weeks and 16% after 12 weeks. Their vaccine efficacy was 56%, 70% and 78% respectively. This, she concludes, indicates “a clear trend of increasing efficacy with longer intervals between doses”. When the immune response is included, “it was found that the longer the intervals between the two doses, the better was the human response”.So, clearly, there’s good evidence for this guidance. It also makes sense for three other reasons. A longer interval means more people can receive a vaccine quickly. If more people get it, we would be better protected if a second wave — God forbid — happens. And with cases and deaths sharply declining, we’re in a position to increase the interval.Yet, on this issue the government is silent or, if it’s spoken, it’s done so sotto voce. Why? This is a matter on which I would expect a carefully thought-out, if not also confident, opinion. Moreover, it needs to be widely known. Silence feels like irresponsibility.The second issue is more complex, but the government’s lack of response remains perplexing. It’s to do with the efficacy of AstraZeneca for people over 65. Because only one-tenth of the participants in the efficacy trials were older than 65, Germany and Denmark have decided not to give it to this age group. Commenting on this, Kang writes that for over-65s, the trial showed “a vaccine efficacy of 52%”, which isn’t great. More importantly, “the numbers are too small for firm conclusions”. Spain, Italy and Belgium, it seems, have gone one step further. They’ve decided not to give AstraZeneca to anyone over 55. Switzerland is not giving it at all.Now, these are countries that have alternatives with proven efficacy for the over-65s. We don’t. Our alternative is Covaxin, and its efficacy is yet to be proven. Fortunately, WHO has come to a very different conclusion. Its guidance says: “WHO recommends the vaccine for use in persons aged 65 years and older”. Kang explains it’s done so after considering both immunogenicity and efficacy. So there’s no reason why we should not give it to this age group.But — and this is my point — should we not have informed our 65-year-olds of the European concerns and discussed them? Don’t our elderly have a right to be informed and then reassured? Leaving them unaware is not what one expects of a democratic government.Let me end by raising two other unconnected issues. France has decided to only give a single dose of any vaccine to people who’ve had Covid-19. As Kang puts it, it believes “an infection and one vaccination are equivalent to two doses of the vaccine”. Is this something we should consider too?Second, given vaccine hesitancy, should we shift focus to districts with a worrying number of cases rather than continue with a nationwide rollout? Has this been thought about? If it has, I’d like to know why it was considered inadvisable.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-vaccine-strategy-needs-transparency-101613827753296.html
21-02-2021||Today's||Incentivise health workers on the ground||There are two positives from the Covid-19 pandemic. One, there is growing realisation of the need to invest in primary health, and second, there is recognition of the invaluable role of Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers at the grassroots. Their performance in the face of all odds should force the government to think about how to strengthen this cadre and make it more effective in delivering grassroots health care. One initiative should be to induct more male health workers into the system. This is the time to make community health work more attractive for all genders.To begin with, the incentive structure must change. India has 900,000 Asha workers who get an honorarium of ₹2,000 to ₹4,000, depending on the state government. They get minor incentives for recurring tasks, with each worker being responsible for up to 2,500 people in her district.They need to be given post-retirement benefits and other incentives if India is to build on this crucial cadre. The pandemic may recede, but a host of health care issues have to be dealt with. Instead of piecemeal payments linked to tasks, there must be a drastic overhaul in their pay structure. A non-governmental organisation (NGO) worker in the field told me that the government’s logic in some states is that task-based incentives keep the Asha worker on her toes. This is the wrong approach. Even if the remuneration is called an honorarium rather than a salary, state governments must now consider providing Asha workers with the job security that other medical professionals get.During the pandemic, many were given a very short period of training on how to handle the deadly virus and its aftermath. Their workload increased drastically without commensurate infrastructure. Yet, they have come up trumps. This calls for creative strategies to better their lot.Another area that needs re-evaluation is career progression. Through the Skill India programme, Asha workers should be given the opportunity to move to the next level in health care, should they so chose to. There should be year-round training for them in rural settings and much greater engagement with them to ascertain their personal aspirations for professional growth. One noteworthy step has been the commitment of the National Health Mission to pay the fees for Asha workers who wish to complete their secondary education through the open school system and for them to be given preference in admissions to nursing schools.They should also be given access to information about institutions where they can further their skills and avenues of employment open to them. Through the panchayat system, there should be community recognition of their efforts; something which could encourage more people, and hopefully men as well, to join the grassroots health care system. Their requirements such as crèches for their children, overnight rest rooms, sanitation facilities and safety must all get priority now. They must also have access to proper grievance redressal forums.If the right inputs are made into the Asha system now, it can have the potential to change and improve health care at the grassroots level and also eventually correct gender inequalities in the communities they function in. Much will depend on the respect, recognition and rewards that both the central and state governments afford them for their role in holding together a rickety grassroots health care system in a most challenging time.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/incentivise-health-workers-on-the-ground-101613827752225.html
21-02-2021||Today's||Health breaks into the economic mainstream||The past three weeks saw three key events in India’s economic and fiscal policy calendar. The Economic Survey of India was tabled in the Parliament on the first day of the Budget Session. Budget 2021-22 was presented on February 1; and the Fifteenth Finance Commission (FFC)’s final report was then tabled in Parliament.While these may be seen as routine events, there was something unprecedented in their content — the focus on health. Health and well-being were the first of the six pillars in the finance minister’s budget speech. The Economic Survey has two chapters on health — a first. And then FFC report dedicates a chapter to health, and a sub-chapter to local body grants for health. Never has health been a centrepiece of India’s economic policy establishment. In fact, it has been conspicuous in its absence. These events mark health’s entry into the mainstream of economic policy.The shift is undoubtedly shaped by the Covid-19 pandemic, which demonstrated that a health shock can wreck the economy. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to contract by 7.5% in 2020-21 due to the impact of the lockdown on jobs and businesses. Covid-19 unearthed the deep, but often invisible and unacknowledged, link between health and the economy. Though Covid-19 hastened the realisation, there was growing acknowledgement of health’s importance for the economy prior to it. FFC’s interim report highlighted the centrality of health for productivity and growth-enhancing human capital.There are two key implications of this shift. First, increasing, policy importance will be accorded to health as it starts getting viewed as “human capital investment”, not merely social sector expenditure. The Economic Survey and FFC both highlight this point, and outline the multiplier effect of government health spending on growth. Greater resource allocation for health will follow the shift in thinking. The 2021-22 Budget underscores the point. Budgeted expenditure on health increased by 75% to over ₹1.2 lakh crore, even after excluding allocations for drinking water and sanitation.Second, there will be greater scrutiny and thinking around how and where funds are spent, with the ministry of finance pushing for efficiency and increasing utilisation of allocated funds. Health policy and government spending have often prioritised cure, and had a disproportionate focus on secondary and tertiary care. Though the National Health Mission (NHM) is correcting the balance, an economic lens of efficiency can further push the preventive, promotive, and primary care components.Two examples highlight the shift. One, there is a broader conception of health and well-being in Budget 2021-22 and this includes drinking water and sanitation, both key for preventive health, with far-reaching impact. Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to the transmission of diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, and dysentery. They also contribute to malnutrition. The allocation for drinking water and sanitation has increased over four-and-a-half times from ₹21,000 crore in 2020-21(BE) to ₹96,000 crore in 2021-22(BE), including FFC grants. Further increases in government health spending will still be required, but with a concurrent focus on systemic efficiency.Similarly, both FFC and the Economic Survey highlight the need to further strengthen the focus on primary care, typically under-consumed and under-provided. The former recommends primary health expenditure be two-thirds of total health expenditure by 2022. The finance ministry has accepted FFC’s recommendation for local government grants to improve primary health service provision. Prioritising efficiency and systemic focus on determinants of health will be as important as an increase in resources allocated for health.There is a long road ahead to building a robust health system. Recognition of health in the economic mainstream is not the same as sustained policy focus and resource allocation. It is certainly no guarantee of implementation of lofty goals, which require solving tricky governance and administration challenges. However, recognising and prioritising health is an important gesture by the economic and fiscal policy community. It would serve it well to internalise this lesson.Anurag Kumar works at NITI Aayog on health economics and financingThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/health-breaks-into-the-economic-mainstream-101613827692571.html
21-02-2021||Editorials||Providing migrant workers a political voice||Niti Aayog has formulated a draft national policy on migrant workers. According to a report in The Indian Express, the policy, prepared in consultation with seven ministries, civil society organisations, and international institutions, proposes instituting mechanisms to “enable voting” for migrant workers because their political inclusion will enhance political accountability. It also suggests setting up inter-state coordination mechanisms between states to facilitate migrant movement; making migrant wings a part of labour departments; and getting source states and destination states to work with each other.The migrant crisis, triggered by the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the pandemic, saw, according to official figures, over 10 million migrant workers returning home. The pandemic also revealed the fact that the Indian State doesn’t have adequate data and information about this large pool of citizens. This was quite astonishing since migration has been an integral component of India’s political economy, and the presence of migrant workers routinely places additional demands on basic infrastructure in destination towns and cities.The Niti Aayog draft, which will now be sent to the labour ministry, en route to Cabinet and Parliament, has several excellent workable ideas. A key issue is creating political incentives — the fact that migrants are spread out, and may not end up voting in either source or destination states, means that they have often been underestimated as a political constituency. Enabling their political voice will be key to making them effective stakeholders and forcing the system to take their interests on board. The economy has been opening up and many migrant workers have started going back to their jobs, but this issue must not be relegated to the margins. It’s time migrant workers get the respect, protection and rights they are entitled to as citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/providing-migrant-workers-a-political-voice-101613913978599.html
