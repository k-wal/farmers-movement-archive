The video of a rally held after his release from Taloja jail on February 15 after acquittal in two murder cases registered against him in 2014 was shared across social media platforms last week. The case is being investigated by senior police inspector Vinayak Gaikwad, head of unit one of the anti-narcotic cell, Pune police crime branch. The police forces in Raigad, Pune city, and Pimpri-Chinchwad, have registered multiple cases against the man and his close aides for the rally. The Pune police have alleged that Marne and his accomplices flouted multiple rules and made a spectacle of his return starting from Mumbai to his house in Kothrud, Pune. The videos, edited for grandiose, were published by multiple people on various social media platforms. “Gajanan Marne is a notorious gangster and has serious cases like murder, public disorder, extortion registered against him and the war of his and rival gang led to the death of multiple people,” translates a statement from Pune police in Marathi. The statement further mentioned that given that his rival gang leaders are also outside of jail, Marne and his supports uploaded the videos and photos on various social media in order to establish his dominion and create fear among citizens. A case under Sections 290 (punishment for public nuisance in cases not otherwise provided for), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code along with Section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act; and Section 37(1)(3)with 135 of Maharashtra Police Act was registered at Bund garden police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/case-registered-against-social-media-handles-backing-marne-101614104981087.html

23-02-2021||Pune||PMC explores option to purchase electricity from private companies||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to rope in private electricity companies to provide electricity to civic body establishments at lower rates in comparison to the Maharashtra state electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL). The PMC has called for expression of interest in the open market to provide electricity. According to PMC officials, the civic administration is planning to use electricity for plants having consumption with 1 MW. Currently, there are three plants under consideration for usage. The civic administration aims at increasing the usage up to 23 MW. The electricity policy states, “If the consumption is more than 1 MW, then it can be procured from the open market.” Therefore, the civic body has decided to use this option. At present, the PMC requires a total of 23 MW of electricity to run water supply plants, sewage treatment plants, street lights, hospitals and other utilities across the city. Shriniwas Kandul, additional city engineer of the electrical department said, “We have called for expression of interest to supply electricity to PMC. At present, we are purchasing power from the Maharashtra state electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL). We pay more than ₹3 per unit. Our daily consumption is more than five lakh units. If we save ₹1 per unit, we can save ₹5 lakh per day.” He further said, “The PMC is the first civic body which is exploring the option to get power from a private firm. There are private power companies in the market that supply power at lower rates. We have decided to check the options of other companies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-explores-option-to-purchase-electricity-from-private-companies-101614104620855.html
23-02-2021||Patna||Amid price hike, fuel smuggling from Nepal to Bihar in full swing||Smuggling of petroleum products from neighbouring Nepal into the border districts of Bihar has become rampant over the last few days following A sharp hike in petrol and diesel prices in India.Not only this, but pilferage from oil tankers in collusion with the crew members have also become a common sight on national highways passing through north Bihar.Petrol and diesel prices are much cheaper in neighbouring Nepal, which, ironically, imports almost all of its petroleum products from India.Arjun Bharatia, a social analyst at the border town of Raxaul in Bihar, said the smuggling of petrol and diesel from Nepal was nothing new in border areas. “There is a huge gap in prices which has led to illegal trade. But this has become rampant nowadays as the difference has gone beyond ₹22/litre for petrol and ₹26/litre for diesel,” he said.“The price of petrol in Nepal was at INR 70.95 on Monday while it was ₹94.05 in Indian cities. The price of diesel was at INR 60.12 in Nepal while it was ₹86.45 in India. So, people in border areas are buying fuel much cheaper in Nepal and selling it in India,” Bhartia noted.Also read: BJP's Rakesh Singh, named by Pamela Goswami in drugs case, arrested in KolkataWhen HT visited areas along the Indo-Nepal border in Sitamarhi, Sheohar and Araria districts, it saw oil being siphoned off from tankers by locals in connivance with the vehicle’s crew members. One of the locals said they were getting cheaper oil from tankers. “The rates depend on your bargaining with the tankers’ crew members. It may range between ₹60 and ₹70 per litre,” he said.“The quality of the oil smuggled from Nepal is worse. However, the quality is very good if taken from an oil tanker. So, people prefer buying it from tankers,” the man said.The police and personnel of Sashastra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal border, admit there was a sharp increase in the smuggling of petroleum products. “Yes, it has come to our notice. We have beefed up surveillance along the border and some people have been caught with smuggled petroleum products,” said Ganesh Kumar, inspector general of police (Tirhut range).In northeastern parts of Bihar bordering Nepal, the smuggling of petroleum products has witnessed a sharp increase.In Araria, petty businessmen of Kursankanta and Sikti markets are doing a brisk business.“It’s nothing new. This has been a practice for a long time,” said Anil Kumar of Kursakanta. “Petrol is sold at ₹22 less per litre just a few kilometres away.”The situation is the same in Kishanganj and Supaul.Sanjay Kumar Sarangi, deputy inspector general (DG) of SSB (Purnia sector), said, “We have seized petrol and diesel at several places and are conducting raids.”Araria and Purnia in the Seemanchal region and Supaul in Kosi share a 217-kilometre-long border with Nepal.Meanwhile, fuel station owners in Bihar, especially in areas bordering Nepal, are feeling the pinch.“Smuggling has become rampant as prices are cheaper in Nepal because of tax differentiation,” said Ravi Bharti, who operates a fuel station at Adapur, less than three kilometres from the Nepal border. “This is severely impacting our sales.”Daily sales of petrol and diesel at his refilling station have dropped to 1,200 litres from 1,800 litres earlier, Bharti stated. “Vehicles are now refilling from roadside vendors who are selling the smuggled fuel for much cheaper.”(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/amid-price-hike-fuel-smuggling-from-nepal-to-bihar-in-full-swing-101614104328192.html

The workshop was carried out on the directions of the Delhi high court, which in an order issued on February 10, asked the Delhi government to initiate measures to sensitise agencies to the importance of preserving trees while undertaking civil construction work. The court was hearing the matter against the PWD for damaging the roots of trees during the construction of a drain on Meera Marg at Lodi Road. Complaints were received by the forest department of 30 trees being damaged on Meera Marg by the PWD work in September last year, while in January again another 12 trees were damaged by this. The workshop was convened by the principal chief conservator forests (PCCF) Ishwar Singh and chief conservator forests (CCF) Nishith Saxena. Environment experts including Prabhakar Rao, member of Kalpkrish, an environment action group, and Vallari Sheel, researcher and urban ecologist also discussed ways in which agencies can avoid harming trees and ecology of an area by digging, concretisation and construction work. Agencies that were in attendance in the session was Public Works Department (PWD), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), Delhi Jal Board (DJB), representatives from the three municipal corporations (south, north and east) and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Delhi Cantonment. Participants in the workshop said that details of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA), 1994, was discussed, and court directions of the past that have pronounced best practices for the preservation of trees were also highlighted. The instances of agencies indulging in practices such as concretisation and excessive pruning were also discussed by experts and senior forest department officials. “This was a good initiative. A conversation has started around best practices that could be adopted to protect our ecology. I hope this can be extended as a series of sessions so that sensitisation can be developed among agencies,” said Vallari Sheel, one of the experts who conducted the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-forest-dept-conducts-workshop-for-road-owning-agencies-101614104440702.html
23-02-2021||Noida||This time we will go to Parliament, says BKU leader Rakesh Tikait||Ghaziabad: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Tuesday said to a gathering of farmers in Sikar, Rajasthan that the next march of tractors will be to the Parliament in the national Capital and the date of the call will be given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). Farmers have been camping at various borders of Delhi since November last year, demanding repeal of three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). Of late, Rakesh has been conducting public rallies in Haryana and Rajasthan and also intends to travel to other states in order to garner support for the farmers’ cause. The farmer leaders had given a call for a tractor parade on Republic Day in Delhi, however, incidents of violence were reported, and a flag was hoisted at the Red Fort amid the melee. Thereafter, many farmers’ leaders including Rakesh Tikait were named in FIRs lodged by the Delhi police. The farmers’ organisations, however, distanced themselves from the violence, stating that their ranks were infiltrated by outsiders. “About 3.5 lakh tractors went to Delhi on January 26. Our tractor also went to Delhi... We did not say anything about the Red Fort. It is a house of ghosts. Delhi must open its ears and listen that it is the same farmer and those are the same tractors. This time the call will be going to the Parliament and we are telling you beforehand about this. Either you take back the three farm laws or, about 40 lakh tractors will go this time and all equipment used in fields will also be taken along,” he told the gathering at Sikar after his rally at Churu earlier on Tuesday.He said that people of Rajasthan know how to fight scorching summer heat and their support will give strength to the ongoing farmers’ agitation, but that the call for marching to Parliament in Delhi will be given by the SKM. “This time the tractors will go to the lawns of the India Gate. Either you take back the laws and bring in a new law on MSP or tractors will start cultivating land there,” he added.Rakesh Tikait has been spearheading the farmers’ protest at the UP Gate protest site and has emerged as a major figure in the ongoing farmers’ agitation. He is also garnering support of farmers, khaps and people in areas near Delhi. Meanwhile, the protesting farmers at UP Gate and other protest sites near Delhi celebrated Pagdi Sambhal Divas on Tuesday, during which farmers wore the traditional pagris (turban) of their respective areas. Rakesh’a brother and BKU chief Naresh Tikait also participated in the event on Tuesday. He also appreciated Union minister Rajnath Singh, saying that the minister has the potential to get things sorted. “He is a good man and has also been the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. If they (the government) ask Rajnath Singh to talk, he can get the things sorted out. He has a lot of experience, but they are not asking him to come forward. We don’t know what the government is thinking, and farmers have been protesting for about 90 days now. We don’t know how this deadlock will be broken,” Naresh said. He added that no farmer leader who is part of the ongoing protest will go to rallies held by politicians in Uttar Pradesh. “Politicians have the right to hold panchayats and rallies and there is no ban on them. We cannot hold back people and they can go for rallies. But we will not go and will also not let them use our dais,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/this-time-we-will-go-to-parliament-says-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-101614104381392.html

23-02-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal lauds AAP’s performance in Gujarat municipal polls||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday pitched the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as the key political alternative in Gujarat, with his party winning 27 seats in municipal polls in the western state, which is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj described it as “breaching the citadel of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP” even though the BJP retained power in all six municipal corporations winning 409 of the 474 seats where results were declared till evening.“People of Gujarat have voted for politics of work as they were fed up by the politics of BJP and Congress. The people of Gujarat wanted an alternative and AAP has emerged as the key alternative to the present parties. Now the upcoming assembly election will be only between Aam Aadmi Party and BJP,” said Kejriwal, who is also the national convener of the AAP, in a press statement issued on Tuesday.Gujarat goes to assembly polls in 2022 and the AAP has announced that they will be contesting the polls. It is the home state of Modi where he has served as the chief minister between 2001 and 2014.Delhi’s deputy chief minister and AAP leader Manish Sisodia said, “People in all the cities of Gujarat are expressing trust in the AAP. The Aam Aadmi Party is at number two in Surat which has been a BJP stronghold. People are now seeking change and they are looking at the Aam Aadmi Party as the key alternative.”All 27 seats won by the AAP are in Surat municipal corporation, where it emerged as the principal opposition party against the BJP. It was the AAP’s debut in municipal polls in Gujarat even though they had unsuccessfully contested in 30 seats in the 2017 assembly polls in the state.Bhardwaj further said, “For the first time, the Aam Aadmi Party is getting significant support and winning several seats in the grassroots level elections across India. The grassroots level elections mean that municipality elections and gram Panchayat elections… Earlier, the same trend was noticed in the states like Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Goa and other states.”In the next two years, the party will be contesting assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat.“In Punjab municipal polls (earlier this month), the AAP’s performance was poor. That put a question mark in their expansion plan. Seen in that light, the Gujarat performance would be quite a saving grace. Evidently, they have gained from the decline of Congress. But it gives them hope for the assembly elections in 2022 for emerging as a prominent opposition party in Gujarat,” said Praveen Rai, political analyst with the centre for study of developing societies.Kishansinh Solanki of the BJP- the places that aap has won are traditional seats of the congress. So the bjp has taken that share. They have surat and bhavnagar and not in other places as in that area someParidar leaders who were with congress have now fallen out.

Shamshad allegedly fired at the police party during his attempt to flee. The shot missed the target and nobody was hurt. Police personnel then overpowered him and snatched away his firearm before he could fire again, the police said.During the interrogation, Shamshad disclosed that he is a life convict in the 2010 Dhaula Kuan gang-rape case. He was released on parole on April 20, 2020, as a part of the exercise to decongest jails in view of Covid-19. Parole was later extended due to the ongoing pandemic till February 20 (Saturday). However, Shamshad did not return to the jail on the proscribed date, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah.Police said after being released on parole, Shamshad joined a Mewat-based interstate gang of robbers. He along with others of the gang allegedly committed 12 ATM break-ins in Delhi, between December 2020 and January 2021, and took away cash amounting to ₹1.35 lakh.“The gang members used to spray black paint on CCTV cameras after entering the ATM booths. They used to open the ATMs with the help of a gas cutter and remove the cash cabins,” the officer said, adding that the remaining five suspects have also been identified.Shamshad was previously involved in around 16 criminal cases, including attempt to murder, abduction, rape, arms act and cattle smuggling, in Delhi and Haryana.In the 2010 gang-rape case, on the night of November 23, Shamdhad and his four associates abducted a 30-year-old BPO executive while she was walking home with a colleague around midnight, in Moti Bagh near Dhaula Kuan, after being dropped off by an office cab from their Gurugram office.The five men grabbed the women, threatened them with a countrymade pistol and tried to force them into their vehicle – a Tata 407 mini truck. They put the 30-year-old woman into their vehicle while her friend managed to escape after a brief struggle. The five men took turns to rape the woman in the moving vehicle before dumping her at an isolated stretch in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri.The police had cracked the case in a week using some key clues provided by the survivor. Police had used the clues to identify the truck as well as the suspects.The first arrest in the case was made on December 2, when the police caught Shamshad and Usman from Haryana. The other three were caught between December 4 and 6. Police filed the charge sheet on February 2, 2011, and on October 20, 2014, all five accused were awarded life imprisonment by a Delhi court. It was after this incident that the Delhi Police ordered all call centres in Delhi-NCR to drop women employees home safely and to also provide them security while travelling at night. Police also instructed PCR vans to be visible on roads and one officer to remain outside every such vehicle at all times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dhaula-kuan-gang-rape-convict-held-for-12-atm-break-ins-he-committed-while-out-on-covid-parole-101614104203339.html

Both of them are residents of Jammu, the police said.Jammu and Kashmir United Kisan Front Chairman Mohinder Singh (45), a resident of Chatha area of Jammu city, and Mandeep Singh (23), a resident of Gole Gujral, Jammu, were arrested on Monday night from Jammu by Delhi Police’s crime branch team with the help of the local police, senior Delhi Police officers said on Tuesday. The two suspects were immediately taken to the national capital for questioning, they said.“As per the information received, both the accused persons are active participants and key conspirators in the Red Fort case,” read a statement released by the Delhi Police on Tuesday morning.Mohinder Singh’s family said was innocent and demanded his immediate release. “He (Mohinder Singh) informed me that he was called by the senior superintendent of police (Jammu) and was visiting Gandhi Nagar Police Station before his mobile was switched off. Upon enquiring, I came to know that he was arrested by police and shifted to Delhi,” the farmer leader’s wife told reporters at Jammu.She said her husband was at the Delhi border (protest sites) and not Red Fort when the violence broke out. “He went alone to see the SSP because he was not afraid as he had done nothing wrong,” she said.Police said the two have been booked under charges of rioting, assaulting police personnel on duty, attempt to murder, dacoity, and criminal conspiracy, a case regarding which was registered at the Kotwali police station on the complaint of the station house officer. Another case pertaining to the vandalism and damage to the historic fort was registered at the same police station on the complaint by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which is the custodian of the fort. Both the cases were later transferred to the crime branch for investigation.So far, 14 people have been arrested in connection with the violence at Red Fort. They include Punjab’s actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, who was sent to jail for 14 days on Tuesday by a Delhi court after his extended seven days police custody ended.The crime branch has identified nearly 50 people who were allegedly involved in the violence at the monument. Their identification has been done after analysing the video footage and photographs available with the police. While a majority of the identified persons are named as “key participants”, the police have identified six persons as “key conspirators” and have announced cash rewards for information about them.The six suspects include Punjab’s alleged gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, for whom the Delhi Police have announced R1 lakh reward. Despite topping the list of wanted persons in the Red Fort violence, Sidhana surfaced with bodyguards in tow to address a rally organised by Sikh hardliners at Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s ancestral village, Mehraj in Bathinda district on Tuesday afternoon.While the Delhi Police did not offer any official statement on why Lakha Sidhana could not be arrested despite him turning up at the rally in Punjab, a police officer who did not want to be named said, “Sidhana’s arrest in our top priority and his movements are being tracked. Our teams that are in Punjab to arrest the suspects are facing resistance from locals. We have arrested suspects like Deep Sidhu and others from Punjab and other states. Sidhana will also be caught.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/red-fort-violence-two-arrested-from-jammu-101614104140738.html
23-02-2021||Delhi||Pitbull attacks woman, her pet near Aerocity, owner arrested||Delhi Police have arrested a 25-year-old man after his pet pitbull – a dog breed banned in many countries for its apparent ferocity – allegedly attacked a woman and her dog and bit them both near Aerocity in south Delhi on Monday evening. The woman has alleged that the pitbull was not on a leash and that after the attack when she complained to the owner, he allegedly threatened her. A senior police officer said the woman was taken to Safdarjung hospital, from where she was discharged after treatment. Pitbull dogs are said to be banned in many states of the US as well as in countries such as Finland, New Zealand and Brazil because they are perceived to be aggressive. Proponents of the breed, however, have engaged in a nature-versus-nurture debate over whether apparent aggressive tendencies in pitbulls may be appropriately attributed to owners’ care for the dog or inherent qualitiesMonday’s incident took place around 7.30pm near Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport, when the woman, who lived on the premises of the JW Marriot hotel, was walking her dog, an Indian pariah. In her complaint, the woman has alleged that all of a sudden and without provocation, a pitbull came running and attacked her dog. When she tried to intervene and save her pet, the pitbull proceeded to attack her too, biting her several times on her hand, the woman alleged. She has said that the pitbull’s owner then came to the spot, but was not able to handle his dog. She said when she complained to him, he threatened her and asked her to leave, the complaint reads. The woman then reported the matter to the police and a police team that reached the spot arrested the man. The man was brought to the IGI airport police station. The man was identified as Neeraj Sahrawat, a resident of Mahipalpur, who also runs a hotel in the neighbourhood. Police said the woman was then taken to her home which is within the premises of JW Marriot hotel in Aerocity, as her husband works with the hotel as a general manager. She first saw her family doctor after which she was taken to Safdarjung hospital for a medical examination, they said. Deputy commissioner of police (IGIA) Rajeev Ranjan said that the woman’s medical examination confirmed that she had multiple dog bites. “A case was registered and the pitbull dog’s owner and he was arrested. Since it’s a bailable offence, he was later released on bail,” Ranjan said.

AAP councillors alleged a “scholarship scam” by the civic body and demanded an investigation in the matter, apart from an explanation from the House on the issue. The move was immediately opposed by the ruling BJP. The AAP councillors then proceeded to enter the well of the House, displayed posters related to the alleged scam and raised slogans against the SDMC ruling authorities. To counter it, BJP councillors also raised anti-government slogans. The House was adjourned twice before being finally adjourned to the next date.Leader of opposition Prem Kumar Chauhan alleged that there were irregularities in payment of scholarships to SC/ST students of SDMC schools between the financial year 2013-14 and 2018-19. “It is a scam worth at least ₹5.7 crore, where annual scholarship was not paid to SC/ST students between 2013-14 and 2018-19 despite the fact that the Delhi government released this amount every year. The money never reached students and it was pocketed by the civic officials,” Chauhan alleged.He also said that an enquiry in this connection is already going on by the anti-corruption branch, but there is a need to seek an explanation from the BJP-ruled civic body and fix responsibility. “We were demanding a discussion on the issue and an explanation from the mayor. But our demand was rejected so we expressed our displeasure. BJP leaders have been protecting corrupt officials because they themselves benefit. BJP councillors opposed our move and created ruckus because they never wanted a discussion on this,” Chauhan said.According to SDMC officials, SC/ST students are given ₹500 scholarship annually by the government. In municipal schools, it is disbursed by the civic body after the funds are released by the government. Chauhan also demanded that taking moral responsibility, the SDMC mayor should resign from the post.Leader of the House, Narendra Chawla refuted the claims of involvement of any councillor or political executive in the alleged scam. “The AAP is in the habit of levelling baseless allegations. When I asked them to submit proofs regarding their claims of a scam, they had none. They just display placards not proofs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aapbjp-spar-during-south-civic-body-house-meeting-over-alleged-scholarship-scam-101614104082680.html
23-02-2021||Delhi||How riots — and the pandemic— tore apart the lives of children of north-east Delhi||Mohammad Kaif was preparing for his CBSE class 12 exams last February when communal riots broke out in north-east Delhi, where he lives with his family. Overnight, the 19-year-old had to forget all about exams as he and family were forced to flee for their lives, to their village in Uttar Pradesh. Kaif, a resident of Mustafabad, aspired to become a doctor until last year. “We fled to our village the same day our neighbour was killed by a mob. Later, my family did not allow me to return to Delhi, to appear for the exams in the first week of March 2020. Then, before we could even think of returning to discuss my case with the school, a nationwide lockdown was announced. My entire year got ruined -- I finally completed my class 12 this month through distance learning mode.” A year after the violence, he is uncertain about his future. “Things have changed in the past one year. I could not study properly due to the circumstances. My father is also not keeping well. His work – he rents out bulldozers – was severely hit by the violence and then the pandemic. There is so much uncertainty around; I’m thinking of doing a course in the distance learning mode this year,” he said. As many as 53 people were killed and more than 400 injured in the riots that broke out in parts of north-east Delhi on February 23, 2020. Police have registered 755 cases related to the communal violence that was allegedly triggered by protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Like Kaif, hundreds of children in these parts are struggling to string together their lives interrupted by violence, even a year after the riots. Apart from seeing their neighbourhoods and schools laid to waste by rioters, many of them also lost their loved ones – some of them their parents – to the violence. Several children said they could not focus on studies throughout the year. Arsh Malik, 18, a resident of Yamuna Vihar, failed in two subjects in the class 12 exams. “My tuition centre was set afire by rioters at a time when my exams were on. Several people I knew died in the violence or were injured. Those were disturbing times. I could not study well for the exams that happened a week after the riots. Now, I’m thinking of enrolling in the distance learning mode,” he said. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had to postpone several exams for both classes 10 and 12 after the violence broke out. The board resumed exams from March 2 onwards but it could not conduct the postponed exams as by then, the Covid-19 pandemic had hit the city. Students were finally promoted last year on the basis of alternative assessment schemes. A 2005 UNICEF report on “Childhood Under Threat” define children as among the first and worst affected by conflict, whether directly or indirectly. Even if they are not killed or injured, they can be left with deep emotional scars and trauma from direct exposure to the violence or from dislocation, poverty, or the loss of loved ones, said the report. Iqra, a class 11 student who lost her two brothers, Amir Khan (30) and Hashim Ali (19), in the riots, said, “People have started referring to us as “that family that lost two sons in the danga (riots)”. That has become our identity now. I am glad that my class 10 exams were cancelled and we were promoted; otherwise, I would have failed. How do you concentrate on studies with so much tension around?” For the riot-hit children, the Covid-enforced lockdown was another bolt from the blue. Anjum, whose Khajuri Khas house was burned down by a mob, said, “We were left with nothing; not even a piece of cloth. We also lost the only smartphone we had and there was no way for any of us – myself or my siblings – to attend online classes. We could only resume studies in October after a person donated us a mobile phone.” Neetu Chaudhary, an official at the Arun Modern School in Brijpuri, one of the four schools that were attacked and damaged in the violence, said their student strength reduced by nearly 40%, post the riots and the Covid-enforced lockdown. “It took us months to bring back our school to its former status – the construction work is still going on. Now that the school has reopened for classes 9 to 12, we have another task at hand – instilling confidence in parents. We had to request the police to deploy some personnel during school hours so that their fears are allayed,” she said. Officials at the other three schools affected by the violence ---DRP Convent Public School, Victoria Senior Secondary School, and Rajdhani School -- said a large number of their students were yet to return to school. Farooq Ahmed Nawab, whose family owns both Rajdhani and Victoria schools, said, “The student strength has reduced by almost half in both of schools in the past one year. We are struggling to even manage the operational costs.” Parents and family members of children in riot-hit areas said the violence has left them traumatised and they are unable to shake it off. Imrana (32), who lost her husband to the firing in Subhash Mohalla during the riots, said her two children are now highly irritable and stubborn. “Even today, loud noises scare them and they get angry over the smallest of things. Being a single parent has been challenging as I have to discipline them, while still being mindful of the trauma they’ve been through,” she said. Fifteen-year-old Shifa Naaz, a class 10 student in old Mustafabad and the eldest of eight siblings, lost her father Mudassir Khan (30) to the riots. The loss has scarred her siblings more, she says. “My younger sister (12) refused to even see our father’s body for the last time. Since then, she has become highly irritable. The younger ones often dream of our father and cry. It is difficult to see them like that. Managing finances has also been challenging for our mother. Every day, I feel emptier and weak,” the 15-year-old said. Experts said a timely intervention is required to bring these children out of their trauma. Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), said the riots, followed by the lockdown, might have led to “conduct disorder” among children. “Conduct disorder is identified by emotional as well as behavioural disturbances. It’s very important that these children are given a chance to express themselves. For kids above 8 years of age, verbal expression is still easier but for those below that age, verbalising their trauma is a challenge. So, intervention by NGOs, child rights bodies, families, and schools is essential,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/how-riots-and-the-pandemic-tore-apart-the-lives-of-children-of-north-east-delhi-101614104081485.html
23-02-2021||Delhi||Sensitise students and parents on cyberbullying: DoE tells schools||The Directorate of Education (DoE) has directed all schools in the national capital to sensitise students and parents about cyberbullying and online threats they children might be subjected to while attending online classes during the Covid-19 pandemic.While schools have started resuming in-person sessions for classes 9 to 12, the sessions are still in the online mode for those enrolled in classes 1 to 8.In a letter addressed to all heads of government and private schools in Delhi, the DoE on Monday said, “The internet spaces are growing and multiplying and data security, privacy, and protection are inadequate to keep a check on this. It is important that everyone is aware of the risks that could be associated with being connected to the internet.”“In addition, the students need to be warned against these risks and it is extremely important for us to ensure that every possible step is taken towards giving our children safe spaces to learn in, that safeguards their innocence and cater to their curiosity in a non-harmful way,” it said.Citing a study conducted by India Child Protection Fund (ICPF), regarding online exploitation of children, which indicates a sharp rise in demand for online child pornography during the lockdown, the DoE said, “Hence, it is imperative to make children and their parents aware about the safe use of the internet.”The directorate also asked schools to make parents and students aware of the guidelines on “safe online learning in times of Covid-19” that were released by the Union education ministry in June last year. “Heads of all schools are directed to share this information with teachers, students, and parents via text messages or WhatsApp groups or by any other means which are being used to reach out to children and parents,” the DoE added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sensitise-students-and-parents-on-cyberbullying-doe-tells-schools-101614104082153.html

Sidhana, who has been evading arrest, spent about two hours at the stage and left the venue on a motorbike. He was escorted out of the rally site at the grain market by a large gathering of his supporters. Delhi Police have announced ₹1 lakh reward for information leading to Sidhana’s arrest who is resident of Bathinda. There was a heavy deployment of Punjab Police at Mehraj but Sidhana reached the stage without any resistance by cops. Bathinda range inspector general of police (IGP) Jaskaran Singh said since Sidhana is not facing any case in Punjab, “there was no question of arresting him”. “He is wanted by Delhi Police and they may have an action plan. We will provide all possible support if our counterparts in Delhi ask for it. Police deployment was made to ensure law and order at the event,” said the IG.While the Delhi Police did not offer any official statement on why Sidhana could not be arrested despite him turning up at the rally in Punjab, a police officer who did not want to be named said, “Sidhana’s arrest is our top priority and his movements are being tracked. Our teams which have been sent to Punjab to arrest the suspects are facing resistance from locals. We have arrested suspects like Deep Sidhu and others from Punjab and other states. Sidhana will also be caught soon.” It was apparent show of strength by Sidhana, who had unsuccessfully contested from Rampura Phul assembly segment as a candidate of the People’s Party of Punjab (PPP) in 2012. The PPP was floated by the state finance minister and Bathinda MLA Manpreet Singh Badal who later merged his party with the Congress. During his speech, Sidhana cautioned the leadership of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading the protest against the three farm laws, for accepting anything less than the repeal of the contentious laws. “The farmers’ agitation will be intensified to ensure the three farm laws are withdrawn. There is no question of agreeing to any amendments or suspension of the laws for 18 months,” Sidhana said. No prominent farmer leader spoke on the occasion. Speakers also questioned SKM leaders for dubbing Punjabi film actor Deep Sidhu, arrested in connection with Red Fort violence, as ‘gaddar’ (traitor) to the farmers’ cause. Other speakers raised the demand for release of Sidhu and withdrawal of case against Sidhana. Talking about cases of rioting against protesters, Sidhana said: “Capt Amarinder Singh will have to explain to the public if Punjab Police helps Delhi Police in arresting anyone booked for the (January 26) violence.” He even exhorted his supporters to “hold Delhi Police hostage”. “Leaders like BKU president Balbir Singh Rajewal may have repeatedly ducked media questions on farmer leadership’s silence on police action against me. Leaders of Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders are also facing criminal complaints after January 26 incident. But I assure them our supporters will not let the police arrest them,” said Sidhana. Leaders of Sikh radical organisations such as Dal Khalsa and Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) were instrumental behind organising the rally. Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwar Pal Singh said the SKM should chalk out a plan to gherao Parliament again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fugitive-sidhana-addresses-punjab-rally-says-farm-laws-must-be-repealed-101614103960770.html

23-02-2021||Gurugram||Trio held for duping people on pretext of selling mortgaged properties||The police arrested three people over the last week for allegedly duping several people of crores of rupees on the pretext of selling mortgaged properties, over the last few months. The suspects had created a fake domain name (website) and an email ID closely resembling that of a public sector bank, and presented themselves as bank employees to fool their targets, the police said on Tuesday. According to the police, around 20 people have been duped so far and they are estimated to have struck deals for around ₹100 crore.According to the police, one of the suspects, a former employee of the bank, managed to get details of mortgaged properties as he was aware of the auction processes of the bank. The suspects allegedly approached prospective buyers as representatives of the bank and after finalising the deal, shared the sale proposal from the fake email ID and got them to deposit the property cost in their bank account. The suspects were allegedly planning to move to Dubai after collecting ₹40 crore over the next week. On February 15, Gaurav Sahni of Gurugram had filed a complaint with the cyber police station alleging that he was duped of ₹2.38 crore by people claiming to be bank employees, who had offered to sell him a mortgaged property with the bank. Based on his complaint, a case was registered under sections 419 (impersonation), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document as genuine) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66D of IT Act at the Cyber police station KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that based on the bank account in which money was transferred, and tracking the fake email ID and domain used by the suspects, the police tracked the accused and arrested three of them from different locations. The suspects were identified as Kishan Kumar of Delhi, Rakesh Vashiye alias Rakesh Gupta of Uttar Pradesh and Saurabh Palanwal, alias Sumit Sharma, alias Pashu, of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh. Rao said they had arrested Kishan on February 17 and took him on two-day police remand. “During interrogation, he revealed the names of his two associates and the police arrested two other accused on February 19,” he said. Kishan had earlier worked with the bank and was familiar with the process of auctioning mortgage property. “Kishan hatched the plan to dupe people on the pretext of selling mortgaged property of banks and engaged his two friends Rakesh and Saurabh. They purchased a domain name similar to the bank name and created a fake email ID. They created a company — Aatma Ram Mahajan Building — and purchased a domain name ARMB. They presented ARMB as an asset recovery management branch of the bank,” said Rao.The police said that the suspects approached prospective buyers as bank representatives and sent them proposals from the fake ID, which they claimed was of the asset recovery management branch of the bank. After finalising the deal, they asked their victims to transfer the money to their accounts, from which they re-transferred money to a different account and withdrew cash. They purchased three gold bricks for ₹1.50 crore from a jeweller in New Delhi. “They were planning to collect ₹40 crore through this cheating and move to Dubai with the money. They had taken visas and were ready to close two more deals for ₹17 crore,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/trio-held-for-duping-people-on-pretext-of-selling-mortgaged-properties-101614101741367.html
23-02-2021||Gurugram||Private schools remain divided on issue of reopening for junior classes||Schools in the city were divided on reopening for students of classes 3 to 5 with some parents expressing concerns over another surge in the cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in other parts of the country. While some schools have announced that they will welcome students having put in place measures to keep them safe, others have said that they will not do so until all parents are comfortable with the decision. Those who will start their operations said that classes will be held from 10am to 1:30pm as per the government directive. The teachers have undergone training based on CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines. All entry and exit points in schools have been rearranged to a one-way flow of traffic. Schools will have to follow all Covid-19 related guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) before starting the operations, said the education department’s official. Students of classes 3 to 5 will be returning to classrooms after a gap of almost a year. In-person classes were suspended early last year to check the spread of Covid-19. Schools for classes 6 to 12 have already opened in the state over the past few months. Kunal Bhadoo, director of Kunskapsskolan Schools, said they are facilitating both online as well as in-person classes on campus at the same time, with all applicable SOPs listed out by government authorities in place. “We have been doing so for grade 6 upwards for so long. After recent Government directions, we are doing the same for grade 3 upwards,” he said. Before coming to school, students will have to submit a consent letter from their parents. Parents who wish to continue online classes for their children can write to the school in this regard. Another school, Lancers International School, has reopened the school for junior classes and said that they are well prepared for the students joining classes from Wednesday onwards. In-person classes have huge a huge impact on children’s education, development and well-being, said the officials. “Our staff is undergoing training based on CDC guidelines 2021. We will continue to enhance the existing range of safety measures in place – mandatory temperature checks at the entrance, wearing face masks at all times. All entry and exit points have been rearranged to a one-way flow of traffic,” said Rohit Mann, director, Lancers International School. Physical distancing markers have been placed in the schools operational from Wednesday. Hand sanitisers have been placed strategically throughout the campuses. Mann said being an International Baccalaureate school, these measures were easy for them to implement due to the small class size ratio. “As of now, students from grades 6-12 are attending school. About 30% of students are already attending school till 1.30pm. This number has been growing ever since we started about two weeks ago,” he said. Schools said that parental consent is required before they allow any student to attend in-person classes. Those parents who do not want their children to attend in-person classes can continue with the online mode. Neeti Kaushik, director/principal, Mount Olympus School, said that the school walls missed the children, as children missed their school. “The overwhelming response from both the parents and children in rejoining the school is indeed appreciated. “We have already commenced operations for classes 6 to 11, following the safety protocols of social distancing, use of mask, staggered sitting arrangement, hand hygiene, etc. To make the transition convenient for our students and parents we are ready to welcome students of 3 to 5 to school for doubt- clearing sessions or extra classes for better understanding as their annual assessment starts from first week of March 2021,” she said. Kaushik further added that formal resumption of classes will commence as per the government instructions from April 2021 with the new academic session. Alka Singh, principal of Blue Bells Model School in Sector 4, said that they are calling students from grades 9 to 12 to clear their doubts before the exams. “We have asked the parents to give consent for students of class 6 to 8 for the coming sessions in April. For grade 3 to 5, we would not be calling the students due to increasing Covid-19 cases. We want to go in a staggered manner and we cannot compromise on the safety of students. We have started the first phase of calling students and the second phase will begin in April. Looking at the condition, we will call students of grade 3 to 5,” she said. Parents too seemed wary of in-person classes. Manmeet Kumar, mother of class 5 student of Suncity School in Sector 54, said that she is not keen in sending her ward to school given the Covid-19 situation. “The number of cases are increasing every day and the children’s safety is at risk,” she said. Ritu Gupta, mother of class 5 of Heritage School, said that she would like to wait till the vaccination drive is completed across the city, before sending her child to school. “With exams approaching, the health of children is extremely important and we would like to wait and watch before making a decision on sending young children to school,” she said. Nishant Kapoor, father of a class 5 student of Suncity school, said he is hesitant to send his son for regular classes, “Children at this age are too young to be taking proper precautions. We are doubtful that we would be sending our child to regular school till the condition improves,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/private-schools-remain-divided-on-issue-of-reopening-for-junior-classes-101614101740755.html
23-02-2021||Gurugram||Govt schools gear up to welcome students of classes 3 to 5||Students of classes 3 to 5 are set to resume in-person classes from Wednesday, with government schools taking measures to handle the full strength of students in view of the ongoing pandemic.Officials of schools said that besides following all Covid-19 protocols, they have set up separate entry and exit points and are ensuring sufficient staff presence for better attention to students, to make up for the learning loss over the last 11 months.“Except classes 1 and 2, schools will run with full strength from Wednesday. We aim to now operate schools without any panic. Students will no longer have to carry a medical certificate. Only a consent form signed by a parent will be enough to enter the school. Students can get relaxation for a day or two if they fail to get the consent form,” said Prem Lata, district nodal officer for primary education.In Haryana, classes 6 to 12 are already underway in schools, with over 80% of the students turning up to attend the in-person sessions. Classes 6 to 8 resumed on February 1, classes 10 and 12 on December 14, 2020, and classes 9 and 11 on December 21, 2020. For almost 353 government schools in the district having a separate primary wing, the directorate of school education on Monday issued the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for running schools for three-and-a-half hours, from 10am to 1.30pm.To avoid any gatherings or interaction of primary students with others after the classes, schools have planned to allow primary school students to either exit through a separate gate or leave a few minutes before 1.30pm. “Almost 80% of students in classes 6 to 12 are coming for classes. To avoid any gathering once classes are over, teachers have been instructed to let primary school students leave by 1.20pm through the exit gate. Classes are being held without any prayer or recess in between. Therefore, chances of students gathering is impossible,” said Suman Sharma, principal of a government school in sector 4/7.Principals of other government schools said they are adopting similar tactics, besides following the basic Covid-19 protocols like temperature check and sanitisation of classrooms.“Some primary classrooms are opening after 11 months, although schools have been functional. They have been sanitised. Seating arrangements will, however, depend on the footfall of students. If the strength is too high, students will be shifted to other rooms,” said Sunil Kumar, principal, principal of a government school in Sadar.According to Kumar, since students of classes 6 to 12 are attending classes in almost full strength, they are running the school in two batches. “While practising the norms to prevent transmission of Covid-19 infection, some students are given the first shift from 8.30am to 12.30 pm, while the other half is put in second shift from 1pm till 4pm,” said Kumar, adding that such an arrangement will not be required for primary classes as the overall count of students is less than 200.A government school in Kadipur, however, is not expecting many students of primary classes to turn up. “Only 50% of enrolled students in 6-12 attend the classes physically. Considering the turnout so far, it is expected that not many kids in classes 3 to 5 will come for classes as many of them are still in their villages. But it is uncertain as schools are reopening after months, it is likely students might attend the class,” the school’s principal said.Sharma and Kumar said that there are enough teachers to attend to students even if a section has to be divided. “Teachers of classes 1 and 2 will be involved as well, if required,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/govt-schools-gear-up-to-welcome-students-of-classes-3-to-5-101614101740143.html
23-02-2021||Gurugram||Parents of private schools protest against ‘unreasonable’ fee collection||Over 100 parents from at least five prominent private schools of the city protested at the Mini Secretariat on Tuesday against alleged overcharging of tuition fees by the school authorities, with most of them complaining that students’ full access to online classes have been blocked after they objected to paying the fees. Parents complained that they have been getting emails and WhatsApp messages from schools regarding full payment of fees at a time when schools have been closed for months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Senior district administration officials, however, said that a clarification has been sought from the district education officer on the matter. “The details of the matter have been submitted to the deputy commissioner, while a clarification has been sought from the district education officer to resolve the issue,” said Siddharth Dahiya, city magistrate, who met the protesting parents.Officials of the education department were unavailable for comment. Since schools were shut in March 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak, the directorate of education has issued several directives in this regard. Private schools were asked to charge fees under applicable heads only after the physical opening of schools, until which the schools were allowed to collection fees only under the tuition head. Later, parents who were affected financially due to the pandemic were also allowed to apply for exemptions. After the schools had challenged the reduction in fee, the Punjab and Haryana high court last July had allowed “reasonable fee collection” by schools, if online classes are held daily and had ruled that teachers’ salaries should not be cut.Currently, the tuition fee paid by parents has been adjusted by schools under different heads, complained parents at the site. “They are embarrassing kids in online classes by asking for fees,” said Bharati Sharma, whose son studies in class 2. “From July onwards, schools have been asking for full payment of fees under different heads like infrastructure, examination, resources, health and hygiene. When schools are closed, why should we pay the additional fee, except for the tuition charges?” In November 2020, over 800 parents of different schools had connected on the Telegram app to share their grievances on unnecessary amounts charged by schools. Sagarika Gupta, the mother of two daughters who are in class 4, said that schools are using pressure tactics as the annual examinations are just around the corner. “School authorities never replied or responded to our queries. Therefore, we had to protest. For an academic year, we are spending almost ₹2.5 lakh when the schools are closed. Although we have paid the tuition fees, schools have blocked access to study material for the examination,” said Gupta, even as other parents nodded in agreement. A parent at the protest site, on the condition of anonymity, shared a message shared by the school sent on Tuesday, stating that the final results of their ward would be held if dues are not cleared. Another parent, who also requested not to be named, said, “The school authority has said that they will give a rebate of ₹15,000 but the annual fee has to be paid.”Dhruv Bansal, the father of a class 11 student, said, “Schools cannot ask for the annual fee, according to the court and education department orders. If the issue is not addressed, we will sit on a hunger strike.” Col (retd) KR Pratap Singh, senior vice-president of Haryana Progressive Schools Conference, said, “There is no bar on the collection of all charges by the school, as per the ruling of the Punjab and Haryana high court in July and October last year. Schools can assess their fee structure, and some schools reduced the annual charges by 10%. Parents can be exempted only if they seek relief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/parents-of-private-schools-protest-against-unreasonable-fee-collection-101614101681542.html
23-02-2021||Gurugram||Turnout for first dose vaccination drive drops to 28.5%||The turnout of front-line workers for the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine declined to 28.5%, with only 414 of the 1,450 targeted workers turning up for the drive on Tuesday. This is the lowest coverage rate since the launch of the inoculation drive for front-line workers. The turnout of healthcare workers for the second dose also dropped to 60.6% on Tuesday, as per the health department data, with 3,036 of the 5,002 targeted healthcare workers taking the second dose shot of the Covid-19 vaccines at 66 session sites.“The footfall of both front-line and healthcare workers remained low despite targeting more than 6,000 people. In case of second dose inoculation, health workers are aware they can take jab anytime between four and six weeks, while in the case of front-line workers, there has been reluctance among the employees of revenue and panchayati raj institutions (PRI),” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Until now, almost 14,000 of the 18,000 registered front-line workers have taken the first shot, due to which officials are expecting the footfall to remain low. Of the 500 police personnel targeted on Tuesday, about 160 took the vaccine shot, while only 123 of the 500 targeted Municipal Corporation of Gurugram employees turned up to take the jab. The sluggish response continued in other departments as well, with only 88 of 300 targeted PRI workers and 14 of the 100 targeted revenue department officials turning up for the drive. “Considering the poor footfall, the department will hold a special camp for police personnel on Saturday. For MCG, we are talking with the officials about setting up a camp,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/turnout-for-first-dose-vaccination-drive-drops-to-285-101614101682118.html

We had received several complaints from the residents following which the action was taken,” said Bhath.Earlier on Monday, the enforcement team checked the status of illegal colonies around Bhondsi, where demolitions have been carried out to ensure illegal constructions are not resumed. “The team went to illegal colonies and found a few instances where fresh construction was being carried out again. We have issued a warning to these plot owners and asked them to stop construction immediately as they would otherwise face demolition,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement.The data collected by the department estimates that they have carried out enforcement on roughly 720 acres of 840 acres where illegal colonies have come up.Bhath said that on Monday, they had also visited a private licensed colony to check violations in approved houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-demolishes-illegal-tenements-in-saraswati-kunj-colony-101614101680933.html
23-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG to intensify action against waste dumping violations at dairy farms||Responding to frequent complaints from citizens regarding unauthorised dumping of waste in sewers by dairy farms, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) plans to scale up action against violators. Residents living in areas where dairy farms are concentrated say that repeated blockages due to dumping of waste, particularly cow and buffalo dung, in open drains is causing spillover of sewage onto roads.Confirming that they frequently receive such complaints from Zone 1 and Zone 2, the older parts of Gurugram city, MCG officials said that such violations lead to an added burden for the sanitation department, which has to deploy additional labour and resources in the problem areas.Over the past week, blockages due to waste from dairy farms have been reported in Dhanwapur and Jharsa’s Krishna Colony and mechanised sewer cleaning machines had to be pressed into service.Deepa Verma, a resident of Dhanwapur, said, “The dairy farms should be relocated outside of residential areas. The streets sometimes become unwalkable because of sewage overflow. The wastewater stinks and also attracts mosquitoes. Residents here are worried about their health. Several people have raised this issue with the municipality and on social media, but the situation hasn’t changed.”According to a survey by the MCG last year, there are at least 570 registered dairy farms in the district, of which 241 farms are located in Zone 1, 259 in Zone 2, 45 in Zone 3 and 25 in Zone 4.Before the survey, which commenced in October last year, the number had earlier been estimated at around 320, indicating an increase in dairy farms.An official with the animal husbandry department, who did not wish to be identified, said that this is indeed the case. “There are also many small dairy farms that do not have any kind of registration. They also generate a lot of waste, although I cannot comment on how the waste is disposed of since that is not the purview of my department,” the official said.Bijender Sharma, a senior sanitation inspector with the MCG, said, “This is an issue that we are constantly grappling with. We issue dozens of challans every year against poor waste disposal practices at dairy farms, but more needs to be done.”To address this issue, the MCG had last year tabled a proposal to shift such farming operations outside Gurugram’s municipal limits. While Sharma did not directly comment on the status of the proposal, another MCG official who is privy to the matter confirmed that issues of land acquisition in peri-urban areas have slowed the progress of the proposal.Vinay Pratap Singh, municipal commissioner, Gurugram, could not be contacted on Tuesday despite multiple attempts.Jitendra Garg, the joint commissioner of MCG, said, “We are aware of the issue. Discharging wastewater or dung openly in residential areas cannot be allowed. The authorities concerned will serve notices to the dairy farmers warning them of stricter action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-intensify-action-against-waste-dumping-violations-at-dairy-farms-101614101680283.html

The CBI team, including two lady officers, reached Abhishek Banerjee’s house moments after the CM left.According to CBI officials privy to the development, Rujira was questioned for around an hour by a team and the entire proceeding was captured on video.This comes a day after the central agency questioned Menaka Gambhir, Rujira’s sister in connection with the same case.CBI officials haven’t ruled out the possibility of questioning the two sisters again. They said that the statements of Rujira and Menaka were being matched.“The statements given by Rujira Banerjee and Menaka Gambhir would be matched and verified before further steps are taken,” said an official.Also read: India hasn’t changed its mind on Chinese investment, will make no exceptionsCBI officials said that at least two bank accounts, one of a London-based bank and another of a Bangkok-based bank, have come under the scanner for huge transactions.On Sunday, the CBI had visited the residence of Abhishek Banerjee to serve notice to his wife for questioning in connection with a coal smuggling case. The agency had also summoned Banerjee’s sister-in-law for questioning in the case.On Monday, Rujira responded to the CBI and sent a letter saying, "Though I am unaware of the reason for me being called for questioning on the subject matter of the investigation, you may visit my residence as per your convenience between 11 am and 3 pm tomorrow i.e 23 February 20201”.On Sunday evening, Abhishek Banerjee tweeted a photo of the notice left by the CBI at his residence. “...if they think they can use these ploys to intimidate us, they are mistaken,” he wrote.Later, CM Banerjee said she is not intimidated by anyone adding that “a tiger cub is not scared of fighting cats and rats”.The incident has triggered mudslinging between the BJP and the TMC ahead of the crucial assembly polls.“Bhaipo (nephew) will now land in jail. More clinching evidence would surface once the diary of Anup Majhi (prime accused in the coal smuggling case) comes out,” said Suvendu Adhikari, former TMC heavyweight who sided with the BJP.“This is not done.

The task force has so far freed 67,000 acres of land of the revenue department.""Priority has been given to sports grounds, whether under the sports department, the youth welfare department or under the MGNREGA. Our effort is that the sports grounds should be made at the panchayat level. If land is found near primary or upper primary schools, then children will get space for themselves and villagers will also get space for holding public programmes," he said.The chief minister said the intention of his government is that the sports grounds should be located near the primary and upper primary schools."The district magistrates have been instructed to exchange land if needed. So far, sports grounds have been made in thousands of village panchayats," he said.Adityanath also said sports kits have been provided to the "yuvak mangal dal" and "mahila mangal dal".Meanwhile, in the post-lunch session, Samajwadi Party (SP) members protested the passing of certain bills in the Legislative Council without a proper discussion.Amidst the noise, Chairman Kunwar Manvendra Singh declared that the bills have been passed by voice vote.

23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Vij seeks new DGP, stokes controversy||Haryana home minister Anil Vij has stoked yet another controversy by writing to additional chief secretary (ACS), home, to send a panel of officers to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to be considered for the next Haryana director general of police (DGP) despite the fact that incumbent Manoj Yadava has over four years of service left. “As Yadava assumed charge on February 21, 2019, he has completed his two-year tenure …,” Vij wrote. On the contrary, the state government on January 7 has already extended the tenure of Yadava till further orders. In fact, Vij as home minister had put his signatures on the file ordering the extension. Minister’s note not in tune with SC directions The home minister’s latest move is also not in line with the directions of the Supreme Court. The apex court in its 2006 orders in the Prakash Singh case had held that the DGP should have a minimum tenure of at least two years irrespective of his date of superannuation. Former IPS officer Prakash Singh, the original petitioner in the matter which led to the landmark apex court judgment on police reforms, said that the Supreme Court has defined minimum and not maximum tenure for the DGP. An amendment in the Haryana Police Act in 2018 — the DGP shall have tenure of not less than one year extendable to one more year irrespective of his date of superannuation — was rejected by the Supreme Court on January 16, 2019, since it was not in consonance with its directions. The apex court in fact had dismissed a bunch of interlocutory applications filed by Haryana, Punjab and three other states, seeking exemption for their respective Police Acts from the operation of SC’s July 3, 2018, order and permission to appoint the DGPs in accordance with their respective police laws. The apex court had also ruled in its 2006 orders that any legislation or rule framed by any of the states or the central government running counter to the direction shall remain in abeyance to the aforesaid extent. Vij, who did not respond to messages for a comment, seems to have misinterpreted SC orders. He told television channels on Tuesday that the SC had directed that DGP could have a tenure of two years. “Since his two years have been completed, that’s why I have written the note,’’ he said. Quoting apex court directions, legal experts said that the DGP can only be relieved of his responsibilities by the state government in consultation with the State Security Commission if any action has been taken against him under the All-India Services (Discipline and Appeal) rules or following his conviction in a court of law in a criminal offence or in a case of corruption, or if he is otherwise incapacitated from discharging his duties. Opposition slams minister Reacting to Vij’s move, former minister Karan Dalal said this reflected poorly on the aptitude of the minister. “It is an abnormal way to function. If disciplinary action has been initiated against the DGP, then one should consider replacing him. But Yadava should be appreciated and commended for maintaining sanity in the police department despite a loose cannon minister. The truth is that a conflict is going on between Vij and the chief minister. But it is the officers who are suffering,’’ Dalal said.Congress MLA Neeraj Sharma said Vij is known for his impulsiveness. “Instead of raking up frivolous matters, he should pay attention to the performance of his departments. All his portfolios are in a shambles,’’ he said.

Dozens of women, along with their families, raised slogans at the Press Enclave in Srinagar before marching up to the Lal Chowk. “For the past 12 years, we have been protesting peacefully again and again. We came here from Pakistan when rehabilitation policy was announced. Our husbands brought us here and but the government is neither giving us citizenship nor the travel documents,” said Saira Javed, a protester from north Kashmir. The police intervened at the Lal Chowk where the women were demanding an audience with the deputy commissioner. A magistrate-level officer then arrived, prompting the gathering to disperse. Some of the Kashmiri youths, who had crossed over to the PoK in the 1990s to get arms training, gave up violence, married there and started lives afresh. There are no official figure about such couples, but the protesters said they were 400 in number. “The issue is that we don’t have any documents or any identity. The only identity we have is that she is the wife of a militant. Neither we nor our children can go anywhere. Neither can we send our kids to study outside,” said another protester. Many of such couples entered India through Nepal route and the informal entry meant no official recognition of such families even as a rehabilitation policy had been announced. The protesters said many among them have been divorced and some have lost their husbands. “I came here in 2012. My mother died recently but I could not go to see her one last time. We can’t meet our relatives and family members. Parents of many women died during these years but they could not go even for the funeral,” said Saba Fayaz, another protester.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pakorigin-wives-of-kashmiri-men-stage-protest-seek-citizenship-or-deportation-101614097309719.html

The statement from the home minister comes a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) clarified that it has not certified any traditional medicine for the treatment of Covid-19.Patanjali launched the product on February 19 in presence of Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari. On Monday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) expressed shock and dismay at what it called is a “blatant lie of WHO certification” for Patanjali’s Coronil tablet. The global health body earlier tweeted not giving any certificate to Coronil. “WHO has not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment COVID-19,” the global health body said on February 19.Deshmukh, in a series of tweets on Tuesday, said that the IMA has questioned the ‘trials’ of Coronil and WHO has refuted claims that it has certified it. He added that launching such drugs hurriedly and the endorsement by two Union ministers is “deplorable”.Also read: India hasn’t changed its mind on Chinese investment, will make no exceptions“The IMA has questioned the said 'clinical trials' of #Coronil & WHO refuted the false claims made by #Patanjali Ayurveda for giving any certificate regarding its effectiveness for #Covid19 treatment.

Selling of #Coronil without proper certification from competent health organizations like #WHO, #IMA and others will not be allowed in Maharashtra,” Deshmukh tweeted.Meanwhile, Patanjali Ayurveda claimed that it has the proper certification from the relevant authorities to sell and export the product to 158 countries across the world.SK Tijarawala, spokesperson of Patanjali Ayurveda said, "Coronil has received the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CoPP) from the Ayush section of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation as per the WHO certification scheme. This empowers us to sell the product across 158 countries. The public is under the misconception that the WHO has not certified it, but the WHO never certifies any product. It sets a protocol for clinical control trials on modern medical parameters. Once that is cleared DCGI and Ayush Ministry gives its certificate. and we have those certificates.

Amaravati will remain the legislative capital and the people have to decide what exactly they want,” he said.The cabinet approved the compensation package to be given to the farmers whose lands were acquired for Kakinada Special Economic Zone in East Godavari district.“The cabinet sub-committee headed by agriculture minister K Kanna Babu submitted its report to the chief minister suggesting certain compensation package for the farmers who would be losing their lands, but the cabinet decided to enhance the compensation amount,” he said.The cabinet also approved the selection of a joint venture partner for the construction of the YSR Steel Plant in Kadapa district. The cabinet finalised the calendar of implementation of nine various welfare schemes under the Navaratnalu (nine jewels) programme. “The benefits would be extended to the people as per the calendar,” Nani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jagan-rolls-out-rs-670-cr-scheme-for-economically-weak-upper-caste-women-101614093255430.html
23-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt launches campaign to encourage shift from pvt to electric vehicles||The Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) on Tuesday launched their Switch Delhi campaign to encourage private vehicle owners to shift to electric vehicles.The campaign in association with WRI India, a research organisation that works to foster environmentally sound and socially equitable development, was launched by Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot."The Switch Delhi pledge has been launched to cement the commitment of Delhiites to be a part of the electric vehicle revolution in Delhi and make Delhi the EV capital of India. I encourage all Delhiites to take this pledge if you are going to switch to an EV and install a charging point on your premise in the next three years. I have taken this pledge today and hope everyone will do the same."Over 7,000 new EVs have been registered in Delhi. Total subsidy of around ₹13.5 crore on over 210 approved models has been disbursed as of now," the minister said, while delivering the keynote address during a webinar on "Encouraging Private Vehicles to Switch to Electric Vehicles".The webinar that saw the participation of over 100 electric vehicle enthusiasts comprised two panel discussions - one with EV adopters and experts, and another on how youth can drive the EV movement in Delhi"The EV policies introduced by other states seem more like an industrial policy to attract investments to the state. But the Delhi government's EV policy has set an example to the country by providing huge subsidies and incentives to people switching to an EV, and by involving them in this movement," said O P Agarwal from WRI India.Among other participating expert panelists were Abhishek Ranjan (BSES Rajdhani Power Limited) and Akshima Ghate (Rocky Mountain Institute, India).The webinar was the first in a series of similar virtual events organised under the Switch Delhi campaign, an eight-week mass awareness initiative by the Delhi government to sensitise Delhiites about the benefits of switching to electric vehicles."The campaign aims at informing, encouraging, and motivating each and every person in Delhi to switch from polluting vehicles to zero-emission electric vehicles," a statement from the DDC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-launches-campaign-to-encourage-shift-from-pvt-to-electric-vehicles-101614090375790.html

With home isolation allowed for Covid-19 patients, patients, asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, are opting for the same, and so the pressure on hospital infrastructure has gone down. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “In view of the increasing cases, the administration will increase beds. We will ensure more beds are reserved. At the current active centres, we have brought down the number of beds at the dedicated Covid care centre’s, dedicated Covid health centres and Covid hospitals, which will be increased when needed.”Currently, the district has 13,763 beds reserved for Covid-19, of which 652 are with ventilators. Of these, the 13K-+ beds, 4,498 beds are reserved in the city, while 4,787 are in PCMC.The remaining are reserved in the Cantonment and rural areas of the district.Of the 652 ventilators available, 388 are reserved for Pune city.

23-02-2021||Chandigarh||India, UK ties set to grow deeper: Andrew Ayre||Andrew Ayre, the outgoing British deputy high commissioner in Chandigarh, believes India-UK ties are set to grow deeper with the focus on information technology and manufacturing in business and partnership in health, education and climate change. “The past is important, but our future is more important. We have close ties, particularly in this region, comprising Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Whether it’s business delegation visits or the trade flow or the growing number of students and health care professionals opting for further studies and jobs in the United Kingdom, they are all an indicator of our success in the region,” Ayre said, reflecting on his four-year tenure at the deputy high commission in Chandigarh that draws to a close on Wednesday. “I’d urge youngsters not to overlook my country. Rather, they should make the most of the opportunities there, particularly now that the UK has left the European Union and has its own visa and immigration policy,” he said, highlighting the strong diaspora connect. Caroline Rowett first British woman deputy high commissioner in India His successor, Caroline Rowett, was the UK’s charge d’affairs in Haiti before being appointed the first British woman deputy high commissioner in India. “She is looking forward to meeting you all as soon as she has completed her self-isolation,” Ayre said during an interview on the eve of his departure. “The Covid-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on everyone, including the operations of the deputy high commission. My only regret is that I’ve been unable to host a farewell event due to the restrictions. I leave with a heavy heart but a part of me will always be here,” he said on an emotional note. Besides expressing gratitude to the governors and chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana and their ministerial teams and officials, Ayre said, “I want to thank the citizens of Chandigarh, too numerous to mention individually, who have guided my wife Bettina and I, hosted us and shown us nothing but kindness since we arrived in 2017. I’m grateful to my staff and family without whom much less would have been achieved. Chandigarh, the City Beautiful, stay kind, be kind. Cherish the way you are. It’s people who make this place special. ” Finds India diverse, complex Reminiscing his trips to Rajasthan, Goa and Agra apart from the region, the deputy high commissioner, who learnt Hindi for four months before taking up his Indian mission, said, “India is complex, there’s so much diversity that honestly no foreigner can claim to have understood it entirely.” As for Punjabi, he admitted he has picked up more of it during his stay in Chandigarh and has a weakness for butter chicken, naan and kulfi. “I’ll miss walking in Kansal forest adjoining Sukhna Lake; it’s been a sanctuary for me, too,” he said in his inimitable style. A passionate biker, he recalled trips on his Royal Enfield Classic around the region and the camaraderie among fellow bikers. Reading non-fiction is another area of interest with Daniel Silva and Tony Parsons being favourite authors at present. Signing off with his life lessons, he said, “Don’t take life too seriously, accept you can’t control everything and put family and friends first.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/india-uk-ties-set-to-grow-deeper-andrew-ayre-101614090279299.html

The decision was taken during a meeting on Tuesday when the PMC chief medical officer enquired with private hospitals regarding beds for Covid-19 patients. As on Monday, Pune city’s active case tally reached 2,902, with 1,984 taking treatment in various hospitals; the count of total positive cases is 2,04,758. Dr Ashish Bharati, PMC’s chief medical officer, said, “We have given instructions to all private hospitals to secure beds for Covid-19 patients and give priority to Covid-19 patients. We want to reserve 2,000 beds across all private hospitals.” The dashboard of the Pune district administration, on Tuesday, showed a total of 9,259 beds vacant across the district of a total of 13,722. To tackle with any eventualities, the PMC has also decided to restart some of its Covid care centres.

23-02-2021||City||Goa's contentious second airport sees fresh protests. Here's why||Farmers in Goa’s northernmost taluka of Pernem have risen against losing their lands this time for a road connecting the upcoming International airport at Mopa to the national highway. This could be the latest chapter in a protracted struggle the farmers have raged against the acquisition of their lands - first for the airport and now for the connecting road.On Friday, some 200-odd farmers were bundled into police buses and placed under arrest after they blocked the path of government surveyors who were on their way to demarcate the land for a brand new approach road. The protesters refused to budge and not to part with even an inch more of the land that they say has sustained them.“The chief minister is saying that he is trying to make us understand. They are saying we should understand? What should we understand? We have even given them an alternative alignment that will involve less land. More than 500 farmers are going to lose their homes for the road,” Prashant Shirodkar, a land-losing farmer, said.Also read: England’s medical officer says Covid-19 to remain problem for ‘next few winters’“If the CM really wants to understand us then he should come and have a look at our fields and cashews. Villagers from this area have already sacrificed land for the Tillari canal, the Sports City, Ayush Hospital, Ravindra Bhavan, and now they say they are bringing casinos too,” Shirodkar added.Goa’s second International Airport, which is being built in the state’s northern corner and covering nearly 100-lakh square metres of land that once comprised villages of Mopa, Uguem, Dhadachivada, Poroscodem and Dhargal, has had a contentious history. First proposed in the late 90s, the project ran into opposition from politicians, hoteliers and taxi operators from South Goa who opposed the airport saying it was too far North and going ahead with the project would harm the development of South Goa.The land acquisition procedure that had nearly lapsed was taken forward only in 2012 after the BJP government came to power and after written assurances from the central government that the existing Dabolim airport, which doubles up as a Naval base, will continue to operate as a civilian airport even after the new airport is inaugurated.But the land losing farmers were not convinced. Within a radius of ten kilometres, farmers in the once rural Pernem taluka have had to part with 9-lakh square metre of land, mainly comprising cashew, mango and other fruit orchards, for a Sports City for which land was acquired but never materialised, the tiller irrigation canal that is lying in a state of disrepair and other projects like an Ayush Hospital, an auditorium, etc.“How much more land should we part with? Is it always us who have to pay the price of development? Is there no other area that you can choose to ‘develop’? Let other parts of Goa also see the benefits of ‘development’. It’s not like we are the only farmers,” Bharat Bagkar, who had led the villagers collective to oppose the acquisition, said.Villagers are also upset that more land than what is necessary for an airport is being acquired while the rest is being ‘given away’ to GMR Infrastructure which won the bid to build and operate the airport for ‘city-side’ development.Nearly 10-lakh square metres has been given to the airport concessionaire that will likely be used to build a gaming zone besides other hospitality ventures.“We understand that an airport can be built with 30-40 lakh square metres of land but here the government has acquired 1-crore square metres,” Shirodkar said.“We were paid a compensation of ₹30-40 per square metre which was later hiked to 120 per square metre but the value of the land in the vicinity has gone up and is now being sold in the thousands. Why should we face this injustice,” Bagkar said.The Goa government, which only recently had to relent in the face of ferocious opposition from farmers unwilling to part with their lands for an IIT in another similarly rural area in the state, has had talks with the farmers which have remained inconclusive.“I have already met them twice and listened to their demands. I have told them that the government is committed to go out of the way to ensure compensation for their land,” Sawant told reporters late on Friday.Till date, the farmers have yet to relent vowing to fight till their last breath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goas-contentious-second-airport-sees-fresh-protests-here-s-why-101614089453147.html

The BJP, however, termed the action as “selective” and part of “political vendetta”. BJP city unit chief Jagdish Mulik said that while on one hand the NCP and Congress leaders have been attending events where Covid norms are openly flouted, the action against Mahadik has been unfair. “The Congress has in the last few days held multiple events and rallies as part of its show of strength. However, no action has been taken against the party leaders. The NCP minister Jayant Patil, too, was seen attending a wedding in Nashik, while another leader celebrated his birthday in a helicopter, after which, he too tested positive for Covid,” said Mulik. Jayant Patil was recently on state tour when he came in contact with large number of people. He also held meetings in Vidarbha, currently, a Covid hotspot. “The promptness of Maharashtra’s home minister in filing a case against Dhananjay Mahadik should have been shown against some of the criminals in Pune to control crime here,” said Mulik.According to the officials, a wedding reception for Mahadik’s son was held at the Laxmi Lawns in Magarpatta, Hadapsar, on Sunday evening, where at least 1,000 people attended the ceremony. This is a violation of the order which has capped the number of people allowed to attend weddings at 200. Balkrushna Kadam, the senior police inspector, Hadapsar police station, said, “We have registered a case against Mahadik and two others including the owner and manager of the lawn under section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-alleges-fir-against-mahadik-for-violating-covid-norms-is-political-vendetta-101614089018520.html

The deceased was identified as Deepali Mahesh Bidkar (23) of Shilim village of Lonavla, according to a statement issued by Andhashradha Nirmoolan Samiti (ANiS) - an organisation started by slain rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar. A complaint was lodged by Deepali’s brother Santosh Ashok Magar. “The pregnant woman was taken to a godman in the village by her husband and his parents. The baby and the 23-year-old mother, both died because of it,” said Milind Deshmukh, Pune head of ANiS. “The accused include the deceased’s husband Mahesh Bidkar, and his relatives — Raghunath, Jijabai, Mohan and Bakula Bidkar,” said senior inspector Sandip Ghorpade of Lonavla rural police station. The accused were booked under the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013. The members of ANiS claim that the complaint lodged at the police station on February 17 went without acknowledgement for some days. Navneet Kunwat, sub-divisional police officer of Lonavla division, said, “The death happened on February 10, and the victim’s family lodged a complaint on February 17. In their initial complaint, there was no mention of superstition, but domestic violence in which case the Supreme Court allows us time to investigate. Their next complaint was received by the station’s police inspector on February 21. On the morning of February 22, they (the deceased’s family) came to me and by the night of the same day, a case was registered. Our priority is to catch the godman and then make further arrests based on the findings of the investigation.” Meanwhile, a case under Sections 498(a), 304(a) of Indian Penal Code along with Anti Black Magic Act was registered at Lonavla rural police station. Police sub inspector Lavate is investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/five-booked-yet-to-be-arrested-under-black-magic-act-after-8-month-pregnant-woman-and-her-baby-die-in-pune-101614088538566.html

As a result, the NCP managed to elect Digvijay Suryawanshi as mayor, while the Congress’ candidate, Umesh Patil, has been elected deputy mayor of the Sangli Miraj Kupwad municipal corporation.The corporation is currently ruled by the BJP with a clear majority. Of the 78-member civic body, the BJP has a total of 43 councillors, while the NCP-Congress strength is 34. According to NCP leaders, five of BJP corporators defied the party line and voted in favour of the NCP-Congress candidates, while two remained absent. After winning the mayoral polls, Digvijay Suryawanshi said, “This success belongs to all the senior leaders of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) including Vishwajit Patil and Jayant Patil. What happened - some of the BJP members voting in our favour – is the result of the dictatorship that the party is exercising while running the civic body. Even though we had a strength of 34 corporators, we managed to elect our mayor and deputy mayor.” According to NCP district president Dinesh Jagtap, the BJP’s Dhiraj Suryawanshi only got 36 votes, despite the party having strength of 43 in the house. “This had to happen as many were unhappy with the local leadership here,” said Bajaj. The development is seen as jolt to BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, who was monitoring the elections. NCP state president and cabinet minister, Jayant Patil, who personally was looking into the election strategy, congratulated Suryawanshi and Patil on their win. The BJP alleged that NCP and Congress misused their power to garner support from some BJP councillors. “We will inquire into what went wrong. However, is it very clear that the Congress and NCP is misusing its power in the state which may have led to our defeat in Sangli,” said BJP leader Ashish Shelar. This is the second consecutive setback for Chandrakant Patil after the BJP candidate suffered a massive defeat in the recent graduate constituency polls in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sangli-mayoral-polls-a-jolt-for-bjp-ncp-cong-win-mayor-dy-mayor-s-seats-101614088478488.html

At present, the jail department follows the Prisons Act, 1894, and rules like Rajasthan Prisons Rules, 1954, drawn from the act.The state has prepared a new bill, the Rajasthan Prisons Bill, 2021, taking inspiration from the model jail manual, which was shared by the Union home ministry in 2016.“The draft of the bill has been sent to the law department for examination and the bill is expected to be passed in the ongoing budget session,” the official said.“The purpose of the bill is to focus on correctional measures for the inmates. Earlier, prisons were considered places for punishment. The new bill aims to make prisons more humane and change the mindset of the inmates so that they can go back and lead a new life in society again.”Also read: Terrorism one of the gravest threats to humankind - JaishankarThe major focus of the bill is to connect the inmates with employment. “If this bill is passed, then the focus is to link the inmates with different industrial set-ups. For this, the inmates would be connected with skill development programmes,” another official from the prisons department said on the condition of anonymity.In this bill, a provision has been made to make inmates aware of their rights. A special focus is on strengthening the security of jails through technology and a central command centre at the district level, the official said.Software systems, including a personal information system for recording information relating to inmates, will be incorporated by the department. Prison authorities will maintain electronic registers. CCTV cameras will be installed in work sheds, kitchens, high-security enclosures and main gates of prisons to prevent human rights violations, he said.“In this bill, procedures have been made for a proper system for the visitors, canteen facilities, laundry, hygiene, quantification of leave, distribution of works, parole, children staying with mothers and the segregation of different criminals,” the official said.The bill specifically describes the role of every official. In the present act, the inspector general of prisons is the supreme authority but under the new bill, roles and powers of the additional director general and the director general are mentioned, he said.“A special focus has been also laid on safety and reformation of women prisoners. Special programmes will be initiated specifically to empower women inmates with skills so that they can become self-reliant after release. The health of women prisoners has also been recognised as a focus area.”In the first week of February, the state government had overhauled the “archaic rules” for allotment of work to jail inmates based on their caste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-to-have-own-law-to-upgrade-prisons-impart-skills-to-inmates-101614087177370.html

The Lokhitwadi Mandal of Nashik is the organising body of the annual meet and renowned astrophysicist Dr Jayant Narlikar will preside over the literary meet.As the Covid cases are increasing in the state, uncertainty has now shadowed this literary meet which usually is attended by thousands of language aficinados. Though preparations for the sammelan have not halted, organisers and the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal are closely watching the situation and contemplating “other means” to conduct the literary meet.“The cases have been spiking again, which is not a good sign. In the sahitya sammelan we have many attendees from all over the country. Many noted literary figures are over 60-years of age. If this situation continues, then either the literary meet will have to be postponed or it will have to be conducted online. “If the sammelan is online then where will publishers put up their stalls?” said Milind Joshi, chief secretary, Maharashtra Sahitya Parishad, Pune.“Let’s not rush to any conclusion as of now. We are monitoring the situation and keeping track of the number of cases. The chief minister has also said that we should wait for a week. Preparations for the sahitya sammelan have not stopped. After eight-10 days we will have a meeting with the Sahitya Mahamandal and the next course of the action will be decided,” said Jayprakash Jategaonkar, president, Lokhitwadi Mandal.The three-day Marathi Sahitya Sammelan is attended by many noted literary figures, publishers, and book lovers. Speakers come all over from the state. In his address to citizens on Sunday, chief minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray, urged people to follow the Covid-prevention norms and avoid crowding. He also warned that if Covid norms are not followed and cases do not come down in a week, then the administration will have to take stern steps.“We cannot make any decision at this moment. We are aware of the situation and closely monitoring it. Let’s wait for a few days and then come to a conclusion,” said Kautikrao Thale-Patil, president, Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal.On Feb 22, Nashik rural reported 54 fresh Covid-19 cases, while 127 cases were reported from Nashik city, according to the state health department. “We are keeping a close eye on the numbers.

A complaint in the matter was lodged by the 29-year-old wife of the injured man. The couple was identified as Pramod Kisan Ghare (35), who works as an accountant in a private company, and Komal Ghare (29), a housewife. The couple reside in a gated residential society in the Bhumkar chowk area in Nerhegaon, Pune. “There are no suspects yet as the CCTV in the parking was facing in the other direction. The security guard was asleep when the men entered from the backside of the building. The victim sustained serious injuries but is stable and is undergoing treatment at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital,” said police sub-inspector Kuldeep Sankpal of Sinhagad road police station who is investigating the case.The car in question was a Swift Dzire. However, the police believe that the men may have been trying to steal something from inside the car and not the car itself as it was surrounded by vehicles on all sides and there was no way of driving the car out without being noticed, according to PSI Sankpal. “The one who was trying to open the car fought with the victim, and the three others who were keeping a watch came and stabbed him,” said PSI Sankpal. The couple were sleeping in their room when they heard noises from the parking inside their society compound at 3:45 am on Monday Upon peeping from their balcony, the woman found a man trying to fiddle with their car, according to her complaint. She informed her husband who went down to check on the situation and found that the miscreants were trying to force the car lock open. The man tried to catch hold of the man who was trying to force the car lock open. However, the three others who were accompanying him started beating the complainant’s husband while verbally abusing him. The complainant also claims to have intervened. However, one of them stabbed her husband in the stomach with a knife and grievously injured him. A case under Sections 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 4(25) of the Arms Act was registered at Sinhagad road police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-stabbed-while-trying-to-stop-thieves-from-unlocking-car-in-a-residential-society-101614080858248.html

The warning is based on the analysis of the three-year data from two observatories with aerosol monitors set up near Gangotri glacier in Uttarakhand in 2016 at a height of about 3,800 metres. The scientists said that aerosols were the second major factor after greenhouse gases in the faster melting of the glaciers.The aerosol is a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets and is produced mostly by the burning of fossil fuels. Black materials absorb more light and emit infra-red radiation that increases the temperature. An increase in black carbon in the high Himalayas will contribute to the faster melting of glaciers.India and China are the largest emitters of black carbon with emissions of up to 25-35%. These figures are expected to increase in the coming decades, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Atmospheric Research.Also Read | Expert team widens mouth of Rishiganga lake by 15ft to prevent repeat tragedyWIHG scientist PS Negi, who led the study, said before they set up the observatories, there were none in the Himalayas. “...[There were] 22 [observatories] in the plains to check black carbon aerosols. Our move not only proved the presence of the invisible particles in the Himalayas but their amount in a particular area also.”Negi said they found black carbon in the Himalayas varied from 0.01 microgram per cubic metre to 4.62 micrograms per cubic metre. He added their analysis also suggested that the black carbons are coming even from Europe and other Asian countries apart from the plains of India.“The climatic phenomena of Western Disturbance, which comes from Europe to the northern Indian states to cause rainfall and snow during winters also carries black carbon aerosols from there. When the Western Disturbance reaches higher reaches of Himalayas, the black carbon aerosols get deposited there causing significant damage to the glaciers by artificially increasing the temperature,” said Negi. He added a large amount of the invisible particle is coming from neighbouring countries such as China.Negi said the black carbon aerosols were also affecting the Himalayan ecosystem and causing the snowline in the upper reaches to move upwards. “This is...adversely affecting the whole ecosystem there... changing the growth of native plants and other vegetation which is worrisome.”Negi warned if this persists, then it could also lead to a major disaster as higher temperature caused by the black carbon could loosen the hold of glaciers on mountains. “That would then lead them to break in large chunks or cause a devastating avalanche or landslide like the one in recent disaster in Chamoli.”A glacier breach on February 7 in Chamoli triggered flash floods, hit two hydropower projects and left 69 people dead. As many as 135 people remain missing in the aftermath of the disaster.Negi said environment-friendly lifestyle changes needed to be adopted to reduce black carbon. He added this means people have to use lesser fossil fuels, commercial fuelwood, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/black-carbon-aerosols-on-himalayan-glaciers-could-speed-up-melting-scientists-101614080258146.html

23-02-2021||Mumbai||Karate association secy held in Mumbai for forgery to avail govt privileges||Mumbai police have arrested the secretary of the Karate Association of India (KAI), Bharat Sharma, from Delhi in connection with a cheating and forgery case registered in 2019 for an elaborate fraud he is suspected to have committed.Sharma and other office bearers of KAI allegedly forged documents and fraudulently represented themselves as representatives of the All India Karate-Do Federation (AIKF) to the World Karate Federation (WKF). They then got the AIKF’s name changed to KAI and got it fraudulently recognised by the WKF, the police said.Sharma and his colleagues made false representations to the ministry of youth affairs and sports and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), enjoyed many privileges and received government funds, the police complaint states. HT reached out to Kiren Rijuju, the sports minister, who said he was aware of the case, but did not offer any comment.Ananda Hodage, senior inspector of MRA Marg police station in Mumbai, confirmed Sharma’s arrest.“Sharma, who was arrested on February 13 from Delhi, has been charged with sections 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) 471 (using as genuine a forged document) 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code. Presently he is in police custody. He would be produced in court on Tuesday,” said assistant police inspector Himmat Jadhav, who is investigating officer of the case. “The accused with their fraudulent acts cheated AIKF and the government of India and enjoyed many government privileges and received government funds,” he said.Mumbai police are likely to elaborate on how much money was siphoned off in the fraud in their second remand application on Tuesday to seek further custody of Sharma. “The unauthorised association, which does not even have any legal existence in National Sports Federation, siphoned huge amounts of government grants and moneys from young aspirants of karate by misrepresenting before the Indian Olympic Association and internationally before World Karate Federation,” alleged advocate Sandeep Sherkhane, who is representing the complainant in the case.“AIKDF is the only legally recognised and genuine Association for Karate in India. As a result of this fraud recently no representation was given to Karate from India in the international tournament of Olympics,” said Priyanka Chhabria, also an advocate for AIKDF.Sharma has been arrested on a complaint filed by Nandji Prasad, secretary of the AIKF. Prasad stated in the FIR, a copy of which is with HT, that AIKF is a recognised trust that encourages young talent in karate and also trains and grooms potential karatekas for the Asian Games and other International Olympic Committee-recognised tournaments. Karate was made a part of the Olympics for the first time in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, deferred until this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, with eight gold medals on offer.“KAI is an illegal body and they also got recognition from the government showing the World Karate Federation etter in 2014,” alleges Nandji Prasad, the general secretary of AIKF.The sports ministry declined to comment on the issue.The FIR filed by Prasad also names Thiyagarajan and another KAI office bearer, Virat Vaccha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/karate-association-secy-held-in-mumbai-for-forgery-to-avail-govt-privileges-101614080018082.html
23-02-2021||Bangalore||Everything you wanted to know about Darling Krishna and Milana’s wedding||Sandalwood stars Darling Krishna and Milana Nagraj are on a dreamy honeymoon in Maldives, but we still can’t get over their grand wedding in Bengaluru on Valentine’s Day. We decided to snoop around a little and found that it took months of planning to make this into a dream wedding. Their wedding planner Lakshmi Keerthu tells us how it all happened. “So, we knew we had about six to seven events and it was going to take a long time to plan it. It took us six months or so to just finalise and put together everything, because right from Milana’s wedding ensembles to the last few details like the decor elements, I had to take care of everything with a lot attention to detail! The couple’s mandap, set in a pool, made a lot of noise and Lakshmi says that it was Krishna’s idea. “So Milana is a swimmer and Krishna wanted that to be representative of what she does and is best at. They were so sure of wanting the mandap in the middle of a pool... that it was something I had to ensure.”It was also the most challenging part about the event, she says, “The hardest thing was definitely balancing the mandap and ensuring it is safe, and could take the weight of people coming in and out. The other challenging thing was making sure everything and everyone was in pastels and colour coordinated. We had to give guests the whole memo about pastel dress codes and other finer details that took a lot of work. On their sangeet, we also had a large canopy driveway full of fairy lights and we made sure that it looked like a star studded evening, which was a large set up to do and I haven’t really seen this concept anywhere else.The colour scheme of the wedding, she reveals, was the bride’s choice. “Milana was pretty clear about the colours she wanted and how she was not really a fan of bright hues. She wanted it to be all pastels and that’s what we followed. Executing an Indian wedding with just pastel colours and ensuring we don’t repeat the set of colours wasn’t easy and took a lot of design sense to sort of get to doing,” she concludes.

This year’s budget is the third budget presented by the Gehlot government in the state. After Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan is the second state in the country to table a paperless budget. Gehlot, who is also the state finance minister, will read out the budget from a tablet at 11am. The government this time will be providing a soft copy of the budget to MLAs on a tablet, instead of a hard copy. Also Read | World is looking up to India’s health sector, especially after Covid-19: PM ModiExperts believe that this will probably prove to be the Gehlot government’s most challenging budget as they did not get ₹25,000 crore in revenue from taxes because of the pandemic. The government has already taken a loan of ₹40,000 crore, which is ₹14,000 crore higher than the last financial year. However, a senior official of the finance department, requesting anonymity, claimed that the state revenue had done better in comparison to last year (2019-20). The idea, the official said, is to go paperless – the questions asked by members and the replies consume thousands of sheets of paper. He said besides, the agriculture and health sectors, the budget will focus on governance and use of information and technology. “The pandemic has taught us importance of technology and ways to save unnecessary expenditure and time, such as by holding department meetings online,” he said. Sources in the government believe that the government could announce new jobs, increase in honorarium to Anganwadi workers; and resuming rural bus services etc. Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said, “We expect that the budget will be inclusive and fulfil the aspirations of the state. The budget will be growth-oriented.” Senior BJP MLA Narpat Singh Rajvi said, “We don’t expect anything from budget, especially looking at the zero implementation of the last two.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-to-present-first-paperless-budget-tomorrow-101614079119297.html

First, the recruitment of village secretary, then PGT Sanskrit and now TGT English have been cancelled. Educated youth are suffering due to the irregularities and frequent paper leaks,” he said.He said that the BJP-JJP coalition government is working on a policy of increasing unemployment, inflation and corruption. “The government should cut down on scams if it wants to bring in more revenue instead of imposing taxes that add to inflation,” he said.Raising questions on the new sports policy, the leader of Opposition said that the state government has completely destroyed the “get medals, get employment” policy of Congress.“Under the new policy, medal-winning players will now be able to get appointments from junior coaches to deputy directors. The new policy discriminates against para-Olympic players. Appointment of para-Olympians has been restricted to Group-B posts. This is a violation of their constitutional rights,” he said.He added that 40-50 people had died after drinking poisonous liquor in November last and a big liquor scam was exposed in state. “The SIT has submitted its investigation report, but the government is not ready to make it public. Similarly, the report of registry scam has also been kept under wraps. The government should make these inquiry reports public,” he demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-should-resume-dialogue-with-protesting-farmers-hooda-101614078398020.html

23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Wanted Punjab gangster mocks police, calls for intensifying farmers’ stir||Cocking a snook at the police, wanted gangster Lakha Sidhana, who is accused of instigating the violence during the farmers’ tractor rally at Red Fort on Republic Day, surfaced with bodyguards in tow to address a rally organised by Sikh hardliners at Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s ancestral Mehraj village in Bathinda district on Tuesday afternoon. “The farmers’ agitation will be intensified to ensure the three farm laws are withdrawn. There is no question of agreeing to any amendments or suspension of the laws for 18 months,” Sidhana said at the well-attended rally, where Sikh flags outnumbered those of the farm unions. Besides Sidhana, radical Sikhs have proactively rallied behind actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, who was arrested for the January 26 violence conspiracy. Sidhana warned leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha against making any concession and regretted that Dalits have negligible participation in the agitation. Turning to the cases of rioting against protesters, he said: “Capt Amarinder Singh will have to explain to the public if Punjab Police help Delhi Police in arresting anyone booked for the (January 26) violence.” In a brazen attack on the police, he even exhorted his supporters to “hold Delhi Police hostage if they come”. He was escorted out of the venue by a large number of supporters to thwart any attempt of his arrest. Took to Facebook to announce rally Last Friday, Sidhana shared a 13-minute video on Facebook announcing today’s rally in support of the agitating farmers at the grain market in Mehraj, 35 km from the Bathinda district headquarters. A native of Sidhana village in Bathinda district, Lakha is on the run since January 26 and had hinted that he would join the rally on his home turf. Delhi Police had on February 14 announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for information on his whereabouts. Teams of Delhi Police, along with the special cell, had conducted searches for the gangster across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR. Sidhana was earlier seen in Punjab when he had visited Moga on January 20 to garner support for the tractor rally on Republic Day. Charged with murder, dabbled in politics Mehraj is a part of the Rampura Phul assembly segment from where Sidhana had unsuccessfully contested as a candidate of the People’s Party of Punjab (PPP) in 2012. The PPP was floated by state finance minister and Bathinda MLA Manpreet Singh Badal and later merged in the Congress. Sidhana is booked for murder, attempt to murder, loot and violation of the Arms Act. He was jailed several times between 2004 and 2017. During this duration, he also came in contact with politicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wanted-punjab-gangster-mocks-police-calls-for-intensifying-farmers-stir-101614076957889.html

The world's largest Covid-19 case centre admitted patients referred by 11 hospitals in Delhi, including AIIMS, Safdarjung, Medanta and Max Hospital.In November, the ITBP had announced increasing the capacity of Covid-19 beds from 2,000 to 3,000. These new beds were equipped with a proper supply of medical oxygen. The centre also has 75 dedicated ambulances.The number of patients being treated at the centre during the peak of the infection was 2,000. But by December, as the number of Covid-19 patients declined in the national capital, the number of patients declined at the Sardar Patel centre too; in the same month, the number of patients at the centre dipped to 59.The Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre is 1,700 feet long, 700 feet wide - roughly the size of 20 football fields - and has 200 enclosures with 50 beds each.The Delhi government had provided administrative support, but the ITBP was operating the centre. Volunteers from the religious sect of Radha Soami Beas are also helping in its day-to-day functioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/itbp-to-close-its-covid-care-centre-world-s-largest-within-a-week-101614075477937.html
23-02-2021||Ranchi||10th century Buddha Vihar discovered in Jharkhand’s Hazaribag||A 10th century structure resembling a small ‘Buddha Vihar’ (Buddhist shrine-cum-monastery) has been discovered during an excavation, being carried out by Archeological Survey of India (ASI), in foothills of Juljul hill at Sadar block of Hazaribagh district, around 110-km from capital Ranchi, ASI officials said on Tuesday.The ASI identified three mounds in the foothills having links to Buddhism last year. The excavation of the first mound last year led to the discovery of a complete shrine with a central and two subsidiary shrines, just two metres below the surface. However, the excavation work was suspended after two months due to Covid-19 pandemic triggered lockdowns and some other reasons.In the second round of excavation, beginning the last week of January this year, the second mound, around 40-meters away from the first mound or central shrine, was excavated and a small Buddha Vihar like structure was discovered.“We started excavation in the second mound of the area in January last week, where a huge structural mound, similar to a small Buddha Vihar, was found with three cells (rooms). In the west corner of the structure, we found five sculptures of Gautam Buddha in seated position and one sculpture of Tara, which indicates that it might also be a centre of Vajrayana,” said Dr Neeraj Mishra, assistant archaeologist at ASI.Spread over a 50-metre long and 50-metre wide area, three cells and hoards of artefacts including statues of Gautam Budha and Tara, the female Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism who appears as a female Buddha in Vajrayana Buddhism, were discovered.“As per the evidence found here, it appeared that the structures had been built during the Pala period. During the excavation, we found an inscription on a stone slab. The paleographic dating of the inscription suggests that it was of 10th century AD, meaning the Pala period,” said Dr Mishra.It might have been a big religious centre then, as it is located on the side of the old Grand Trunk road, connecting Sarnath in Uttar Pradesh to Bihar, home to historic Bodh Gaya where Buddha attained salvation, he added.He recalled that a shrine and two subsidiary shrines, spread over 30 metres long and 50 metres wide area, were discovered last year. “It was a single storey temple. An entry gate and stairs were also found there.”Historians and archaeologists find the discovery of great importance, which will help understand the history and influence of the dynasty in Jharkhand.Also Read: Jharkhand petroleum dealers body demands reduction of VAT on dieselHistorian Dr DN Ojha, dean, social sciences department at Ranchi University, said ancient history talks about the arrival of Buddhist monks in this area and the extension of Buddhism’s reach here."However, there was also a debate on this. The recent discovery in Hazaribag would work as a big evidence to support the theory of extension of Buddhism and arrival of monks here," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/10th-century-buddha-vihar-discovered-in-jharkhand-s-hazaribag-101614072362306.html

23-02-2021||Mumbai||Follow Covid-19 protocols: Punjab, Maharashtra urge amid rising cases||Authorities in Maharashtra and Punjab have stepped up their efforts in the last two days to address the issue of rising Covid-19 cases in the states. Officials have said that carelessness among the people in the state could be one of the reasons for the rise in the number of cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). They have also warned citizens that failing to adhere to rules could hurt the process of further reopening as well as efforts put in by healthcare workers over the past year to bring the pandemic under control.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Tuesday urged people to adhere to Covid-19 preventive measures as surging Covid-19 cases put the government in Maharashtra in a tight spot. Pednekar distributed protective masks to people at a vegetable market in Dadar while instructing people to adhere to social distancing rules. Pednekar also pointed out that people tend to fear the police officials more than marshals appointed by the civic authorities. “Mumbai Police have joined hands with us. People are more scared of the police than marshals. I request all to wear masks, sanitise and maintain social distancing,” Pednekar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The government in Maharashtra, which has been recording more than 2,500 Covid-19 cases on average since the past few weeks, has over the past two weeks asked citizens to take precautions in order to prevent contracting coronavirus disease. It has already warned its citizens of a lockdown if rules are not followed and cases are on the rise.The state recorded 5,210 Covid-19 cases on Monday while Mumbai recorded 1,364 cases and there were four reports of death from the city. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had earlier said that Mumbai has witnessed a 36.38% rise in Covid-19 cases in the city since February 8, according to a report by news agency PTI.Civic officials outlined the carelessness of citizens and the running of local trains as a reason for the rise in cases and also said that the reopening of malls and shopping complexes leading to a rise in commercial activities have also led to a surge in the number of cases.The Punjab government also asked people to follow social distancing rules and adhere to Covid-19 preventative measures in order to save themselves from getting infected. It has said that people need to shed their careless attitude regarding the pandemic and follow rules strictly. “People are not following Covid-19 safety precautions like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing which is the main reason behind the surge in cases in the state,” Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Rajesh Bhaskar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI on Monday.The northern state recorded close to 400 cases of the coronavirus disease on Monday even as the death toll inched closer to 5,800 with 15 fresh fatalities.The Centre has urged Punjab and Maharashtra to step up efforts to arrest the rise in Covid-19 cases. It has asked these states, along with Chattisgarh, Kerala, Karnataka and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, to increase the pace of vaccination, identify clusters and increase RT-PCR testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/follow-covid-19-protocols-punjab-maharashtra-urge-amid-rising-cases-101614065409184.html

Moments after the chief minister left, the CBI team arrived to question Abhishek’s wife in connection with an alleged coal smuggling case.Banerjee, the two-term chief minister of the eastern state who faces re-election this year, stayed at her nephew’s residence for around 10 minutes. News agency ANI shared a video of the TMC chief arriving at the young Lok Sabha MP’s house in the city and leaving after spending some time there.#WATCH | Kolkata: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee arrives at nephew and TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee's residenceAbhishek's wife, Rujira, is expected to answer CBI's queries today in connection with the coal scam case pic.twitter.com/srmLo7awiWOn Sunday, the CBI had served notices to Abhishek’s wife, Rujira, and sister-in-law Menaka Gambhir, in connection with the alleged case. While Gambhir was questioned by the probe agency on Monday, Rujira requested the CBI to visit her residence anytime from 11am-3pm on Tuesday. Confirming that the notice was indeed issued, Abhishek had tweeted that while they have full faith in the law of the land, they’re not the ones who could be cowed down. “If they think they can use these ploys to intimidate us, they’re mistaken. We’re not the ones who would ever be cowed down,” he had tweeted.At 2pm today, the CBI served a notice in the name of my wife. We have full faith in the law of the land.

We are not the ones who would ever be cowed down. pic.twitter.com/U0YB6SC5b8Heading into the assembly elections, which are likely to take place in April-May, the state’s opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has turned the spotlight on Abhishek, who is considered by many as the heir apparent to Banerjee. Responding to allegations of nepotism and dynasty politics, Abhishek last month pointed out how several senior leaders of the BJP, including West Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya, defence minister Rajnath Singh and former TMC leader Mukul Roy have sons who themselves are lawmakers in the party.On the CBI notices, TMC has already said it would fight these legally, adding that the BJP is left with no allies except investigating agencies like the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/coal-smuggling-case-mamata-banerjee-visits-nephew-abhishek-s-residence-101614065711072.html

23-02-2021||Bangalore||Marshals at Karnataka wedding halls to ensure Covid-19 rules followed||The Karnataka government on Monday said it will deploy marshals at wedding halls and other public events to ensure that guidelines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are adhered to.“People attending large gatherings are not following the guidelines. In fact, people urged me to remove (my) mask when I attended a function. Therefore, it is necessary to deploy a marshal to ensure the Covid guidelines are followed,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health and family welfare and medical education, said on Monday.According to the latest central guidelines, social, religious, cultural, sports, entertainment and educational gatherings will be subject to standard operating procedures (SOPs) by states and Union Territories (UTs). The central guidelines say such gatherings are permitted, but with a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity and a ceiling of 500 people in closed spaces.Sudhakar said Karnataka did not want a situation like that in Maharashtra, where cases are on the rise and fresh curbs have been introduced in a few pockets to curb the spread of infections.On Sunday, Karnataka recorded 490 daily infections, as compared with the 6,971 in Maharashtra.Altogether 3,293 cases have been recorded across Karnataka over the last seven days till Sunday, government data showed. According to Covid19india.org, the number of new infections in Karnataka has grown by an average of 0% every day in the last one week. For Maharashtra, the growth rate is 0.3%.Karnataka has already put in place strict guidelines, including mandatory Covid-19 negative certificates for people entering from neighbouring Kerala and Maharashtra.Truck, bus and cab drivers protested in Talapady check post that connects Kerala with Dakshina Kannada district, about 350km from Bengaluru, after authorities restricted entry without Covid-19 negative certificates.Bengaluru has recorded nearly 2,000 cases in the last one week (till Sunday). While Tumakuru recorded 120 cases in this period, the number was 145 for Dakshina Kannada. It was 150 for Mysuru and 114 for Kalaburagi, according to government data.In Bengaluru, the number of cases reported on February 12 was 194, as against 248 on Sunday. “The six contiguous blocks with 10 cases have been declared as a Containment Zone by HO (health officer),” N Manjunath Prasad, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) commissioner said in a statement on Monday, referring to the apartment blocks.Two other containment zones with over 100 cases were identified in the city last week.Meanwhile, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said the issue of closure of many border roads from Kerala to Karnataka will be brought to the notice of the central government.“Karnataka government has taken the decision that only those who show a negative RT-PCR test certificate will be allowed to enter Karnataka. The state police chief has brought the matter to the notice of the Karnataka DGP. The Karnataka DGP assured that vehicles carrying essential items could be exempted from this requirement,” Vijayan said at a Covid-19 press briefing.Vijayan added that Kerala would continue to take up the issue with the Karnataka government to resolve it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/marshals-at-karnataka-wedding-halls-to-ensure-covid-19-rules-followed-101614061902165.html
23-02-2021||Bangalore||Basanagouda Patil Yatnal acting as B Team of Congress, say 2 Karnataka ministers||Two senior ministers of the Karnataka government on Monday hit out at the backers of an ongoing campaign by the Panchamasalis, a sub-sect of the Lingayat community, for 2A category reservation status that would entitle them to 15% reservation in government jobs and college seats, saying they wanted to advance their own political ambitions.The main target of CC Patil and Murugesh Nirani was Basanagouda Ramanagouda Patil Yatnal, who is a legislator of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Vijayanand Kashappanavar, a former Congress legislator.“The campaign has been used for selfish reasons by some people and this is something that we do not agree with such statements or attacks. The rally was held for inclusion into 2A {category reservation status} and these people are misusing it for their own selfish reasons,” Patil, a senior minister in the BS Yediyurappa-led government, said.“Some people have kept the seer (Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swamy) under their grip and misusing the forum,” he added.The ministers, who both belong to the sub-sect of the Lingayat community, lashed out at the way the agitation was being taken forward.Nirani said Yatnal was behaving like a member of the B Team of the Congress.The statements come a day after Patil had stormed off the stage after Yatnal had remarked that both ministers should threaten the chief minister that they would resign and get him to cede the Panchamasali community’s demands.Increasing calls for reservations by several dominant and politically influential communities has made life harder for the 77-year-old chief minister who will turn a year older later this week.Already trying to manage simmering dissent within his government and party, the chief minister is facing attacks from the opposition over the poor state of finances, reduction of revenue inflows from the Centre and the Cauvery river water row.The ministers said that Yatnal and Kashappanavar had ‘hijacked’ the agitation by the Panchamasali seers.Nirani even said that Kudalasangama math pontiff Basava Jayamruthyunjaya Swamy was being misguided by Yatnal and Kashappanavar.“What was the need for the seer to announce Kashappanavar as president of Akhila Bharata Lingayat Panchamasali Mahasabha when such a decision was not taken by the rightful body of the community. The seer has no right to take such a decision,” Nirani said.In Karnataka’s caste-influenced politics, it is very rare to see political leaders criticise influential pontiffs in public.The seer, who has continued his agitation in Bengaluru, has demanded that they be given a timeline by when the community can expect an announcement conceding its demand for 2A category reservation status.“The main reason for the delay is that the chief minister did not take us seriously from the beginning,” Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami said.He said that the government should give an exact time frame of the process and the community leaders would take a call based on these assurances.Kashappanavar has also hit back, calling the minister’s two-faced and without the will to fight for the cause of the community.Yatnal could not be reached for comment.Meanwhile, Yediyurappa on Monday said the government would take strong measures to protect the state’s interests.“Karnataka will not allow a single drop of excess water from the Cauvery river to Tamil Nadu,” the chief minister said on Monday.The statements came a day after Tamil Nadu laid the foundation for the first phase of the ₹14,400 crore Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar river interlinking project, which aims to divert around 6,000 cubic feet water to drier areas in southern districts.The Karnataka government said it will hold a meeting with all parties to discuss the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/basanagouda-yatnal-acting-as-b-team-of-congress-say-2-karnataka-ministers-101614061427617.html
23-02-2021||Bangalore||Belagavi’s Marathis accuse BJP, Congress of ignoring region||The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), an umbrella organisation created to integrate Marathi speaking majority districts of Karnataka with Maharashtra, will neither support the Congress nor the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the upcoming Lok Sabha by-polls, accusing the two national parties of ignoring the issues of the region.“As a group, we will not be supporting anybody. All these national parties are of no use to us,” Deepak Dalvi, a senior MES leader told Hindustan Times.Formed in 1948, the group has been fighting for the inclusion of Marathi speaking areas, on the border shared by the two states, in Maharashtra.“They (national parties) just milk our cause for their (political) reasons. Once the bypolls are declared and we know the candidates, we will come up with a strategy whether it is to field our own candidate, go for NOTA or abstain from the entire election itself,” Prakash Margale, another MES leader said.The Marathi speaking people in the region have sought the inclusion of Belagavi, Karwar, Balki, Bidar and Nipani with Maharashtra, ever since the areas, then part of the Bombay State, were made parts of then Mysore State under the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, which divided the states along linguistic and administrative lines.According to the 2011 Census, over 50% of the district’s population are Marathi speakers. In Karnataka, 3.95% are Marathi speakers.In previous elections, the MES tried to mobilize the people to press NOTA, backed independents or boycotted the polls. In the 2019 elections, there were 48 independents who contested the Belagavi Lok Sabha elections. The 48 independents mustered only 60,605 votes out of the total 1205229 polled in the district. NOTA or none of the above accounted for 3243 votes or 0.27% of the total polls.In 2013, Sambaji Patil and Aravind Patil, both backed by the MES won the Belagavi North and Khanapur, about 26 km from Belagavi city.“One of the reasons for MES not participating in Lok Sabha elections is that by breaking constituencies (both parliamentary and assembly) in a very selective manner and using the policy of gerrymandering, Karnataka government has created constituencies that change the demographic components. That has adversely affected the prospects of the MES in the recent elections,” Deepak Pawar, Mumbai-based political analyst and faculty at the University of Mumbai said.The issue gained significance recently after Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray suggested that the “disputed” area be made into Union territory.Reacting to the MES decision to not support it in the upcoming by-election, Laxmi Hebbalkar, Congress MLA from Belagavi Rural, said, “The MES does not have any connection on the ground with the border issue and the people here are more interested in development and equality.”“They will state that they do not want to support any of us but no one listens to these leaders anymore,” Prabhakar Kore, a senior BJP leader and former Rajya Sabha member said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/belagavis-marathis-accuse-bjp-congress-of-ignoring-region-101614060480202.html

23-02-2021||Delhi||Trans-people welcome the decision for separate toilets, but need gender-neutral toilets||The Delhi government has mandated that all its departments, offices, district authorities, municipal corporations, state-run companies and the Delhi Police have separate and exclusive washrooms for transgender persons. The order further stated that trans-people shall continue to be allowed to use gender-based toilets as per their self-identified gender. The agencies have been given a maximum time of two years to build these exclusive toilets.For 38-year old trans-woman Simran Shaikh, using public restrooms pre as well as post transition was a nightmare. “It is a brilliant move; using washrooms which were not actually assigned to you, both before transition and after transition, was very difficult. It was stigmatising to use the men’s washroom before transitioning, and now to use the women’s washroom attracts questions. We are moving towards a progressive India and such initiatives create a beautiful impact. We feel included that we are counted within the system and that the system is thinking about you,” she says.There is, however, an opinion about gender-neutrality. Grace Banu, a 34-year old trans-woman, questions, “What about trans-men and queer people? We don’t need separate toilets; we need gender-neutral toilets. These schemes have little impact.”Read: A Rainbow of inclusivity: Trans community welcomes move by NMRC to rename metro stationThe need for gender-neutral toilets is felt strongly, but more so for creating change in the mindsets. Trans rights activist Abhina Aher says, “It is a welcome change. Providing facilities for transgenders for a basic necessity is very well appreciated, but I think more work needs to be done. The governments need to look into the prioritisation of trans-community needs. Think about the bigger change and other changes will happen. Some trans-people feel that with these separate toilets, you are further stigmatising them.” She adds that in areas where separate toilets cannot be made, then at least one toilet should be made gender-neutral.Stressing on fundamental rights, Shreegauri Sawant, who runs a shelter home for children of sex workers in Mumbai, says that though it will help create a safe space for trangenders, separate washrooms come with their perils. “It is a good move, but security is very important. How will you ensure that trans-men and trans-women are not using it for nefarious activities? Sirf toilet banaa dena solution nahi hai. Have a security guard and allow only one person at a time,” she says and adds that the area and location also matter. “Separate toilets in office and malls would be safe, but what about highways?” she questions.While the decision has drawn mixed reviews, people who have been working to bring about change believe that no decisions should be made without involving the people the decisions are being made for. Activist Harish Iyer is of the opinion that the needs of trans-men and trans-women should be evaluated. “I wish to know how many trans-women and trans-men were consulted before making this suggestion. Did they check with trans-people if they need all-gender restrooms, the freedom to use a restroom of their choice, or a separate restroom with a sign labelled transgender? The point I am making is no decision about them should be made without them,” he says, stressing upon the need for creating awareness around the community and their needs.

23-02-2021||Kolkata||BJP leader, named by Pamela Goswami in drugs case, summoned by Kolkata cops||Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rakesh Singh has been summoned by the detective department of Kolkata Police at 4pm on Tuesday in connection with the probe into the seizure of drugs from the party’s youth wing leader Pamela Goswami, a city police officer said.Pamela Goswami, state secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), was arrested from south Kolkata’s New Alipore area on Saturday along with a friend, Prabir Kumar De, and another person from south Kolkata’s New Alipore area. According to the police, 90 gm of cocaine was allegedly seized from her handbag and car.Soon after the police presented her before a city court, Goswami told reporters that she had been framed. “I want a CID investigation. BJP’s Rakesh Singh, the aide of Kailash Vijayvargiya, should be arrested. This is his conspiracy,” Goswami told reporters on Saturday.Singh, a BJP state committee member, has refuted the charge and accused the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Kolkata Police of having “brainwashed” Goswami.“If I am involved, they can call me or Kailash Vijayvargiya or Amit Shah. I think the police have brainwashed her. I am not in touch with Pamela for more than one-and-a-half-years now,” Singh told news agency Press Trust of India.The detective department, which has taken over the case initiated by the local police, said Rakesh Singh would be questioned later in the day.“Singh has been sent a notice under Section 160 of the CrPC to appear by 4 pm on Tuesday for questioning,” said a senior officer of the Kolkata Police.Section 160 of the criminal procedure code empowers the police to summon a witness who may be familiar with the facts and circumstances of a criminal case.Police had said that Goswami’s father Kaushik Goswami had sent a letter to the police commissioner and joint commissioner of police (crime) in April 2020 alleging that De, who was arrested with Pamela Goswami, had introduced her to drugs.In the letter, Pamela’s father stated that De first started a business with Pamela as a partner and later introduced her to drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-leader-named-by-pamela-goswami-in-drugs-case-summoned-by-kolkata-cops-at-4pm-101614057022590.html

The state had reported an all time high 17,616 viral infections during September 14-20 last year.Health officials said the limited increase in number of infections is not a cause of worry yet. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said the department has been testing over a lakh individuals every week and the positivity rate is 4.9%. “But we are conscious of the fact that there is always a possibility of a surge in infections. So, we are not taking things lightly,” he said.The number of total active infections (861) continued to stay to a three-digit figure for the third successive week. “The recovery rate stays at 98.6% and the mortality rate at 1.1%,” health officials said.The ACS said that sampling has been consistent at well over a lakh individual every week even when infection rate was on decline. The health department tested about one lakh persons last week and about 1.29 lakh persons the week before.Data shows that though four districts- Faridabad (8.7%), Gurugram (7.2%), Rewari (7.1%) and Panchkula (6.1%) - continued to have critical positivity rate of more than 6%, the rate continues to decline steadily. While three districts - Nuh (0.9%), Charkhi Dadri (1.2%) and Jhajjar (1.9%) - have a desirable positivity rate of less than 2%, the remaining 15 districts have a positivity rate in the range of 2.5% to 5.6%, according to the data.Vaccine wastage below 10%Health officials said that the average vaccine wastage in state was 8.3% as per latest figures. This is well below the programmatic wastage of 10% allowed by the Union ministry of health, they said.As per the vaccine coverage data up to February 20, the state has administered 2,28,180 doses against the actual dose consumption of 2,48,828. This also means that more than 91% of the doses have been successfully utilised for inoculation, officials said.“The wastage is more for Covaxin since each vial has 10ml vaccine (20 doses) while each Covishield vial has 5ml vaccine (10 doses),” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/slight-increase-in-covid-infections-in-haryana-for-second-week-101614056975179.html

23-02-2021||Patna||Bihar: Grants to govt aided schools to be released soon, says minister||Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary on Monday said assistance grant to the government aided secondary and higher secondary schools would not be denied in the name of formalities. The assistance grant is given by the government for payment of salary to teaching and non-teaching staff.“The officers, who would try to linger the process of award of the grant to deserving schools, would be taken to task,” said Chaudhary in response to a call attention motion moved by Congress MLC Madan Mohan Jha in the legislative council.Raising the issue, Jha stated that grants to about 1400-1500 government aided schools, including those upgraded to intermediate levels, had been held up since 2016 by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) on one pretext or the other. “The state government had allocated ₹630 crore on account of payment of arrears to various schools last year. However, in the absence of payment to the concerned schools, the government took back ₹500 crore from the BSEB to manage corona-induced crisis,” said Jha, also the state Congress president.Chaudhary said that assistance grant of ₹842 crore would be released to the BSEB for its disbursement among the schools, which fulfil the laid down criteria, within a month. “The department will also see that the BESB did not stop payment to the schools without strong valid reasons,” said the minister.Leaders cutting across the party lines lashed out at the BSEB claiming it put up stumbling blocks unnecessarily in payment of grants to the schools. Sanjeev Singh of the Janata Dal United (JD-U) alleged that the BESB declined the payments to the schools, even though the rules for award of grants have been considerably simplified in 2013.Nawal Kishore Yadav of the BJP and Kedarnath Pandey of the CPI claimed that the amount had been kept up by the BSEB despite the inquiries. Sanjeev Singh claimed that as per the government circular issued in 2013, no inspection is required for payment of grants to the schools, which were found eligible for recognition by the government.The minister assured that the arrear payments to schools will be cleared after approval by the state cabinet soon.Honorarium for Panchayat functionariesPanchayati raj department minister Samrat Chaudhary on Monday informed the legislative council that a sum of ₹577 crore was released to clear the arrears in honourarium to elected representatives of gram panchayats and gram kutcheries till the current fiscal of 2020-21. “The payment would be ensured to the elected representatives by the end of this month or before the expiry of their current tenure,” added the minister.Earlier, raising the issue, BPCC chief Madan Mohan Jha claimed that monthly honorariums to panchayat leaders had not been paid since March 2020. The panchayat elections are due to be held in May-June this year.The minister said that an estimated expense of ₹228.91 crore was likely to be incurred by the department on account of payment of honorarium to elected representatives of panchayats and gram kutcheries for the year 2019-20, while a sum of ₹227.48 crore would be spent to clear payments for the current fiscal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-grants-to-govt-aided-schools-to-be-released-soon-says-minister-101614049668063.html

23-02-2021||Delhi||Multiple strands, piles of evidence: Inside the Delhi riots probe||A year ago to the day, a clash between supporters and opponents of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, below the Jafrabad Metro station in north-east Delhi triggered one of the worst bouts of rioting in Delhi in recent years.The clash snowballed into full-fledged Hindu-Muslim rioting between February 23 and 27 in parts of north-east Delhi. Fifty-three people were killed , 581 injured.The following month, even as the country came to grips with the Covid-19 pandemic, Delhi Police started what would be one of the longest and most controversial investigations in recent years.The police have claimed that the riots had been planned by prominent protestors against the CAA, which seeks to fast-track citizenship for members of minorities like Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, the first time citizenship has been linked to faith in a professedly secular nation.However, much before the first stones were hurled by supporters and opponents of the new Citizenship law below the Jafrabad Metro station at 7. 30pm, on February 23, 2020, Delhi had already reported at least nine incidents of rioting during the anti-CAA protest.The police have alleged that the first two incidents of rioting outside Jamia Millia Islamia and around New Friends Colony was the “beta version” executed by the key conspirators before the February rioting two months later in north-east Delhi.Linking the violence in the December and the February rioting, the police wrote in one of the charge sheets: “..every character who gained notoriety in February 2020 had been noticed as being present in the incidents of December 2019.”Joining the dotsOf the 472 murders reported in 2020, at least 53 (11%) murders were victims of the Delhi riots. The police registered 755 cases, of which 697 were probed by the local police, 57 by the crime branch and one by the special cell. The local police investigated incidents of rioting and arson, the crime branch probed heinous cases (including all 53 murders) and the special cell is probing an alleged conspiracy behind the riots.The special cell has arrested 21 people, including student leaders such as Natasha Narwal, local politicians Tahir Hussain and Ishrat Jahan, university student Sharjeel Imam, and activists like Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi who the police say planned and orchestrated the riots. They have been arrested and charged under stringent sections of the sedition law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.Of the 1,825 people arrested, at least 40 have got bail till date. But these 40 do not include the 21 people mentioned above. The 40 are those who were arrested for isolated incidents of rioting.The police have alleged that on January 8, 2020, more than a month before the riots, Umar Khalid had met AAP councillor Tahir Hussain at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest site to plan the riots. According to Delhi Police, the alleged conspirators had planned that the protests would dovetail with then US President Donald Trump’s official visit to India to create an international embarrassment for India and defame the country.The suspects, denying the police’s claims, have said that as of January 8, news of the US President’s impending visit had not been published.Videos, WhatsApp chats, protected witnessesIn all these months, the police have filed at least 400 charge-sheets against the 1,818 arrested suspects. A charge sheet is a document submitted to the court that lists charges and evidence against suspects. A trial starts in a case only after a court takes cognizance of the charge sheet.An analysis of the charge-sheets shows that the police have relied on CCTV footages, WhatsApp chats and protected witnesses as evidence.The police have taken help of at least 15 people who were insiders at the anti-CAA protest sites before the riots and have claimed to have seen or heard the main conspirators plan the violence. Referred to only by pseudonyms such as Alpha, Beta, Silver, Gold, James and Bond, these witnesses are currently in protective custody and are the key to the police’s claims that the violence was a “planned conspiracy”.Apart from such witnesses, police also have the WhatsApp chats that the suspected main conspirators were part of during the riots. In its 7,500-page charge-sheet, the special cell attached at least 100 WhatsApp chats.ControversyMany civil society groups have also filed petitions urging courts to intervene alleging that the police did not act against certain people who were involved in triggering the riots. Several of those arrested also accused police of conducting a biased probe against anti-government voices.Social activist Harsh Mander has filed a petition against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra for making an inflammatory speech which allegedly led to the riots.Another person has filed a similar petition against Mander and other persons for delivering allegedly inflammatory speeches before the riots broke out. The courts are hearing the matter.Police spokesperson, deputy commissioner of police Chinmoy Biswal, said police arrested 869 Hindu rioters and 956 from Muslim community. “The numbers speak for themselves. Our investigation is absolutely fair and impartial, replying only on credible, material and scientific evidence. We are also working to solve the unsolved cases,” he said.Former Delhi police commissioner Neeraj Kumar believes investigations of the riots is one of the best conducted by the department till date. “Newer scientific technologies were adopted...unlike the past, when the accused were only those caught on the spot, Delhi police have unearthed the conspiracy and arrested the key accused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-multiple-strands-piles-of-evidence-inside-the-probe-101614041223515.html
23-02-2021||Delhi||Then and now: At 5 Delhi riots hot spots, the memory remains||A year after communal riots ravaged north-east Delhi, HT revisits five places which were hot spots of violence.JafrabadA little ahead of Jafrabad metro station — ground zero for the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in north-east Delhi; where the communal violence is believed to have sparked on the night of February 23, 2020 — sits Mohammad Yasir, a banana seller. The fruit cart is on a stretch where riot accused Shahrukh Pathan was seen pointing a pistol it at a policeman in a photo that became emblematic of the riots.Yasir says the Hindu residents of the area avoid buying from his stall since last year. “That forces me to push my cart to areas where there are more Muslims,” he said, wearing a white kurta-pyjama and donning a white skull cap.But some others in the area have managed to bridge the divide. Dharamvir Singh and Mohammad Imran, a milk booth owner and an ironmonger whose shops are located right next to each other, still spend their free hours talking to each other.They say their shops have been next to each other’s for the past 30 years, and no riot can split them apart. After the riots, when both returned to open their shops, there was some awkwardness, but they ensured that it did not come between them.Singh does his bit to make Imran feel comfortable. “If someone stands outside my booth and starts talking ill of Muslims, I immediately send them packing,” he said.Imran, who would earlier allow his friends to gather outside his shop and discuss local issues, in turn stops community gatherings outside in shop because he knows the discussions will veer towards the riots.The stretch that connects Jaffrabad metro station to Maujpur-Babarpur metro station witnessed heavy stone pelting, tear gas shells, and the looting or burning of shops. While the buildings and houses have been reconstructed and repainted, the concrete fence on the road divider was never reconstructed.It remains conspicuous by its absence — a grim reminder of what happened last year.Shiv Vihar parking lotsGajinder Parihar now runs a banquet hall in Shiv Vihar. Until last year, this 400 square yards area was a parking lot. It was set on fire by rioters during the communal clashes. There were 45 cars parked in the garage. They were all gutted.With the parking lot his only source of income, it took Parihar over 200 days to re-establish the area, but not as a parking space this time. “Businesses in this area may look normal after a year, but the uncertainty has left people scared. No one would have imagined that their houses or cars will be burnt — but it happened. Many of them who have rebuilt their houses have made sure to have a parking space. Some have left the area never to return,” he said.Parihar, 46, said he is still here only because this is his ancestral land. “It took me five months to clear the scrap of the burnt cars. They had to be cut, dismantled, and lifted out of the area using cranes. Many owners who were waiting for insurance money did not want their burnt cars removed. Once that was done, I had to make sure that the yard is repaired and painted to new, which took another two months. As the space is usually hired by local residents, I didn’t want them to be reminded of what they witnessed last year.”He lives in Sonia Vihar with his wife and two children. The parking facility that he owned was right at Shiv Vihar Tiraha (three-road junction) one of the epicentres of the communal violence last February.A densely populated area where free space is a premium, most residents parked their cars at two garages, one of which was run by Parihar. The other one, next to it, was also burnt to ashes, along with the 54 parked inside. Its owner, Prem Giri, has also turned the place into a banquet hall — it was inaugurated on Tuesday.Ashok Nagar mosqueAt around 1pm on February 25 last year, a mob stormed the Maula Baksh Masjid in Ashok Nagar, and torched it. A year later, the mosque — built over a 400 square yards in this neighbourhood with a low Muslim population — is being reconstructed from scratch.The local Hindu population, which is the majority here, has offered to support rebuilding the mosque — both financially and physically. Rebuilding the trust between the two communities, however, has not been easy.The mosque’s imam, Abdul Rahim, and muezzin, Zahir Hussain, continue to stay in the mosque, but their families are no longer with them. “There is dua-salaam (wishes exchanged) with the Hindus here, but all that is just over the surface,” said Rahim, with a tinge of bitterness and regret.There are less than 100 Muslim houses in this neighbourhood, about one-fifth of the locality’s population. Last year, the armed mob stormed the mosque and used petrol to set it ablaze. The three families living inside had a narrow escape. The imam believes that most in the mob were outsiders.Attempts by local Hindus to comfort the fear-stricken Muslims in this neighbourhood began hours after the burning. “Several Muslims began preparing to leave the neighbourhood. But we couldn’t have abandoned the Masjid, so we stayed on,” said Hussain.As it turned out, it was the locals who eventually stepped in to prevent an exodus.“We convinced them that the attackers were outsiders, and the Muslims here didn’t have any reason to fear. We told them that even the houses of the Hindus around the mosque were not spared by the mob. So far, not a single Muslim family has left from here,” says Jaiveer Singh, president of the Ashok Nagar footwear market association.Tyre marketUntil last February, the Old Mini Motor Market, popularly known as the Gokalpuri tyre market, would remain closed every Tuesday. Ever since it reopened last July, after much of this market was burnt to the ground during the riots, the weekly holiday has stopped.“Many shopkeepers here lost all their businesses built over years and decades. We now have to work seven days a week and longer hours to even attempt a recovery,” said the market’s vice president, Mohammad Rashid.But recovery is not the only reason to operate seven days a week. There is also the fear that an unattended market would be prone to a repeat attack.“When the riots began, we had downed our shutters and left for our homes. Our absence is what the mob took advantage of. Now, we have to ensure our presence on all days,” said Fazly Rahman, the owner of a shop, Famous Tyres.This market has tyre shops and two-wheeler repair shops, all of them owned by Muslims. Of the 224 establishments here, 62 were gutted, and a few others damaged when rioters struck on February 24. A mosque in the premises was gutted as well.While much of the cost of the reconstruction was borne by religious organisations, the shopkeepers continue to pursue civic agencies for raising the walls of the market and securing gates of the two entrances. Mohammad Aftab, legal advisor to the market association, says that about two dozen shopkeepers have received compensation, and the rest are under process.The silver lining, says Rashid with a tinge of irony, is that the market has become better known after the riots. “The riots led to many motorists in east Delhi getting to know of this specialised market. The customers have increased,” he said.Tahir Hussain’s factoryA few hundred metres on both sides of the factory of former Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain on the Main Karawal Nagar Road near Chand Bagh are markets buzzing with activity. But as you near Hussain’s four-storey wood products factory, the crowd thins considerably.Local residents say this is no coincidence.“Locals and customers usually choose not to stop on the stretch of road around this building. There is a sense of stigma attached to it,” said Suraj Singh, owner of a recently opened restaurant in a building next to Hussain’s factory.Around this time a year ago, the stretch was among the worst affected in the Delhi riots. So many stones and bottles were pelted by rival mobs, that vehicles could not negotiate the terrain.Hussain is in jail on allegations of orchestrating the riots. He and some of his associates are accused of killing some local Hindus, including IB officer Ankit Sharma, whose house is located in the narrow bylanes behind the factory. According to police, Hussain and his men stocked weapons, ranging from acid bags to petrol bombs, on the terrace of his factory.Now, local residents say, work continues in the factory under the supervision of some of Hussain’s relatives, but the large iron gates remain locked from inside.Hussain’s factory is in a neighbourhood with mixed population. While there are more Hindu homes around his factory, a few hundred metres away, Chand Bagh is a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood.While people of both communities have continued their businesses on either side of the road, the bonhomie is gone. Suresh Chand, who operates a tea cart opposite the factory (his previous cart was burnt down by the mob), says gatherings outside his stall have thinned since the riots. “People don’t stop around here to have tea, smoke and converse anymore. The fear hasn’t left anyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/then-and-now-at-5-delhi-riots-hot-spots-the-memory-remains-101614040799853.html
23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Testing down, Covid cases on the rise in Punjab||Chandigarh With the Centre advising Punjab and four other states to take preventive measures in view of the latest surge in Covid-19 cases, the government has asked all the district administration to double the testing. Testing has slowed down in the state even as there has been a rise in cases in the last week (February 14-21). The state tested 1, 23,379 samples with an average of 17,625 daily this week, only once crossing 20,000 mark. The previous week (February 7-14) when the average daily testing was 18,980, more than 20,000 samples were tested thrice. Daily cases go up Alongside the dip in testing, the state has witnessed increase in cases with the week ending on Sunday (February 14-21) witnessing 2,161 fresh cases with a daily average of 308 infections as compared to 1,652 cases in previous week (Feb 7-14) with a daily average of 236 patients. In the week of February, 1,370 positive cases were detected with a daily average of 195. In past three days, the state has witnessed 1,073 new cases. As per health department figures, in the last one week, the number of new infections has grown by an average of 0.2% every day, which almost double as compared to the first week of this month. As various reports suggest, after the Centre specifically asked Punjab to focus on testing, all the deputy commissioners have been instructed to ramp-up the testing. “All the districts have been asked to double the testing immediately so that we cross the daily target to 30,000 a day,” Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said. Surge in fatalities too Punjab’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has remained highest in the country at 3.2% with the state witnessing 5,754 Covid-19 deaths till February 21. In the second and third weeks (February7-14 and February 14-21), the state recorded 57 and 56 deaths, respectively, which are more than double the number of deceased reported in the first week with 27 virus-related fatalities. Sources in the health department also disclosed that the Centre has once again flagged the high CFR with the government. ‘No trace of new strain’ The state has refuted reports by some experts about the presence of the new Covid-19 strain in Punjab. “No sample has been found positive for the new strain till now. A few days back, we received reports of 14 samples from the Pune lab and all were negative for the new strain,” said the nodal officer. Cases are going up in the state primarily because people have started violating Covid protocols, he said, adding, “Cases are surging but the situation is not alarming. Following the Covid protocols strictly can reverse the latest surge”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/testing-down-covid-cases-on-the-rise-in-punjab-101614026852319.html
23-02-2021||Chandigarh||GST scam: VB pegs annual loss at ₹225cr from Mandi Gobindgarh||Patiala Mohali district and sessions judge RS Rai on Monday took up the multi-crore GST scam case for framing of charges against 13 accused against whom the challan was presented by the vigilance bureau. The next date of hearing is March 5, district attorney Sanjeev Batra said. Officials of taxation department were causing an annual loss of about ₹225 crore to the state exchequer by pocketing ₹ 1.5 crore monthly in bribe, reads the Punjab Vigilance Bureau’s first charge sheet. The scam was busted in September 2020 with the arrest of eight people, including six officials, while a dozen officials named in the FIR are evading arrest. The VB has submitted charge sheet against three officials and two private persons, while the role of more than 20 others is under the scanner. The VB has so far arrested 12 people in the case. In the challan, the VB summarised the statements of Sukhwinder Singh Shinda and Rohit Kumar Bansal, two main conduits (passers), whose names cropped up during the interrogation of taxation official Kalicharan, who was posted at Shambu barrier, who was arrested by the VB. “Every day, about 60 to 70 vehicles of metal scrap were unloaded in Mandi Gobindgarh by evading tax through a nexus of GST officials and passers. A same number of outbound vehicles having finished steel material leave the industrial town by evading tax. The total loss in GST evasion is ₹60 -70 lakh per day, which roughly is about ₹225 crore a year,” reads the VB challan, citing its investigations based on call recordings and cross-verification of the GST records. It further mentions that for passing a truck, GST officials would charge ₹5,000 to ₹7,000. “Every month, the passers would collect up to ₹1.5 crore at Mandi Gobindgarh for the select GST officials. Businessmen paid this bribe in advance and was handed over to officials in the first week of every month for smooth tax-free operations,” reads statement of Shinda, one of the accused, who has named eight firms which were paying ₹10 to 15 lakh per month in advance. In the challan, the VB has named several officials in the rank of director, deputy excise and taxation commissioner, assistant excise and taxation commissioner, excise and taxation officer, inspector, who were receiving bribe ranging between ₹30,000 and ₹7 lakh per month. “The money was going from bottom to top,” reads the statement of an official arrested by VB. The VB has said they have made a list of 60 iron manufacturers and traders indulging in tax evasion and shared with taxation department for submitting records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gst-sca-vb-pegs-annual-loss-at-225-cr-from-mandi-gobindgarh-101614026490140.html
23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Pregnancy termination law: HC seeks details from Centre on steps taken for uniform policy||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Centre to detail about the steps being taken or contemplated for legal termination of the pregnancies of the women with medical advice beyond 20 weeks as legal and moral predicament of the court is being tested “yet again”. The high court bench of justice Arun Monga while seeking response from the Centre by March 1 asked the central government counsel to apprise the court about the steps being taken or contemplated, in order to frame a uniform policy about legal termination of the pregnancies of the women, where the medical opinion is strongly in their favour. Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, does not permit termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks. The law allows termination of pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner, where the duration of the pregnancy does not exceed 12 weeks. If the duration is up to 20 weeks, the pregnancy can be terminated on doctors’ opinion that continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or can cause grave injury to her physical or mental health. However, courts in India have been allowing termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks by invoking its powers. “Apart from easier access to justice, such a policy shall also ensure the deserved dignity and confidentiality to the women, confronted with such legal impediments,” the bench observed, lamenting that this is not the first time when such a case has come before this court where the age of the foetus is more than 20 weeks and the doctors have opined in favour of medical termination of pregnancy. Past instances are many, perhaps becoming a routine, but only where a litigant has the means to approach this court, it said, while dealing with a pregnancy termination plea of a Chandigarh woman sought on the advice of medical practitioner. The foetus in the case in hand was of 23 weeks and five days. “This court feels that a uniform policy is required to be formulated in order to deal with all such like cases as the one in hand. A balanced approach has to be adopted to ensure the well-being and safety of the women vis-a-vis fetal abnormalities,” the bench of justice Monga said. During the hearing, the court was told that an amendment is underway in the law for allowing termination of certain kinds of advanced stage pregnancies, provided the medical opinion in favour thereof and a Bill has been introduced in the Parliament in March 2020, which prompted the court to ask about status of the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pregnancy-termination-law-hc-seeks-details-from-centre-on-steps-taken-for-uniform-policy-101614025710064.html

Schools in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai are yet to reopen, even as those in the other parts of the state began physical classes from November 23. “There is a lot of risk associated in travelling as cases are rising in the city. The chief minister has recently appealed to organisations to allow employees to work from home, if possible. Then what is the point in calling teachers and the non-teaching staff to school?” asked Rajesh Pandya, vice-president of the Teachers’ Democratic Front. While schools have remained closed for physical classes for the past 10 months, teachers are being called for work related to online learning and exams. As per the state education department’s standard operating procedures (SOPs), teachers from all the schools in the state can be called to school for work related to online learning or other academic work. Similarly, schools need to follow the policy of ‘staying home if unwell’ for teachers who are sick, especially if they have comorbidities or are aged above 50. Meanwhile, parents are now requesting the government to allow online exams for Class 9 and Class 11 students. “Many schools are scheduling offline exams for these students and it is risky considering the current situation. We also request that students be promoted on the basis of internal assessments,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allow-us-to-continue-working-from-home-say-teachers-from-mumbai-101614025169785.html

While the multiple-choice-based exams for postgraduate students kick off on Tuesday, those for undergraduate students have been postponed as the admissions for first-year students were delayed. Though the University of Mumbai (MU) is yet to take a final decision on the issue, sources said it is more likely to hold online examinations. MU’s pro-vice chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni said, “While the final decision is likely to be taken within the month, an online examination would be in the best interest of the students’ safety.” While colleges in rural areas around Mumbai have been allowed to resume physical classes, the university is yet to allow those within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to reopen institutes.“At the moment, the varsity is mulling whether to allow colleges within Mumbai to begin physical classes. However, as colleges have been conducting online exams for a year now, we are confident that they will be ready in case we decide to opt for semester exams virtually,” said Kulkarni.Even as colleges were preparing to reopen their campuses in phases for students, they are now preparing to conduct examinations for the ongoing semester.“There is a state of utter confusion on whether or not will we be allowed to reopen colleges. We were hoping to at least conduct practical exams physically. Online examinations don’t go a long way in helping students secure jobs,” said a principal of a suburban college.Anju Kapoor, the principal of Usha Pravin Gandhi College in Vile Parle, said, “We haven’t taken a decision on exams yet as we are waiting for a word from the university on whether to hold exams online or offline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/university-of-mumbai-says-online-exams-likely-101614024929856.html

Satpati and Boisar police stations booked six accused, including the fathers of the grooms, the disc jockey (DJ) and caterer, after a majority of those present at the ceremonies were seen without masks or practicing social distancing. No arrests have been made so far. “The accused have been booked under section 188 (disobedience) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897; and the Disaster Management Act, 2005. We have given permission to allow only 50 persons to attend such functions, but people were flouting the rules and were not following the rule about masks, social distancing and other standard operating procedure (SOP),” said Dr Gursal.

The state Covid-19 task force said this is a good sign, as most of the newly infected patients are either mildly or moderately infected.From January 1 to 21, Pune, Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola recorded 10,664, 1,152, 1,083 and 770 new cases. However, this month till February 21, the numbers surged to 11,600 in Pune, 8,350 at Amravati, 2,070 in Akola and 1,572 at Yavatmal.However, new Covid-19 cases fell by 7% in Mumbai in the same time period. Last month, till January 21, Mumbai had recorded 10,586, which declined to 9,825 from February 1 to 21.Despite the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state, the silver lining is that the overall fatality rate has decreased from 2.56% recorded on January 1 to 2.47% on February 21. Also, Pune, Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola – the districts that are recording the highest positivity rate – have also witnessed a decrease in the fatality from February 1 to 21 against the same period last month.Amravati which has a 50% positivity rate, has recorded around 600% surge in cases in the past 21 days as compared to the figures in January 1-21. But the fatality rate has fallen from 0.86% in January to 0.41% in the past 21 days of this month. Similarly, the fatality rate in Akola has dropped from 1.94% to 0.33%, while in Pune, it has decreased to 0.56% from 1.10%. Mumbai’s fatality rate was 1.4% last month till January 21, which dropped to 0.86% this month. Only Yavatmal has recorded a rise in the fatality rate, as it surged from 2.40% in January to 2.92% this month.“Viruses getting mutated is a regular phenomenon. But it has been observed that the severity of mutated viruses always remains lesser compared to the original one. So, if the citizens are getting infected with the new strains of Covid-19, its severity will be less. Thus, it can be one of the reasons behind the low fatality rate,” said Amravati district health officer Dr Dilip Ranmale.Claiming the decline in the fatality a good sign, the state’s Covid-19 task force attributed the rise in cases to testing. “Since the start of February, the state-wide testing has been increased. With the rise in testing, it is accepted theory that the new Covid-19 cases would also increase. So there is nothing to be scared of,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the task force. When asked if the mutation of the Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 is the reason behind the sudden rise in cases, he said, “At Amravati, the mutation can be a reason for the faster spread of the virus. But so far, we haven’t seen any mutation in Mumbai or Pune. However, samples have been sent for analysis so, we have to wait for that.” “Unlike the beginning of the pandemic, the severity of the infection among patients has gone down. Though there is a surge in the number of admissions now, we aren’t witnessing many deaths,” said St George’s medical superintendent Dr Akash Khobragade. On Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, through a video message, stated that he would review the situation for the next eight days and then take a decision on imposing the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-cases-on-the-rise-but-maharashtra-sees-a-dip-in-fatality-rate-101614024269647.html

Jakhar said the people of the state had reposed their faith in Amarinder Singh’s leadership with their landslide verdict in the Congress’ favour in the recent civic body polls. “The Congress’ sweeping victory in the civic polls has not only revalidated his leadership in the state but is an endorsement of the faith of Punjabis in his future leadership also,” he said while participating in an event for the launch of developmental projects. The state Congress has already launched mission “#Captainfor2022”, and the next elections would be fought under his leadership, he added. “Amarinder has led the state in very difficult times and the people were well aware of his massive contribution. Punjab is perhaps facing its worst-ever crisis – Covid-19 and the farmers’ unrest coupled with an unfriendly Union government,” he said, lambasting the Centre for what he termed as its stepmotherly treatment to the state. He alleged that the federal structure of the country was under extreme threat under the BJP-led central government. He also questioned the recent decision of the Union government to refuse permission to a Sikh jatha to go to Nankana Sahib in Pakistan and accused it of being biased against the state. Jakhar also urged the CM to ensure that the Congress manifesto for 2022 should promise making Amritsar – the ‘Guru ki Nagri’ - an iconic city. “Amritsar should be made as one of the best cities in the world on the lines of the Vatican,” he said.

The state launched the campaign virtually and released its logo on Monday.While announcing the drive during his televised address to the state on Sunday, Thackeray had appealed to the citizens to act with responsibility. He said that it was up to them to decide if they want to follow the norms or face another lockdown. CM Thackeray had also appealed political parties to again conduct meetings virtually. Hours after the appeal, the political fraternity reacted positively. Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) postponed its February 24 ‘jail bharo (voluntary arrest)’ agitation to protest against the disconnection of electricity connection. Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap took to Twitter to announce about the postponement of his meetings and padyatras (campaigning by foot), while Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders such as Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule cancelled their public programmes for the next few days. “I am cancelling all my programmes in the wake of the spike in the Covid-19 cases after the appeal by CM,” Pawar tweeted.

The police registered a first information report (FIR) under sections 188 (disobeying the order of public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection) and 34 (common intention), of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which stipulate imprisonment of up to six months, or a fine, or both, based on the complaint of the officials of the M-West ward Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation after they visited the gymkhana where a marriage ceremony was on. On Sunday, ward authorities acted on a tip-off about the wedding venue violating Covid-19 rules. According to civic officials, over 200 people were present at the venue of the ceremony. The officials also found that physical distancing norms were being flouted and many guests were not wearing masks properly. Senior inspector Sunil Kale from Tilak Nagar police station said, “On the basis of the complaint by the civic officials, an FIR has been registered against the gymkhana secretary, organisers, caterers and the family who had booked the gymkhana for the ceremony.” Prithviraj Chauhan, assistant commissioner of M-West ward, said, “The FIR was lodged against Chheda Nagar Gymkhana which was the organiser, and the parents of the bride and groom on Sunday night, for violating SOPs (standard operating procedures) of the marriage ceremony, such as conducting the ceremony without permission, allowing more than 200 people at the venue, not maintaining social distancing. Many people present there were also not wearing face masks.” Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had last week directed all the wards to conduct surprise inspections at at least five marriage and banquet halls each day to ensure that Covid-19 rules were being followed. He also directed ward officers to take action against bars, restaurants, cinema halls, violating Covid-19 rules. From Monday, Mumbai Police have been authorised to issue fines to citizens for not wearing masks. A police officer said that the department would be largely focusing on public places and large gatherings. Continuing its crackdown, BMC on Sunday filed police complaints against three Andheri-based pubs – Arbour, Illusion and Amethyst for violating Covid-19 rules, according to an FIR filed at Amboli police station. A senior civic official said, “The bars were open after 1.10am and were operating with over 50% occupancy. Many of the customers and staffers were not wearing masks. In one case, we noticed that the organisers were not checking the temperature of those entering the premises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-police-book-wedding-venue-at-chembur-3-pubs-in-andheri-101614023489771.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Spike in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra’s Vidarbha: Cause not clear||Even as Vidarbha region is reporting the highest number of Covid cases in the state, surpassing Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), state officials are clueless about the reason behind the sudden spike, which is similar to the July-September peak. The state is now awaiting reports from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, to ascertain the type of strain, which may be an important factor. Earlier, there were reports that genome sequencing of Covid-19 samples has found E484K mutation in one sample in Amravati and N440K mutation in another sample in Yavatmal, which are foreign mutants. However, the state on February 19 denied it. In the past 12 days, the region has clocked 21,193 cases, which on an average comes to 1,766 cases a day. Since February 11, MMR has clocked 14,492 cases and its per-day average cases is 1,207. “We also don’t know reason why the cases are increasing specifically in Amravati division because laxity regarding Covid-appropriate behavior is seen everywhere in the state,” said Piyush Singh, divisional commissioner Amravati region, comprising Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Washim and Buldhana districts. In Vidarbha, Amravati division is more affected than Nagpur division, which comprises Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts. Amravati, including both city and district, has never seen such a rise during the entire pandemic. On September 17, when the state reported its highest number of cases, 24,619, the district clocked 391 cases. However, on February 20, 21 and 22, it reported 1,055 cases, 926 cases and 649 cases respectively. The positivity rate of the district is 29.8.%. The local administrations in all districts of Amravati division have imposed a slew of restrictions that includes a week-long lockdown in Amravati city, starting Monday evening. “We have imposed restrictions on timing and activities. In containment zones, the rules are a bit stricter,” said the divisional commissioner. The state recently asked Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the, state to visit a few districts and analyse the situation. He visited Amravati and Akola districts and made a presentation before the state. “One of the reasons was active transmission of cases. Although mutation is a normal phenomenon, it is not yet clear if it is a dangerous mutation. Only the NIV report can clear the air,” said Dr Salunkhe. “However, most of them are mild cases and case fatality rate (CFR) has also not gone up in the districts.” Shelesh Nawal, district collector, Amravati district, said they have sent some 50 samples to NIV and are expecting reports by next week. “We are trying to control the situation by the means of restrictions in activities and are also penalizing people for violations,” Nawal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-s-vidarbha-cause-not-clear-101614023129913.html

During the investigation, NCB found that Anas had four previous cases registered against by the bureau, said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director, NCB.Tramadol is a psychotropic drug that is medically prescribed as a painkiller. It is a scheduled ‘H’ drug under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and can only be dispensed under the prescription of a registered medical practitioner.Over the past few years, agencies have noticed that it has been abused as an intoxicating drug, due to which it was added to the schedule of psychotropic substances under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, in 2018.In the second operation, the Bandra unit of the ANC on Sunday evening arrested three drug suppliers from Kurar in Malad and allegedly seized 3kg of charas from their possession. The arrested accused were identified as Sonu Rampal Singh, 29, Amar alias Ramshiromani Yadav, 33, and Chandan Chaurasiya, 24. All three accused are residents of Appapada area in Malad (East). An ANC officer said the gang was active for more than two years and supplied charas to small drug peddlers in north Mumbai. They were also in touch with high-profile customers in Malad and Kandivli, said Datta Nalawade, deputy commissioner of police (ANC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/four-in-mumbai-arrested-with-drugs-worth-60-lakh-101614022829381.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai cyber police bust major online racket that duped 250K people nationwide||Over the past week, the city’s cybercrime police station has arrested four men for carrying out online fraud worth ₹4 crore and duping more than 250,000 people from across the country. The arrested accused are part of a gang that had created unauthorised mobile apps and websites using fake identification numbers. On the pretext of sanctioning loans under schemes named to resemble schemes launched by the Prime Minister, the accused lured people to pay processing fees. The online fraud came to light when Pune resident Suraj Sawle filed a complaint at the Mumbai cyber crime police station in January, saying unknown people were threatening him over the phone and demanding refunds. The police probe found that Sawle’s mobile number had been used by the accused on five fake mobile apps — named Pradhan Mantri Yojana Loan, PM Loan Yojana, PMYL Loan and Sarvottam Finance Loan Service — which promised loans with low rates of interest. In the name of loan processing fees, the fraudsters charged applicants ₹900 and ₹3,000 in two phases and then cut off all communication with them, said the police. Accused Sanjeev Kumar Singh, 36, was arrested on February 15 in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh while Pranjul Rathore, 27; Ramnivas Kumawat, 25; and Vivek Sharma, 42, were arrested in Jaipur on February 18. The arrested accused have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Information Technology (IT) Act. Police have seized 18 mobile phones, 10 hard discs, three routers and a pen drive from the gang’s offices in Aligarh and Jaipur. “The fraudsters had featured a photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the national emblem on the app and as a result, over 279,000 people registered for loans, and many paid the processing fees,” said Dr Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber). The accused made the fake apps and three fake websites, which they created using fake Aadhaar cards, voters’ identity and PAN cards. Karandikar said that in order to carry out the online fraud, call centres were set up in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, and Jaipur, Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cyber-police-bust-major-online-racket-that-duped-250k-people-nationwide-101614022710802.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s St George Hospital concludes trial for Sputnik V vaccine||The government-run St George hospital completed the third phase of clinical trial of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine last week. So far, no adverse effect has been recorded among the volunteers who completed taking both the shots of the vaccine. In January, the hospital participated in the third phase of the clinical trial of the vaccine. Just like Covishield and Covaxin, Sputnik V also has two shots to be given 28 days apart. The hospital started the trial from January 20 under which they provided the first jab to 144 volunteers of which two developed mild fever. But none had any other severe health complications. Following this, the hospital started providing the second shot to the volunteers from last week. The process concluded on February 20. “All 144 volunteers who took the first shot participated in the trial. No one refused to take the second shot. In fact, no one has developed any kind of mild reactions,” said Dr Akash Khobragade, superintendent of the hospital. However, the hospital will keep following up with the volunteers for the next seven months to see if anyone develops any kind of adverse effect to the vaccine. The new analysis of data from 20,000 Phase-3 trial participants, published in the medical journal—The Lancet, claimed the vaccine provides more than 90% efficiency against Sars-Cov-2—the virus that causes Covid-19. After being vaccinated with Sputnik V, the body produces antibodies which are specially tailored to the coronavirus which helps the immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters it for real. “Sputnik V is one of the three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90%,” reads the official website of the manufacturer. In November 2020, the hospital had also participated in the second phase of the clinical trial where around 18 volunteers enrolled. “For the third phase, we got very good responses from doctors. Around 25 of the volunteers were doctors from private hospitals,” he added.The vaccine was developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. The vaccine maintained over 91% efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-st-george-hospital-concludes-trial-for-sputnik-v-vaccine-101614022709718.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Time to reactivate all quarantine centres: Mumbai civic body chief||To deal with the daily spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Iqbal Singh Chahal, in a video conference with all ward officers, on Monday decided to restart all its deactivated quarantine facilities within a week. According to BMC officials, of the 70,518 beds available for isolation in quarantine facilities, 13,136 beds are currently active, 9,757 beds are buffer beds and the remaining are deactivated. In dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and centres, 7,915 of the 11,205 beds are vacant. In terms of ICU beds, 972 of the total 1,528 are vacant; 4,749 of the 6,174 oxygen beds and 596 of the 959 ventilators are vacant. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, had earlier told HT that all jumbo centres and makeshift hospitals in the city will remain activated until March 31, 2021. However, BMC officials on Monday said these facilities now may have to stay activated for a longer period. A BMC official who attended the meeting said, “There was no discussion on reopening of schools or colleges in the city, which means they will remain shut for now. Further, every ward officer has been asked to keep a close watch on restaurants, marriage halls, night clubs and bars. Every ward office already has a flying squad to check compliance, and levying of penalty and filing police cases has started since Friday. However, there might be restrictions in the coming days, if the spike is not brought under control.” Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday hinted at a lockdown after monitoring the situation for the next eight days. Last week, mayor Kishori Pednekar also hinted at a night curfew, if the spike is not brought under control. Apart from this, all deans of BMC hospitals were asked to ensure all medical accessories are stocked up, and representatives of private hospitals were also asked to ensure 80% of the total beds in their hospitals are reserved for Covid-19. Meanwhile, as of Sunday, the BMC levied a penalty on over 1.6 million citizens for not wearing a mask in public places and collected over ₹32 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/time-to-reactivate-all-quarantine-centres-mumbai-civic-body-chief-101614022349744.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||₹15 crore worth mobile phones, watches, gold seized by Mumbai Customs||A team from Indian Customs seized high-end mobile phones and other undeclared goods worth ₹15 crore over the weekend which were being smuggled through the postal service.The seizures were made after officers were tipped off about illegal movements of the goods, which included gold, mobile phones, drones, smart-watches and cigarettes, which were smuggled via post by non-declaration of the items, thus evading the Customs and Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST). The rummaging &intelligence division of the Preventive Commissionerate (New Customs House) in Ballard Estate conducted an anti-smuggling operation and the first raid was conducted on February 18 at the MIDC post office in Andheri. Subsequent raids were conducted at Foreign Post Office (FPO) in Ballard Estate, and Air Parcel Sorting Office (APSO) at Vile Parle (East) on February 20 and 21.By the end of the raids, officers discovered that the names and addresses of the recipients of the consignments were fake. An officer close to the investigation said that the operation resulted in the seizure of 12 consignments from Chakala -MIDC post office, 26 from FPO and VDB, and five consignments from APSO. A total of around 180gm of gold, 1,470 mobile phones, 322 smart-watches, 64 drones, 41 Bluetooth earphones, 391 cigarette sleeves and 36 auto parts, collectively worth around ₹15 crore were found. “These were smuggled from Dubai. We are now investigating the case, to get the details,” said the officer.Sources from the Customs department said that since the number of passenger movements is low due to flying restrictions, smugglers seem to be choosing the least risky (as the addresses mentioned are fake) and lucrative mode to transport undeclared goods. “However, these goods undergo thorough checking before being cleared. Hence, the involvement of internal officers is being looked at,” said a source from the department. Alok Chopra, principal commissioner of customs, said, “Acting on specific intelligence, the operation was conducted, and seizures were made. While the operation is ongoing, based on intelligence inputs, we are looking forward to a few more seizures and learning the modus operandi used by the smugglers.”When asked if any Customs officer was involved, Chopra said, “It is too early to comment on this as the investigation is on. However, we will be looking at all the angles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/15-crore-worth-mobile-phones-watches-gold-seized-by-mumbai-customs-101614022229270.html

23-02-2021||Patna||No fresh taxes in Bihar's multi-crore budget for FY ’21-22||Bihar's deputy chief minister Tar Kishore Prasad on Monday presented a budget worth ₹218,302 crore for the year 2021-22, which is ₹6,541 crore more than last year's budget estimate. This year the focus is on youth, women, agriculture, rural development, technical and skill education, and entrepreneurship development.Presenting his maiden budget, Prasad said the budget has a separate allocation of ₹4,671 crore for Bihar government's 'Seven Resolves (Part-2)' and promised the creation of over 20-lakh employment opportunities and development of skill centres and training institutes. In the 2020 Assembly election, joblessness had emerged as a big issue in Bihar.“It is a budget to add pace to Bihar’s inclusive growth story and take development to the next stage. In the year 2020-21, the expected crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic put the world economy under strain and Bihar was no exception. However, the way Bihar responded to the challenge at multiple levels despite its limited resources has resulted in the state barely registering around 536 active cases today. Though we still need to maintain utmost precaution,” he added.This estimated budget expenditure includes establishment and committed expenditure of ₹117,783 crore, which is ₹11,788 crore more than last year. The scheme expenditure is estimated at ₹100,518 crore, with a lion’s share of 21.94 per cent going to education, followed by 16.78 per cent to rural development, 7.31 per cent to rural works department, 8.19 per cent to social welfare and 6.93 per cent to the health department.Also read: UP allocates ₹479 crore in budget for madrasa modernisation schemePrasad said that a new department would be set up focussing on skill and entrepreneurship development. “It will include industrial training institutes (ITIs) and polytechnics and also incorporate entrepreneurship in the curriculum. Mega skill centres will be set up in every district. The youth will be encouraged to start their own enterprise and women will be given interest-free loan up to ₹5-lakh or 50 per cent of the project cost. A sum of ₹200-crore has been earmarked for the purpose,” he added.He said that the survey for the government’s resolve to ensure water to every farm in the next five years has been completed and a sum of ₹550 crore has been added for this purpose in this year’s budgetary allocation of agriculture, energy, minor irrigation and water resources departments.The deputy CM, who also holds the finance portfolio, said that the estimated fiscal deficit for 2021-22 was estimated to be ₹22,510 crore, which is 2.97 per cent of the gross state domestic product (GSDP). The receipt from the state’s resources is estimated to be around ₹40,555 crore, which is just around 18.5 per cent of the total estimated budget.However, economic experts feel that the government would find it difficult to match the estimated budgetary target, as it would depend heavily on the fiscal situation and intent of the Centre. Even in 2019-20, against the estimated budgetary estimate of ₹200,501 crore, the actual expenditure was much lower at 143,613 crore.“The situation could be even worse during 2020-21 when India was hit by Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the numbers need to be seen with caution,” said the expert who did not want to be quoted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/no-fresh-taxes-in-bihar-s-multi-crore-budget-for-fy-2122-101614021255397.html
23-02-2021||Other||Puducherry govt falls on brink of elections||V Narayanasamy resigned as Puducherry chief minister on Monday ahead of a floor test to prove that his party, the Congress, has a majority, throwing the Union Territory (UT) into a crisis, potentially just weeks before assembly elections are announced.Narayanasamy had looked set to lose the floor test. The Opposition, comprising the All India NR Congress and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), has a majority of 14 representatives, including three nominated MLAs representing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 33-member House. It is unlikely to stake a claim to form government, and President’s rule is imminent, opposition party leaders said.The Congress was jolted with six (five Congress and one Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) legislators resigning in the run-up to the trust vote, ordered by the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Tamilisai Soundararajan after it was sought by the Opposition.When legislators occupied the assembly on Monday, there were seven vacancies in the 33-member (30 elected; 3 nominated) assembly. The government’s strength was 12, including two DMK MLAs, an independent legislator and speaker VP Sivakozhundu. The speaker votes only when there is a tie. There was no need for that, though.The collapse of the government means the Congress isn’t part of the government in any southern state or UT. Since 2019, the Congress has seen its governments collapse in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, largely on account of internal issues.In an hour-long speech on the floor of the assembly, Narayanasamy attacked the BJP-led Centre and recently ousted L-G Kiran Bedi for colluding with the Opposition and topping his government. “What is happening in Puducherry now is political prostitution, but the truth will prevail,” Narayanasamy said.Also Read | Congress needs to worry more about rebels than opponents in PuducherryNarayanasamy and his loyalists argued that the nominated members could not vote. Opposition MLAs were on their feet, drawing to their defence a Supreme Court ruling that interpreted the 1963 UT Act that allows nominated members the powers of elected MLAs.Soon after, Narayansamy and his 11 MLAs walked out. “We walked out as the Speaker refused to accept our contention that only elected members and not nominated MLAs have a right to vote,” said Narayanasamy, who then submitted his resignation to Soundararajan.Last Tuesday, amidst Congress MLAs resigning, Bedi was removed as L-G and Telangana governor Soundararajan was handed additional charge of Puducherry. Narayanasamy, who had been at odds with Bedi since 2016, had appealed to the President to recall her and rejoiced at her removal. But senior BJP leaders in the Capital said at the time that they didn’t want a seemingly partisan person to be L-G when President’s rule seemed imminent.Puducherry BJP president V Samithan said that while no move was discussed so far to stake claim to form the government, the party’s national leadership will take a decision.Former chief minister and opposition leader N Rangasamy, visibly happy as he walked out of the assembly, said the government lost “because they didn’t deliver on their promises but they are blaming the Centre”. He, too, said that the next course of action will soon be discussed.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Puducherry on February 25 to inaugurate government projects and will later head to Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore district to participate in a BJP rally in the state, which will also go to the polls shortly.Analysts say that polls in Puducherry may be delayed and will not be held alongside Tamil Nadu and three other states. “BJP government will want the President’s rule to go on for at least six months so they can build their base,” said political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “Administratively, through the L-G, they will roll out development projects and restart projects that were stalled. Politically, they will weaken the Congress further, (perhaps) use Modi’s visit to poach more MLAs. Rangasamy may want early elections hoping to be chief minister because he wouldn’t like to be dependent on the nominated (BJP) MLAs.”DMK chief MK Stalin called the elected government’s fall a “murder of democracy”. He said his party will move court if the BJP tries to delay polls in the UT.“In the coming elections people will punish the Opposition who used the three nominated MLAs (of the BJP) to topple our government,” Narayansamy told reporters.Samithan responded: “He lost because his MLAs resigned. What do our nominated MLAs have to do with it?”On Sunday, Congress MLA K Lakshminarayanan and DMK MLA K Venkatesan resigned. On Monday, the DMK suspended Venkatesan. Since late January, four other Congress MLAs — including former ministers A Namassivayam and Malladi Krishna Rao — have quit, while another party legislator was disqualified for anti-party activities last year.Namassivayam and another MLA have joined the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/puducherry-govt-falls-on-brink-of-elections-101614021223563.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police arrest 6 school drop-outs for duping 450 job aspirants across India||An ongoing investigation has revealed that a fake job racket that duped more than 450 people was run by six school drop-outs. On January 11, Mumbai Police’s crime branch raided the office of Mumbai Sri Consultancy in Malad (West), which was a fraud recruitment agency that promised foreign jobs to applicants. It was run by Mainuddin Musuruddin Shaikh, 44; Sapurid Shaikh Shamsuddin Shaikh, 34; Moinuddin Goldar Aminuddin Goldar, 34; Jayantkumar Panchanan Mandal, 38; Abdul Hasim Shaikh Ajadul Islam, 33; and Tarak Manoranjan Mondal, 32, who were arrested following the raid. The six, all from West Bengal, are school drop-outs. They had been running offices in Kolkata and Mumbai and had duped job applicants from across the country. Mainuddin is believed to have been the mastermind of the gang. The police believe the Mumbai office was set up last year on the advice of Sapurid, who lived in Malwani and had previously worked with a travel agency in Wadala. Initially, they had an office in Kolkata, which they shut down in February. A case was registered against Mainuddin and his associates in West Bengal in March 2020. After closing the Kolkata office, the plan had been to set up the Mumbai office in March 2020, but the lockdown forced them to delay their move. Eventually, they rented an office in a mall in Malad in September 2020. Inspector Sanjeev Gavade of Mumbai Police’s crime branch said that Mumbai Sri Consultancy had hired two people as office workers and issued advertisements declaring several vacancies in a Russia-based firm called Enka & Euretek. In the advertisements, Mainuddin gave his mobile number. “Their modus operandi was to contact job aspirants from outside the state where they would set shop and not entertain any locals from the same city or state in which they set up office,” said Gavade. Applicants would be asked to send their passports and pay between ₹80,000 and ₹125,000 for services such as visa processing and plane tickets. Between November 2020 and January this year, the accused had collected money and passports from around 200 people from different states, under the pretext of providing them jobs in Russia. Mainuddin and his associates advertised their services through WhatsApp and on employment websites. Mumbai Police’s crime branch got a tip-off about the gang in early January and sent a decoy to obtain information. When the decoy asked questions about their Mumbai operations, the gang members asked him to leave and approach another agency. Following this, Gavade and his team raided the office on January 11 and recovered 250 original passports of various people outside Maharashtra and fake offer letters, a computer, laptop and mobile phones. The six arrested accused have been charged with cheating, forgery and using forged documents. HT spoke to some victims of this fraud, many of whom have prior experience of working abroad. Meghnath Duhudi, for instance, had worked as an electrician in Dubai for two years. Similarly, Manish Gupta had worked as a crane operator in Saudi Arabia.

23-02-2021||City||Odisha presents ₹1.7 lakh cr budget with focus on agriculture, health||Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari on Monday presented the state budget for 2021-22 with an outlay of ₹1,70,000 crore, about 26 per cent higher than the previous year, with a focus on agriculture, healthcare and heritage even as Covid-19 affected its revenue receipts.The budget projects a revenue surplus of 2,336 crore, almost one-fourth of the revenue surplus that it had in 2020-21 FY while the fiscal deficit was below the FRBM limit of 3.5 per cent of the gross state domestic product (GSDP).“The outlay is proposed to be financed mainly through revenue receipts of ₹1,25,600 crore and gross borrowing and other receipts amounting to ₹44,400 crore. Total revenue receipts for the year 2021-22 include state’s own tax of ₹37,500 crore, own non-tax revenue amounting to ₹20,000 crore, state’s share in central taxes of ₹30,137 crore, and grants from the Centre, including GST compensation to the tune of ₹37,963 crore," said Pujari in his budget speech.With farm protests still raging around northern India and panchayat polls less than a year away, the budget kept its focus on agriculture, allocating ₹17,469 crore for agriculture and allied activities, up from ₹11,911 crore in 2020-21.The allocation includes ₹1,800 crore for Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation scheme, ₹819 crore has been sanctioned towards interest subvention on crop loans to co-operative and commercial banks, ₹454 crore towards subsidy, ₹106 crore for Odisha Millet Mission, ₹1,415 crore for fisheries & animal resources development sector, and ₹137 crore for development of brackish water aquaculture, marine fisheries, intensive aquaculture, and inland fisheries.Also read: UP allocates ₹479 crore in budget for madrasa modernisation schemeSimilarly, the allocation for healthcare was up by 19 per cent over previous years with a budgeted expenditure of ₹9,164 crore. While ₹1,353 crore was provisioned for Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana for free medical facilities with coverage up to ₹5 lakh per family in case of male members and up to ₹10 lakh per family in case of female beneficiaries, ₹500 crore was allocated to convert SCB Medical College into “AIIMS Plus Institute” to provide world-class healthcare facilities. Similarly, ₹1,572 crore was allocated under Mukhyamantri Swasthya Seva Mission for building health infrastructure and services.Keeping its focus on heritage, the government allocated ₹542 crore in the coming fiscal to transform Puri into a world heritage city while ₹200 crore each for the Lingaraj and Samaleswari temple development. For drinking water supply, the budget allocated a massive investment of ₹12,000 crore for piped drinking water supply projects while it allocated ₹7,618 crore for building new roads, bridges, improvement of existing roads and bridges as well as highway development programme.A corpus of ₹500 crore has been created to facilitate timely payment of wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Guarantee Act pending receipt of Central assistance for the wage component. Around ₹29,063 crore has been allocated under the tribal and the SC sub-components.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the budget was pro-people, pro-growth and transformative.“Most of last year, we lost in Covid lockdowns. From that scenario to present a holistic, fiscally prudent budget is nothing short of brilliant,” said Patnaik.The finance minister said after a contraction in the current year, robust economic growth is expected to support improved revenue growth in the coming year. "Odisha’s two largest revenue sources are its share of centralgovernment revenue and its revenue. In 2019-20 they amounted to 70 per cent of total revenue. Mining revenue is also subject to fluctuations in global demand. There is still uncertainty around goods and services tax compensation given the recent economic slowdown. Despite these negative revenue shocks, state revenue is expected to grow by about 10 per cent over the medium term," he said.The finance minister said in the current year, the short-term expenditure priority has been to design and implementimmediate responses to the Covid-19 crisis. "Amid the shortfall in tax revenue against the budget estimate, the state government has undertaken some expenditure rationalisation measures to cut down spending in the short-term but is budgeting for increased expenditure over the medium term," said Pujari."The total spending is projected to increase from 24.01 per cent of GSDP in FY 2019-20 to 29.01 per cent in FY 2021-22. Working with limited resources, and guided by the need to ensure sustainable public finances, the state is placing a greater focus on strategic sectors such as health, education, social security, livelihood security, employment generation and support for economic recovery," he added.The finance minister said despite Covid-19 affecting revenue, Odisha's revenue is expected to grow modestly by 5.5 per cent. "The slower growth is the combined result of the falloff in economic activity as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown and a decline in the state’s share of central taxes. A lower share in Central taxes is anticipated as a result of updated demographic data being used in the calculation of states’ share, and uncertainty in GST compensation. As the economy expands over the medium term, revenue is expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels, reaching 21 per cent of GSDP in FY 2021-22," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-presents-rs-1-7-lakh-cr-budget-with-focus-on-agriculture-health-101614020239198.html

23-02-2021||Mumbai||No new Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai for first time in 11 months||Mumbai on Monday reported zero deaths due to Covid-19, its first such day since March 31, 2020, according to data from the state health department. Maharashtra added 5,210 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking its total to 2,106,094 and alarmingly, pushing its active case count to 53,113.India’s financial capital reported its first Covid-19 death on March 17, 2020, six days after its first case. As of Monday, Mumbai has reported 11,446 deaths. Mumbai’s mortality rate went from around 6% in June 2020 to 4% in January 2021, followed by 3.58% in February 2021, which civic officials attribute to early treatment and detection. Mumbai has seen 319,889 Covid-19 cases, followed by 301,593 recoveries at a recovery rate of 94.28%. There are 5,986 active infections in the city.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The mortality rate has gone down in the city as there is a proper system in place and also citizens have better awareness about the virus one year down the line. Due to better treatment, tracing and awareness among citizens, the mortality rate has gone down.”Meanwhile, a day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray warned citizens to follow Covid-19 protocol or risk a lockdown, the health department and district authorities have already swung in action to tackle the increase in cases. Some districts such as Nagpur imposed stringent restrictions on the movement of people, including shutting markets, schools and colleges, among others, to break the chain of transmission, while not affecting daily economic activities.The state added 18 fatalities due to Covid-19 on Monday to push the toll to 51,806. Of the 18 deaths reported, six occurred in the past 48 hours and nine in the past week. The remaining three deaths were from the period before last week. Mumbai topped in the state by recording 761 fresh cases on Monday, followed by Nagpur city (643), Amravati city (555) and Pune city (336). Maharashtra, which is witnessing a resurgence of cases, recorded over 6,000 infections daily for the past three days. The active caseload in the state has shot up significantly in Akola, Amravati, Nagpur, Pune, Mumbai and Thane districts. State health department officials attributed the rise to multiple factors, including laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour, colder weather, possible mutation of the virus in the Vidarbha region, local village body elections, and social programmes such as wedding and other events.As per the data, Akola’s active cases have gone up by 145% between February 15 and 22. The active cases on February 15 were 809, which rose to 1,981 on Monday. Amravati district too saw a jump of almost 75% between the same period. The active cases in Amravati district were 3090 on February 15, which rose to 5,404 on Thursday.State surveillance officer, Dr Pradeep Awate, said that besides faster transmission and cold weather that is conducive for increasing viral activity, the laxity and increasing movement of people could have lead to an increase of cases in the state. “There have been functions, get-togethers, weddings with 500-1000 attendees happening. In January we had elections of over 14,000 Gram Panchayats where the turnout was 80%. The movements of people have increased, coupled with lack of covid-appropriate behaviour, it has led to an increase.”Mumbai reported a jump of 45.29% in its active caseload between February 15 and 22. The vast Thane district, which has five municipal corporations and a substantial rural belt, has seen an increase in active cases by 26.5% during the same period. Authorities said that cases have gone up due after local train services were allowed made available to the general public since February 1. Kakani told reporters that so far there are no signs of a night curfew being implemented in Mumbai. However, public response to Thackeray’s appeal to the state to follow masking, sanitisation and physical distancing needs to be adhered to.Kakani said that the BMC took stock of the preparedness in the city with laboratories, private hospitals, civic hospital, jumbo centres etc. “The availability of beds is at 75% now. We took stock of labs, jumbo facilities, private hospitals and have decided to maintain preparedness that was there in September 2020 [when Maharashtra reached its peak]. The laboratories have been directed to turn in reports within 24 hours. They must ensure proper contact details with pin code is mentioned so that tracing patient does not take more time,” Kakani said.Nagpur district recorded an increase of active cases by nearly 62%. It had 4,429 active cases on February 15, which rose to 7,167 on Thursday. Nagpur city on Thursday reported 643 new cases, while its rural areas reported 130 fresh cases.The rise in cases prompted the district administration to introduce stringent measures to get control the spread. Nitin Raut, guardian minister of the district, who took stock of the situation in the district, said that they are putting strict rules in the district instead of a lockdown.Raut said, “Looking at the rising Covid cases, these measures are taken include shitting all weekly markets till March 7. Similarly, all schools, colleges and coaching classes will remain shut till March 7. All markets will remain closed on the weekends. Hotel and restaurants have permission to operate at 50% capacity but till 9 pm. All religious, social, and political too will not be allowed till March 7. Besides that, we have asked wedding venues, including marriage halls and open lawns, to remain shut between February 25 and March 7.”He added that the Covid centres in the district have been directed to remain alert. He said that testing in the district has increased.Meanwhile, Maharashtra is inching closure to the landmark of inoculating 1,000,000 beneficiaries. On Monday, the state inoculated additional 57,367 beneficiaries across 823 centres, including 21,185 healthcare workers (HCWs), who received their second dose of the vaccine. Overall, the state has vaccinated 983,830 beneficiaries. On Monday, 25,235 frontline workers (FLWs) were also vaccinated.In Mumbai, 10,556 beneficiaries were inoculated on Monday. The BMC achieved 93% of the expected turnout. Of the ones vaccinated 6,706 were FLWs, 1,086 HCWs received their first dose, while 2,764 beneficiaries received their second shot on Monday, the BMC data revealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-new-covid-19-deaths-in-mumbai-for-first-time-in-11-months-101614020926213.html
23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Fresh hostel allotment begins at Panjab University||In fresh hostel allotment that began at Panjab University (PU) for the first time after the lockdown, 20 PhD scholars were provided accommodation on campus on Monday.Earlier, only those PhD scholars and MPhil students who were earlier residing in hostels were allowed to return.Last week, the varsity had decided to provide hostel accommodation to PhD students who were enrolled/registered before the lockdown (March 23, 2020). PU has also allowed final-year students of various courses, governed by different regulatory bodies, to return.Response bleak on Day 1Not many PhD scholars, however, showed up on the first day of hostel allotment, and the response is expected to increase in the coming days.Many PhD scholars, who were enrolled before lockdown but were not able to get hostel accommodation, were waiting for the varsity to start fresh allotment. Many PhD students of the varsity were also residing at rented accommodations in the peripheral areas of the varsity.A PhD scholar, on the condition of anonymity, said, “I was enrolled before the lockdown and I have been living in a rented accommodation since August last year.”PU has still not started hostel allotment for students of new batches of various undergraduate and postgraduate courses; newly-enrolled PhD scholars, too, have been asked to wait.Dean student welfare (women) professor Sukhbir Kaur said, “All standard operating procedures related to Covid-19 will be strictly followed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fresh-hostel-allotment-begins-at-panjab-university-101614020918083.html
23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Former EPFO official gets 4-year jail for graft in Chandigarh||Stating that the conduct of the convict was “highly deplorable”, the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court, Chandigarh, on Monday awarded four-year imprisonment to a former enforcement officer of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Sector 17, who was held guilty in a bribery case. A fine of ₹50,000 was also imposed on him.The CBI had arrested Manmohan Gilhotra in April 2015 for accepting ₹15,000 as bribe from a private firm based in Baltana, Zirakpur. According to the chargesheet, Gilhotra demanded the money from the firm’s chief administrative officer after threatening to conduct raids at his office.Last week, court held him guilty under Sections 7 and 13 (1)(d), pertaining to public servant taking gratification and criminal misconduct, of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The quantum of sentence was pronounced on Monday.In court, Gilhotra, 45, pleaded that he is a first offender and has two school-going daughters and a family to look after. Pleading for leniency, he said that on account of the conviction, his services would be terminated by the government and would not get any service benefits. Public prosecutor KP Singh argued that in order to check rampant corruption in public life, it is the need of the hour to give an exemplary punishment to a public servant found indulging in corrupt practices.Stating that “corruption is worse than prostitution”, Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge, CBI, ruled: “The latter might endanger morals of an individual, the former invariably endangers morals of the entire country... There are still those of us who work to overcome corruption and believe it to be possible. The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything.”The judge observed that “the conduct of accused-convict is highly deplorable” and “any softness in this regard could produce an undesirable result, namely encouragement to adoption of corrupt means by public servants which has indeed to be checked, and not allowed to be increased”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-epfo-official-gets-4-year-jail-for-graft-in-chandigarh-101614020670563.html
23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University to have hi-res cameras at all six gates||Panjab University has initiated the process of installing high-resolution cameras at the campus gates to record the images of visitors and number plates of the vehicle. The cameras will replace the present ones which are of low resolution, and will be installed at six gates in Sectors 14 and 25. The matter was under consideration for the last few years and a committee was also constituted to make suggestions. Several rounds of meetings were held for the implementation of this project.Chief of university security Ashwani Koul said: “These cameras will allow us to detect vehicles and visitors in a better way. They will be useful in maintaining law and order on the campus.”According to the plan, two cameras will be installed at each gate and will be operational day and night.The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) team during its last visit to PU in 2015 had also recommended that the campus security needs to be strengthened.Last month, the varsity had also asked the departments where heritage furniture was available to install CCTV cameras on the premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-to-have-hi-res-cameras-at-all-six-gates-101614020669121.html
23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Dumping ground fire chokes Chandigarh||Even as the fire department had earlier claimed to have brought under control the blaze that erupted at the Dadumajra dumping ground on Sunday afternoon, it kept smouldering on Monday, emanating thick plumes of smoke that were carried across the city by winds, causing inconvenience to residents. According to officials, it will take at least another day to douse the fire completely.While people in northern and western sectors woke up to a hazy morning, those residing in the south-east corner of the city, as far as in Sectors 48 and 49, also complained of difficulty in breathing due to smoke in the air. However, the Air Quality Index (AQI) did not show any unusual rise at any of the observatories in the city, according to Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee member secretary Debendra Dalai. At the monitoring station in Sector 25, which is located close to the dumping site and gives continuous data, AQI stayed at 125, as per the daily bulletin. Even in the previous days, it was staying in the 100-200 range, which comes under the moderate bracket. The highest value of PM 2.5 was recorded at 157 during the day. “Though there was lesser smoke on Monday as compared to Sunday, there was a cover of haze and white ash was also seen falling,” said Pankaj Gupta, president of the resident welfare association in Sector 38 West, which is located next to the dumping ground.Surinder Sharma, president, RWA, Sector 15, said: “Besides smoke, we could feel the foul smell as well. The administration needs to do something to address this problem.” Jatinder Mehta, vice-president, RWA, Sector 49, said: “There was a layer of smoke in the morning, and it smelled foul as well. However, later, the smoke dissipated.”Winds, methane at landfill fuel fireThe fire had been controlled in the morning, but as winds started blowing, they made the things worse, said a fire official who visited the spot. “As the fire erupted near a landfill, methane gas emanating from there kept fuelling it. We were putting sand to douse the flames, but winds kept blowing it away and made the fire spread further,” he said, adding that the things are likely to be brought under control by Tuesday.Fires frequently break out Dadumajra dumping site, which has around five lakh tonnes of legacy waste. A similar fire in October 2020 had put residents to inconvenience for days, with many complaining of irritation in eyes and throat. Amardeep Singh, president, RWA, Sector 39B, said, “Living in close proximity to the dumping site, we are fed up with the fires. An inquiry needs to be conducted to find the reasons and rule out any foul play.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dumping-ground-fire-chokes-chandigarh-101614020549484.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Sachiin Joshi remanded in judicial custody in ₹87-crore money laundering case||Businessman and actor Sachiin Joshi, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on February 14 for his alleged involvement in a ₹87-crore money laundering case, has been remanded in judicial custody by a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Monday.ED officers on Monday informed the court that the actor has not provided the required information regarding laundering proceeds of crime and sought further custody for seven days. However, the defence lawyer opposed it, saying nothing new has emerged in the ED’s investigation. Special PMLA judge Abhijeet Nandgaonkar refused to extend Joshi’s ED custody and remanded him to 14 days of judicial custody.The ED told the court that Joshi has set up companies in Dubai and also has some properties in Dubai. The agency said it wants to confront him with documents related to the same.“On this point itself when the source of money to be layered which alleged to be processed of crime can be traced by way of documented and statements recorded. But I do not think for this purpose further custody of the applicant (Joshi) is required,” the special judge observed while rejecting plea of ED for Joshi’s further custody.ED’s investigations has so far revealed that the loans availed by Omkar Group from Yes Bank were diverted and Joshi, son of Gutkha baron JM Joshi, had helped Omkar Group promoters in diversion of at least ₹87 crore.Joshi’s name came to the fore when the anti-money laundering agency was scanning documents seized during the search and seizure operation carried out at the premises of Omkar Developers last month. ED found certain documents related to payments to the tune of ₹87 crore to certain outside entities (Viikings Group of companies owned by Joshi). During initial investigation, ED confronted Babulal Varma and Kamal Kishore Gupta, both previously arrested by the agency, about these documents. Varma and Gupta said these payments were made for slum evacuation and slum rehabilitation services for certain Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) projects and a part of it was investment. However, the claim later turned out to be incorrect.ED said the funds were received by Joshi and his companies from various firms of Omkar Group. Part of the funds was shown as investment and part is shown as received against rendering of services.When questioned about funds received as investment, Joshi said the same was sent for development of land near Pune. However, no definitive agreement is entered between Omkar Group and Viiking Group with respect to such a huge investment, ED said.“It is very surprising that an amount of ₹48 crore is shown as an investment, but except for simple term sheet dated March 15, 2019, no definite agreement is made. On analysing the actual utilisation of the funds, it shows that the said funds were utilised for various purposes such as repayment of loans, various expenses etc. However, no expense is seen to be incurred towards the stated purpose of investment,” ED stated in their remand application.When ED confronted Joshi about it, he said it was a verbal agreement between the promoters of Omkar group and him that till the full payment is received, he can use the received funds as per his needs.“The said reply of the accused is clearly evasive and does not reflect the true nature of transaction. It appears that the said term sheet of investment is simply used to disguise the real intention of diversion of funds received from Omkar Group of companies and park these funds on behalf of the promoters of Omkar Group. It can be seen that any prudent business transaction would involve definite black and white agreement about investment/utilisation of such huge funds,” ED added.Investigations regarding the funds received against various invoices raised by the accused has shown that the purpose mentioned in the said invoices were for facilitating settlement of non-eligible tenants and possession of constructed rehabilitation units, help in getting consents from society, slum dwellers, committee members, brokerage towards land deal, etc. However, when Joshi was interrogated about whether any such services were actually rendered, he said no slum rehabilitation work was done by him. He, however, added that he was involved in facilitation with Omkar Group, where Omkar Group was to use his name and brand name in order to rehabilitate the tenants/settle with the tenants.“This reply of the accused is devoid of any truth and thus evasive. Use of brand name and/or goodwill for settlement of non-eligible tenants appears to be very far-fetched in light of the fact that neither the accused nor his companies had ever done any SRA project or SRA-related works. He himself stated that actual work was done by persons of Omkar Group. Thus, for no actual work done or no actual services rendered, the invoices were raised and funds were diverted in the name of expenses,” ED had submitted before the court previously. ED’s previous remand application stated that after perusing cash flows of Omkar Realtors & Developers Pvt Ltd for various years, it is observed that there are huge inter-company transactions with group companies including companies from which funds have been transferred to Joshi and his companies.It is established that loans availed from Yes Bank have been diverted, and Joshi has helped promoters of Omkar Group in diversion of at least ₹87 crore, ED stated.Joshi was charged for money-laundering under sections 3 and 4 of PMLA, 2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachiin-joshi-remanded-in-judicial-custody-in-87-crore-money-laundering-case-101614020489045.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Minor electrocuted at Airoli near Mumbai||A boy, aged around 12, died of electrocution after the iron ladder he was playing with came in contact with a high-tension wire at Airoli on Monday morning. The deceased begged for a living, the police said. Rabale police registered an accidental death case. According to police, a four-pole iron ladder was brought to that area for some repairing work of a shop on the ground floor of a building at sector 7, Airoli. Yogesh Gawde, senior inspector of Rabale police station, said, “After finishing their work on Sunday evening, the workers had kept the ladder with rubber wheels at a safe place. The CCTV footage from that area shows that around 8.52am on Monday, the boy started playing around the ladder. At one point, he unknowingly pushed the ladder towards the overhead high tension wire. He was electrocuted as soon as that ladder came in contact with the 11KV high-tension wire.” “The boy was not wearing any footwear, hence the electricity flow got connected to earth through his body. The boy was burnt and died on the spot,” said an official from Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL). Gawde said, “Our investigations are on and if we find anyone at fault, we will register an FIR against him or her. We have come to know that the boy would beg in that area to earn his livelihood. So far, no one has come to claim the body and we are unable to trace his family members.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/minor-electrocuted-at-airoli-near-mumbai-101614020369021.html

23-02-2021||Other||Film City DPR submitted, ₹10,500 crore needed for development||The Film City projected proposed at Greater Noida sector 21 will require around ₹10,500 crore, according to the draft detailed project report (DPR).The DPR was presented to the Yamuna expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) on Monday. The authority will now study it and send it to the state government in a week’s time. “We will study and discuss as to how much land allocation for a particular facility was made in the DPR (and add our suggestions). Then it wil be sent to the state government for their suggestions on the financials. After that we will make changes and finalise it,” said Arun Vir Singh chief executive officer of Yeida.Officials quoted from the 2000-page DPR that suggested mixed-land use -- residential, commercial, institutional and recreational --- will attract investment from international investors.The DPR has also spoken on the three proposed models -- public-private partnership (PPP), the authority alone, or another single developer -- to develop the project. “We will study to ascertain if the PPP model will be financially more viable. We will go by the state government’s directions on the model to give opportunity to create world-class facilities for filmmakers,” said Singh.On September 18 last year, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced the development of the Film City project that will provide the platform to encompass all aspects of filmmaking -- related with script, music, writing, editing and production -- under one roof. Subsequently, Yeida offered 1,000 acres located only 6 km from the upcoming Noida International Airport and 12 km from the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.On December 14, 2020, Yeida hired CBRE South Asia Private Limited as the consultant for the project to prepare the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/film-city-dpr-submitted-10-500-crore-needed-for-development-101614018929194.html
23-02-2021||Other||Ludhiana school that evaded property tax to tune of ₹57 lakh to now pay ₹1.5 crore||After the management of Sacred Heart Convent School, Sarabha Nagar, failed to submit pending property tax of ₹1.15 crore, a team of the municipal corporation (MC) went to the school on Monday to issue a warning. The school authorities submitted ₹18 lakh to the MC and sought time till Wednesday to pay the remaining amount.After receiving a complaint that the school management was evading property tax, MC officials looked into the matter and found that the school had filed property tax returns for three years under the self-occupied category. But the school had been paying rent for the property in crores. The building owner or the tenant has to pay 7.5% of the annual rent as property tax, but in case of schools, 50% exemption is provided by the department. It was found that the school management has evaded tax amounting to over ₹57 lakh by filing tax return under the wrong category. As per the tax evasion norms, a violator has to pay 100% penalty on the amount evaded. So the MC served a notice for recovery of ₹1.5 crore on the school on January 7.MC superintendent Rajeev Bhardwaj said, “The school authorities were delaying the payment following which we issued a warning that the civic body will initiate sealing proceedings if the dues are not cleared. The management has paid ₹18 lakh and assured that the rest of the amount will be paid by Wednesday.”Zonal commissioner Kulpreet Singh led the team of officials. The MC team also recovered ₹10 lakh from the management of a bank in Kochar market area, which was caught evading tax recently. The MC officials said the bank authorities have to pay ₹20 lakh as tax, including penalty, and they have assured that pending ₹10 lakh will be paid by March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-school-that-evaded-property-tax-to-tune-of-rs-57-lakh-to-now-pay-rs-1-5-crore-101614018928789.html
23-02-2021||Noida||UP cabinet approves 700 acres for Electronic City project near Jewar airport||The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Monday approved a 700-acre Electronic City project near the upcoming Noida International Airport.The first-of-its-kind project in the national capital region (NCR) is expected to help the state create a hub of electronics system design and manufacturing sector together with multiple incentives.The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) in 2020 sought the approval for the project proposed in sector 7, adjacent to the airport and along the expressway that connects Greater Noida and Agra.“It is a matter of extremely happiness that the UP government in its annual budget has approved the project paving way for further operations to begin at the ground. Now we will ready the land and allot the same to interested companies willing to set up businesses here,” said Arun Vir Singh chief executive officer of the Yeida.The authority has not yet set a deadline for the project or estimated cost for the project. That, officials say, will be known once detailed project report (DPR) is prepared.“Other modalities will be worked out. We have to prepare a detailed project report and also finalise the floor area ratio that will be allowed within the sector,” said Singh.Apart from IT industry services, outsourcing and research and development, the focus will be on attracting small, medium and big hardware manufacturers to the site due to its proximity to Dadri where multiple freight corridors and logistics hub are planned. The region is likely to shape up as a prime export and import centre and manufacturers will find it convenience to operate from this region.Among the incentives that the state government will offer will be subsidy on interest and capital payment, common infrastructure development, tax reimbursement and up to 100% exemption from stamp duty, among others.In 2018, Yeida had planned the project in sector 33 and had earmarked 103 acres. Now, that land will be used for a Toy City project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-cabinet-approves-700-acres-for-electronic-city-project-near-jewar-airport-101614018808277.html
23-02-2021||Noida||GB Nagar administration enlists 4.25 lakh beneficiaries for phase-3 vaccination||On the basis of latest electoral roll, the Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad district administrations have prepared a list of beneficiaries for the third phase of Covid-19 vaccinations expected to begin in March. The third phase will administer the first dose for people over 50 years or those suffering from comorbidities.While Gautam Budh Nagar has identified over 424,500 such people, while Ghaziabad said it had a list of over 616,000 people.GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, said that the list was made in compliance of the instructions from the state government. “Everyone who has completed 50 years have been include in the list of beneficiaries enlisted for the third phase, irrespective of any co-morbidity. For accuracy, we decided to tally it with the latest electoral roll in the district. As soon as the dates of vaccination for these beneficiaries will be announced by the government, the district health officials will begin the process of registration, in which the addresses and mobile numbers of the beneficiaries will be updated,” he said. “To increase the turnout during inoculation, we have made a proposal to the state government, to increase the sessions to thrice in a week from the existing twice in a week,” he said. The phase will have 15 rounds.Meanwhile, aimed to inoculate the remaining frontline workers, the mop-up round for second phase of vaccination began on Monday. However, it could not yield better results than previous sessions as only 2,405 of remaining 8,062 frontline workers could be inoculated, which was 29% of the remaining frontline workers. GB Nagar district vaccination officer, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, said that taking serious notes of the instructions given by the state health department to increase the vaccination turnout, the district vaccination department had made 54 booths at 26 different locations, for this mop-up round. “All our efforts couldn’t pull up the beneficiaries as 5,637 out of overall 18,717 frontline workers finally missed the inoculation in the second round. These left out beneficiaries could not get the jabs in any of the four sessions of second phase of vaccination,” he said. He further said that after the mop-up round, the final figures of vaccination in the first phase, have gone to 69.77%. “As many as 13,060 health workers could be inoculated in all three sessions and the mop-up round. Now, the failure of potential beneficiaries to get vaccinated in the mop up round will automatically push them to the age-appropriate vaccination category, which will perhaps take place after the last round of vaccination,” he said. When asked about the reasons behind the lukewarm response to the mop-up drive, Tyagi said that a lack of confidence in the vaccine among the health workers appears to be the main reason. “While many of them remained sceptical about the efficacy of the vaccine, others claimed that they do not need it as their bodies have developed immunity against the virus,” he said. He said that the health department officials had informed the beneficiaries, two days ahead of their stipulated date of vaccination. “We had also informed the departments concerned of the beneficiaries about their presence or absence during the vaccination. To increase vaccine confidence, it is essential to improve the public’s understanding of how they can help control the spread of Covid-19 in their families and their communities,” Tyagi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-administration-enlists-4-25-lakh-beneficiaries-for-phase-3-vaccination-101614018748344.html

Pollution levels are likely to hover between the “poor” and “very poor” categories over Delhi and other parts of northwest India due to calm winds in the evening that slow the dispersal of pollutants.An AQI between 301 to 400 is categorised as “very poor”.“Wind speed during day time is around 10kmph, but they are mostly calm during the evening. This is why we are not seeing any improvement in air quality. We are unlikely to record any significant improvement in the coming days either,” said VK Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality division. Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Moradabad, Meerut recorded “very poor” air quality on Monday.“With February coming to an end, we expect a rise in maximum and minimum temperatures. The maximum temperature is likely to rest between 30 to 31 degrees Celsius (°C), while the minimum is likely to be 12 to 13°C in the next three to four days. A western disturbance is impacting the Western Himalayan region. Once that moves away, there will be a marginal and brief drop in temperatures in the Capital as cold northwesterly winds will be blowing. But otherwise, it is likely to get warmer now,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.On Monday the maximum temperature was 28.9°C, four degrees above normal, while the minimum temperature was 11°C, which is the normal mercury level for this time of year.Under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, widespread rainfall or snowfall is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad; scattered rainfall/snowfall is likely over Himachal Pradesh for next 3 days and fairly widespread rainfall for the subsequent 2 days while scattered rainfall or snowfall is also likely over Uttarakhand during next 5 days.Thunderstorm or lighting is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad during the next five days and over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand from February 23 to 26.Isolated hailstorms are likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad on February 24 and 25; Himachal Pradesh on February 25 and 26 and over Uttarakhand during February 23 to 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poor-air-in-delhi-imd-says-mercury-to-hit-30-c-again-this-week-101614017728627.html

The Delhi government is committed to ensure their dignity and welfare. Registration camps will be organised at 45 sites across the city, which includes 29 government schools and 16 major construction sites. Mobile units would be deployed to all 11 districts of Delhi and they will move around different construction sites so that workers do not have to forego their daily wage to register themselves,” Sisodia said.Delhi has 262 major labour chowks where workers assemble daily in search of work. As part of its awareness campaign, the government, in a statement, said it will put up hoardings, posters and distribute handbills to encourage labourers to get themselves registered at the nearest registration camp. These camps will operate from 9am to 5pm till March 22 and all documentation -- be it new registration, renewal or verification -- will be offered at these sites, the statement read.This is not the first time that the Delhi government is organising such a camp for construction workers. A similar camp was launched last August, but it received a tepid response and the Delhi government was pulled up by a city court for not spreading awareness about its enrolment drive.“There are one million construction workers in Delhi of whom only 0.13 million workers are registered with Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board till date. Around 80,000 workers are in the process of getting registered. I appeal to the residents of Delhi to assist the construction workers and spread awareness about the mega registration drive so that maximum workers are able to avail of benefits,” Sisodia said.Construction workers can also get themselves registered using the Delhi government’s doorstep delivery service. They need to call 1076 and the personnel from the labour department will visit their homes to register them, he said.The Delhi government has a number of schemes for those registered with the Board. Workers can get ₹ 3-5 lakh for the construction of a house, ₹30,000 as maternity benefit, ₹ 20,000 as loan for the purchase of work-related tools and ₹5,000 as grant for the purchase of work-related tools. Other than these, the registered workers’ family gets assistance of ₹1 lakh in case of a natural death of the worker, and ₹2 lakh in case of accidental death. They can also avail of ₹1 lakh in case of permanent disability and a disability pension of ₹3,000 a month.Under the education scheme, registered workers can avail of benefits between ₹500 and ₹10,000 a month for school education and higher education of their children. In other schemes, the workers can get ₹35,000-51,000 as financial assistance for the marriage of children, and ₹3,000 a month as pension.So far, the Delhi government has distributed cheques totalling ₹3.18 crore to 488 construction workers in the month of February.

23-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi airport sets up more booths, deploys extra staff to test foreign flyers||Arrangements have been made at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) to test all arriving international passengers starting Monday midnight. At least 30 new counters have been set up and additional staff deployed to test and guide the passengers through the new protocol.The government of India on February 17 had issued new guidelines for passengers travelling to India, in the wake of new variants of the Covid-19 virus, with demonstrated increased transmissibility, being reported from countries such as the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil.Starting Tuesday, all international flyers arriving at Delhi international airport on flights from the UK, Europe and South Africa can exit the airport only after giving their samples for an RT-PCR test. The flyers will also have to upload a “negative RT-PCR test report”, done within 72 hours of boarding the flight to India. Only those travelling on exigencies, such as a death in the family, will be exempted from the pre-boarding mandatory RT-PCR test, the new rules say.Transit passengers will have to wait for their test reports before boarding the connecting flight, the new SOP says.Since under the new arrangement, more RT-PCR tests will be conducted per day, special arrangements have been put in place at the Delhi airport.Dr Gauri Agarwal, founder and director of Genestrings Diagnostics, which will be conducting these tests at the Delhi airport, said they were earlier conducting 500 to 600 RT-PCR tests a day, which is now expected to go up at least tenfold -- to about 6,000 to 7,000 a day.“With government’s stringent approach to control spread of the new variant of the virus, the number of our daily tests will go up from 500-600 to 7,000-plus. While our laboratory is equipped to test more than 15,000 samples a day, the operations teams, comprising data entry operators and sample collection technicians, had to be increased to handle the large inflow of passengers from these countries. For this, a massive recruitment drive had to be launched and at least 230 additional staff had to be recruited overnight -- they will trained over the next two days,” Agarwal said.“It is expected that during peak hours, between 3am and 5am, there will be roughly 1,200 passengers an hour undergoing testing,” she said.The airport operator, DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd), said since all incoming international passengers on flights from the UK, Europe and South Africa will have to undergo the mandatory RT-PCR tests, two categories of services will be available for passengers. “One is the government approved rate of ₹800 per test, while the other is a premium service at ₹1,300. This service will also be available for pre-booking on www.newdelhiairport.in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-airport-sets-up-more-booths-deploys-additional-staff-to-test-international-flyers-101614017608209.html
23-02-2021||Delhi||Metro, buses to continue operating at restricted capacity for two more weeks||The Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) on Monday decided that state-run buses and Metro trains will continue operating at their current limited capacity for at least two more weeks in view of a rise in Covid-19 cases in a few states.A senior official, who attended the meeting, said the decision was taken as states such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab are witnessing a surge in cases with the new strain of Covid-19 virus. “The Delhi transport corporation (DTC) and cluster buses and the Delhi Metro will run at previously fixed limited capacities for now. The idea is to be vigilant and to watch the Covid-19 daily cases for another two weeks,” the official said, on condition of anonymity.Last week, the Delhi transport department had sent a proposal to the DDMA to allow people to travel standing up on public buses. The DDMA is chaired by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal and has chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as its vice-chairperson.DTC and cluster buses are currently plying at full seating capacity, while on Metro trains, commuters can sit only on alternate seats. Commuters are also allowed to stand and travel, but have to maintain a stipulated distance between them. This, according to Metro officials, further reduced the carrying capacity of each coach.In the face of a sudden rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, several states have imposed fresh restrictions on allowing passengers from other states.A negative report of the RT-PCR test is required if you are travelling to Maharashtra from Gujarat, Delhi-NCR, Goa, Rajasthan and Kerala. This is applicable to all travellers irrespective of whether they are travelling by flight or train.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/metro-trains-buses-to-continue-operating-at-restricted-capacity-for-two-more-weeks-101614017549057.html

The bridge is part of the 82-km-long Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project between Delhi and Meerut.The bridge will run parallel to the existing Delhi Noida Direct flyway and connect Sarai Kale Khan and New Ashok Nagar RRTS stations.A NCRTC spokesperson said, “The length of the bridge crossing over the river will be around 626 metres and the remaining portion will come up on the floodplain on both sides. We have started digging the foundation for the piers.”This will be the eighth mass transit corridor to be constructed on the river. The Northern railway is constructing a new bridge parallel to the Old Yamuna bridge. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has four corridors crossing the river and the construction work on the fifth bridge on the Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor started in August last year.Environment expert CR Babu said, “The agency should ensure that there is no damage to the floodplain and wetlands. The agency should undertake work to restore the ecology and protect the wetland.”A senior NCRTC official said, “All the construction activities are being carried out following the prescribed guidelines to avoid any adverse impact on the floodplains. Various eco-friendly measures will also be taken during the construction. The muck and debris generated will be disposed of systematically and no dumping will be done on the floodplains.”Earlier this month, the NCRTC started work at its Anand Vihar station, one of the 22 stations on the Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor. Anand Vihar is an important transit point as it has a railway station, inter-state bus terminal and two Metro corridors --- blue line (Vaishali to Dwarka) and pink line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ncrtc-starts-work-on-bridge-over-yamuna-for-delhi-meerut-rrtslink-101614017548017.html
23-02-2021||Delhi||North MCD to pass a proposal for legal tag to makeshift temple in Chandni Chowk||North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash on Monday directed civic officials to draft a proposal within two days to grant legal status to a makeshift structure that has come up near the site of a Hanuman temple in Chandni Chowk demolished by the North civic body on January 3 on the orders of the Delhi high court.The makeshift structure came up on the central verge of the Chandni Chowk main road, which has been redeveloped into a pedestrian-only zone as part of a project to decongest and beautify the Mughal-era market. The temple was demolished as it fell in the course of the redevelopment work. The demolition kicked off a row with both the AAP and BJP blaming each other for not taking steps to what they claimed was a 100-year-old structure. It was yet to be known who built the makeshift structure.Mayor Jai Prakash has also called an all-party meeting to “achieve a consensus” on the issue and then pass the proposal in its House meeting on Thursday, called specifically to discuss the matter.Prakash said officials informed the political executive that the temple can be granted a legal status provided it is approved by the city government and its religious committee. “So, we have now directed the legal and land & building departments officials to draft a proposal or a document of support for the temple within two days and it will be passed in the house meeting of north corporation on Thursday. We have also invited councillors of all parties for a meeting on Tuesday so that a consensus can be reached on legalising the temple construction. Since all party leaders have offered prayers at the new structure, it should not be a problem for them to support the cause,” the mayor said.Civic officials said once passed by the House, the proposal will be sent to the Delhi government’s religious committee and urban development department for approval. Once approved, the temple will be granted a legal status.On Saturday, the Public Works Department (PWD) wrote to the Delhi police asking them to take action against the construction. The PWD mentioned that the structure came up without any permission from any of the agencies executing the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project.Prakash said the makeshift temple did not encroach upon the road as it was located on the central verge. “Keeping sentiments of thousands of people in the area, we request the religious committee to consider the proposal,” he said.Leader of opposition in north corporation and Aam Aadmi Party councillor, Vikas Goel, said the Hanuman temple should not have been demolished in the first place, but the civic body demolished the temple. “Now, they are doing drama over the issue. We have always been in favour of the temple as we respect sentiments of the public. We will attend the all-party meeting tomorrow (Tuesday),” Goel said.The Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) requested chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to direct the PWD to withdraw its complaint from the police. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor wrote to the CM on Sunday, requesting him to take back the complaint and also direct the Delhi government’s religious committee to review and approve the new temple and make it part of the beautification plan.In last three days, leaders of all the three political parties have visited the makeshift temple in Chandni Chowk and offered prayers, performed hawan and chanted religious hymns such as Hanuman Chalisa and Sundar Kand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/north-mcd-to-pass-a-proposal-for-legal-tag-to-makeshift-temple-in-chandni-chowk-101614017488594.html
23-02-2021||Delhi||Two murders in a span of 15 hours; suspects nabbed in both cases are family||Two persons, including a 64-year-old woman, were killed in two separate incidents reported from south and north-east Delhi within a span of 15 hours on Sunday. Both murders have been solved and the suspects -- family members of those killed -- have been arrested.The first murder came to fore around 7.30am on Sunday, when the Safdarjung Hospital authorities informed south Delhi’s Fatehpur Beri police station about the death of 38-year-old Sikandar Sahni due to strangulation. Sahni was admitted to the hospital by his 35-year-old wife Sarita Devi, who was later arrested for the murder. Police said during questioning, she admitted to killing her husband by strangling him with her saree.“Sarita Devi told us that her husband was a habitual drinker despite being a chronic tuberculosis patient. The couple often had arguments over this. After consuming liquor, he allegedly used to abuse and assault her daily in front of their children,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.On Saturday night, an investigator who did not want to be named, said Sahini returned home in an inebriated condition and picked up a fight with Sarita Devi. Their four children went to another room on the ground floor. The couple’s argument continued till the early hours of Sunday and the woman strangled her husband with her saree in a fit of rage.“The woman alerted her neighbours, sought their help to rush him to hospital but did not tell them that she had strangled him. It was the doctors who found the ligature marks around his neck and informed us. Sahni was declared brought dead at the hospital,” the officer added.In the second case, a 22-year-old man allegedly killed his mother by stabbing her multiple times with a screwdriver at their home in north-east Delhi’s Khajoori Khas on Sunday around 10pm. The man, Sushil Pandey, turned violent when his mother, Ramlalli Devi, rebuked him for his drinking habit and refused to give money to buy liquor, the police said.DCP (north-east) Ved Prakash Surya said Pandey was caught from the crime scene after his father returned home, found his wife’s body and raised the alarm. “Pandey’s parents were concerned over his drinking habit. He worked as an electrician but had stopped going to work for the past sometime. He often fought with his mother Ramlalli Devi over money for buying liquor,” said the DCP, adding that the screwdriver used in the murder was recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-murders-in-a-span-of-15-hours-suspects-arrested-in-both-cases-are-family-members-101614017488082.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Auto, taxi fares in Mumbai to increase by ₹3 from March 1||Mumbaiites will have to shell out more for autorickshaw and black-and-yellow taxis to travel in the city from March 1. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Transport Authority (MMRTA) on Monday gave nod for a ₹3-hike in minimum fares for both auto and taxi, bringing fares to ₹21 and ₹25 respectively. The minimum fare for 1.5 km for autorickshaws will increase to ₹21 from ₹18. Thereafter, per kilometre rate will increase to ₹14.20 from the present ₹12.19. The minimum fare for black and yellow taxis for 1.5 km will be ₹25 from ₹22, and the per km rate will increase to ₹16.93 from ₹14.84.“The price hike will be implemented from March 1. Autorickshaw and taxi drivers will have to get their meters calibrated by May 30,” said state transport minister Anil Parab. Also Read | ‘Another lockdown unaffordable’: Maharashtra minister Tope urges peopleParab said the fare hike has been decided as per the criteria of the Khatua committee appointed by state government to determine tariff hike formula. There are various factors in deciding revised fares such as transport bodies, price of vehicles, insurance cost, CNG prices, interest on loan, licence fees, and consumer index.“A fare hike has not happened in the past six years. As per the rules of the Khatua committee, if there is an increase due of 50 paise in June, it should be given in that year itself. This fare hike was due for a long time. The transport department has helped several sections of the transportation sector by way of tax waiver, but we could not do so for auto and taxi drivers. The hike would give them some relief,”Parab said. “The hike in petrol, diesel and CNG prices is an important factor. In this backdrop, auto and taxi drivers are also a section of society who should be given support by the government,” he said and added that the fare of shared auto and taxi routes will also be revised.The last fare hike of autorickshaws and taxis was in June 2015.Unions have welcomed the move and said it will help the taxi drivers recover from losses they had to face during the lockdown. “We had demanded an increase in fares in 2019 as there has been a significant increase in prices of CNG. According to Khatua committee report, the increased fare should be ₹27, but we demanded for ₹25. Long distance passengers will not be impacted much,” said AL Quadros, leader, Mumbai Taximen’s Union.“The fare hike was due for the past five years. Though it has happened now, other demands have been sidelined. Auto drivers should be provided ₹10,000 as compensation along with waiver of vehicle loans,” said Shashank Rao, president, Mumbai AutorickshawMen’s Union. “The government should reconsider the increase in fare. This will be a steep increase. A minimum token amount fare hike was expected. There has been an increase in fuel prices, while autos and taxis operate on CNG. The increase in CNG price will have to be seen,” said Shirish Deshpande from Mumbai Grahak Panchayat.Mumbai has around 200,000 autorickshaws and 40,000 black-and-yellow taxis operating in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-commuters-may-have-to-pay-higher-auto-taxi-fares-101613993001208.html
23-02-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Bombay HC grants six months’ interim bail to Varavara Rao||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday granted bail to Telugu poet and activist P Varavara Rao for six months on health grounds, nearly two-and-a-half years after he was arrested in connection with the so-called Elgar Parishad case.The 80-year-old Rao, arrested on August 28, 2018 from his residence at Hyderabad, was asked by the court to remain in Mumbai.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale said in the course of delivering its order that the answer to the question — can aged prisoners with various health conditions be forced to live a subhuman existence behind the bars only because they stand accused of serious offences — has to be in the negative.Also Read | NIA supports plan to shift P Varavara Rao to Mumbai’s Sir JJ HospitalThe National Investigation Agency (NIA) opposed the bail, and pointed out that Rao had been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, under which bail is not usually granted, but the bench held that undertrial prisoners can be granted bail purely on the grounds of sickness, advanced age, infirmity and health conditions, if continued incarceration is found to be incompatible with their health and endangers their life.In this case, the court concluded that the hospital attached to Taloja Central Prison, where Rao was lodged, was ill-equipped and inadequate to take care of his health; his health had deteriorated when he was admitted to various government hospitals in the city; and it improved only when he was shifted to Nanavati Hospital, a private super-specialty hospital.“In view of the aforesaid material and sequence of events, we have come to the conclusion that sending the undertrial (Rao) back to Taloja Central Prison would certainly endanger his life,” the court added.As part of the bail conditions, Rao has to report to the nearest police station in Mumbai through a fortnightly WhatsApp video call. He has also been told not to make any statements regarding the case in any form.Rao’s family in Hyderabad welcomed the court’s decision.“It is really a big relief for all of us that he will be out of jail after a gap of more than two-and-a-half years. But it is unfortunate that the court did not grant him permission to return to his home in Hyderabad during the bail period,” said Rao’s brother-in-law N Venugopal, who is also a poet and writer.Rao’s wife Hemlatha is in Mumbai, awaiting his release.According to Venugopal, there are two more cases pending against Rao, one in connection with a 2005 Maoist attack in Pavagada in Kolar district of Karnataka and another case of trucks burning at Gadchiroli in Maharashtra in 2016.“While he got bail in Pavagada case, the bail petition pertaining to the Gadchiroli case is pending before the Bombay high court. Since the same high court has granted him bail, it will not be a problem for his release from jail,” he added.The Elgar Parishad case is about a meeting of a group of activist organisations, held on 31 December 2017, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon battle, where a Dalit regiment of the British army is believed to have defeated the Marathas.The Bhima-Koregaon battle is celebrated as a symbol of Dalit empowerment.The Elgar Parishad meeting in 2017 preceded widespread violence on January 1, 2018, and the charge against Rao and other activists of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) is that they incited violence by creating communal disharmony.The case was taken over by the NIA on January 25, 2020. Fifteen other activists were also arrested in connection with the case.(Srinivasa Rao Apparasu in Hyderabad contributed to this story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-bombay-hc-grants-six-months-interim-bail-to-varavara-rao-101613975240139.html
23-02-2021||World||US marks grim milestone of 500,000 Covid deaths||President Joe Biden led the nation to observe a moment of silence on Monday in the memory of Americans who died of Covid-19, as the toll crossed 500,000, a grim testament to how miserably one of the world’s most advanced countries failed in the face of the worst public health crisis in a century.The US toll reached 500,201 on Monday, and stood at 500,443 with 1,347 more fatalities overnight, according to the Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 tracker. And the number of new infections went up by 56,079 over the same period to 28.1 million, which is nearly 9% of the population.The first Covid-19 case was reported in the US on January 21, 2020 and the first death a fortnight later on February 6.“Today, we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone: 500,071 (official figures can be different depending on the cut-off time and tracker agency),” President Biden said. “That’s more Americans who have died in one year in this pandemic than in World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined. That’s more lives lost to this virus than any other nation on Earth.” Brazil, India and the United Kingdom are next.“As a nation, we can’t accept such a cruel fate. While we have been fighting this pandemic for so long, we have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,” he added.Biden has ordered the US flag to be flown at half-mast for the entire week in memory of those who died of Covid-19.President Biden’s response to the pandemic and the attendant fallout has been in marked contrast to that of his predecessor Donald Trump, who had tried to downplay the crisis and frequently questioned mitigation measures such as social distancing and masking.Even in the best of circumstances, the pandemic would have been a serious problem. “However, that does not explain how a rich and sophisticated country can have the most percentage of deaths and be the hardest-hit country in the world,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a top adviser to Biden, told Reuters. “That I believe should not have happened.”With just 4% of the world population, the United States accounts for a fifth of the 2.5 million global deaths and a fourth of all infections.But the situation has improved despite the threat of new strains of the virus from South Africa and Brazil. Vaccinations are up and new infections and deaths are declining. Both Biden and Fauci are hopeful of the country returning to normalcy around Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-marks-grim-milestone-of-500-000-covid-deaths-101614102100971.html
23-02-2021||World||UK to push at G-7 for global standard on 'vaccine passports'||Britain plans to use its presidency of the Group of Seven economic powers to push for an internationally recognized system of vaccine passports that could allow world travel to resume, though Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged Tuesday that the idea raises “complex” ethical issues.The British government previously said it was not considering issuing vaccine passports to people who had been inoculated. But it has now set up a review into “Covid status certification” that will examine ways people can prove they don’t have the coronavirus, either through vaccination or by showing a negative test result.The government said it would “look to introduce a system to allow vaccinated individuals to travel more freely internationally.” It added it would work with other countries through the World Health Organization, the G-7 -- whose presidency the UK holds this year -- and other bodies on “a clear international framework with standards that provide consistency for passengers and industry alike.”“Introducing such a system also needs to be fair and not unduly disadvantage people who have yet to be offered — or gain access to — a vaccine,” the government said in a document outlining its plans to lift Britain’s pandemic restrictions. “That being the case, the government does not expect this solution to be available quickly, and restrictions like those in place across the world are likely to continue for the near future.”The British government is also looking at how such proof might be used by employers, venue owners or organizers of large events. One option under consideration is using the National Health Service contact-tracing app, which millions of people in Britain have on their phones, to display Covid-19 test results.Johnson said Tuesday that “there are deep and complex issues that we need to explore” before making a decision.“We can’t be discriminatory against people who for whatever reason can’t have the vaccine,” he said. “There might be medical reasons why people can’t have a vaccine. Or some people may genuinely refuse to have one. I think that’s mistaken, I think everybody should have a vaccine, but we need to thrash all this out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-push-at-g-7-for-global-standard-on-vaccine-passports-101614100003431.html

Each of those variants has been found in the US, adding urgency to the country’s effort to understand how they’re spreading.About 3% of all cases are being sequenced to find variants, Walensky said. “That obviously needs to scale up,” she said.The CDC is working with seven academic institutions to sequence about 4,000 samples a week, and commercial labs are sequencing about 6,000 cases a week, Walensky said. They are expected to further expand capacity.Congress is proposing $1.75 billion in additional funding to expand sequencing as part of President Joe Biden’s economic stimulus plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-steps-up-key-genetic-analysis-for-coronavirus-variants-by-5500-101614099902199.html

The illness was not related to the coronavirus and royal officials called it a precautionary measure.Philip's youngest son, Prince Edward, told Sky News that his father was “a lot better.”Edward said "he’s looking forward to getting out, which is the most positive thing, so we keep our fingers crossed.”Other members of the royal family have continued their official duties during Philip’s hospitalization.Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, retired from public duties in 2017 and rarely appears in public. During England’s current coronavirus lockdown, he and the queen had been staying at Windsor Castle, west of London.Both Philip and Elizabeth, 94, received COVID-19 vaccinations in January.The queen performed her first face-to-face event of the year on Thursday, when she knighted a royal aide during a private, socially distanced ceremony at Windsor.Philip, whose 100th birthday is in June, married Elizabeth in 1947 at London's Westminster Abbey five years before she became queen. He is the longest-serving royal consort in British history.He last stayed in the hospital in December 2019, when he was treated for a “pre-existing condition” and discharged after four nights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-has-infection-will-stay-in-hospital-palace-101614097755832.html
23-02-2021||World||How rich is Saudi Arabia? Kingdom does the math in balance sheet overhaul||The kingdom is working on creating a consolidated balance sheet of its assets and liabilities which will include items currently kept off the oil-rich economy's books, including the investments and debts of its powerful sovereign wealth fund."The main purpose of this programme is to have a financial equivalent of an MRI of the government balance sheet," a Finance Ministry spokesman told Reuters, adding that it would include assets and liabilities that are currently "off-balance sheet".Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman has put Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, at the centre of reforms aimed at diversifying the economy of the world's top oil exporter away from fossil fuel.Under the prince's chairmanship, PIF has transformed from a sleepy sovereign wealth fund into a global investment vehicle making multi-billion dollar bets on hi-tech companies such as Uber as well as other equity investments and pledging tens of billions of dollars to funds run by Japan's Softbank.Its financial statements are not published and it does not feature in the kingdom's budget, which is publicly available.Gulf countries don't typically publish information about their overall debts and assets but the PIF's riskier investment profile and infusion of state funding have made its opacity an issue for some investors."Transfers of wealth from liquid pools of assets like central bank reserves into PIF's less liquid (and less transparent) investments increases the overall risk profile of the public sector balance sheet," said Kirjanis Krustins, a director in Fitch's sovereign team."Debt investors would tend to see the government and its key government related entities such as PIF as representing substantially the same risk. Thus the levering up of the broader Saudi complex could at some point impact the government's own borrowing costs," he said.The government media office did not respond to a request for comment.ARAMCO BILLIONSThe government started working in the second half of last year on the so-called Sovereign Asset and Liability Management (SALM) framework and the spokesman said it was a 'long-term project' with no decision yet made on when and how its results would be disclosed."If we use benchmarks we will see countries spent a couple of years to implement the consolidation phase," he said of the project.The PIF's finances are formidable.Its assets have swelled to $400 billion as of 2020 from $150 billion in 2015, with the fund bolstered by an expected $70 billion payday from Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, for PIF's stake in a petrochemical giant and a $40 billion transfer from the central bank's foreign reserves.It was also the recipient of nearly $30 billion in proceeds from Aramco's initial public offering in 2019.The fund has raised $21 billion in loans between 2018 and 2019, and is finalising a new facility expected to be over $10 billion in size, sources have said.THE 'NORMAL' WAYDespite Saudi's oil wealth, creating enough jobs for the kingdom's young population is one of the biggest challenges facing Prince Mohammed, known in the West as MbS.The government has been pushing through economic policies since 2016 aiming to create millions of jobs and reduce unemployment to 7% by 2030. But fiscal austerity to contain a yawning deficit has slowed investment, and the coronavirus crisis last year pushed unemployment up to a record 15.4%.To get the deficit down from an eye-watering 12% of GDP last year to a shortfall of 4.9% by the end of this year, Riyadh has slashed capital spending.It is relying instead on the PIF to fund some of the major infrastructure projects to help boost growth, including NEOM, a $500 billion high-tech business zone, and the recently announced "The Line", a 1 million inhabitants carbon-free city in NEOM, expected to cost between $100 billion and $200 billion.PIF plans to inject at least 150 billion riyals ($40 billion) annually into the local economy until 2025, and to increase its assets to 4 trillion riyals ($1.07 trillion) by that date, Prince Mohammed has said."MBS understands that unless the economy grows at a rate above 6.5-7%, the youth unemployment rate will stagnate or grow – and that is a ticking time bomb," said Khaled Abdel Majeed, MENA fund manager at London-based SAM Capital Partners, an investment advisory firm, commenting about transfers of state funds to PIF."Doing things the 'normal' way through 'normal' channels will take more time than is available."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-rich-is-saudi-arabia-kingdom-does-the-math-in-balance-sheet-overhaul-101614098697057.html
23-02-2021||World||US treasury nominee Adeyemo urges get-tough attitude on China||Wally Adeyemo, President Joe Biden's nominee for the No. 2 job at the US Treasury, on Tuesday said Washington should work with allies to hold China accountable to international rules to ensure a level playing field for companies in the United States and elsewhere."China is our top strategic competitor," Adeyemo told a confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee."Where China is not willing to play on a level playing field, it's important that we hold them accountable in the international system," Adeyemo said, adding that taking such action with other countries would better "demonstrate to the Chinese that they're isolated when they violate the rules."Echoing comments from other Biden officials, Adeyemo struck a hardline tone on Beijing, vowing to fight what he called "unfair economic practices" in China and elsewhere, while working to rectify economic inequality at home.If confirmed as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's deputy, Adeyemo, 39, would play a key role in shaping US economic policy on issues ranging from financial regulation to relief for everyday Americans and US sanctions on foreign governments.A former senior adviser at asset manager BlackRock Inc and the child of Nigerian immigrants, Adeyemo would be the first Black deputy secretary of the Treasury. He served as a top national security and economic adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama and held senior jobs at the Treasury.Adeyemo underscored the importance of sanctions, and said Yellen had asked him to conduct a top-to-bottom review of US sanctions policy, if confirmed."Treasury's tools must play a role in responding to authoritarian governments that seek to subvert our democratic institutions; combating unfair economic practices in China and elsewhere; and detecting and eliminating terrorist organizations that seek to do us harm," he said.Treasury oversees a host of sanctioning tools, including a ban on US investment in alleged Chinese military companies that was introduced by former President Donald Trump.The ban, which has prompted market confusion since being unveiled late last year, takes effect in November and investors are eager to learn if Biden will revoke it or clarify its scope and use it to go after top Chinese firms.Adeyemo also called for targeted investments in critical US industries and technologies, and policies to protect workers and companies from anti-competitive trade practices, signaling a hardline stance on trade issues.He defended Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan, and dodged questions about concerns that its passage could trigger inflation. Adeyemo also backed Biden's plans to raise corporate tax rates, and said he would work with international partners to end "a race to the bottom" in corporate taxation.Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and other members of the committee lauded Adeyemo's qualifications. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said he expected Adeyemo to be confirmed in the job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-treasury-nominee-adeyemo-urges-get-tough-attitude-on-china-101614098663211.html
23-02-2021||World||Donald Trump may soon have to answer rape allegations under oath||During a December visit to New York City, writer E. Jean Carroll says she went shopping with a fashion consultant to find the “best outfit” for one of the most important days of her life - when she’ll sit face-to-face with the man she accuses of raping her decades ago, former President Donald Trump.The author and journalist hopes that day will come this year. Her lawyers are seeking to depose Trump in a defamation lawsuit that Carroll filed against the former president in November 2019 after he denied her accusation that he raped her at a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s. Trump said he never knew Carroll and accused her of lying to sell her new book, adding: “She’s not my type.”She plans to be there if Trump is deposed.“I am living for the moment to walk into that room to sit across the table from him,” Carroll told Reuters in an interview. “I think of it everyday.”Carroll, 77, a former Elle magazine columnist, seeks unspecified damages in her lawsuit and a retraction of Trump’s statements. It is one of two defamation cases involving sexual misconduct allegations against Trump that could move forward faster now that he has left the presidency. While in office, Trump’s lawyers delayed the case in part by arguing that the pressing duties of his office made responding to civil lawsuits impossible.“The only barrier to proceeding with the civil suits was that he’s the president,” said Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor and now an adjunct professor of clinical law at the New York University School of Law.“I think there will be a sense among the judges that it’s time to get a move on in these cases,” said Roberta Kaplan, Carroll’s attorney.An attorney for Trump and another representative of the former president did not respond to requests for comment.Trump faces a similar defamation lawsuit from Summer Zervos, a former contestant on his reality television show “The Apprentice.” In 2016, Zervos accused Trump of sexual misconduct, saying that he kissed her against her will at a 2007 meeting in New York and later groped her at a California hotel as the two met to discuss job opportunities.Trump denied the allegations and called Zervos a liar, prompting her to sue him for defamation in 2017, seeking damages and a retraction. Trump tried unsuccessfully to have the case dismissed, arguing that, as president, he was immune from suits filed in state courts. His lawyers appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, which is still considering the case. Zervos filed a motion in early February asking the court to resume the case now that Trump’s no longer president.Zervos and Carroll are among more than two dozen women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct that they say occurred in the years before he became president. Other accusers include a former model who claims Trump sexually assaulted her at the 1997 U.S. Open tennis tournament; a former Miss Universe pageant contestant who said Trump groped her in 2006; and a reporter who alleges Trump forcibly kissed her without her consent in 2005 at his Mar-a-Lago resort.Trump has denied the allegations and called them politically motivated.In September, after several unsuccessful attempts by Trump’s lawyers to get Carroll’s case dismissed or delayed, U.S. Justice Department officials under his administration took the unusual step of asking that the government be substituted for Trump as the defendant in the case. Justice Department lawyers argued that Trump, like any typical government employee, is entitled under federal law to immunity from civil lawsuits when performing his job. They argued that he was acting in his capacity as president when he said Carroll was lying.Legal experts said it was unprecedented for the Justice Department to defend a president for conduct before he took office. When Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rejected that argument, the Justice Department appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has yet to rule on it.It’s yet to be seen whether Justice Department officials under President Joe Biden, who took office last month, will continue to defend the case on Trump’s behalf. The White House and the Justice Department declined to comment.If the appeals court upholds Judge Kaplan’s decision, it would likely clear the way for Trump to be deposed by Carroll’s lawyers.UNIDENTIFIED MALE DNACarroll’s lawyers are also seeking a DNA sample from Trump. Carroll says she still has the dress she was wearing when Trump allegedly attacked her.“I hung it in my closet,” she said.Carroll said she randomly crossed paths with Trump in the Bergdorf Goodman’s store in the mid-1990s. Carroll, who hosted a TV talk show at the time, said Trump recognized her. The two chatted, she said. Trump asked her to pick out a gift for an unidentified woman, and they eventually ended up in the lingerie department. After asking her to try on a body suit, Trump closed the door in a dressing room, pinned her against a wall, unzipped his pants and sexually assaulted her, according to the complaint.Carroll said she told two friends about the alleged attack shortly after it happened, but did not report Trump to police, fearing retribution from the wealthy and well-connected businessman. Decades later, Carroll went public with her story in a June 2019 New York magazine article, adapted from a new book, “What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal.”She said she was inspired to recount the incident by the #MeToo movement, which emboldened women to share their experiences of sexual assault and harassment. In photos shot for that story, Kaplan, at the request of the magazine’s photography director, wore the same black Donna Karan dress that she said she had worn on the day that Trump allegedly assaulted her.When Carroll filed her lawsuit later in 2019, her lawyer, Kaplan, had a guard escort her to retrieve the dress from her closet for forensic testing. An analysis concluded no semen was found on the dress, but the DNA of an unidentified male was detected on the shoulder and sleeves, according to the Jan. 8, 2020 lab report, which was reviewed by Reuters.If the dress does contain traces of Trump’s DNA, it would not prove his guilt. But a match could be used as evidence that he had contact with the dress and to help disprove his claims that he never met Carroll, according to two forensic experts not involved in the case.“How his DNA got on that dress would be the argument,” said Monte Miller, a biochemist who runs a DNA analysis consultancy and previously worked at the Texas Department of Public Safety’s State Crime Laboratory. “It’s for the attorneys and the courts and everybody else to argue about why it’s there and how it got there.”Carroll said she’s confident the DNA on the dress belongs to Trump and wants her day in court. She said she now sleeps with a gun next to her bed because she has received death threats since publicly accusing Trump.“This defamation suit is not about me,” said Carroll, who meets regularly with other women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. It’s about every woman “who can’t speak up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-may-soon-have-to-answer-rape-allegations-under-oath-101614098126883.html

Governments are censoring journalists, manipulating information, attacking human rights defenders and eroding women's rights"I want to reiterate the European Union's call on China to comply with its obligations on the national and international law to respect and protect human rights including the rights of persons belonging to minorities in Xinjiang, in Tibet and in Inner Mongolia," Borrel said.He added, "Once again, we urge China to allow meaningful access to Xinjiang for independent observers including High Commissioner Bachelet. This is key to enable an independent impartial and transparent assessment of the grave concerns that the international community has."He also said that the Chinese Communist Party must respect the fundamental freedoms, the rule of law in Hong Kong amid the imposition of the draconian National Security Law."I also want to reiterate our call on China to respect fundamental freedoms, rule of law and democratic principles in Hong Kong and to ensure its high degree of autonomy under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle," he said.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community, according to a report.Meanwhile, China imposed the draconian National Security Law in Hong Kong last year.The law criminalises secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1. Since then, a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers have been arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-demands-china-for-meaningful-access-to-xinjiang-for-rights-observers-101614097854750.html

The 34-year-old was sentenced at DundeeSheriff Court after he had pleaded guilty. According to the BBC, Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told Bowes-Lyon in court that he had repeatedly ignored his victim's pleas during the attack."Even now – one year on – she still, occasionally, has nightmares and feels panicked because of being sexually assaulted by you. This has also had an impact on her emotional wellbeing," said Sheriff Carmichael.Last month, Bowes-Lyon apologised for his actions after entering his guilty plea, saying he felt "greatly ashamed" for causing "such distress to a guest in my home".He said he had "drunk to excess" on the night of the assault, although he noted that this was "no excuse" for what transpired."I did not think I was capable of behaving the way I did but have had to face up to it and take responsibility," he said outside the court."Over the last year this has involved seeking and receiving professional help as well as agreeing to plead guilty as quickly as possible. My apologies go, above all, to the woman concerned but I would also like to apologise to family, friends and colleagues for the distress I have caused them," he said.Previously, Dundee Sheriff Court heard that the woman fled the castle the morning after the attack on February 13 last year and flew home to report the matter to police, following which Police Scotland and the Metropolitan Police were involved in the investigation. Earl’s defence counsel John Scott said his client had shown "genuine remorse".Glamis Castle is the seat of the Earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne, who are both part of the family of the Queen Mother – the late mother of Queen Elizabeth II.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queens-relative-handed-10-month-jail-term-for-sexual-assault-in-uk-101614097665879.html
23-02-2021||World||US security officials cast blame for January 6 failures at Capitol||Testifying publicly for the first time about the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, former security officials say that bad intelligence was to blame for the disastrous failure to anticipate the violent intentions of the mob. That left them unprepared for the attack that was unlike anything they had ever seen before.The officials, including the former chief of the Capitol Police, are blaming other federal agencies — and each other — for their failure to defend the building as supporters of then-President Donald Trump overwhelmed security barriers, breaking windows and doors and sending lawmakers fleeing from the House and Senate chambers.Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund described a scene that was “like nothing” he had seen in his 30 years of policing.“When the group arrived at the perimeter, they did not act like any group of protestors I had ever seen," the ousted chief said, arguing that the insurrection was not the result of poor planning but of failures across the board from many agencies.Congress was hearing for the first time from Capitol security officials about the massive law enforcement failures on Jan. 6, the day the violent mob laid siege to the building and interrupted the presidential electoral count.“We must have the facts, and the answers are in this room," Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar said at the beginning of the hearing.Three of the four scheduled to testify Tuesday before two Senate committees resigned under pressure immediately after the deadly attack, including Sund.Much remains unknown about what happened before and during the assault. How much did law enforcement agencies know about plans for violence that day, many of which were public? How did the agencies share that information with each other? And how could the Capitol Police have been so ill-prepared for a violent insurrection that was organized online?Read | US Capitol security chiefs give differing accounts of January 6 riotAfter smashing through the barriers at the perimeter, the invaders engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police officers, injuring dozens of them, and broke through multiple windows and doors, sending lawmakers fleeing from the House and Senate chambers and interrupting the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Five people died as a result of the violence, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break through the doors of the House chamber with lawmakers still inside.Former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving are speaking publicly for the first time since their resignations at the hearing, which is part of a joint investigation by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Rules Committee. They are joined by Sund and Robert Contee, the acting chief of police for the Metropolitan Police Department, who sent additional officers to the scene after the rioting began.The hearing is the first of many examinations of what happened that day, coming almost seven weeks after the attack and over one week after the Senate voted to acquit former President Donald Trump of inciting the insurrection by telling his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat. Thousands of National Guard troops still surround the Capitol in a wide perimeter, cutting off streets and sidewalks that are normally full of cars, pedestrians and tourists.Congress is also considering a bipartisan, independent commission to review the missteps, and multiple congressional committees have said they will look at different aspects of the siege. Federal law enforcement have arrested more than 230 people who were accused of being involved in the attack, and President Joe Biden's nominee for attorney general, Judge Merrick Garland, said in his confirmation hearing Monday that investigating the riots would be a top priority.Congress needs to know, quickly, how failed security preparations and delays in the response led to “a mad, angry mob invading this temple of our democracy,” Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar said in an interview with The Associated Press.Klobuchar, D-Minn., said senators are especially focused on the timing of the deployment of the National Guard, which eventually arrived to help the overwhelmed police, how security agencies shared information ahead of the attack and if the command structure of the Capitol Police Board, which includes the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, contributed to the failures. She said there may be legislation to address any inadequacies.“We are on a fast track here simply because decisions have to be made about the Capitol,” Klobuchar said.Klobuchar said Tuesday’s hearing is the first of at least two public examinations of what went wrong that day as the Senate panels undertake a joint investigation into the security failures. A second hearing, expected to be held in the next few weeks, will examine the response of the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.While there is broad agreement that security measures were inadequate that day, officials have pointed the blame at each other for the causes and disputed each others’ accounts. The day after the riot, Sund said that his force “had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities.” It soon became clear that while the Capitol Police had prepared for protests, they were vastly unprepared for a violent insurrection — and many were beaten as they tried in vain to keep rioters from entering the building.Interim Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman, who has temporarily replaced Sund, last month apologized for failing to prepare despite warnings that white supremacists and far-right groups would target Congress. But she also said that Sund had asked the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the department, to declare a state of emergency beforehand and allow him to request National Guard support, but the board declined. The Defense Department has said it asked the Capitol Police if it needed the Guard, but the request was denied.A third member of the Capitol Police Board denied Pittman’s claim hours after her testimony was released. J. Brett Blanton, who serves as the architect of the Capitol, said that Sund did not ask him for help and that there was “no record of a request for an emergency declaration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-security-officials-cast-blame-for-january-6-failures-at-capitol-101614097434104.html
23-02-2021||World||UK PM Johnson suggests he left journalism because he was always abusing people in print||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested on Tuesday that he had left journalism for politics, because in his original profession he often found himself abusing people in print.Johnson, 56, has displayed a colourful, sometimes combative speaking and writing style both as a journalist and as a politician, a trait which has fuelled many controversies during his three decades in the public eye."When you're a journalist, it's a great, great job. It's a great profession. But the trouble is that you always, sometimes, you find yourself always abusing people, attacking people," he said during a visit to a school on Tuesday."Not that you want to abuse and attack them, but you are being critical. You're being critical when maybe you feel sometimes a bit guilty about that because you haven't put yourself in the place of the person you're criticising."Johnson concluded his off-the-cuff remarks by suggesting that it was those aspects of journalism that had driven him to give politics a go instead.Read | Prime minister Boris Johnson sets out plan for fully reopening UK in JuneThe opposition Labour Party said Johnson should apologise to journalists."We know from Donald Trump that these kind of assaults on the free press are dangerous and designed to stir up distrust and division," said Labour's media policy chief, lawmaker Chris Matheson."For Boris Johnson to say journalists are 'always abusing people' probably says more about his own career," he added.As a young man, Johnson was sacked from his first job in journalism, at the Times newspaper, for making up a quote.He went on to have a successful career at the Daily Telegraph, where he made his name as a Brussels correspondent lambasting the European Union in vivid if not always entirely accurate prose.He later pursued parallel media and political careers as editor of the Spectator magazine and as a member of parliament.Even in more recent years, when he has focused more on successive political jobs as mayor of London, foreign affairs minister and prime minister, he has written frequent newspaper columns in his trademark style.In the latest of a series of similar examples, he caused a major public row with a 2018 column in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-suggests-he-left-journalism-because-he-was-always-abusing-people-101614095155086.html
23-02-2021||World||French households have saved $146 Billion as Covid lockdown curtailed spendings||French households built up as much as 120 billion euros ($146 billion) in excess savings in 2020 as lockdowns curtailed spending and government aid maintained incomes, according to the Bank of France.When and how French consumers will spend the nest egg is key to determining the speed of the economic recovery after the pandemic. While there is no full lockdown in France, the prolonged closing of bars and restaurants and a nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. is keeping a lid on spending for now.With hospitalizations rising, there is little chance of an imminent lifting of restrictions.“It’s a question of confidence - that is what will transform savings into growth,” Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said Monday evening on BFM Business television.To estimate excess savings, the Bank of France compared actual savings in 2020 to the trend based on 2019 figures.The central bank also said that while there was a 217 billion euro increase in gross debt levels of non-financial companies in 2020, their cash positions also rose by 200 billion, indicating most firms are only spending a fraction of the emergency state-guaranteed loans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-households-have-saved-146-billion-as-covid-lockdown-curtailed-spendings-101614075448228.html

23-02-2021||World||Republicans working to block Biden's health care pick; Democrats unfazed||President Joe Biden’s pick for health secretary, Xavier Becerra, faces two days of contentious Senate hearings. Republicans are portraying the Californian as unfit, but Democrats are unfazed, accusing the GOP of playing politics despite the coronavirus pandemic.Now attorney general of the nation's most populous state, Becerra will be grilled by two panels. Tuesday, it's the health committee's turn, followed Wednesday by the Finance Committee, which will vote on sending Becerra's nomination to the Senate floor. If confirmed, he'd be the first Latino to head the Department of Health and Human Services, a $1.4 trillion agency with a broad portfolio that includes health insurance programs, drug safety and approvals, advanced medical research and the welfare of children.In his opening statement, Becerra said it's clear the coronavirus pandemic will be his top priority if confirmed.“The president has ambitious goals – 100 million vaccine shots in arms in his first 100 days, increasing access to testing, sequencing the virus so we’re prepared for the variants, and reopening schools and businesses. HHS has a central role in meeting these goals – safely and equitably,” he said.Becerra, 63, represented Hispanic neighborhoods of Los Angeles in the US House for more than 20 years before becoming his state's chief law enforcement officer, succeeding Vice President Kamala Harris after she won election to the Senate. His politics are liberal but his style is low-key and oriented toward problem solving. As a congressman he played a behind-the-scenes role steering President Barack Obama's health care law through Democratic divisions in the House.Republican opposition has grown louder ahead of his nomination hearings. On Monday, Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas released a letter in which they asked Biden to withdraw the nomination, calling Becerra “unfit for any position of public trust.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has called him “famously partisan.” And the political group Heritage Action for America launched a cable and digital ad campaign against Becerra.Republicans say Becerra is a radical supporter of socialized medicine, abortion and curbs on religious liberty and that he has no medical experience.Democrats are shrugging it off.Republicans are “just flailing around,” Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon said Monday. “They've done their best to try to find something that could stick in terms of their opposition, but there’s no ‘there’ there.”At a White House briefing, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Becerra is part of the team that Biden needs to execute his Covid-19 response plan.The pandemic is expected to dominate questioning at the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions hearing on Tuesday. Senators of both parties want to know about the administration's timetable for a return to near-normalcy, the progress of the vaccination campaign, the outlook for reopening schools, and the threat from more aggressive virus mutations.Becerra is expected to use as much of his time as possible to push Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan, which is on track to pass the House but faces major political and procedural challenges in the Senate.In many ways, Becerra was California’s early face of opposition to the Trump administration. He was appointed by Gov. Jerry Brown to replace Harris and took over as attorney general in early 2017 as Trump became president.Over four years, he filed 124 lawsuits, challenging the Trump administration on immigration, environmental and health care policies. His litigiousness and vocal resistance to Trump’s policies could allow Republicans to paint him as an overly partisan figure. California took pride in viewing itself as the resistance to Trump, and Becerra embodied that ethos.Democrats say he's not outside the mainstream of their party, which strongly supports women's access to abortion, and where single-payer government-run health care for all remains a popular policy position, even if Biden has made clear he doesn't support it.Lack of medical experience doesn't disqualify a nominee for HHS secretary, although it can be a plus. Recent secretaries have included one doctor but also a pharmaceutical executive, a White House budget director and three governors.Biden's pandemic response is being coordinated from the White House. While Becerra would be an important player, the administration's decision-making structure is already in place. Becerra is expected to play a central in broader health care policy issues, such as expanding insurance coverage and trying to curb prescription drug costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-working-to-block-biden-s-health-care-pick-democrats-unfazed-101614094215709.html
23-02-2021||World||US Capitol security chiefs give differing accounts of January 6 riot||The former US Capitol Police chief said the principal security officials for the House and Senate resisted calling in help from the National Guard before the Jan. 6 protests that turned into a mob assault on the building.Steven Sund, who resigned from his role as Capitol Police chief after the attack, plans to tell two Senate committees that the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, who are also testifying in the same Senate hearing, didn’t adequately prepare for the planned rally by Donald Trump’s supporters. Sund also blames the other authorities for delaying a request for backup from the National Guard once the attack was underway.The joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Rules and Administration Committees on Tuesday is the first in a series of lawmaker inquiries into the origins of the Jan. 6 insurrection and the failure of the Capitol’s security forces to anticipate and then quell the riot, which left five people dead.Sund will testify along with former Senate Sergeant-At-Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, offering conflicting and contentious recollections of how things went wrong.“We have a lot of questions,” Senator Gary Peters, the chairman of the Homeland Security panel, told reporters before the hearing. “What did they know and what did they expect? Why were they not really fully prepared to deal with what was a very large violent attack on the Capitol?”The assault on the Capitol was replayed in vivid detail at Trump’s Senate trial after he was impeached on a charge that he incited the mob. The Senate voted Feb. 13 to acquit the former president, but the bitter partisanship of the moment hasn’t dissipated, even as members of both parties are calling for a thorough examination of the riot.Two House hearings related to the riot also are scheduled this week, and retired Army Lieutenant General Russel Honoré is conducting an independent security review commissioned by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi also is proposing an independent commission, modeled on the panel that investigated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, to review the causes of the Capitol assault and the security failures surrounding it.Differing VersionsTuesday’s hearing isn’t the first time Sund has sought to shift blame to other officials.In a Feb. 1 letter to Pelosi other top House and Senate leaders, Sund also asserted that violence or threat assessments from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service and District of Columbia police were incomplete. And he said that Irving during the attack insisted on going through his chain of command, which technically includes Pelosi, to get approval to seek National Guard support, resulting in a nearly hour-long delay.Irving, the former House sergeant-at-arms, plans to offer a different version than Sund’s characterization of the events of Jan. 6. In his prepared testimony for Tuesday’s hearing, Irving says he doesn’t have any record of Sund’s call and request to call in help from the National Guard that afternoon.However, Irving does plan to day he agrees with Sund’s assessment that Capitol officials didn’t have all the information they needed to prepare.“The intelligence was not that there would be a coordinated assault on the Capitol, nor was that contemplated in any of the inter-agency discussions that I attended in the days before the attack,” Irving plans to tell the committees, according to his written remarks.Jan. 6 CommissionAny disagreement between the officials testifying Tuesday could feed into partisan narratives about who is to blame.Democrats and Republicans are haggling over the composition of the independent commission that Pelosi has proposed. Republicans have objected to a Democratic proposals for 11-seat panel that would give seven seats to Democratic appointees -- including three to be named by President Joe Biden -- and four to Republicans. GOP leaders want the panel evenly divided.Separately, some House Republicans have seized on Sund’s Feb. 1 letter to demand answers from Pelosi on her role in planning for Jan. 6 and the responses to the violence that day. Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, has dismissed that as a “transparently partisan attempt“ to lay blame on the speaker while ignoring the role of Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who appointed Stenger.This week, there are two more House hearings related to the Jan. 6 riot -- including one involving testimony from the acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman and House Sergeant at Arms Timothy Blodgett on Thursday. Both of them already have testified in a closed hearing before the House Appropriations Committee.Capitol Police officers are still reeling from the attack that left one officer dead and 140 Capitol and Metropolitan Police officers injured. A member of the Capitol force and a D.C. police officer committed suicide after the assault.D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee is a fourth witnesses invited to answer questions at the hearing Tuesday.David Schanzer, a terrorism and homeland security expert at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, said politically divisive hearings in Congress could get in the way of any independent attempt at fact-finding.“Sometimes public hearings that are held very close to an event without a lot of time and effort putting into the foundations of an investigation beforehand -- collecting documents, document review, interviewing lots of witnesses -- can tend to be more about political theater than getting to the ground truth,” he said.He said a bipartisan independent commission can have more credibility and “can take more time outside the cauldron of open, televised hearing to do the ground truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-security-chiefs-give-differing-accounts-of-january-6-riot-101614093565886.html

While governments around the world gradually lifted restrictions on the entry of foreigners, many of them announced their own set of requirements that inbound travellers must fulfil to board a plane.The IATA sees the digital travel pass, a mobile app developed by the association, as an essential tool for the reopening of international borders without having the risk of importing the infectious disease. Several airlines, including Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Air New Zealand, are conducting trials of IATA travel pass in an attempt to seamlessly manage the digital travel documentation of passengers."We are currently working with a number of airlines worldwide and learning from these pilots. And the plan is to go live in March," Vinoop Goel, IATA’s regional director of airports and external relations, told BBC. “So basically we expect to have a fully functional working system over the next few weeks.”Here’s all you need to know about the IATA travel pass:The travel pass is a standardised solution to validate and authenticate all country regulations regarding passenger travel requirements related to Covid-19.The global registry of health requirements will enable passengers to find accurate information on travel, testing and vaccine requirements for their journey.The trial app includes a global registry of testing centres and labs at the departure and/or arrival location which can conduct Covid-19 tests in accordance with the type of test required for the journey.Read | Vaccination passport: Air New Zealand to trial digital travel pass amid Covid-19The app will enable passengers to create a ‘digital passport’, verify their test/vaccination meets the regulations, and share test or vaccination certificates with authorities to facilitate travel.The travel pass communicates with governments, airlines, and test centres/vaccination providers to get verified information to those who need it.The IATA travel pass will be free for passengers to download and use on their iOS as well as Android platforms.According to IATA, the travel pass does store any data centrally and simply links entities that need verification with the test or vaccination data only when travellers authorise it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iata-expects-to-roll-out-covid-travel-pass-within-weeks-all-you-need-to-know-101614092512761.html

23-02-2021||World||In year of pandemic, Home Depot became supplier to millions||The housing market was among the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in the year of the lockdown and Home Depot became its supplier, racking up an unprecedented $132 billion in sales for 2020.Sales grew even stronger in the final quarter of the year, surging 25% to $32.26 billion. That is up from $25.78 billion in the same period last year and exceeded even the lofty projections for $30.66 billion on Wall Street, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research.Home improvement stores became a beehive during the pandemic with millions working and attending school remotely. Many families concluded that bigger homes, or at least different homes, were the answer in 2020. The U.S. Commerce Department has estimated that 811,000 new homes were sold in 2020, up nearly 19% from the previous year.While Home Depot was not alone in meeting the resulting demand for hammers, paint or appliances, the sheer volume of goods sold this year were staggering.Attempting to put it into context, Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, calculated that in 2020 the equivalent of every single person in the United States spent $402 at Home Depot.“It is easy to look at Home Depot’s numbers and chalk up its success to the pandemic,” Saunders said Tuesday. “However, sustaining three quarters of growth above 20% is extremely difficult in terms of the pressure it puts on the whole operation from supply chains to stores.”Global sales at stores open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer's health, climbed 24.5%, and by 25% if only U.S. stores are counted.Home Depot Inc. earned $2.86 billion, or $2.65 per diluted share, for the three months ended Jan. 31 compared with $2.48 billion, or $2.28 per diluted share, a year earlier.Earnings, adjusted for costs related to mergers and acquisitions, were $2.74 per share. That handily beat the $2.63 per share Wall Street was calling for.The Atlanta company on Tuesday said that it was not providing annual guidance for the year, citing the uncertainty of the pandemic. Given the huge numbers Home Depot put up in 2020, that dispirited investors, and shares fell more than 2% before the opening bell.However, in a show of confidence, the nation’s biggest home improvement chain boosted its quarterly dividend 10%, to $1.65 per share.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-year-of-pandemic-home-depot-became-supplier-to-millions-101614088452718.html
23-02-2021||World||Britons rush to book holidays amid plans to end lockdown||Stir-crazy Britons rushed to book overseas vacations after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled plans to slowly ease a national lockdown, boosting optimism that travel restrictions will be removed in time for the summer holiday season.TUI, the UK’s largest tour operator said bookings increased six-fold on Monday, the company’s busiest day in more than a month. Discount airline easyJet said demand for flights more than tripled, and package holiday company Thomas Cook said traffic on its website increased 75%. International travel has nearly ground to a halt globally, so the increases are a sign of hope for the beleaguered industry.“We have consistently seen that there is pent-up demand for travel, and this surge in bookings shows that this signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what U.K. consumers have been waiting for,” easyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said in a statement. “The Prime Minister’s address has provided a much-needed boost in confidence for so many of our customers in the U.K.”While the plans, which Johnson announced Monday, were welcomed by travel companies, many business leaders were disappointed at the slow pace of re-opening as some restrictions are expected to remain in place until June 21. Others criticized the government for failing to guarantee current levels of support for businesses hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.The Office for National Statistics said Tuesday that the U.K.’s unemployment rate rose to 5.1% in December, up 0.1% from the previous month and 1.3% from a year earlier. The number of people on company payrolls has dropped by 726,000 since the pandemic began last February, with 58.5% of the decline coming among people under 25.But the figures don’t show the full impact of COVID-19 restrictions. Some 1.9 million workers remain on furlough, a government program that covers 80% of the wages for people who aren’t working but remain on their employer’s payroll.“The sheer longevity of the crisis is taking its toll on firms, and young people in particular who have borne the brunt of jobs losses,” said Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on improving conditions for low-income people. The government “will need to address this in next week’s budget by both extending emergency support to firms while restrictions are still with us, and announcing fresh stimulus to power Britain’s economic recovery.”Airlines and hospitality businesses have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, with restrictions all but shutting down international travel and closing pubs and restaurants for much of the past year.The government is now considering the possibility of introducing some type of “COVID status certification” to give business owners and consumers confidence about the safety of reopening theaters, restaurants and other venues this year.So-called vaccine passports, which could include information on whether a person has been vaccinated and recent COVID-19 test results, raise difficult questions about privacy in Britain, which doesn’t have a tradition of national identification cards.“There are deep and complex issues that we need to explore, and ethical issues about what the role is for government in mandating for people to have such a thing,’’ Johnson said Tuesday after visiting a school. “We can’t be discriminatory against people who, for whatever reason, can’t have the vaccine … I think everybody should have a vaccine, but we need to thrash all this out.”Britain has had Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with more than 120,000 deaths attributed to the disease.Faced with a new variant of the virus that scientists say is both more transmissible and more deadly than the original, the country has spent much of the winter under a tight lockdown, the third since March 2020.Schools, bars, restaurants, gyms, hair salons and nonessential shops are closed, people are expected to stay at home except for exercise and essential shopping, and foreign holidays are banned.But Johnson announced plans to ease those restrictions as the rapid rollout of vaccines helps drive down new infections and hospitalizations.On March 8, children in England go back to school and people will be allowed to meet one friend or relative for a chat or outdoor picnic. Three weeks later, people will be able to meet in small groups outdoors for sports or relaxation.Under the government plan, shops and hairdressers will reopen April 12.

23-02-2021||World||Nepal's Supreme Court orders reinstatement of Parliament||Nepal’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the reinstatement of Parliament after it was dissolved by the prime minister, in a ruling likely to thrust the Himalayan nation into a political crisis.The order came in response to several cases filed with the court charging that Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli's decision to dissolve the legislature was unconstitutional. The court said a meeting of the reinstated Parliament must be called within 13 days.The order will cause political trouble for Oli since he will not have a majority of votes in a reinstated Parliament.Since Parliament's dissolution in December, there have been regular street protests against Oli by tens of thousands of people in Kathmandu and other cities.Oli decided to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections because of an escalating feud within his governing Nepal Communist Party.He became prime minister after the party won elections three years ago. Oli’s party and the party of former Maoist rebels had merged to form a strong Communist party to win the elections.However, there has been a power struggle between Oli and the leader of the former Maoists rebels, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also co-chair of the party. The two had previously agreed that they would split the five-year prime minister’s term between them, but Oli has refused to allow Dahal to take over.A splinter group led by Dahal is organizing the street protests and his supporters are among those who filed cases with the Supreme Court.Other opposition parties have repeatedly accused Oli’s government of corruption, and his administration has faced criticism over its handling of the coronavirus.Oli also has been accused of moving closer to China and drifting away from Nepal’s traditional partner, India, since taking power. This has caused problems between India and Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-top-court-orders-reinstatement-of-parliament-court-official-101614088465946.html

A German interior ministry spokesman said he was not aware of the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-tried-to-intimidate-hong-kong-activists-in-germany-berlin-says-101614086054488.html
23-02-2021||World||Iran stops snap nuclear inspections, state-run daily urges caution||An Iranian government newspaper warned on Tuesday that overly radical actions in the nuclear wrangling with the West may lead to the country's isolation after Tehran ended snap inspections by United Nations inspectors.Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Kazem Gharibabadi, said it had ended implementation of the so-called Additional Protocol at midnight (2030 GMT) on Monday. The agreement allowed the IAEA to carry out short-notice inspections.The state-run daily newspaper Iran criticised hardline lawmakers who protested on Monday at Tehran’s decision to permit “necessary” monitoring by U.N. inspectors for up to three months, saying this broke a law passed by parliament in an apparent effort to pressure the United States to lift sanctions.The law requires ending snap inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog from Tuesday if sanctions are not lifted."Those who say Iran must take swift tough action on the nuclear accord should say what guarantee there is that Iran will not be left alone as in the past... and will this end anywhere other than helping build a consensus against Iran?" the daily Iran said.To create room for diplomacy, the U.N. watchdog IAEA on Sunday reached a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of Tehran’s reduced cooperation and refusal to permit short-notice inspections.On Monday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran might enrich uranium up to 60% purity if the country needed it, while repeating a denial of any Iranian intent to seek nuclear weapons.Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers, which it has been breaching since the United States withdrew in 2018, caps the fissile purity to which Tehran can refine uranium at 3.67%, well under the 20% achieved before the agreement and far below the 90% suitable for a nuclear weapon.A U.S. State Department spokesman said Khamenei's comments "sounds like a threat" but reiterated U.S. willingness to engage in talks with Iran about returning to the 2015 nuclear deal.Washington said last week it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the accord abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump.Tehran said last week it was studying a European Union proposal for an informal meeting between current members of the deal and the United States, but has yet to respond to it.Iran, which has resumed enriching to 20% in an apparent bid to heap pressure on the United States, has been at loggerheads with Washington over which side should take the initial step to revive the accord.Iranian leaders insist Washington must end its punitive campaign first to restore the deal, while Washington says Tehran must first return to full compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-stops-snap-nuclear-inspections-state-run-daily-urges-caution-101614062163658.html
23-02-2021||World||French researchers trial more accurate fast Covid-19 test||French researchers are using tiny antibody particles extracted from the family of animals that includes camels and llamas to produce a test they say can detect if patients have Covid-19 faster and more accurately than existing methods.The prototype test, called CorDial-1, has not been approved for use, but initial trials on 300 samples showed a 90% accuracy rate compared to a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, the most reliable commonly-used method of detecting Covid-19.The prototype test can deliver results within 10 minutes, and can be used outside the laboratory, according to the team developing it, while PCR testing typically takes hours and needs lab conditions.There are other quick and portable Covid-19 tests available, but scientists have raised doubts about their reliability.The CorDial-1 test uses antibody fragments called nanobodies. They are derived from camelids -- a group that includes camels, dromedaries, llamas and alpacas -- because they are more stable than antibodies from other creatures.For the Covid-19 test, the nanobodies are grafted onto the surface of an electrode. When those nanobodies come into contact with the "spike" protein of the Covid-19 virus, they interact to produce a change in the electrical current across the electrode.When the testing apparatus -- a device the size of a large USB stick -- is plugged into a smartphone, the current shows up as a signal on a graph."Depending on the height of the signal, you can say if you are Covidpositive or negative," said Sabine Szunerits, of the University of Lille, who is working on the project with scientists at the University of Marseille and the French National Centre for Scientific Research.The next phase of the project is to run a three-month trial on more than 1,000 people.Christophe Demaille, lead researcher in molecular electrochemistry at the University of Paris, who is not involved in the project, said tests that rely on electrical signals are highly portable."I am confident it will be usable anywhere," he said of the CorDial-1 project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-researchers-trial-more-accurate-fast-covid-19-test-101614074909125.html

Here’s why||England chief medical officer Chris Whitty on Monday said that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is likely to remain a problem for the "next few winters" despite aggressive vaccination drive. The United Kingdom has administered more than 18 million doses with over 27 doses per 100 people, one of the highest in the world, and is expecting the end of all Covid-19 restrictions in England on June 21.However, the chief medical officer warned that the virus can still cause a significant number of fatalities as other respiratory diseases, for which vaccines are available, continue to cause deaths. He said that Covid-19 is going to be added to the list of diseases that puts vulnerable individuals at risk despite vaccination.“This is something that we have to see for the long term and, in my view, is likely to be a problem in particular during the winter for the next few winters,” he said. “We vaccinate against flu, we vaccinate against pneumococcal pneumonia and still there are cases and there are deaths.”Read | UK PM Boris Johnson optimistic of June 21 lockdown endMeanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johson has said that he is optimistic about the June 21 date earmarked to lift the Covid-19 restrictions amid concern over virus variants. "I'm hopeful, but obviously nothing can be guaranteed...I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to get there," Johnson told broadcasters.Over 212 million vaccine doses to provide immunity against Covid-19 have been administered, so far, in at least 107 countries and territories, according to Our World in Data. The United States, which has reported more than 28 million Covid-19 cases and over 500,000 related deaths, is the front runner of the vaccination drive in terms of absolute numbers. The worst-hit nation has administered more than 64 million vaccine doses, with nearly 20 doses per 100 people.

Tasnim reported that Khamenei answered a question posed by the news agency asking if observing compulsory hijab is necessary for characters in animated features.“Although wearing hijab in such a hypothetical situation is not required per se, observing hijab in animation is required due to the consequences of not wearing a hijab,” Khamenei said according to the report.A fatwa is a declaration or ruling on a point of Islamic law, which is not legally binding but is given by a recognised higher authority.Read more: Saudi women can join armed forces in latest widening of rightsPolitical activists in Iran condemned the fatwa, calling it 'toxic'. Iranian journalist and activist Masih Alinejad wrote on Twitter: “This isn't a joke! The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran has announced women even in animations should wear hijab. Even female insects like bees have their hijabs on! Their obsession with the hair of female anything is toxic. These people are in power in Iran.”Academic Arash Azizi also criticised the decision. “In case you thought the Grand Ayatollah Khamenei wasn't focused on core issues of interest for Iran and Iranians,” Azizi tweeted.This kind of fatwa is not new in Iran as women in the country have faced persecution for not wearing a hijab before as well. Under Islamic law in force in Iran since the 1979 revolution, women must wear a hijab that covers the head and neck, thus concealing their hair. Violators are publicly admonished, fined or even arrested, often targeted by Iran's 'morality police’, also known as the "Gasht-e Ershad."Read more: Trans-people welcome the decision for separate toilets, but need gender-neutral toiletsUltra-conservative figures have also called for the end of foreign films being shown in theatres in Iran about which Khamenei himself has said that programs broadcast from the West led to 'misleading thoughts and factual misrepresentations'.Iran also has strict censorship laws in place on the country's film industry. Physical interactions between men and women on screen are banned and all scenes deemed immoral or offensive to the regime are often censored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/female-tv-cartoon-characters-must-wear-hijab-iran-s-khamenei-decrees-101614083700859.html

Shortly after the attack on Dec. 6, 2019, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz condemned it a "heinous crime" and said it "does not represent the Saudi people."Three US sailors were killed in the attack. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later found cellphone evidence linking the gunman, Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, to the militant group al Qaeda, the US attorney general said.Alshamrani, a Royal Saudi Air Force trainee who was shot dead by a deputy sheriff, was on the base as part of a US Navy training program designed to foster links with foreign allies."None of the Royal Saudi Air Force trainees at the scene of the attack reported Al-Shamrani's behavior nor did they try to stop the NAS Terrorist Attack. Because they supported it", the lawsuit alleged.US President Joe Biden's administration has signalled a tougher stance on Saudi Arabia after mostly warm relations between former President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Biden, who took office last month, has declared a halt to US support for a Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen and demanded an end to the war in Yemen, which is widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran.The Biden White House has also been putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to improve its record on human rights, including the release of political prisoners from jails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-sued-by-families-of-victims-of-2019-florida-base-attack-101614083534760.html

Though the rate of its spread has slowed down in recent months - due to vaccines etc - one thing that has stood as a wall to keep everyone safe from the infection is face mask.Health experts across the world, including from the World Health Organzation (WHO), are advising people to continue wearing masks; many states in India are penalising people for not wearing masks.But in United States, the country worst-affected by Covid-19, a restaurant has sparked outrage on social media for its contoversial policy.“FACE DIAPERS NOT REQUIRED! EVERYONE WELCOME,” declares the sign at BeckyJack’s Food Shack in Florida. The image was posted by the restaurant on its Facebook page on Valentine's Day with the following post: "Howdy Folks! Happy Valentine's Day. A friendly reminder that we DO NOT require Face Masks."Since then, the post has been shared 1,000 times and elicited 3,800 comments on the social media platform.Some of the people who commented on the post early, said they love the restaurant and its food. "Love your restaurant and food!!! Thank you! We will be by soon," said Kristine Rowles Pepe.In fact, a few appreciated the post. "So glad you’re giving people the choice to wear or not wear a mask. Just like they have a choice to go or not go to your restaurant. I think we are all capable of making our own decisions when it comes to our health. Unfortunately there are those that think we need those decisions made for us!!" commented Ronda Shrigley Alley."This is fabulous! We will definitely be dining here!! Thank you for having common sense," said another user Troy Christine Woest.But others were aghast, calling the post a "cheap publicity stunt"."Enjoy your infamy while you can. Cheap publicity stunts are awesome. Team sports obviously not a thing your way. If you're locals feel sitting side by side without distancing and limited seating is cool, again, enjoy," said Adam Mullikin."Sad that egregious personal choice Trumps science based social responsibility," John Dvoracek said in his comment. Others also said that "people like these are the reason we’re still in a pandemic".After the uproar on social media, the restaurant defended its poster and in a follow-up post, asked those who are hurt by the post to "unfriend them"."My email address is right here on our page. Y'all know me. Okay some do, the rest of Y'all have no clue where Weeki Wachee is. Yes we do not require facemasks and yes we think of them as diapers. We strive to be transparent. And to our friends.. unfriend us now because being our friend will hurt you," the post on February 16 said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-restaurant-calls-masks-face-diapers-uproar-on-social-media-101614080009785.html
23-02-2021||World||Time for Jeep to end use of tribe's name: Cherokee chief||It is time for Jeep to stop using the Cherokee Nation's name on its Cherokee and Grand Cherokee SUVs, the chief of the Oklahoma-based tribe said.Chief Chuck Hoskin, Jr. said in a statement first reported by Car & Driver magazine that he believes corporations and sports teams should stop using Native American names, images and mascots as nicknames or on their products.“I’m sure this comes from a place that is well-intended, but it does not honor us by having our name plastered on the side of a car," Hoskin said.Kristin Starnes, a spokeswoman for Jeep’s parent company, Amsterdam-based Stellantis, said in a statement that the vehicle name was carefully selected “and nurtured over the years to honor and celebrate Native American people for their nobility, prowess and pride." She didn't say whether the company was considering renaming the vehicles and didn't immediately reply to an email requesting that information.Hoskin says the best way to honor the Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe is to learn more about its history.“The best way to honor us is to learn about our sovereign government, our role in this country, our history, culture and language and have meaningful dialogue with federally recognized tribes on cultural appropriateness," Hoskin said.The controversy comes amid a national reckoning over the use of Native American names and images, particularly in sports.After years of resistance and under pressure from corporate sponsors, the NFL's Washington, D.C., franchise announced last year that it was dropping its “Redskins” nickname and Indian head logo and would go by the name Washington Football Team until a permanent replacement was chosen. Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians also announced last year that it would change its name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-jeep-to-end-use-of-tribe-s-name-cherokee-chief-101614079678522.html
23-02-2021||World||Biden-Trudeau talks on Tuesday seek to ease strained relations||President Joe Biden will seek to repair relations with Canada that have been strained by disputes over trade and an oil pipeline as he meets virtually with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday.The two leaders plan to unveil a road map on how to improve cooperation on a range of topics, from global alliances to the coronavirus, according to a senior US official, who requested anonymity to preview the meeting.As part of that effort, Biden and Trudeau will announce a forthcoming ministerial meeting on climate and the resumption of the Cross-Border Crime Forum, an annual gathering of top law enforcement officials from each country to examine ways to collaborate on counterterrorism and efforts to combat smuggling, and organized crime.There are also plans for additional announcements related to Canada coming this week from the US State Department and Department of Transportation according to the official, who didn’t discuss the substance of those plans.The meeting, set for late afternoon, comes at a time when Canadians have become increasingly uncertain about where they stand with their closest ally. After four years of bruising trade battles with Donald Trump, the Biden administration already has canceled a permit for TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL oil pipeline and threatened new “Buy American” provisions for government procurement contracts.But the White House is hoping to improve the tenor of relations with a coronavirus-era variation of the longstanding tradition of the US. president making his first foreign trip to Canada.Traditional Talks, Virtual VersionWhite House officials have said it would likely be months until Biden could hold in-person meetings with foreign leaders, but the two leaders will try to approximate the beats of a traditional gathering.Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will meet with their Canadian counterparts in a virtual session designed to get as close as possible to a traditional Oval Office meeting between world leaders.After about 45 minutes of conversation, an expanded group -- which will include Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and White House economic and coronavirus advisers -- will meet for broader discussions. After the private meetings, the leaders are expected to deliver joint remarks to reporters.“I look forward to renewing the strong friendship between the United States and Canada and working to tackle the shared challenges we face,” Biden tweeted over the weekend.Jobs, Climate ChangeTrudeau tweeted that the conversation would “focus on ending the pandemic, growing the middle class and creating jobs, and fighting climate change.”Relations between the US and Canada are expected to improve under the Biden administration, with the new American president more closely aligned with Trudeau’s Liberals across a series of policy initiatives. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday she expected Biden to “highlight the strong and deep partnership between the United States and Canada as neighbors, friends, and NATO allies.”Still, some areas of discussion could prove thornier. Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline -- linking oil-rich Alberta to Nebraska -- on his first day in office, saying the project isn’t “consistent with my administration’s economic and climate imperatives.”Trudeau has called the project -- which would have shipped more than 800,000 barrels of crude a day from Alberta’s oil sands to US refineries -- a key priority, and voiced his concern over the cancellation in a telephone call with Biden last month. The Canadian Parliament last week agreed to establish a committee to study he economic relationship between the two countries. And Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has called for retaliatory economic sanctions on the US over Biden’s move, though that effort has gained little traction.Officials in both Ottawa and Washington said they don’t expect the pipeline to play a major role in Tuesday’s talks -- a tacit acknowledgment that neither side appears likely to relent -- though they do expect the topic to be raised.‘Buy American’Trudeau may also press Biden on another early executive action: his “Buy American” order that strengthened requirements for federal spending, clamping down on contractors’ use of foreign suppliers. That could spell trouble for Canadian suppliers who sell to American companies that contract with the federal government.Trudeau is expected to seek waivers similar to those granted during the Obama administration to help protect Canadian businesses. But Psaki said Monday that although the administration is reviewing its procurement procedures under the executive order, it doesn’t anticipate making changes.Canada is also likely to again seek US assistance in pressuring China to release former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, who were detained in 2018 after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese executive with Huawei Technologies Co. The US has sought the extradition of Meng -- who is the daughter of the company’s founder -- to try her on fraud charges. Her extradition case remains pending in Canadian courts.Because Biden made a priority of the bilateral talks with Canada as the first such event since he took office, the discussions can be seen as the new president extending a peace offering, according to Sarah Goldfeder, a former US diplomat.“This is the Biden administration acknowledging they need to do better on the relationship with Canada,” said Goldfeder, a principal at government relations firm Earnscliffe Strategy Group in Ottawa and a former special assistant to US ambassadors to Canada.“It’s scaffolding to build on later,” Goldfeder said, adding she doesn’t expect there to be a lot of “deliverables or work done.”For Biden, she said, “This is a way of being nice and re-instituting that relationship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidentrudeau-talks-on-tuesday-seek-to-ease-strained-relations-101614077733311.html
23-02-2021||World||Paris raps Pakistan over Alvi's remarks on French Muslims||The French foreign ministry has summoned Pakistan's envoy to protest claims by President Arif Alvi that a French bill cracking down on radical Islam stigmatises Muslims.Addressing a conference on religion on Saturday, Alvi said: "When you see that laws are being changed in favour of a majority to isolate a minority, that is a dangerous precedent."Specifically referring to the legislation drafted after the beheading of a French teacher by an Islamist radical over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, Alvi said: "When you insult the Prophet, you insult all Muslims."I urge the political leadership of France not to entrench these attitudes into laws... You have to bring people together -- not to stamp a religion in a certain manner and create disharmony among the people or create bias."Pakistan was one of several Muslim countries that saw angry anti-French protests in October over President Emmanuel Macron's defence of the right to show cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed.The country with the second-largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia does not have an ambassador in France.The French foreign ministry said late Monday it had called in Pakistan's charge d'affaires to mark "our surprise and our disapproval (over Alvi's remarks), given that the bill contains no discriminatory element."Read | French Assembly passes bill aiming to curb 'a rise in Islamism'- 'Constructive attitude' -"It is guided by the basic principles of freedom of religion and conscience, makes no distinction between the different religions and applies therefore equally to all faiths," the ministry said."Pakistan must understand this and adopt a constructive attitude for our bilateral relations," it added.The bill adopted by the lower house of the French parliament last week is dubbed the "anti-separatism" bill in reference to Macron's claim that Islamists are closing themselves off from French society by refusing to embrace secularism, gender equality and other French values.The legislation significantly expands the state's powers to close religious organisations and places of worship if they are found to air "theories or ideas" that "provoke hate or violence towards a person or people."It also creates a new crime of "separatism" -- described as threatening a public servant in order to gain "a total or partial exemption or different application of the rules" -- that is punishable by up to five years in prison.Pakistan's government has been particularly virulent in its condemnation of Macron's clampdown on radical Islam, which follow a wave of attacks that have killed over 250 people.Prime Minister Imran Khan in October accused Macron on Sunday of "attacking Islam" and chosing to "encourage Islamophobia" for defending the right to publish cartoons of Mohammed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-raps-pakistan-over-alvi-remarks-on-french-muslims-101614077721023.html

Thales, known as Thompson-CSF in 1999, has consistently said it has no knowledge of any transgressions having been committed by any of its employees in relation to the awarding of the contracts.The pre-trial hearing, which was broadcast on local television, began on Tuesday after it was postponed in December.Zuma was not present for the hearing.The case is ready to go to trial, the Pietermaritzburg High Court said, and asked all accused to be present on May 17 provided COVID-19 restrictions allow representatives of the French company to fly to the country.The trial will last from May until June, the court said.In another case, a South African inquiry into corruption during Zuma's time as president is seeking his imprisonment for two years, after he defied an order from the country's top court to appear and give evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/corruption-trial-against-south-african-ex-president-jacob-zuma-to-start-in-may-101614076183997.html

It oversees the immigration processes and helps migrants as well as asylum seekers to settle in the country.INZ’s deputy head Catriona Robinson said they have to adapt to New Zealand’s Covid-19 economic recovery as well as focus on the changing work environments.“INZ has made the difficult decision to close our offices in Mumbai, Manila and Pretoria by March 2021 and bring more visa processing onshore. This is not a decision that we have made lightly. Our staff in these offices have made a significant contribution to INZ and New Zealand. However, these offices have been closed since March 2020 and with no certainty about when visa volumes may return to normal, INZ has had to make some tough decisions,” Robinson said.She said that it will gradually withdraw visa processing from its Beijing office and ‘strengthen its risk and verification presence.’ “The Beijing office reopened in September 2020 and is currently processing visa applications for individuals who are already in New Zealand. The timing of the withdrawal of visa processing from Beijing will depend on a number of factors including visa volumes and changes to New Zealand’s border restrictions. INZ will continue to monitor this over the next six months,” Robinson said in the statement.The statement pointed out that more than 300 employees will be affected by the closing down of the offices. New Zealand has been very restrictive about allowing people from entering the country due to the pandemic. A report on New Zealand-based news website, stuff.co.nz. said that INZ’s offshore offices have been closed since March 2020 after the Ardern-led government declared a Covid-19 lockdown.New Zealand reported three fresh cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern had lifted the temporary lockdown in Auckland last week, which was imposed after a family of three - two adults and a child - were diagnosed with the more transmissible UK variant of coronavirus. Health authorities had conducted more than 70,000 tests to ensure that there was no community transmission before lifting the lockdown. The island nation also rolled out its Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-to-shut-its-immigration-offices-in-mumbai-pretoria-and-manila-101614076882475.html
23-02-2021||World||Iran imposes curbs on UN nuclear inspections: State TV||Iran officially has begun restricting international inspections of its nuclear facilities, state TV reported Tuesday, a bid to pressure European countries and US President Joe Biden's administration to lift crippling economic sanctions and restore the 2015 nuclear deal.The state TV report gave little detail beyond confirming that Iran had made good on its threat to reduce cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.“The law has gone into effect from this morning,” said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, reiterating that Iran would no longer share surveillance footage of its nuclear facilities with the UN agency.“We never gave them live video, but (recordings) were given daily and weekly,” Zarif said of the IAEA's access to information recorded by camera monitors. “The tape recording of our (nuclear) program will be kept in Iran.”The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Tehran’s civilian nuclear agency, has promised to preserve the tapes for three months, then hand it over to the IAEA — but only if granted sanctions relief. Otherwise, Iran has vowed to erase the tapes.Iran announced its plans to cease implementation of the so-called “Additional Protocol,” a confidential agreement between Tehran and the IAEA reached as part of the landmark nuclear accord. The agreement grants the UN inspectors enhanced powers to visit nuclear facilities and watch Iran’s program.Nearly three years ago, former US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear accord and reimposed sanctions on Iran that have squeezed its economy.To create leverage over Washington, Iran has announced gradual breaches of the 2015 agreement over recent weeks. The country has started enriching uranium up to 20% purity, a technical step away from weapons-grade levels, as well as spinning advanced centrifuges and producing uranium metal.In a show of defiance, Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei outlined further developments in Iran's nuclear program on Tuesday. Over the last three weeks, he told reporters, Iran has installed an additional 148 high-tech IR2-m centrifuges at its Natanz nuclear enrichment facility and its fortified nuclear complex at Fordo, bringing the total number of centrifuges to up to 492. Another set of 492 centrifuges will be installed in the coming month, he said.He added that Iran has installed two cascades of even more advanced centrifuges at its nuclear enrichment facilities, but did not specify where.On Monday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also signaled Iran would refuse to capitulate to US pressure over its nuclear program. Khamenei said that Iran could enrich uranium up to 60% purity if necessary, but stressed the country forbids nuclear weapons. Tehran has long insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, such as power generation and medical research.The Biden administration has said it’s ready to join talks with Iran and world powers to discuss a return to the deal. Zarif responded to the overture cautiously on Tuesday, saying that Iran is “assessing the idea of an unofficial meeting" with the parties to the accord “in which America is invited as a non-member.”Tuesday's escalation followed IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi's emergency weekend trip to Tehran to negotiate the inspection restrictions. As part of a temporary deal, Grossi said the agency would maintain the same number of inspectors on the ground.But Iran's curbs would affect inspectors' ability to conduct so-called “snap” inspections of nuclear sites, Grossi said. Iran blocking access to IAEA cameras also means the agency can’t monitor Iranian actions when those inspectors aren’t physically at a site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-imposes-curbs-on-un-nuclear-inspections-state-tv-101614076160059.html
23-02-2021||World||US Congress to question US Capitol security officials on Jan 6 siege||Congress is set to hear from former US Capitol security officials for the first time about the massive law enforcement failures on Jan. 6, the day a violent mob laid siege to the building and interrupted the presidential electoral count.Three of the four scheduled to testify Tuesday before two Senate committees resigned under pressure immediately after the deadly attack, including the former head of the Capitol Police.Much remains unknown about what happened before and during the assault, and lawmakers are expected to aggressively question the former officials about what went wrong. How much did law enforcement agencies know about plans for violence that day, many of which were public? How did the agencies share that information with each other? And how could the Capitol Police have been so ill-prepared for a violent insurrection that was organized online, in plain sight?The rioters easily smashed through security barriers on the outside of the Capitol, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police officers, injuring dozens of them, and broke through multiple windows and doors, sending lawmakers fleeing from the House and Senate chambers and interrupting the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Five people died as a result of the violence, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break through the doors of the House chamber with lawmakers still inside.Former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving will speak publicly for the first time since their resignations at the hearing, which is part of a joint investigation by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Rules Committee. They will be joined by former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund and Robert Contee, the acting chief of police for the Metropolitan Police Department, who sent additional officers to the scene after the rioting began.The hearing is expected to be the first of many examinations of what happened that day, coming almost seven weeks after the attack and over one week after the Senate voted to acquit former President Donald Trump of inciting the insurrection by telling his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat. Thousands of National Guard troops still surround the Capitol in a wide perimeter, cutting off streets and sidewalks that are normally full of cars, pedestrians and tourists.Congress is also considering a bipartisan, independent commission to review the missteps, and multiple congressional committees have said they will look at different aspects of the siege. Federal law enforcement have arrested more than 230 people who were accused of being involved in the attack, and President Joe Biden's nominee for attorney general, Judge Merrick Garland, said in his confirmation hearing Monday that investigating the riots would be a top priority.Congress needs to know, quickly, how failed security preparations and delays in the response led to “a mad, angry mob invading this temple of our democracy,” Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar said in an interview with The Associated Press.Klobuchar, D-Minn., said senators will be especially focused on the timing of the deployment of the National Guard, which eventually arrived to help the overwhelmed police, how security agencies shared information ahead of the attack and if the command structure of the Capitol Police Board, which includes the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, contributed to the failures. She said there may be legislation to address any inadequacies.“We are on a fast track here simply because decisions have to be made about the Capitol,” Klobuchar said.Klobuchar said Tuesday’s hearing will be the first of at least two public examinations of what went wrong that day as the Senate panels undertake a joint investigation into the security failures. A second hearing, expected to be held in the next few weeks, will examine the response of the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.While there is broad agreement that security measures were inadequate that day, officials have pointed the blame at each other for the causes and disputed each others’ accounts. The day after the riot, Sund said that his force “had a robust plan established to address anticipated First Amendment activities.” It soon became clear that while the Capitol Police had prepared for protests, they were vastly unprepared for a violent insurrection — and many were beaten as they tried in vain to keep rioters from entering the building.Interim Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman, who has temporarily replaced Sund, last month apologized for failing to prepare despite warnings that white supremacists and far-right groups would target Congress. But she also said that Sund had asked the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the department, to declare a state of emergency beforehand and allow him to request National Guard support, but the board declined. The Defense Department has said it asked the Capitol Police if it needed the Guard, but the request was denied.A third member of the Capitol Police Board denied Pittman’s claim hours after her testimony was released. J. Brett Blanton, who serves as the architect of the Capitol, said that Sund did not ask him for help and that there was “no record of a request for an emergency declaration.”Lawmakers hope to resolve some of those discrepancies by questioning the witnesses together on Tuesday. Klobuchar said she is pleased that they are all appearing voluntarily and hopes that the hearing will have a “constructive” tone.“It was a horror what happened, we all know that,” she said. “But if we are going to have solutions and a safer Capitol going forward, we have to identify what went wrong, what the issues were, and the answers we’ll get are part of that solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-to-question-us-capitol-security-officials-on-jan-6-siege-101614075330974.html
23-02-2021||World||Biden admin rolls back Trump-era stringent citizenship test in another policy reversal||The Biden administration on Monday announced another reversal of Trump-era policy by reverting to an earlier 2008 civics test module to make the path to US citizenship more accessible. The previous administration had introduced some changes to the naturalisation civics test, called the 2020 civics test, which increased the pool of questions from 100 to 128 and the correct answers in the multiple-choice questions had political and ideological overtones.Announcing the reversal, US citizenship and immigration services (USCIS) said the agency has determined that the revised civics test, applicable for individuals who had applied on or after December 1, 2020, “may inadvertently create potential barriers” to the naturalisation process. It asserted that the action taken by USCIS is consistent with the framework of the executive order on “Restoring Trust in our Legal Immigration System”, which was signed by US President Joe Biden on February 2.“USCIS aspires to make the process as accessible as possible as directed by President Biden’s request to review the process thoroughly,” the immigration agency said in a statement.Read | What type of petitions USCIS still accepting after reaching H-1B visa cap?All individuals who apply for American citizenship through the process of naturalisation are required to take the civics test in which applicants have to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, principles, and form of government of the United States. Candidates who applied for naturalisation on or after December 1, 2020, and before March 1, 2021, will have the option to either take the 2020 civics test or the 2008 civics test. Those filing from March 1 will take the 2008 civics test.The latest announcement is a part of Biden’s policy for “New Americans” as the Democratic leader, in the executive order, called on his administration to improve the naturalisation process. He had directed the secretary of state, the attorney general, and the secretary of homeland security to develop a plan within 60 days to eliminate barriers in the existing naturalisation process by conducting a comprehensive review “with particular emphasis on...background and security checks, interviews, civics and English language tests, and the oath of allegiance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-rolls-back-trump-era-citizenship-test-in-another-policy-reversal-101614075054873.html

Anyone responding to peaceful protests with violence must be held to account," G7 foreign ministers said in a statement."We condemn the intimidation and oppression of those opposing the coup. We raise our concern at the crackdown on freedom of expression, including through the internet blackout and draconian changes to the law that repress free speech."The G7 called for an end to the "systematic targeting" of protesters, doctors, civil society and journalists and for the military junta to revoke its declared state of emergency.Also read: Western countries step up pressure on Myanmar junta as protesters defy warningsIt also urged Myanmar's military to allow full humanitarian access to support the most vulnerable."We remain united in condemning the coup in Myanmar.

The surge in pricing affects people who choose to pay wholesale prices for their power, which is usually cheaper than paying fixed rates during good weather. But owing to the storm, there has been a spike in the prices which is a result of the high demand for electricity.Here’s everything you need to know about the soaring electricity bills:What is the pricing system in Texas?Texas has a wholesale electricity pricing system which results in the prices fluctuating based on the demand. When natural gas pipelines and wind turbines froze up in Texas because of the snowstorm, there was less power available but the high demand of electricity resulted in the wholesale prices shooting up. People are able to pay wholesale prices in Texas because it’s one of the only states that lets people pick which company it buys power from.Read more: US President Biden approves Texas disaster declaration after deadly freezeAre the wholesale prices usually high?No, the wholesale prices are typically as low as a couple of cents per kilowatt-hour but spiked to $9 per kilowatt-hour after the storm. Fixed-rate customers pay a set amount that doesn’t rise as much which is around 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.What is Griddy?Griddy is one of the power supplier in Texas which was launched in 2017. The company charges $10 a month to give people a way to pay wholesale prices for electricity instead of a fixed rate. The company has 29,000 members and has a major role to play in the price surge in Texas.Read more: Texas freeze led to release of tons of air pollutants as refineries shutWhat will happen next?Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), Texas' utility regulator, said on Saturday that it is investigating "the factors that combined with the devastating winter weather to disrupt the flow of power to millions of Texas homes."Texas governor Greg Abbott also said in a statement that the high energy costs are unacceptable. "It is unacceptable for Texans who suffered through days in the freezing cold without electricity or heat to now be hit with skyrocketing energy costs," Abbott said. Although, no step has been taken to control the prices as of now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-snowstorm-the-next-challenge-facing-texans-high-energy-bills-101614071265695.html
23-02-2021||World||Yamani, the Saudi oil minister who brought the West to its knees||Saudi Arabia's Sheikh Zaki Yamani, the embodiment of the ascent of Arab petroleum power and the face of the 1973 oil embargo that brought the West to its knees, has died.Yamani was a witness to the 1975 murder of the Saudi king who had plucked him, a non-royal, from obscurity to be oil minister. Later the same year Yamani was kidnapped at an OPEC meeting by Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez, known as Carlos the Jackal.Yamani, 91, died in London, Saudi state media reported on Tuesday.Known for his elegant manner and trademark goatee beard, Yamani's 24-year tenure running the oil affairs of the world's biggest crude producer made him a global celebrity during the inflationary "oil shocks" of the 1970s.That ended with his abrupt sacking in 1986 after a costly attempt to prop up crude prices, a failed strategy which has cast a shadow over Saudi oil policy to this day.In December 1975, Yamani attended the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna, which ended in a hail of bullets fired into the ceiling from Venezuelan assassin Carlos and five cohorts. Three bystanders were killed.Carlos, promoting the Palestinian cause, targeted Yamani as the most valuable hostage, telling him repeatedly that he had been sentenced to death. Ministers were held for two days in a dynamite-charged room before the captors were granted a plane out of Austria with their hostages.A further 43 harrowing hours on board, flying from Algeria to Libya and back, created an intimacy between captive and hostage taker."It was odd, but as we sat together and talked, it was almost as if we had become friends," Yamani told biographer Jeffrey Robinson. "He was telling me so much, knowing that I would die."A deal was struck in Algiers and Carlos vanished, escaping arrest until 1994.Months earlier, Yamani was at the side of Saudi King Faisal in Riyadh, receiving a visiting delegation when a disaffected Saudi prince pulled out a revolver and shot the king dead.COMMONER AMONG ROYALSYamani's career was remarkable, for the time, as a commoner in a society dominated by the royal family.Born on June 30, 1930, the son of an Islamic scholar and judge in Mecca, Yamani was expected to follow his father and grandfather into teaching.After studying law in Cairo he left for New York University and Harvard. Returning to Saudi Arabia, he set up a law firm and took on government work, drawing the attention of the future King Faisal. He became oil minister in 1962.Yamani became a leading figure in the development of OPEC, founded in 1960. He extricated the Saudi oil industry from the grip of American companies in a series of steps that produced a deal on national ownership of Saudi Aramco in 1976.Aramco remains among the world's wealthiest companies by assets.In Yamani's early years as oil minister, Arab nationalism was on the rise and oil power was at the heart of it.By the time of the 1967 Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, Riyadh was ready to flex its economic muscle. Yamani announced a supply embargo against countries friendly to Israel. But the embargo did not bite. High inventories in the West and extra supply from Venezuela and pre-revolutionary Iran filled the gap.In 1973 the fourth Arab-Israeli conflict prompted Yamani to trigger another oil embargo. This time it worked - a fourfold increase in the price of crude marked the high point of OPEC power and sent western economies into recession as inflation soared in what became known as the first oil shock.OIL MASTERSYamani summed up that moment when oil producers took charge. "The moment has come," he said. "We are masters of our own commodity."With the end of the war and the embargo, Riyadh found an accommodation with the United States.Yamani was now a price moderate, espousing the view that high prices would ultimately destroy demand and encourage production from new exploration in places such as the North Sea.When the 1979 Iranian revolution triggered a second oil shock in the West, most in OPEC raised oil prices. Riyadh, close now to Washington, issued the "Yamani Edict", holding Saudi prices at official levels to ease the pain for importers.Yamani's new-found price moderation was to cost him. A supply glut born of the early 1980s recession in the West depressed fuel demand.Faisal's successor, King Fahd, called on Yamani to both protect Saudi market share and boost prices. Instead, he cut Saudi production to a 20-year low of only 2 million barrels per day in an effort to shore up prices.Fellow OPEC members were not as disciplined on production and Yamani was criticised at home as others increased their market share at Riyadh's expense. As the oil glut ballooned, crude prices crashed below $10 a barrel.Having disobeyed Fahd and failed, Yamani paid the price. In October 1986 he learned of his dismissal from a public announcement on Saudi television, apparently designed to embarrass him.Yamani retreated to his private life and became the figurehead for a consultancy, the Centre for Global Energy Studies. At its launch in London in 1989, with crude still worth only $20 a barrel, he predicted prices would eventually break $100, as they did eventually in the new millennium.Reuters interviewed Yamani in September 2000 to mark OPEC's 40th anniversary. Shale oil was little known at the time and renewables were in their infancy, but Yamani predicted that technology would hurt oil producers.“Technology is a real enemy for OPEC,” he said. “Technology will reduce consumption and increase production from areas outside OPEC. The real victims will be Saudi Arabia, with huge reserves which they can do nothing with.   "The Stone Age did not end because the world ran out of stone, and the Oil Age will end long before the world runs out of oil."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yamani-the-saudi-oil-minister-who-brought-the-west-to-its-knees-101614068794768.html
23-02-2021||World||Rishi Sunak plans more Covid aid for UK as unemployment climbs||The UK’s finance minister Rishi Sunak is set to spend billions of pounds in extra support for the economy over the next four months, as pandemic curbs pushed unemployment to its highest level in almost five years.The chancellor of the exchequer will set out the details in his March 3 budget after Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined a timeline for reopening the UK economy that keeps some businesses closed until at least June 21.“At the budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we’ll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery,” Sunak said in an e-mailed statement. “I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone.”Johnson’s four-step road map for lifting the lockdown will influence how fast Treasury subsidies are withdrawn, according to people familiar with the matter. Key aid programs are currently due to end as early as next month but Sunak will extend assistance so that companies and individuals do not face a cliff-edge, they said.Sunak faces a daunting task to put the economy on a path to recovery after suffering its deepest slump in three centuries last year. Unemployment climbed to its highest rate in almost five years in the fourth quarter, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday.The budget deficit is already setting peacetime records after the chancellor committed to spending 300 billion pounds ($422 billion) to help the health service and businesses cope with the crisis, a sum that’s set to increase next week.On Monday, Johnson detailed his four-step plan gradually to lift restrictions that have damaged the economy and kept most children away from school since the start of the year. While schools will reopen in two weeks, people will be asked to work from home where possible until at least June 21.A snap poll of 3,900 adults in England by YouGov found the largest proportion -- 46% -- think the government has got the balance right on lifting the lockdown, whereas 26% think ministers are moving too fast and 16% too slowly.Sunak’s package of financial support will broadly track the exit strategy, while taking into account the fact that business will not immediately return to normal levels even when shops and pubs are allowed to reopen, according to the people, who spoke anonymously about unannounced plans.“People may be concerned about what these changes mean for the various support packages for livelihoods, for people and for the economy,” Johnson told members of Parliament Monday. “We will not pull the rug out. For the duration of the pandemic, the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK”That suggests assistance will last beyond the tentative date of June 21 set by Johnson to reopen the last sectors of the economy.The premier’s road map means businesses such as nightclubs will be shut until at least June 21, while theaters, concert halls and sporting venues will have limits on the crowds until then, rendering many of them unprofitable.Pubs and restaurants won’t be able to re-open until at least April 12, and then for outdoor service only. By the time indoor service is allowed in mid-May, many businesses will have been closed for nearly 200 days “with just a couple of weeks of heavily restricted trading in December,” said UKHospitality Chief Executive Officer Kate Nicholl.Clinging On“A major package of financial support is imperative,” Nicholl said. “This delay in reopening will make the job of survival all the more difficult for businesses only just clinging onto existence.”Government support policies currently due to expire by the end of April include Sunak’s benchmark program that pays furloughed workers up to 80% of their wages, a business rates holiday, and reduced sales tax for hospitality and tourism. The chancellor faces calls to extend all of them, both from business groups and politicians, including from two predecessors in his own Conservative party.“The chancellor must deliver on the prime minister’s ‘whatever it takes’ pledge,” said Federation of Small Businesses National Chairman Mike Cherry. “On one side of the coin we have continued restrictions – on the other, we need corresponding business support.”Members of Johnson’s own Conservative Party also called for the economy to be reopened more quickly, especially when the 32 million people most vulnerable to Covid-19 are due to have been vaccinated by mid-April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-plans-more-covid-aid-for-uk-as-unemployment-climbs-101614071103617.html

Tensions have grown since the 2018 arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. executive in Vancouver on a US extradition request. Chinese authorities subsequently jailed two Canadians on national security charges.“Trudeau has been equivocating and passive in his approach to China, including on his position on the Uighur genocide, and I don’t think that approach is working,” Michael Chong, a member of the opposition Conservatives who sponsored the motion, said in a telephone interview.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Tuesday in Beijing that Canada’s motion “disregards facts and common sense.”“It is flagrant interference in China’s domestic affairs. We condemn and reject that,” Wang told a briefing. “We have lodged stern representations with the Canadian side.”‘Strong Message’The China file has become a major political vulnerability for Trudeau, who had sought to deepen ties with the Asian country early in his tenure only to see relations deteriorate dramatically. He’s facing pressure from all sides: opposition lawmakers wanting tougher action, and former Liberal ministers who want his government to free Huawei’s chief financial officer in exchange for the release of the two Canadians.Indicative of this balancing act, Trudeau and his cabinet abstained from the vote Monday even as most lawmakers in his Liberal caucus voted in favor. The motion -- which passed by a vote of 266 for and zero against -- also called on the government to push for the 2022 Olympics to be relocated from China.“We remain deeply disturbed by horrific reports of human rights violations in Xinjiang, including the use of arbitrary detention, political re-education, forced labour, torture and forced sterilization,” Foreign Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement after the vote.“The Government of Canada takes any allegations of genocide extremely seriously. We have the responsibility to work with others in the international community in ensuring that any such allegations are investigated by an independent international body of legal experts,” he added.The tactic sent “a strong message that it’s a genocide” and brought Canada more in line with allies like the U.S. “without the prime minister personally shooting an arrow at the dragon,” Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow at the University of Alberta’s China institute, said by phone.Business groups are worried the tensions threaten to undermine a trading relationship that has continued to deepen despite the rancor. The Conservative opposition is calling on the government to impose a ban on the import of products from the Xinjiang region, Chong said.“I’m certain there will be a lot of speculation about what might come next, but I’m not sure it will be very useful to the issues at hand,” said Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “Notwithstanding the many reactions coming after today, the fact remains Canada will need to continue working with allies on how to engage with China.”China has been facing mounting international pressure over allegations of human rights violations of its Muslim minority, which the Chinese government denies. While Beijing says it’s fighting separatism and religious extremism among Uighurs, a United Nations assessment found that anywhere from tens of thousands to “upwards of 1 million” Uighurs have been detained in internment camps.Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden expressed concern in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping about what he said were China’s “coercive and unfair economic practices” as well as human rights abuses.“There has never has been so-called genocide, forced labor or religious oppression in Xinjiang,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the UN Human Rights Council by video on Monday. “Such inflammatory accusations are fabricated out of ignorance and prejudice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/genocide-vote-pressures-canada-pm-trudeau-to-take-harder-line-on-china-101614069961943.html
23-02-2021||World||Malaysian court halts deportation of 1,200 Myanmar migrants||Malaysian court Tuesday ordered a halt to the planned deportation of 1,200 Myanmar migrants to hear an appeal by two human rights groups, which say refugees, asylum seekers and minors were among those being sent back.The court order, following a legal bid by Amnesty International Malaysia and Asylum Access Malaysia, came just after the migrants were transported to a naval base where three Myanmar military ships were waiting to take them home.“In light of the court ruling, the government must respect the court order and ensure that not one of the 1,200 individuals is deported today," said Amnesty International Malaysia’s director, Katrina Jorene Maliamauv.Amnesty said the court will hear their appeal Wednesday and urged the government to reconsider its plans to send the migrants back home, where human rights violations are high following a Feb. 1 military coup that deposed the country's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.“It’s important to note that the stay of execution granted by the court does not mean the 1,200 are safe from being deported. They are facing life-threatening risks," Maliamauv said in a statement.Amnesty urged the government to give the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees access to the 1,200 migrants and all immigration detention centers in general, which Malaysia's government has denied since August 2019.Malaysian immigration officials couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. The department earlier said there were no UNHCR cardholders or ethnic Muslim Rohingya refugees in the group, who were held for offenses including not having valid travel documents, overstaying their visas and violating social visit passes.But the two rights groups in their legal filing named three people registered with the UNHCR and 17 minors who have at least one parent still in Malaysia. The UNHCR has separately said there were at least six people registered with it among the group due to be deported.Amnesty and Asylum Access have said the repatriation is tantamount to legitimizing ongoing human rights violations by Myanmar’s military and would put the migrants at risk of further persecution, violence and even death.A group of 27 Malaysian lawmakers and senators also sent a letter to Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Sunday urging him to halt the deportation. There was no response from the premier's office.Malaysia doesn’t recognize asylum seekers or refugees, but has allowed a large population to stay on humanitarian grounds. It is home to some 180,000 U.N. refugees and asylum seekers — including more than 100,000 Rohingya and other Myanmar ethnic groups.More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar since August 2017, when the military cracked down in response to attacks by a rebel group. The security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and the burning of thousands of homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-court-halts-deportation-of-1-200-myanmar-migrants-101614062690650.html
23-02-2021||World||US looking forward to 'overarching' MoU to enhance health cooperation with India||The US has said it is looking forward to an "overarching" memorandum of understanding to enhance health partnership with India and asserted that the cooperation between the two countries on Covid-19 builds on decades of successful collaboration in health and biomedical research.The US on Monday crossed the grim milestone of 500,000 Covid-19 deaths. With 28,184,218 coronavirus cases and 500,172 deaths due to the disease so far, as recorded by Johns Hopkins University, America is the worst-affected nation."We look forward to an overarching MoU to enhance health cooperation between our two countries (US and India). We are working together on developing diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines to combat the disease (Covid-19) and to recognise the importance of manufacturing critical drugs during this time and making them accessible globally," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference on Monday.The total number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 1,10,05,850 -- the second in the world after the US. The death toll is 1,56,385 -- fourth globally.“India's pharmaceutical sector is strong and well-established and has long played a central role in manufacturing life saving vaccines for global use. We are pleased that the US pharmaceutical industry has been coordinating with Indian companies since the beginning of this pandemic,” Price said, responding to a question on India donating and supplying domestically manufactured Covid-19 vaccines to several countries across the globe.Known as the 'pharmacy of the world', India produces 60 per cent of vaccines globally. India has sent consignments of domestically manufactured coronavirus vaccines to several countries, including Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Seychelles, Myanmar, Mauritius, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Africa, Brazil and Morocco.“When it comes to the broad issue of coordination between the United States and India on Covid-19, I would say that cooperation between our two countries builds on decades of successful partnership in health and biomedical research,” Price said.The US is partnering with India to strengthen the global response to Covid-19 -- ranging from addressing infectious disease outbreaks, strengthening health systems to securing global supply chains, he said.India and the US recently welcomed an initiative to collaborate on infectious disease, including Covid-19 and other emerging threats, through the International Centre of Excellence and Research, Price said.In a recent op-ed in Newsweek magazine, India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, wrote that in recent years, India has emerged as the "pharmacy of the world", with great capabilities in bulk production of generic drugs and vaccines, in addition to its experience immunising a large population.India recently stepped up to provide vaccines to neighbouring countries and other partners, including in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, he said.The US has resources and scientific capabilities that make it a natural, complementary partner in supporting a number of other countries seeking to fight the pandemic, Sandhu wrote.“Furthermore, from the provision of active pharmaceutical ingredients to generic medicines that have lowered drug prices and created jobs and investments, India has demonstrated its reliability as a supply chain partner, especially as de-risking from single country supplies has become a priority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-looking-forward-to-overarching-mou-to-enhance-health-cooperation-with-india-101614041528748.html
23-02-2021||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan to arrive in Sri Lanka on Tuesday||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will hold wide-ranging talks with Sri Lankan leaders on various issues such as trade, defence and technology during his one-day visit to the island nation.Khan, who is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on Tuesday evening, will hold deliberations with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa. He will meet President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Wednesday, the foreign ministry has confirmed.The bilateral talks are expected to focus on various sectors including trade, investment, health, education, agriculture, technology, defence and tourism.This is the first visit by a Pakistan prime minister to Sri Lanka since Nawaz Sharif visited the country in 2016.Khan’s last visit to Sri Lanka was in 1986 when he was the captain of Pakistan cricket team during the acrimonious Test series where he accused the local umpires of bias.Khan’s visit coincides the current controversy over the forced cremations of the island’s minority Muslim community members who die due to the COVID-19. The government continues its policy of forced cremations despite objections from rights groups.Khan congratulated Sri Lanka earlier this month when Prime Minister Mahinda made a comment in parliament that burials would be allowed for Muslim victims of Covid-19. However, the decision is yet to be implemented.International rights group Amnesty International in an open letter to Khan had urged him to take up the issue of forced cremations with Sri Lankan leaders during his visit.“We urge you to raise this issue of forced cremations at the highest levels possible during your visit to Sri Lanka, in solidarity with a minority community who has been stripped of any means of recourse. We urge you to call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to stop forced cremations and to bring to an end discrimination faced by the Muslim community in Sri Lanka,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-to-arrive-in-sri-lanka-on-tuesday-101614062208643.html

That was 15% lower than the previous year, but the report's authors noted with alarm a sharp uptick and historically high civilian casualties in the final three months of 2020, when peace talks began.Last year "could have been the year of peace in Afghanistan. Instead, thousands of Afghan civilians perished," said Deborah Lyons, head of UNAMA, reiterating calls for a ceasefire which has been repeatedly rejected by the Taliban. "Parties refusing to consider a ceasefire must recognise the devastating consequences."The Taliban on Tuesday issued a response critical of the report, saying "the concerns, precise information and accurate details that were shared by us have not been taken into account."The report said that for the first time since records began, deaths and injuries had escalated in the final three months of the year from the previous three months. Casualties for the fourth quarter were up 45% compared with the same period in 2019.The majority of were ascribed to non-government actors, predominately the insurgent Taliban, and more than one-fifth were attributed to government forces.A government spokesman did not immediately respond to request for comment.Both sides said on Twitter their chief negotiators met in Doha, the venue for talks, on Monday evening, adding that teams would continue work on an agenda.After a monthlong break over the new year period, negotiators returned to Doha briefly before many senior members of the Taliban left to hold meetings in Russia and Iran. Mujahid said they would hold further meetings soon.Zabihullah said that the lull was only a break and the Taliban were committed to talks, with further meetings expected in coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-against-civilians-surges-in-afghanistan-after-peace-talks-un-report-101614063221717.html
23-02-2021||World||Carrie Lam backs Hong Kong electoral changes excluding 'rather hostile' opponents||Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam gave her clear support Tuesday to electoral reforms that would likely further exclude opposition voices and cement Beijing’s control over the semi-autonomous Chinese city’s politics.Her comments came a day after a top Beijing official signaled major changes would be coming to ensure is run by “patriots," a clear sign that China intends to no longer tolerate dissenting voices, 23 years after the former British colony was handed over to Chinese rule with a promise it could maintain its own rights and freedoms for 50 years.Following China's imposition of a sweeping national security law on the city last year, authorities have moved to expel members of the city's Legislative Council deemed insufficiently loyal and rounded up veteran opposition leaders on charges including illegal assembly and colluding with foreign forces. Government critics and Western governments accuse Beijing of going back on its word and effectively ending the “one country, two systems" framework for governing the dynamic Asian financial hub.Lam said political strife and unrest in the city, including anti-government protests in 2019 as well as protests in 2014, showed there were always some people who are “rather hostile” to the central authorities in China.“I can understand that the central authorities are very concerned, they do not want the situation to deteriorate further in such a way that ‘one country, two systems’ cannot be implemented,” Lam said at a regular news briefing.A day earlier, Xia Baolong, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said Hong Kong could only be ruled by “patriots," which exclude those who lobby other countries for foreign sanctions or “troublemakers."The electoral changes are expected to be discussed and possibly passed at next month’s meeting of the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp legislature, and its advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.They will likely take the form of a redistribution of votes in the 1,200-member electoral commission that selects Hong Kong’s chief executive, subject to Beijing’s veto. The commission is composed of voting blocs intended to represent Hong Kong's various economic, educational and social sectors, along with its largely Beijing-dominated political institutions.The one exception are the 117 commission members drawn from among the city's 458 local district counselors, most of whom are directly elected by their constituents and tend to be more politically independent. Opposition figures swept district council elections following the 2019 protests and the Beijing authorities have since sought to prevent them from exerting influence on other aspects of the political system.With all other commission members deemed to be firmly under Beijing's control, speculation has risen that the 117 district council votes will be transferred to another bloc, possibly that of Hong Kong’s representatives to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, ensuring that they will follow Beijing’s directives.It remains unclear whether Lam, who is deeply unpopular among Hong Kong's population, will seek a second five-year term in next year’s poll.Another possibility is that China will close what it calls “loopholes” in the election for members of the Legislative Council, now entirely dominated by pro-Beijing legislators since opposition deputies resigned en masse last year after four were expelled for being insufficiently loyal to the government. Lam postponed elections for the council last year, citing concerns over Covid-19, in a move largely seen as designed to prevent an opposition victory.Of the 70 members of the council, half are directly elected from geographic constituencies while the rest are drawn from trade and other special interest groups. Changes could include preventing district counselors from also sitting in the body or simply raising the requirements for loyalty and patriotism above the already stringent levels they are set at now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/carrie-lam-backs-hong-kong-electoral-changes-excluding-rather-hostile-opponents-101614066465539.html
23-02-2021||World||What is the controversy around Neera Tanden’s Senate confirmation?||Indian American Neera Tanden, who was nominated by US President Joe Biden to head the White House Office of Management of Budget (OMB), faces a challenge as her nomination is due to be confirmed by the Senate. Senator Susan Collins and Mitt Romney said on Monday that they will oppose Tanden to lead the White House Budget Office, dealing a decisive blow to her hopes of confirmation.The first blow to Tanden’s bid came on Friday when Senator Joe Manchin announced that he would oppose her, citing her controversial tweets. Without support from Manchin in an evenly divided Senate, Tanden needs backing from at least one Republican in order to be confirmed.Who is Neera Tanden?Tanden is a former Hillary Clinton aide and has worked with Clinton during her first presidential campaign in 2008 as well as in 2016. The 50-year-old was nominated by Biden in November to take over as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, a post which is responsible for managing the administration’s expenditure.Tanden is an American political consultant and the president of the Centre for American Progress, a liberal advocacy organisation. Apart from Clinton, Tanden has also worked on several Democratic presidential campaigns, including those of Michael Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008. Notably, Tanden helped in drafting the Affordable Care Act under the Obama administration.Why is her nomination in jeopardy?Tanden is facing sharp opposition because of remarks that she made over the last four years, especially against Republicans. Tanden called Collins “the worst” and Senator Mitch McConnell, the top Republican, “Moscow Mitch” and “Voldemort”.Collins and Romney on Monday announced that they would not vote to confirm her nomination after Manchin, a Democrat also said last week that he would not support Tanden in her bid.In order to be approved, Tanden needs the support of all 50 Democrats in the evenly divided 100-member Senate, in the hope that vice president Kamala Harris will support her using the constitutionally mandated tie-breaker vote. After Manchin backing out, Tanden is down to 49 Democrats and desperately needs support from Republicans for her confirmation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-the-controversy-around-neera-tanden-s-senate-confirmation-101614066712845.html
23-02-2021||World||Damage to United Boeing 777 engine consistent with metal fatigue: NTSB||Damage to a fan blade on an engine that failed on a United Airlines Boeing 777 flight is consistent with metal fatigue, based on a preliminary assessment, the chairman of the U.S. air accident investigator said on Monday.The Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engine failed on Saturday with a "loud bang" four minutes after takeoff from Denver, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters following an initial analysis of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.He said it remained unclear whether the incident is consistent with an engine failure on a different Hawaii-bound United flight in February 2018 that was attributed to a fatigue fracture in a fan blade."What is important that we really truly understand the facts, circumstances and conditions around this particular event before we can compare it to any other event," Sumwalt said.The engine that failed on the 26-year-old Boeing Co 777 and shed parts over a Denver suburb was a PW4000 used on 128 planes, or less than 10% of the global fleet of more than 1,600 delivered 777 widebody jets.In another incident on Japan Airlines (JAL) 777 with a PW4000 engine in December 2020, Japan's Transport Safety Board reported it found two damaged fan blades, one with a metal fatigue crack. An investigation is ongoing.The focus is more on engine maker Pratt and analysts expect little financial impact on Boeing, but the PW4000 issues are a fresh headache for the planemaker as it recovers from the far more serious 737 MAX crisis. Boeing's flagship narrowbody jet was grounded for nearly two years after two deadly crashes.The United engine's fan blade will be examined on Tuesday after being flown to a Pratt laboratory where it will examined under supervision of NTSB investigators.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it had already been evaluating whether to adjust fan blade inspections in the wake of the December incident in Japan after reviewing maintenance records and conducting a metallurgical examination of the fan blade fragment.Boeing recommended that airlines suspend the use of the planes while the FAA identified an appropriate inspection protocol, and Japan imposed a temporary suspension on flights.Pratt & Whitney, owned by Raytheon Technologies Corp., has recommended airlines increase inspections in a plan that is being reviewed by the FAA, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Pratt did not respond immediately to a request for comment.The FAA has said it plans to issue an emergency airworthiness directive soon that will require stepped-up inspections of the fan blades for fatigue."United Airlines has grounded all of the affected airplanes with these engines, and I understand the FAA is also working very quickly as well as Pratt & Whitney has reiterated or revised a service bulletin," Sumwalt said. "It looks like action is being taken."In March 2019, after the 2018 United engine failure attributed to fan blade fatigue, the FAA ordered inspections every 6,500 cycles. A cycle is one take-off and landing.Sumwalt said the United incident was not considered an uncontained engine failure because the containment ring contained the parts as they were flying out.There was minor damage to the aircraft body but no structural damage, he said.NTSB will look into why the engine cowling separated from the plane and also why there was a fire despite indications fuel to the engine had been turned off, Sumwalt added.Industry sources said that although the engine is made by Pratt, the cowling, or casing, is manufactured by Boeing. Boeing referred questions on the part to the NTSB.Nearly half of the global fleet of PW4000-equipped Boeing 777 jets operated by airlines including United, JAL, ANA Holdings, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines had already been grounded amid a plunge in travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/damage-to-united-boeing-777-engine-consistent-with-metal-fatigue-ntsb-101614063311693.html
23-02-2021||World||US arrests wife of Mexico cartel chief El Chapo on drug charges||The wife of Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was arrested and charged in the United States on Monday with helping her husband continue to run his drug trafficking cartel while he was behind bars.Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, a regular attendee at her husband's high-profile US trial two years ago where he was convicted of trafficking tons of drugs into the United States, was arrested at Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.Her arrest is the highest profile US capture of a Mexican on drug charges since former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos was detained in October, and experts said it indicated a deterioration in bilateral security relations.Coronel was charged by the US Department of Justice with conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamines for unlawful importation into the United States. She is expected to appear in a federal court in Washington on Tuesday.An affidavit attached to the charges also details Coronel's alleged involvement in her husband's escape from a Mexican prison in 2015 and a second attempted prison break in 2016 before the 63-year-old was extradited to the United States.A lawyer for Coronel could not immediately be identified, and lawyers in Mexico linked to the Guzman family did not respond to a request for comment.A Mexican official familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified, said Coronel's arrest appeared to be solely a US initiative and that Coronel was not wanted in Mexico."[It's] a sign of what's likely ahead," former Mexican ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhan said, describing it as an example of US agencies acting with little coordination with Mexican counterparts.Joint efforts to fight drug trafficking were strained by Cienfuegos' arrest, with Mexico's government moving to restrict US agents' activities in Mexico in retaliation for what it called a breach of trust.The Justice Department unexpectedly dropped the Cienfuegos case the following month and let him return to Mexico, a move Mexico welcomed as restoring trust between the two countries. Two months later, Mexico dropped its own case against Cienfuegos.The investigation into Coronel was handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), rather than the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The charges relate to alleged trafficking activity between 2014-2107 prior to the high-profile Brooklyn trial where Guzman was convicted on drug trafficking offenses.The indictment documents said Coronel relayed messages on behalf of Guzman to facilitate drug trafficking after his arrest in 2014.Prosecutors said Coronel also conspired to aid her husband in his July 2015 escape from the Altiplano prison in Mexico through a mile-long tunnel from his cell. An unnamed cooperating witness was paid $1 million to help facilitate a failed second escape a year later, according to the affidavit.POTENTIAL PRESSURE STRATEGYCoronel, who married Guzman as an 18-year-old beauty queen in 2017, is a dual US-Mexico citizen who lives in Mexico. It was unclear why she was in the Washington area at the time of her arrest.Prosecutors at Guzman's trial two years ago said he amassed power through murders and wars with rival cartels. Guzman was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, which the sentencing judge said reflected Guzman's "overwhelmingly evil" actions. Guzman was sent to ADX Florence in Colorado, the nation's most secure "Supermax" prison.Tomas Guevara, an investigator in security issues at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, said Coronel's arrest might be part of a "pressure strategy" to prompt cooperation from Guzman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-arrests-wife-of-mexico-cartel-chief-el-chapo-on-drug-charges-101614056007651.html
23-02-2021||World||'Like a soap opera': The glamorous life of El Chapo's detained wife||The arrest on drug trafficking charges of Emma Coronel Aispuro, a former beauty queen and wife of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, follows a telenovela-style life that straddled hyper-violent Mexican cartels, fame and motherhood.Coronel, 31, married young into infamy and had a front-row seat to Guzman's high-stakes cat-and-mouse game with Mexican and U.S. agents hunting him down.A US-Mexican dual national, Coronel was arrested on Monday at Dulles International Airport and is due to appear in a U.S. District of Columbia court on Tuesday charged with distributing cocaine, heroin and other drugs.Coronel caught the attention of Guzman, who is more than three decades her senior, when she was a teenaged beauty queen.They married after she turned 18 in 2007 and had twin daughters, spending their entire married life with Guzman either in jail or on the run as the leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel. Guzman is serving a life sentence in a U.S. jail.Coronel's fame soared during Guzman's 2019 trial in New York, where she became a media sensation with her designer outfits and the loyalty she showed her husband - even as prosecutors detailed how he kept a string of lovers.She even became a key character in the court drama when a former lieutenant of Guzman's alleged Coronel played a pivotal role in her husband's Hollywood-style escape from prison in a mile-long tunnel burrowed under his jail cell's shower in 2015.Piggybacking on her husband's fame and seeking to cash-in on her celebrity outside Mexico, Coronel launched a clothing brand in the United States in 2019 and even appeared in a U.S. reality show about mafia families."I consider myself a normal woman," Coronel said in VH1's Cartel Crew show, speaking aboard a yacht."It's sad that they judge us without knowing us. It's hard."In media interviews, Coronel emphasised her enduring loyalty to Guzman and her focus on bringing up their twin daughters."Emma is like the old narco families in Sinaloa," a former acquaintance told Reuters.'LOVE STORY'Steeped in the narco tradition from an early age, Coronel was raised in the mountains of Durango, part of Mexico's "Golden Triangle" of drug trafficking states that includes Sinaloa. Her father was jailed for trafficking drugs in 2017.Coronel first hit the headlines in Mexico after her 2007 church wedding in rural Durango to Guzman, who at the time was on the run from authorities.Coronel would be by Guzman's side during several near-misses as Mexican police and U.S. agents tracked him.At Guzman's trial, his former right-hand man, Damaso Lopez Nuñez, testified how Coronel, along with Guzman's sons, helped orchestrate the audacious 2015 prison escape.They got a plot of land near the prison, arranged weapons, brought an armoured truck and even had a GPS wristwatch smuggled into Guzman's cell so the tunnel engineers would have exact jail cell coordinates to help their digging, according to testimony.Guzman was captured again in 2016 and extradited to the United States in 2017.At Guzman's trial, whenever he entered the court, he would seek Coronel out and wave. They could not speak to each other but their glances caught the attention of the media."It was like a love story in complete silence as she wasn't allowed to say anything," said journalist Miguel Angel Vega of the Riodoce newspaper in Sinaloa who covered the trial."It's quite interesting to see what's happening in this new case," Vega said. "It's like a soap opera."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-a-soap-opera-the-glamorous-life-of-el-chapo-s-detained-wife-101614063301698.html

That's more Americans who have died in one year in this pandemic than in World War One, World War Two and the Vietnam War combined," Biden said in emotional remarks at the White House."But as we acknowledge the scale of this mass death in America, we remember each person and the life they lived. They’re people we knew."Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff marked a moment of silence around 6:15 p.m. (2315 GMT) outdoors at the White House after the president's remarks, bowing their heads somberly.Five hundred lit candles lined the White House steps to commemorate the dead and a military band played a soaring rendition of "Amazing Grace."Biden ordered that all flags on federal properties and military facilities be lowered to half-staff until Friday at sunset to commemorate the dead.The president called on Americans to remain vigilant in fighting the pandemic by continuing to wear masks, observe social distancing and receive vaccinations when it is their turn."We must end the politics and misinformation that has divided families, communities and the country, and has cost too many lives already. It's not Democrats and Republicans who are dying from the virus. It's our fellow Americans," Biden said."We have to fight this together as one people, as the United States of America."About 19% of total global coronavirus deaths have occurred in the United States, an outsized figure given that the nation accounts for just 4% of the world’s population.The country has the highest overall death figure, reflecting the lack of a unified, national response last year, when the administration of former President Donald Trump mostly left states to their own devices in tackling the greatest public health crisis in a century. Biden, a Democrat, took office on Jan. 20 after defeating Trump, a Republican, in the 2020 presidential election, in part by arguing he would do a better job of addressing the pandemic.Trump downplayed the pandemic in its early stages and repeatedly predicted rosier numbers about the expected death toll in the United States than came to fruition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-leads-americans-in-moment-of-silence-to-mourn-500-000-covid-19-deaths-101614062381700.html

At a speech earlier on Tuesday, Sims declined to answer questions about the standoff on the grounds that it was before parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-restore-australian-news-pages-after-tweaks-to-media-laws-101614058543241.html
23-02-2021||World||Canada’s parliament votes to label Chinese actions in Xinjiang as ‘genocide’||Canada’s parliament has passed a motion that labels Chinese actions against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province as “genocide”.The House of Commons voted 266-0 for the motion that was brought by the opposition Conservative Party. Not a single member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party cabinet voted for the motion. Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau was present in the House as the motion was voted upon, but he abstained. Many Liberal Party MPs backed it, though.Tensions between Canada and China are set to further escalate following the passage of an opposition amendment to a motion that calls on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympic Games from China to another country. That motion passed 229-29.Beijing is set to host the 2022 edition of the Winter Olympics from February 4-20.The Trudeau administration itself has not used the “genocide” label for the Chinese government’s actions in Xinjiang. Foreign minister Garneau’s office reacted to the motion on Xinjiang with a statement released by Global Affairs Canada that said, “The government of Canada takes any allegations of genocide extremely seriously. We have the responsibility to work with others in the international community in ensuring that any such allegations are investigated by an independent international body of legal experts.”It also called for a “credible international investigation in response to allegations of genocide” and that it “must be conducted by an international and independent body so that impartial experts can observe and report on the situation first-hand”.Even though the Trudeau government is taking a balanced stand on the Xinjiang issue, the motion is set to worsen relations between the two countries. In a sharp statement before the vote, the Chinese ambassador to Ottawa, Cong Peiwu, said Beijing expressed “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition over this”.Accusing those behind the motion of “spreading disinformation and even lies”, he said there was no genocide in Xinjiang and Chinese actions were “about combating violent terrorism and secession”.Calling upon the motions against China to be scrapped, he said, “We urge the Canadian side to take seriously China’s solemn position, respect the facts, discard prejudice, and correct mistakes, immediately cancel the relevant motions, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs by any means, so as not to cause further damages to China-Canada relations.”Relations between the two countries have suffered since Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, was arrested in Vancouver in 2018 in a US extradition request for allegedly circumventing sanctions imposed on Iran. In what Trudeau has described as “hostage diplomacy”, Beijing retaliated by arresting two Canadians, including a former diplomat, who remain jailed in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-parliament-votes-to-label-chinese-actions-in-xinjiang-as-genocide-101614057215265.html
23-02-2021||World||Petrobras shares slump as Brazil's Bolsonaro doubles down on intervention||Petrobras shares plunged 22% on Monday, wiping out 71 billion reais ($13 billion) in market value, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro again slammed its pricing policies after he replaced the state-controlled oil company's market-friendly CEO with a retired army general.The selloff, following a series of analyst downgrades, deepened after Bolsonaro said the company's fuel policy was only pleasing to financial markets and select groups in Brazil and should be changed as part of an effort to lower gasoline and diesel prices.Overall, the last few days have marked a dramatic about-face for Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist whose interventionist instincts until now had been largely contained by economically conservative allies.Shares in state electricity company Eletrobras also plunged on Monday after Bolsonaro said it would be the next sector in which the government would "stick its finger."In comments to Brazil's Radio Bandeirantes on Monday, Joaquim Silva e Luna, the man tapped by Bolsonaro on Friday to take the reins from Roberto Castello Branco, floated the idea of a government fund, or "cushion", to lessen the effects of fluctuating fuel prices on consumers.Bolsonaro doubled down on his criticism of Castello Branco, mocking his decision to social distance since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the severity of which the president has repeatedly minimized."Now, the current Petrobras chief executive, let's be very clear, has been at home for 11 months without working, working remotely. Now, the boss has to be on the front line," Bolsonaro said, adding: "This is for me unacceptable."BONDS ALSO HITCredit Suisse, Santander, Scotiabank, Bank of America, Bradesco and XP analysts were among those who downgraded their recommendations on shares of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known."A good reputation is hard to earn and easy to lose," BTG bank analyst Thiago Duarte said in a note to clients.Dollar-denominated debt issued by Petrobras also suffered hefty losses with the 2043 bond dropping 7.6 cents to trade at a seven-month low of 98 cents on the dollar, Refinitiv data showed.Morgan Stanley removed its 'like' recommendation on Brazil sovereign bonds on Monday, citing fiscal concerns and potential spill over from the removal of Castello Branco.Petrobras' "all-important" pricing policy and its implications for cash generation and planned asset sales, particularly of its refineries, has clouded its debt reduction and dividend outlook, Santander analysts led by Christian Audi said in a note to clients. They downgraded their recommendation on the stock to "hold" from "buy."Director-General Rodolfo Saboia of Brazil's oil regulator ANP said that the CEO change would not affect the country's policy of opening up the refinery sector to private investment or pursuit of free markets. He declined to comment directly on Petrobras' refinery sales."The best way to attempt to reach a fair price is by opening the market ... and not depending on one actor to set the price a certain product should have," he told Reuters in an interview.In a Facebook post after the close of trading on Friday, Bolsonaro announced the nomination of Silva e Luna, a former defense minister who has been managing giant hydroelectric dam Itaipu, to replace Branco.The retired general, who lacks any oil and gas industry experience, said in the Radio Bandeirantes interview that he had not discussed and does not have an opinion on an eventual privatization of the company.On Saturday, Silva e Luna told Reuters that the company needed to find "balance" in fuel pricing, considering the impact on shareholders, investors, sellers and consumers.Brazil's securities industry watchdog CVM on Monday announced the opening of an investigation on the change of leadership, confirming an earlier Reuters report on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/petrobras-shares-slump-as-brazil-s-bolsonaro-doubles-down-on-intervention-101614039259723.html
23-02-2021||World||Trump taxes, long guarded, will soon be in prosecutor’s hands||Donald Trump, who managed to keep his tax returns a secret the entire time he was in the White House, is about to see them fall into the hands of a New York prosecutor looking into possible criminal charges against him.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. subpoenaed Trump’s accounting firm for eight years of records in 2019, but the then-president took the case to the US Supreme Court, twice. On Monday, the justices abruptly rejected Trump’s final bid to block Vance, a Democrat.Trump’s refusal to release his taxes during the 2016 campaign, falsely claiming he couldn’t because he was under audit, marked a break with every presidential candidate of the last four decades. Once in office, he fought tooth and nail to keep them secret, challenging the oversight powers of the House tax committees that had previously been understood to have the power to examine any taxpayer’s return. Congress still doesn’t have Trump’s taxes.Many details of Trump’s taxes have emerged, notably in the New York Times last fall, but Vance will be receiving the returns as part of a criminal probe that looms as one of the biggest legal threats facing the former president and his company, the Trump Organization Inc. In August, Manhattan prosecutors suggested in court papers they may be looking into tax fraud, insurance fraud, and falsification of business records charges.New York Attorney General Letitia James is separately examining whether the Trump company inflated values of some of its properties, and Trump may also be part of a criminal probe in Atlanta over attempts to influence the 2020 Georgia vote count.‘They’d Find It’With Trump’s tax returns, Vance’s investigators will be able to compare statements made by the Trump Organization to the Internal Revenue Service with claims made to banks, insurers and other parties.“Now they have the evidence that the accounting firm and the corporation have,” said John Moscow, a former chief prosecutor for serious economic crimes at the Manhattan district attorney’s office. “At this point, Trump’s position has to be that he didn’t do anything wrong, because if he did, they’d find it.”Trump issued a statement on Monday calling Vance’s investigation “a continuation of the greatest political witch hunt in the history of our country,” connecting it to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election and two unsuccessful impeachment attempts. He suggested prosecutors in “far-left states and jurisdictions” were trying to “to take out a political opponent.”Vance has been beefing up his team in anticipation of receiving Trump’s tax records. Late last year, the district attorney hired FTI Consulting, a leading forensic accounting firm, to assist in the investigation. Earlier this month, Mark Pomerantz, a former federal prosecutor, came aboard as a special assistant district attorney, according to Vance’s spokesman, Danny Frost.Gotti ProsecutorAs head of the criminal division of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office from 1997 to 1999, Pomerantz oversaw complex fraud and organized crime prosecutions, including that of organized crime boss John Gotti Jr. Since then, he’s been a top corporate defense lawyer at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, from which he is taking a leave of absence to work with Vance.Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, isn’t contesting the subpoena. Mazars declined to comment on the Trump tax records Monday, but said it was “committed to fulfilling” its professional and legal obligations.Any material Vance receives from Mazars would be covered by laws protecting grand jury secrecy, meaning it isn’t likely to become public anytime soon.The public learned a good deal about Trump’s financial situation in September when the New York Times published an analysis of at least two decades of Trump’s tax records, reporting that he paid just $750 in federal income tax in 2016 and in 2017. The Times said Trump reported huge business losses, effectively wiping out all income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years as well.Lisa Griffin, a law professor at Duke University, said it was unclear there would be much more for the public to learn from Trump’s actual returns. “It’s entirely possible that we know the most significant facts about his indebtedness,” she said.Rejected ImmunityThe high court had deferred acting in the case for four months, waiting until Trump again became a private citizen to take a step that could boost a probe that initially focused on hush-money payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels and another woman who claimed to have sexual relationships with Trump years before he became president. Vance’s investigators have already gotten hold of some of the tax records from other sources, according to people familiar with the matter.Monday’s rejection effectively shut down the avenue the high court left open for Trump in July, when the justices rejected his claim of sweeping immunity for sitting presidents from state criminal subpoenas but said he could press more specific objections. Two lower courts rejected Trump’s contention that the subpoena was too broad and was issued in bad faith, prompting the now-former president to turn to the Supreme Court.Vance had agreed to hold off enforcing the subpoena while the Supreme Court considered Trump’s new arguments.Trump told the Supreme Court he will suffer “irreparable harm” if the materials are turned over. “Even if the disclosure of his papers is limited to prosecutors and grand jurors, the status quo can never be restored once confidentiality is destroyed,” his lawyers said in court papers.Vance said the year-plus delay has already hampered the investigation.‘A Lot to Do’Trump “has had multiple opportunities for review of his constitutional and state law claims, and at this juncture he provides no grounds for further delay,” Vance argued. “His request for extraordinary relief should be denied, and the grand jury permitted to do its work.”Following the Supreme Court order, Vance’s office said, “The work continues.”Given the complexity of Trump’s financial statements, the broad range of records that Vance’s office will now have to pore over and the political sensitivity surrounding an investigation of this magnitude, the process will take time, said Moscow.“There’s a lot to do,” he said. “It’s not going to be quick, it’s going to be thorough.”Congress could also soon get its hands on Trump’s taxes too. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen could theoretically turn over the returns at any time, but the new administration earlier this month told the judge overseeing the House suit demanding them that it needed more time to determine its position in light of the ongoing transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-taxes-long-guarded-will-soon-be-in-prosecutor-s-hands-101614041543862.html
23-02-2021||World||Chinese Official Signals Changes to Hong Kong Election Rules||China faces a “critical and urgent” task to overhaul Hong Kong’s electoral system, Beijing’s top official for the city said, in the latest sign that authorities were mulling major changes in the coming weeks.Beijing needed to reform the city’s electoral system “to ensure that Hong Kong’s governance is firmly controlled by patriots,” Xia Baolong, director of China’s cabinet-level Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said in a speech Monday.Speaking to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, Xia said that to improve Hong Kong’s electoral system, “relevant legal loopholes within the framework of the Constitution and the Basic Law” need to be closed -- and that it was up to the central government to communicate those changes to the local administration.The remarks follow a number of articles and comments in Chinese state media, and are the latest sign that China is contemplating further curbs to Hong Kong’s already-limited democracy, where a committee of 1,200 business and political elites selects the city’s leader and Beijing retains veto power.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press conference later Monday that Beijing needed to enact electoral reform to ensure everyone involved in governing the city was patriotic.Security LawBeijing intends to limit the influence of opposition groups on the committee that picks the chief executive, taking seats from pro-democracy politicians and assigning them to pro-China loyalists, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the proposal. The changes would pass during an annual session of China’s legislature in March, the report said.China has taken various steps to stamp out dissent in the former British colony since sometimes-violent protests erupted in 2019, most notably by imposing a sweeping national security law last year.Beijing also allowed the local government to disqualify lawmakers who were insufficiently patriotic. All opposition members of the Legislative Council resigned en masse after Lam’s administration used the new rule to kick out four lawmakers.In comments to Lam in late January, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Hong Kong should be governed by “patriots” in order to ensure the city’s stability following unprecedented unrest in 2019.Lam said Monday that reforms would not be designed to limit the influence of pro-democracy politicians but that no one in government should engage in unpatriotic activities, such as colluding with foreign powers to subvert China’s central government.“This need to change the electoral system and arrangements in Hong Kong is for one single purpose, that is to make sure that whoever is governing Hong Kong is patriotic,” she said. “It applies to various aspects of the political structure, including the executive, the legislative, the judiciary, the District Councils and the civil service.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-official-signals-changes-to-hong-kong-election-rules-101614045288480.html

The other MPs, including ministers from Trudeau's Liberal government, abstained.The motion recognizes that "Uighurs in China have been and are being subject to genocide."The MPs cited in particular reports of "political and anti-religious indoctrination," "forced labor" and "destruction of cultural sites" -- among other atrocities -- that the Muslim minority in Xinjiang has been forced to undergo.An amendment to the motion calling for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics to be moved if the "genocide" continues was also adopted.According to foreign experts, more than one million Uighurs are being held in political reeducation camps. Beijing has denied this and claims they are vocational training centers designed to guide Uighurs away from terrorism and separatism, following attacks attributed to the community."Now Conservatives are calling on the Liberal government to respect Parliament and officially recognize the genocide happening in China," said opposition leader Erin O'Toole, who for months has urged Ottawa to harden its stance towards Beijing."The Government of Canada takes any allegations of genocide extremely seriously," foreign affairs minister Marc Garneau said in a statement, noting that Canada favors a joint approach with its allies on this issue.Trudeau said Friday there had been significant human rights abuse reports coming out of Xinjiang.Following a G7 meeting, the prime minister said Canada was consulting with its international allies on the use of the term "genocide," already used by former US president Donald Trump's administration.Canada-China relations soured in late 2018 over the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant, and China's detention of two Canadians -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- in what Ottawa has called retaliation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-mps-ask-trudeau-to-term-china-s-treatment-of-uighur-s-as-genocide-101614041578003.html
23-02-2021||World||'Goosebumps': NASA releases video of Perservance rover landing on Mars||NASA on Monday released the first high-quality video of a spacecraft landing on Mars, a three-minute trailer showing the enormous orange and white parachute hurtling open and the red dust kicking up as rocket engines lowered the rover to the surface.The quality was so good — and the images so breathtaking — that members of the rover team said they felt like they were riding along.“It gives me goosebumps every time I see it, just amazing,” said Dave Gruel, head of the entry and descent camera team.The Perseverance rover landed last Thursday near an ancient river delta in Jezero Crater to search for signs of ancient microscopic life. After spending the weekend binge-watching the descent and landing video, the team at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, shared the video at a news conference.“These videos and these images are the stuff of our dreams," said Al Chen, who was in charge of the landing team.Six off-the-shelf cameras were devoted to entry, descent and landing, looking up and down from different perspectives. All but one camera worked. The lone microphone turned on for landing failed, but NASA got some snippets of sound after touchdown: the whirring of the rover’s systems and wind gusts.Flight controllers were thrilled with the thousands of images beamed back — and also with the remarkably good condition of the rover. It will spend the next two years exploring the dry river delta and drilling into rocks that may hold evidence of life 3 billion to 4 billion years ago. The core samples will be set aside for return to Earth in a decade.NASA added 25 cameras to the $3 billion mission — the most ever sent to Mars. The space agency's previous rover, 2012's Curiosity, managed only jerky, grainy stop-motion images, mostly of terrain. Curiosity is still working. So is NASA's InSight lander, although it's hampered by dusty solar panels.Deputy project manager Matt Wallace said he was inspired several years ago to film Perseverance's harrowing descent when his young gymnast daughter wore a camera while performing a backflip.Watching the video "I think you will feel like you are getting a glimpse into what it would be like to land successfully in Jezero Crater with Perseverance,” he said.Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s science mission chief, said the video and also the panoramic views following touchdown “are the closest you can get to landing on Mars without putting on a pressure suit.”The images will help NASA prepare for astronaut flights to Mars in the decades ahead, according to the engineers.There's a more immediate benefit.“I know it's been a tough year for everybody,” said imaging scientist Justin Maki, “and we're hoping that maybe these images will help brighten people's days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-mars-rover-chronicles-entry-descent-and-landing-on-red-planet-101614040787062.html
23-02-2021||World||Wife of drug kingpin 'El Chapo', Emma, arrested on US drug charges||The wife of Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman was arrested Monday at an airport in Virginia on international drug trafficking charges, the Justice Department said, spelling out in detail how she helped plot her husband’s daring escape from a Mexico prison.Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, who is a dual citizen of the US and Mexico, was arrested at Dulles International Airport and is expected to appear in federal court in Washington on Tuesday.She is charged in a single-count criminal complaint with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana in the US The Justice Department also accuses her of helping her husband escape from a Mexican prison in 2015 and participating in the planning of a second prison escape before Guzman was extradited to the US in January 2017.Coronel Aispuro remained in custody, and it was not immediately clear if she had an attorney who could comment on the allegations.As Mexico’s most powerful drug lord, Guzman escaped through an entry under the shower in his cell to a milelong (1.6-kilometer-long) lighted tunnel with a motorcycle on rails. The planning for the escape was extensive, prosecutors say, with his wife playing a key role.Court papers charge that Coronel Aispuro worked with Guzman’s sons and a witness, who is now cooperating with the US government, to organize the construction of the underground tunnel that Guzman used to escape from the Altiplano prison in Mexico to prevent him from being extradited to the US The plot included purchasing a piece of land near the prison, firearms and an armored truck and smuggling him a GPS watch so they could “pinpoint his exact whereabouts so as to construct the tunnel with an entry point accessible to him,” the court papers say.Guzman was sentenced to life behind bars in 2019. His Sinaloa cartel was responsible for smuggling mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States during his 25-year reign, prosecutors said in recent court papers. They also said his “army of sicarios,” or “hit men,” was under orders to kidnap, torture and kill anyone who got in his way.Coronel Aispuro, a former teen beauty queen, regularly attended Guzman’s trial, even when testimony cast her in a harsh light. The two, separated in age by more than 30 years, have been together since at least 2007 and share twin daughters, who were born in 2011.Her father, Ines Coronel Barreras, was arrested in 2013 with one of his sons and several other men in a warehouse with hundreds of pounds of marijuana across the border from Douglas, Arizona. Months earlier, the US Treasury had announced financial sanctions against Coronel Barreras for his alleged drug trafficking.After Guzman was rearrested following his escape, Coronel Aispuro lobbied the Mexican government to improve her husband’s prison conditions. And after he was convicted in 2019, she moved to launch a clothing line in his name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wife-of-drug-kingpin-el-chapo-emma-arrested-on-us-drug-charges-101614040284259.html
23-02-2021||World||Trump slams Supreme Court for not shielding his tax records||Former US President Donald Trump issued a statement in which he slammed the US Supreme Court for not blocking New York prosecutors from obtaining his tax records.Earlier on Monday, US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer declined to issue a stay for a lower court ruling in favour of former President Donald Trump disclosing his tax returns to a New York grand jury."The Supreme Court never should have let this 'fishing expedition' happen, but they did," Trump said on Monday. "This is something which has never happened to a President before, it is all Democrat-inspired in a totally Democrat location, New York City and State, completely controlled and dominated by a heavily reported enemy of mine, Governor Andrew Cuomo."Trump further said the New York Attorney General's investigation is a continuation of the greatest political hunt in US history, adding that the probe is similar to practices in Third World countries and represents a threat to the foundation of liberty in the United States. Trump also reiterated his stance that the 2020 US presidential election was rigged and stolen from him.Monday's decision significantly weakens Trump's ability to protect his tax returns from the grand jury subpoena, barring further - but unlikely - US Supreme Court interventions in the case.New York City District Attorney Cyrus Vance is seeking Trump's tax returns dating back to 2011.Trump has contended that an August 2019 grand jury subpoena to his accounting form Mazars USA to provide his tax returns was overly broad and issued in bad faith.Last summer, the Supreme Court rejected Trump's earlier request to block the order, claiming that his position as US president did not shield him from complying with the subpoena.

Steamed rice in my bowl. Soft drink in my hand. Can’t fathom why sturdy soldiers die. I woke up in the middle of the night, startled to realize: They died for me.”The post was widely circulated online, the China Daily news report said.Pictures of the four soldiers and their funeral rituals were also widely circulated online. In one, Chen Xiangrong, one of the four deceased troops, is shown smiling at the camera with a half-peeled orange in his hands.Some other trending topics read: “10 details of the border clash scene”, “One soldier is one boundary marker”, “Not an inch of the motherland can be lost” and “The diaries and letters of the five border heroes”.Elsewhere, Chinese authorities have been quick to arrest at least three persons who had “slandered” online the PLA troops.Details of their comments were not shared.“The police stated that cyberspace is not a lawless void and the police will resolutely punish the behavior of slandering and insulting heroes without factual basis according to law,” an official Chinese military website reported.“In recent years, the persons involved in defaming heroes and martyrs have received severe punishment, fully showing that the Chinese rule of law has zero-tolerance for similar words and deeds,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiindia-propaganda-continues-online-in-china-101614018598464.html

It is the same Congress that divided the country into India and Pakistan on the basis of religion," Chouhan said, in a video shared by ANI."Do they now want to divide it into North and South? People will not let such efforts succeed," the chief minister said.Gandhi, while speaking at the concluding rally of the 'Aishwarya Yatra', led by Leader of Opposition in the Kerala Assembly Ramesh Chennithala, said he learnt a lot from Kerala and understood a bit about the "wisdom of the people" here.The Congress leader said that he found the politics practised in Kerala refreshing as opposed to that of the northern part of the country."For the first 15 years, I was an MP in the north. I had gotten used to a different type of politics. For me, coming to Kerala was very refreshing as suddenly I found that people are interested in issues and not just superficially but going into detail in issues," Gandhi said.The Wayanad MP added that being a politician in Kerala has been a learning experience and pleasure."I was talking to some students in the US and I said that I really enjoy going to Kerala.

23-02-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi says BJP going soft on Left Front leaders under probe in Kerala||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday claimed that the BJP government at the Centre was going soft on Left Front leaders embroiled in several cases and accused the Marxist-led government in Kerala of practicing nepotism.Addressing the concluding session of the opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala’s state-wide yatra ahead of the assembly election, he said nepotism is the guiding spirit of the government and jobs are reserved only for Left sympathisers and workers in Kerala.“If you are a Left worker job is ensured. One can even sit at the CM’s office and smuggle gold. Nobody is there to prevent you. If you hold the CPI (M) flag you can smuggle gold sitting at the CM’s office,” he saidGandhi said that when the Left Front assumed power five years ago it said it would make the state perfect. He said the party has only made its organisation and workers perfect leaving many educated youth high and dry.He also accused chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan of not being interested in talking to job aspirants agitating outside the state secretariat.“Many youngsters are on fast for many days. The CM is least interested because they are not Left workers or sympathisers but genuine job aspirants. How can he ignore them like this? he asked.He cited slow progress in cases against Left leaders to buttress his point that the BJP was soft on the ruling dispensation in Kerala.“Central agencies are investigating many cases in Kerala. We know the fate of some of them. Why are they going so slow? Everyone can make out the reason why these cases are getting slow,” he said.Congress leaders in the state had earlier raised similar allegations pointing out tardy progress in gold smuggling, money laundering and other cases being probed by central agencies.Gandhi also pointed out that the MoU between the government owned Kerala shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation and US-based EMCC International Corporation for ₹2950 crore deep sea fishing project was cancelled on Monday after the opposition raised serious irregularities in the deal.“Like the present regime we won’t sell you. We will protect you and ensure your livelihood,” he said. He said the Congress-led United Democratic Front is busy making a people’s manifesto under the leadership of Shashi Tharoor and it will address aspirations of all and take the state to a new level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-says-bjp-going-soft-on-left-front-leaders-under-probe-101614099239941.html

Berhampur, Sambalpur and Rourkela Municipal Corporations, additional chief secretary of health and family welfare department, PK Mohapatra said despite repeated instructions and opportunities given, some registered healthcare workers and frontline workers have not taken the first dose of Covid vaccine.“Over 85% of healthcare workers have been vaccinated and the vaccination of frontline workers is ongoing with good coverage. Odisha is in third position with reference to Covid-19 vaccination of HCWs and FLWs at the national level,” said Mohapatra.He said all health care workers and front line workers who have been registered for vaccination but are now willfully refusing the same without any genuine grounds (of a contra-indication condition) will henceforth cease to enjoy the privileges granted by the Government in case of Covid infection such as free treatment, the period of isolation/treatment being counted as duty, financial and other benefits in case of death.“Odisha has claimed Covid-19 vaccine doses from Govt of India as per the numbers of health care workers and front line workers registered for vaccination If the allocated vaccines are not fully utilised, then the state would be missing out on a critical opportunity to fight the pandemic. Further, those health care workers and front line workers who remain unvaccinated put both their community and their workplace at risk of Covid transmission,” the health secretary said, asking the district officials to take steps to ensure that all HCWs & FLWs take the Covid-19 vaccine within the timeline given by MoHFW.Earlier this month, the Cuttack district administration had threatened to withhold salaries of healthcare workers if they did not get vaccinated.In a letter to the officials of Cuttack's SCB Medical College and Hospital, chief district medical officer, superintendent of Sishu Bhawan and CMC Commissioner, Cuttack district collector Bhabani Shankar Chayani had said as a large number of health workers/anganwadi workers have registered under different establishments were not turning up for the vaccination, their salary/remuneration/stipend for the month would not be drawn.The letter was withdrawn after the threat of withholding salaries triggered outrage.The vaccination has slowed down among the anganwadi workers in several districts as many of them are hesitant and unsure of its efficacy. Several anganwadi workers are also hesitant to take the shot as they feel there is no point in taking the vaccine when Odisha is reporting less than 100 Covid-19 cases everyday and the number of active Covid-19 cases have dropped below 1000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-covid-vaccine-or-else-odisha-warns-healthcare-and-frontline-workers-101614096753078.html

The protest was about a rape case in Rajasthan, where Congress government is in power.Some of the people were seen carrying placards demanding justice for the victim, an 11-year-old girl. The placards read "Beti ko Nyay Do (give justice to our daughter)". The protesters also claimed that the girl has been running pillar to post for one-and-a-half-years but nobody is listening to her.#WATCH | A group of people raised slogans during Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's address at a farmers' rally in Mathura, seeking her intervention in a rape case in Bharatpur, Rajasthan. She got down from the stage & listened to the grievances of the demonstrators. pic.twitter.com/FTfVlC8kUZAccording to Congress leaders, the incident took place in Bharatpur where the girl was allegedly gang-raped. She chose to highlight the matter in Mathura as Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was there. The Congress leader listened to the girl and later took her to Vrindavan in her car.Congress MLA Pradeep Mathur said that Vadra also spoke to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and gave "words of assurance to the girl".Vadra was in Mathura to address a Kisan Panchayat - one of the several the Congress party plans to organise in 28 districts of the state - to raise a voice against the farm laws and to support farmers' demand to repeal them.Uttar Pradesh Congress had launched the 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan' programme in the region on February 10 from Saharanpur in a Kisan Panchayat which was addressed by Priyanka Gandhi. Since then, senior leaders are addressing Kisan panchayats from district to tehsil level.The event is being looked at as Congress' attempt to gain political ground in the state.Priyanka Gandhi had earlier addressed a Kisan Panchayat in Saharanpur where she took on the central government over the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year.She has also been attacking the Centre over rise in fuel prices. On Saturday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre should name the day petrol and diesel prices do not rise as "achha din" as all other days are "expensive"."The BJP government should rename that day of the week as 'achha din' when diesel and petrol do not increase. Because, due to rising inflation, the rest of the days are 'expensive days' for common people," she said in a tweet in Hindi.The Congress has been demanding that tax on petrol and diesel be reduced and the common people given relief in prices of fuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-s-speech-in-mathura-interrupted-after-protest-over-rape-case-in-rajasthan-101614096294157.html

We must now all work together towards a peaceful and prosperous Assam. The government will do all it can to ensure that you are rehabilitated well,” Sonowal said.The militants laid down a total of 338 arms including 58 assault rifles, 4 light machine guns (LMGs) and over 11,000 rounds of ammunition.The surrender by the militants from different outfits is expected to bring lasting peace to the hill districts of Karbi Anglong, West Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao.A formal ceasefire agreement with Songbijit’s PDCK and the other four outfits is expected to be signed on Thursday at Karbi Anglong in presence of Union home minister Amit Shah, said an official who did not wish to be named.Songbijit, who had set up base in neighbouring Myanmar after leaving NDFB (S) and forming PDCK almost six years ago, is reported to have entered India earlier this month after expressing willingness to lay down arms and join the peace process.Tuliram Ronghang, chief executive member of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) is believed to have orchestrated Songbit’s return to the peace process.Songbijit has several cases lodged against him with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for killing non-Bodos and advasasis in at least eight different incidents between 2014 and 2015.Last week, JK Lijang, chairman of PDCK, had issued a statement declaring unilateral ceasefire of hostilities in order to resolve the political conflicts among stakeholders.The outfit sought general amnesty from all criminal charges against its cadres and compensatory financial grant for their rehabilitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-militant-wanted-for-multiple-killings-returns-from-myanmar-to-surrender-101614094611573.html

Nadda was reacting to Gandhi's speech in Thirvananthapuram where he was talking about the "type of politics"."A few days back he was in the Northeast, spewing venom against the western part of India. Today in the South he is spewing venom against the North. Divide and rule politics won’t work, @RahulGandhi Ji! People have rejected this politics. See what happened in Gujarat today!" Nadda said in his tweet, taking a jibe at the Congress party over the results in Gujarat civic polls.A few days back he was in the Northeast, spewing venom against the western part of India. Today in the South he is spewing venom against the North. Divide and rule politics won’t work, @RahulGandhi Ji! People have rejected this politics. See what happened in Gujarat today! https://t.co/KbxZSJ4sdtThe BJP is set to retain power in six Gujarat municipal corporations where elections were held on February 21. The party has won 334 of the 576 seats where results were declared till 5 pm.While Congress has won 36 of the declared seats so far, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), a new entrant in these elections, could win 12 seats. The AAP had fielded 470 candidates across the six corporations.Gandhi, meanwhile, is in Kerala on a two-day visit and took part in a host of events. Nadda reacted to one of his statements made in Thiruvananthapuram today."For the first 15 years, I was an MP in north. I had got used to a different type of politics. For me, coming to Kerala was very refreshing as suddenly I found that people are interested in issues & not just superficially but going into detail in issues," Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Gandhi's visit comes ahead of the assembly elections in Kerala, set to take place in April-May.For Congress, Kerala is a crucial state. In the last Lok Sabha election, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) had won 19 out of 20 seats and going by the poll history of the state, where incumbents never get a chance to continue in power, it may be the turn of the UDF but local body results really worry the party.Gandhi also took part in a programme to mark the culmination of padayatra being undertaken by state leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala.A host of BJP national leaders will also visit Kerala to partake in the 'Vijaya Yatra' rally, which was flagged off by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath earlier this week.Union home minister Amit Shah will be present at the concluding session of the rally on March 7 in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/divide-and-rule-politics-won-t-work-nadda-uses-gujarat-civic-poll-results-to-take-a-jibe-at-rahul-gandhi-101614094515763.html

This will, in turn, bring the state closer to ensuring long-term sustainability of its electricity supply," it added.The northeastern state is currently witnessing energy deficit, specially in peak hours, and one of the main reasons for this is congestion of electricity distribution and transmission networks.The Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Ltd (AEGCL), the sole transmission utility in Assam, is responsible for operation, maintenance and development of the transmission system in the state.AEGCL currently operates 66 substations with 6,882 megavolt-ampere capacity and its transmission network comprises 5,701 circuit kilometers of transmission lines.The AIIB is a multilateral development bank with a mission to improve social and economic outcomes in Asia. It began operations in January 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-signs-304-million-pact-with-aiib-for-power-transmission-network-in-assam-101614093392032.html
23-02-2021||India||Protest in Odisha assembly against fuel price hike||Protests against soaring prices of petrol and diesel, which has touched its all time high in the state, were heard both inside Odisha Assembly and outside it on Tuesday as the opposition parties demanded reduction in tax by the Centre and state to ease the burden of the consumers.They blamed both central and state governments for the situation.NSUI activists staged a demonstration here blaming the BJP-led government at the Centre for the fuel price hike, while some Congress MLAs cycled to the Assembly as a mark of protest.The party's lawmakers - Suresh Kumar Routray, Taraprasad Bahinipati and Adhiraj Panigrahi were seen riding bicycles on Lok Seva Marg on their way to the Assembly to attend the budget session.The opposition party also moved a notice for discussion on the fuel price hike in the state which was debated for about 90 minutes.Both the Central and Odisha governments are equally responsible for the fuel price hike. Both fail to feel the people's plights, Bahinipati, the Congress whip said.Blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi for creating Bure Din (bad days) for the citizens instead of Acche Din (good days) promised by him, Congress MLAs demanded that both the governments reduce tax rates to provide relief to the people who are already struggling due to the situation due to the pandemic.The agitating Congress members also pointed out that the fuel price hike has not only hit the traders, but also farmers, students, daily wage earners and other sections of the society.Odisha Finance Minister Niranjan Pujari said the tax collected on fuel by the state government is utilised for the welfare of poor people.He said GST had been imposed on all materials and services in the state barring crude oil, petrol, diesel, aviation fuel, natural gas and liquor.The Centre is collecting ₹32.90 from a litre of fuel, while Odisha government is levying ₹21.40 as 32 per cent VAT on it, he said.Pujari suggested that the Centre withdraw infrastructure cess and agricultural infrastructure development cess, ₹18 and ₹2.50 per litre respectively, to reduce fuel price.Pujari said the price of 1 litre petrol in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday is ₹91.66. While ₹33.68 is the base price fixed by the oil marketing companies, the central excise duty is ₹1.40. The additional excise duty is ₹11.Taking all these taxes into account, the central government charges ₹32.90 per litre while the states share is ₹21.40 towards 32 per cent VAT, Pujari clarified.In Bhubaneswar the price of 1 litre of diesel on Tuesday is ₹88.63. The Centre takes ₹31.80 from this amount, while Odisha gets ₹ ₹18.90 as 28 per cent VAT, Pujari said.The minister also informed the House that the price of petrol is ₹98.96 in Bhopal, ₹97.34 in Mumbai, ₹91.12 in Kolkata, ₹92.90 in Chennai, ₹94.54 in Hyderabad and Patna, ₹93.25 in Thiruvananthapuram and ₹97.47 in Visakhapatnam.Congress lawmaker Suresh Kumar Routray said the Odisha government should reduce VAT on petroleum products like in West Bengal and Chhattishgarh.Bahinipati raised questions on ruling BJDs silence on fuel price hike. When there was a raise of only 10 paise in the price of petrol, the BJD workers had hit the streets. This is not happening in Odisha now as BJD and BJP have joined hands to exploit the people.Defending the central government, BJP deputy leader in Assembly B C Sethi said that the allegations made by Congress are "politically motivated".He, however, echoed the Congress demand for reduction of VAT by the state government.Sethi said as there is no one present from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, there is no point in holding the discussion in the Assembly.The BJP lawmaker rejected the Congress allegation that the people are annoyed with Modi and claimed that as per a recent survey about 91 per cent of them appreciate him.BJP whip Mohan Majhi also defended the Centre and claimed that the funds raised from fuel price hike is being spent for welfare schemes. As many as 15.34 lakh poor people had been provided with free cooking gas in Odisha during the pandemic.Let Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik set an example by reducing the fuel price, Majhi said.Utkal Petroleum Dealers Association secretary Sanjay Lath said the fuel price hike in the state is the highest so far.A report said that petrol price has touched a record high of ₹100.29 (premium) and ₹97.14 (normal petrol) per litre in Kalimela block of Malkangiri district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protest-in-odisha-assembly-against-fuel-price-hike-101614092569839.html

23-02-2021||India||Don’t address Supreme Court judges as ‘Your Honour’: CJI to petitioner||Judges of the Supreme Court are not to be addressed as “Your Honour”, said Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde on Tuesday, explaining that such salutation befits judges of the Supreme Court of the United States or the magistrate courts in our country.The remark came while the CJI, heading a three-judge bench, was hearing a public interest petition filed by law student Shrikant Prasad. As soon as the petitioner, who sought filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary, addressed the bench as “Your Honour”, the CJI stopped him, and said, “You either have the US Supreme Court or the magistrate court here in your mind when you call us ‘Your Honour’. We do not want you to address us as ‘Your Honour’.”This is the second instance when CJI Bobde has spoken out against the use of “Your Honour”. He expressed the sentiment in August 2020 when addressed as “Your Honour”.The Bar Council of India (BCI) Rules, which regulate uniform standards of professional etiquettes to be followed by lawyers across the country, had in 2006 amended the law making it binding on lawyers to address judges of High Courts and Supreme Court as “Your Honour” or “Your Lordship”.In Part VI of the BCI Rules Governing Advocates, Chapter IIIA was added by way of a Gazette notification in May 2006 which said, “..Consistent with the obligation of the Bar to show a respectful attitude towards the Court and bearing in mind the dignity of judicial office, the form of address to be adopted whether in the Supreme Court, high courts or subordinate courts should be as follows - “Your Honour” or “Hon’ble Court” in Supreme Court and High Courts and in the Subordinate Courts and Tribunals it is open to the Lawyers to address the Court as “Sir” or the equivalent word in respective regional languages.”This amendment carried an explanation with it for introducing this change. It said, “As the words ‘My Lord’ and ‘Your Lordship’ are relics of British colonial past, it is proposed to incorporate the above rule showing respectful attitude to the Court.”Since this amendment, the Full Bench of the Rajasthan High Court in July 2019 resolved that lawyers shall be requested to “desist” from addressing judges of the High Court as “My Lord” and “Your Lordship”. Clearly, the High Court allowed the use of “Your Honour”.Lawyer bodies of the Kerala High Court and the Punjab & Haryana High Court have issued resolutions in line with the BCI amendment shedding the practice of using “My Lord” and “Your Lordship”. State Bar Councils are already bound by the 2006 Gazette notification.On one hand, while the Rules permit the use of “Your Honour”, the preference shown by the CJI in being addressed by anything other than “Your Honour” has put lawyers in a fix. In 2014, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court by a lawyer Shiv Sagar Tiwari seeking a uniform standard to be adopted across all courts in the country for addressing judges of the higher courts and subordinate judiciary. Citing the 2006 BCI Rules laying down uniform standards, Tiwari demanded that the practice of addressing Supreme Court and High Court judges as “My Lord” and “Your Lordship” must end.The top court refused to pass any order. Leaving this choice to the lawyers instead, the bench added a caveat that any form of addressing the judges should be dignified and respectful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-address-supreme-court-judges-as-your-honour-cji-to-petitioner-101614092591489.html

The report came against the backdrop of easing of tensions due to disengagement at Pangong Tso, one of the many friction points between troops of the two countries over the last nine months.“This report is factually incorrect. The government has not cleared investment from China at any level. There is no such proposal either,” the official said, pointing to a Reuters report that indicated that New Delhi was set to clear 45 investment proposals from China.The government has only cleared three foreign investment proposals from Hong Kong. Two of these are investments from Japanese companies, the third is a Non-Resident Indian group, the official said.Also Read: Indian officials explain why buzz around Prez Xi’s India visit is misplacedA foreign ministry official said any suggestion that New Delhi was ready to abruptly change its stand on foreign investment from China was grounded in an inadequate appreciation of New Delhi’s position on the border friction in the Ladakh sector.India has always maintained that peace and tranquillity at the border is a prerequisite for developing bilateral relations. The two countries have taken early steps to restore normalcy at the Ladakh border but they need to travel some distance between status quo ante is restored.New Delhi had last year responded to China’s aggressive manoeuvres in Ladakh by erecting barriers to the flow of investment from countries that share land borders with India and made it mandatory for companies based in these countries to get special approvals to get government contracts.Of the three proposals of companies based in Hong Kong that have been cleared includes Nippon paints headquartered in Japan. The foreign investors proposing investment, in this case, include Nippon Paint Holdings Co. Ltd, Japan, Nipsea International Limited, Hong Kong - it is a 100% subsidiary of Nipsea Holdings International Limited whose ultimate beneficial owners are, among others, the Goh family who are citizens of Singapore, Netherlands and Australia; and FraserHong Kong.Another FDI proposal, which is cleared is of Citizen Watches (India) Private Limited which is 100%held by Citizen Watches Company Limited, Japan.The third FDI proposal relates to Netplay Sports Private Limited, which is involved in sports, amusement and recreation activities. The foreign investors, in this case, include Allshores Capital Limited, Hong Kong owned by 2 NRIs, Sandeep Singh and Ashwin Mehta; and Rajeev Leekha, also an NRI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/indias-hasn-t-changed-its-mind-on-chinese-investment-will-make-no-exceptions-101614092083010.html

23-02-2021||India||Government says 2 new variants not behind Covid-19 surge in Maharashtra, Kerala||Two variants of SARS-CoV-2 -- N440K and E484K -- have been detected in Maharashtra and Kerala but there is no reason to believe presently that they are responsible for the surge in cases in some districts in these two states, the Centre said on Tuesday.One of the two variants has also been detected in Telangana.Addressing a press conference here, NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said that 187 people have tested positive for the UK strain of SARS-CoV-2 in the country so far, while six people have detected with the South Africa variant. Also, one person has tested positive for the Brazil variant strain.“Both the N440K and E484K variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in Maharashtra. In Kerala and Telangana also these variants have been found. Also, three other mutated strains -- one each from UK, South Africa and Brazil are already present in the country. But there is no reason for us to believe, on the basis of scientific information, that they are responsible for the upsurge of the outbreak in some districts of Maharashtra and Kerala,” Paul said.Reporting only detection does not lead to any attribution for a phenomenon on the ground because to relate the occurrence of a virus mutation to change in disease pattern, other epidemiological information and clinical information has to be linked to these mutants, Paul said, adding, “because otherwise these (mutations) happen but they have no influence on the pandemic.”He said the behaviour of mutations is being constantly and closely watched in the country and 3,500 strains have been sequenced so far.“When we are doing sequencing, we are looking for any abnormal shift in the virus character. We have been watching the mutants.“Today, based on the information and as analyzed and understood by a very eminent scientific advisory group of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), we would like to underline the fact that we do not see attribution of mutant strains to the upsurge of the infection being seen in some districts. But this is work in progress. We will continue to watch the situation with full responsibility,” Paul said.The SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) was established in December end for laboratory and epidemiological surveillance of circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the country.Stating that a large proportion of the population is still vulnerable, Paul stressed that Covid-19 appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, hand washing and not getting into mass gatherings should be followed.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that a total of 1,17,54,788 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the country till Tuesday 1 pm, with 1,04,93,205 getting the first dose and 12,61,583 being given the second dose.Bhushan said that 12 states and union territories, including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Odisha, have administered first dose of COVID-19 vaccine to more than 75 per cent of the registered healthcare workers, while 11 states and UTs, including Karnataka, Telangana, Delhi, Punjab and Chandigarh, have administered the first dose to less than 60 per cent of healthcare workers.Two states, Kerala and Maharashtra, account for 75 per cent of total active Covid-19 cases in country, and six people have been detected with South Africa strain of SARS-CoV-2 in India so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-says-2-new-variants-not-behind-covid-19-surge-in-maharashtra-kerala-101614090916645.html

23-02-2021||India||After Savitri, Maharaj becomes second leopard at SGNP to get radio collar||A six-year-old male leopard at Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) was radio-collared and released into the wild on Monday, two days after a female of the species became the first to be fitted with such a collar, park authorities said Tuesday.This is a part of the first phase of leopard radio-collaring work being carried out at SGNP to track and understand the animal’s movement, said park Director G Mallikarjuna. A total of five leopards will be radio-collared in the first phase.The leopard that was radio-collared on Monday has been named Maharaj after Chhatrapati Shivaji. Earlier on Saturday, Savitri became the first leopard in Mumbai to be radio-collared, named after the social reformer and educationist Savitribai Phule.The two-year-long project to radio-collar leopards was initiated in 2018 when the park authorities signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Wildlife Conservation Society – India (WCS). The Maharashtra government gave its nod in August 2019 following which the two-year project was to be completed in 2021. But with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was no movement on this front last year. The work finally began last week.“We are hoping that this activity will help us understand leopards better,” said Mallikarjuna.The collars work by sending a signal to a satellite, which obtains the time and date of the signal sent from the collar and this information is transmitted back to the researchers who can go and investigate where the animal is and what it is doing.The key features of this project are to obtain knowledge on how humans and leopards interact with each other and how they adapt to the presence of each other. This will also help obtain information on how leopards move across the major roads such as the Ghodbunder road, understand their use of space and time in the SGNP landscape, and provide management recommendation with respect to the way they move in the landscape and conflict mitigation based on the results of the study.Dr. Vidya Athreya from WCS, said, “This project at SGNP will give us more insights because in Mumbai a high density of people live in such close proximity to big cats. It will also help us track their pathway and understand how they cross busy roads such as the Ghodbunder Road. This will then help us manage them better to bring down mortality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-savitri-maharaj-becomes-second-leopard-at-sgnp-to-get-radio-collar-101614088387579.html

The trust I had in the judiciary of our country has increased. These were difficult days, I am glad Disha got bail,” said Manjula, mother of the 22-year-old activist.A Delhi court on Tuesday granted bail to the activist calling the evidence produced by the police “scanty and sketchy.”Disha stays with her mother in north Bengaluru’s Soladevanahalli. When asked if Disha will be returning to Bengaluru, Manjula said there has been no communication on this from the lawyers yet.“I don’t know whether she will be returning soon. I just know that she got bail and I am happy,” she said.Vineeth Vincent, a friend of Disha, reacted via text saying: "Today's decision feels like a good start to many better decisions to come. We need this in order for the judiciary to uphold our democracy."Clifton Rozario, a Bengaluru-based lawyer said that the court has done a complete takedown of the case filed by the Delhi police. “When the government is weaponizing criminal laws like UAPA and sedition, it is the court that has to stand to protect the liberties of citizens. It has done so in this case. However, there are many more like Nitin Raj, Umar and those arrested in Bhima Koregaon case who are awaiting similar justice,” he said.Disha was arrested from her residence in Bengaluru on February 13 by the Delhi police following an FIR filed on February 4 charging her with sedition, promoting enmity among people and a criminal conspiracy among others and was flown to Delhi late that evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-trust-in-judiciary-has-increased-says-disha-ravi-s-mother-101614084920988.html
23-02-2021||India||Odisha Congress MLAs cycle to state assembly in protest against fuel prices||Congress legislators in Odisha on Tuesday rode bicycles to the state assembly protesting against the rising fuel prices and demanded that the state government slash taxes on petrol and diesel, much like Chhattisgarh and Bengal have.The price of petrol is currently the highest in Kalimela of Malkangiri, where it is being sold at ₹97.45 per litre. In Bhubaneswar, it is being sold at ₹91.64 per litre.Jeypore MLA Tara Bahinipati and Khariar MLA Adhiraj Panigrahi rode cycles from Congress Bhawan to the state assembly where the budget session is on. Similarly, Jatni MLA Suresh Routray too rode the bicycle.“Chhattisgarh and West Bengal have reduced the prices. Why shouldn’t Naveen Patnaik in Odisha? Is he bearing the cost from his own pocket?... We are protesting this way to show the CM and PM Modi how the price hike in petrol and diesel rates is affecting the common man. We demand both Centre and state to slash the fuel price,” said Bahinipati.Bahinipati said the Central and the Odisha government are equally responsible for the fuel price hike. "Both the governments lack humanity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created ‘Bure Din’ for the citizens instead of ‘Acche Din’ promised by him earlier. Everyday, prices of petrol and diesel continue to witness a hike. It is burning a hole in the pockets of the common man. Both, state and Centre should immediately reduce taxes and provide relief to the people,” added Bahinipati.Fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, are now at record highs in the country, prompting cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers.Congress MLA Adhiraj Panigrahi said, “Oil price rise has affected all sections of people. I appeal to the members of BJP and BJD, including chief minister Naveen Patnaik, to use cycles to understand the problems of the common man.”Yesterday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet, reminded people that crude oil prices have not risen but fallen, and accused the Modi government of emptying the pockets of the common man to fill the pockets of its friends for free.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the steep rise in petrol prices is a vexatious issue and referred to the various aspects involved in the pricing.The Centre and States, Sitharaman said, need to work together and figure out a way to keep the retail prices at a reasonable level.State-owned fuel retailers — Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) — had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-congress-mlas-cycle-to-state-assembly-in-protest-against-fuel-prices-101614083398559.html

If it works, then we will hand over more centres to private partners under PPP mode,” Sarang said.“The state government wants to give the best health facilities to common people at minimum cost. If private partners are ready to run PHC and CHC at no profit and no loss, it is good for the common people,” he added.An officer of MP health department, who is not authorized to talk to the media, said, “The authorities of SAIMS showed interest in taking over CHC. The health department granted permission under the pilot project. If it works, some other PHC and CHC will run on PPP Mode. The private partners will develop infrastructure and improve the facilities. The private partners will not charge any money from the patients but they will earn money through Ayushman Bharat Scheme.”According to the order, “The medical college will improve infrastructure by introducing machines for dialysis, phototherapy, sonography, neonatal care and others. The private medical college is also developing an ICU with 10 beds. In case of referral, an ambulance service will also be provided to patients. Apart from government health department staff, medical college’s specialists and junior doctors will also give their services at the CHC."Vinod Bhandari, director of SAIMS said they would change the face of the community health centres under the pilot project.“We want to help the state government in improving infrastructure and we got permission only a week ago. We have started developing infrastructure at CHC. We will change the face of CHC and people of more than 150 villages will benefit from it. The health department has asked us not to charge anything from the patients. We will provide treatment to the patients under Ayushman Bharat scheme.”“We will also provide training to government staff and MBBS qualified doctors at CHC. In future, we will develop more CHC under PPP mode,” said Bhandari.But the government’s plan has come under fire from health activists who accused it of privatizing healthcare and questioned its intentions.“This project is nothing but backdoor privatization of public health facilities in MP. Earlier, the health department tried to run government health facilities in Dewas and Alirajpur through PPP Mode but it failed. The services which should be free for people now the private partners will charge money from the government for the treatment under Ayushman Bharat scheme,” aid Jan Swasthya Abhiyan convener Amulya Nidhi.Another activist Upsana Behar said, “This pilot project has so many flaws. The CHC has been handed over to SAIMS without any tender. It was more like the private medical college sought permission from the government to run a CHC and without any transparency, the government granted permission. In case of referral, all the patients from CHC will be referred to SAIMs and that only means the staff at CHC will work as agents of SAIMS.”"All these things raise questions on the intention of the state government. If the state government doesn't have any malafide intention, then they should adopt a clear and transparent process," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-hands-over-health-centres-to-pvt-medical-college-in-indore-sparks-row-101614082005343.html

"This is against an all India negative growth of 7.7 per cent," he saidHe urged the government of India to release all the performance grants due to Tamil Nadu based on the 14th Finance Commission recommendations without further delay and said the Central government has increased the share of cesses and surcharges substantially along with reducing the basic duty component in the levy of Union Excise Duties on petrol and diesel in May 2020."Although revenue to the Centre on account of various levies on petrol and diesel saw a growth of 48 per cent in the period from April-November, 2020 over the same period in 2019, Tamil Nadu has received 39.40 per cent less in the corresponding period as a share of Union Excise Duties on petrol and diesel. I personally urged the Union Finance Minister in the pre-Budget meeting held on January 18 that all cesses and surcharges should be merged with the basic rate of tax so that the States receive their due share as devolution from the Central taxes," said Panneerselvam.He said that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami also took up the issue with the Government of India."Despite this, in the Union Budget for 2021-22, the agricultural infrastructure development cess has been levied by further reducing the basic exercise duty on Petrol and diesel. We strongly urge the government of India to merge all cesses and surcharges with the basic rate of taxes and ensure that states receive their legitimate share of the revenue," he added.The Deputy Chief Minister announced ₹22,218.58 crore for the rural development sector in the interim budget. He also said that the state government has incurred a total expenditure of ₹13,352.85 crores for handling the Covid-19 pandemic, and out of the 413 recommendations given by the economic expert committee, the government has implemented 273 of them.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Congress MLAs staged a walkout from the Tamil Nadu Assembly during the presentation of the interim budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-interim-budget-presented-amid-opposition-walkout-101614081486554.html

He was arrested for his involvement during the clashes on January 26 in the farmers' tractor parade against the Centre's three new agri laws.Sidhu was previously sent to police custody on February 16 after extension of his custodial interrogation.

Several social media accounts need to be searched to identify the co-conspirators."The police had also claimed that there are videos where Sidhu can be seen at the site of the incident."He can be seen coming out with the person who hoisted the flag and congratulating him.

This is declining continuously. Positivity rate — cumulative as well as weekly and daily — is declining across the country," health ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.Bhushan also said that India has inoculated at least 1.17 crore people — 1.04 crore have been administered first dose and 12.61 lakh second dose — across the country."The active cases continue to be less than 1.50 lakh. If you look at the average of deaths taking place daily, it was 92 last week- a trend of less than 100 deaths," Bhushan said in a weekly press briefing.Flagging the two areas of concern, the health ministry had last week singled out Kerala and Maharashtra as India's challenge in controlling the daily caseload. In continuation with that, the officials again highlighted the two states and said, "There are still 2 states that have 75% active cases -Kerala and Maharashtra. Kerala has 38% of the total active cases of the country while Maharashtra has 37% of the total active cases."Karnataka has 4% and Tamil Nadu has 2.78% active cases, Bhushan said.India has 194 people infected with three known strains first found in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, officials said."A total of 187 individuals have been reported infected with UK strain, six people with South African strain and one with Brazilian strain till date," Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog's health member said.He added that the two variants have been found in India's three states."There are two variants in Maharashtra being talked about - N440 K variant and E484 K variant. These variants have been reported in Maharashtra, Kerala and Telangana," Paul said.The think-tank's health official said that the Covid-19 variants reported from other countries are not responsible for surge in Kerala and Maharashtra's tally."Based on the information available to us, yes these variants are there in the country. But there is no reason today for us to believe, on basis of scientific information, that these are responsible for upsurge of outbreak that you see in some districts of Maharashtra and Kerala," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-positivity-rate-declining-trend-of-less-deaths-seen-govt-101614080947104.html

We came here from Pakistan when the rehabilitation policy was announced. Our husbands brought us here and for the past decade there has been no forward movement on that rehabilitation policy – neither were we given citizenship nor did we get any travel documents,” said Saira Javed, a woman protestor from north Kashmir.“Our demand or request to the government is that if they accept us please provide us travel documents and citizenship and if not then they should deport those who want to go back and for those who want to stay, something should be done to them,” she said.The police intervened at Lal Chowk where the women were demanding an audience with the administration including Srinagar’s deputy commissioner Shahid Choudhary. A magistrate level officer then arrived to meet the protesters and some of them accompanied him to the DC’s office.The protesters dispersed after that and a woman claimed that the DC assured them that their demands will be raised at the appropriate forum.The protesters are part of the hundreds of women who came here with their Kashmiri husbands after the then chief minister Omar Abdullah announced a return and rehabilitation policy for former militants who were living in PoK.Many young Kashmiri men had crossed the Line of Control (LoC) into PoK in the 1990s to get arms training after insurgency started in Kashmir valley. Some had given up violence, married there and started their lives afresh.There are no official figures about the number of those who returned to Kashmir. The women say 400 of them came to Kashmir with their husbands.“The issue is that we don’t have any documents or any identity in these 11-12 years. The only identity we have is that of being the wife of a militant. Neither we nor our children can go anywhere. Neither can we send our kids to study outside. Next time there will be a bigger protest and all 400 of us will come out if the government won't listen to us,” said another protestor.Last week, some of these women had addressed a press conference to highlight their plight.Owing to opposition from Pakistan, coupled with the then Indian government’s assertion that there were ‘practical issues’ involved in implementing the rehabilitation policy, the returning men and their families were forced to take Nepal route and then by road to Kashmir with authorities going soft on the travelers.The informal entry meant there was no official recognition of their families or any documents which would help them to travel and acquire education.“Why aren’t we allowed to meet our grandparents when all other children in Kashmir can meet them? What is our fault,” said a young girl accompanying the protesters.The women said that many of the women have been divorced and husbands of some others have died.“I came here in 2012. My mother died recently and I could not go to see her one last time. Our biggest problem is that we can’t meet our relatives and family members. Parents of many women died during these years but they could not go there and see them,” said Saba Fayaz, another protestor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-spouses-of-kashmiri-men-protest-in-srinagar-seek-citizenship-or-deportation-101614076673978.html
23-02-2021||India||India a victim of terrorism, leading global action against it: S Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said action against terrorism is only possible when it is understood that terrorism can never be justified nor equating its perpetrators with victims.The foreign affairs minister also said that India has championed the global fight against terrorism having faced it as a long-standing victim.Jaishankar was addressing the high-level segment of the 46th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva."As a long-standing victim, India has been at forefront of global action against terrorism. It's possible only when there's a clear realisation, including in bodies dealing with human rights, that terrorism can never be justified nor its perpetrators ever equated with its victims," the minister said.He added that while there is a need for everyone to come together to overcome these challenges, reform in multilateral institutions and mechanisms is also important to deal with the evil effectively.Terrorism, Jaishankar said, continues to be one of the gravest threats to humankind.Lauding India's efforts in supplying Covid-19 vaccine globally, Jaishankar said, "India has pledged its vaccine manufacturing capacity to make vaccines accessible and affordable to all."From Bangladesh to Brazil and from Morocco to Fiji, the pharmacy of the world is supplying millions of vaccine doses to more than 70 countries, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-a-victim-of-terrorism-leading-global-action-against-it-s-jaishankar-101614076978060.html

In the midst of rising coronavirus infections in the state, Rathod’s supporters were seen in a video posted by news agency ANI flouting social distancing and face mask norms as they gathered around his vehicle. The supporters also clashed with the police and security personnel had to use batons to disperse the crowd, the video showed.#WATCH | Crowd gathers as Maharashtra Minister Sanjay Rathod's convoy reaches Pohradevi temple in Washim district; police baton-charge to disperse them. #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/Mh479pV6FhThe Shiv Sena leader travelled by road from his residence in Yavatmal to the Pohradevi Temple in neighbouring Washim, where he sought blessings and took part in rituals. Rathod is also the guardian minister of Yavatmal where strict restrictions have been imposed after the spike in Covid-19 infections. Along with Amravati, Yavatmal is also witnessing a surge in Covid-19 infection prompting authorities to impose strict measures to curb the spread.As the video surfaced on the internet, many people on social media sites criticised the minister’s sudden visit to the temple amid the surge in Covid-19 cases. "The strict guidelines are only for the common man, temples are blamed for rising in cases, but all this for a criminal is OK for the MVA govt," wrote one user on Twitter."Covid restrictions and safety measures only for a common Man?" asked another user.@OfficeofUT @uddhavthackeray @AnilDeshmukhNCP ....Covid restrictions and safety measures only for comman Man...??? Why and how so much gatherings are allowed???? Shocking...Meanwhile, Maharashtra’s tally of the coronavirus disease stood at 21,06,094 as of Monday evening. The death toll in the state at 51,806. It had reported 6,971 cases on Sunday in the highest single-day count in nearly four months. Out of this, 761 were reported from Mumbai city. However, after registering more than 6,000 Covid-19 cases for three days in a row, Maharashtra reported a dip in the number of daily infection on Monday as 5,210 people contracted the virus.Experts and government officials have attributed the resurgence of Covid-19 to the laxity shown by people of the state after relaxations in the Covid-19 restrictions and the reopening of social activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-spike-maharashtra-minister-defies-covid-19-norms-101614076723696.html

Joshi also accused the Congress leader and Left parties of hypocrisy ahead of polls in five states and a Union territory.The senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader’s remarks come a day after Gandhi held a tractor rally in his constituency in Kerala’s Wayanad against the Centre’s three new farm laws. “Rahul Gandhi is trying to become 'actor on tractor'. If you are in favour of APMC, then, why is there no APMC in Kerala,” news agency ANI quoted minister Joshi as saying.Also read | Rahul Gandhi targets Centre, says it is imposing its will and power on judiciaryJoshi also pointed that a new law brought by the Congress government in Punjab can potentially send a farmer behind bars. “Rahul Gandhi, your government in Punjab has brought a law under which a farmer who breaks the agreement. He could be sent to jail,” the minister said during a press conference in Kerala’s capital of Thiruvananthapuram.Similar comments were made by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on February 6 during his address in the Rajya Sabha. “Punjab Contract Farming Act provides for jail and fine up to ₹5 lakh for the farmers. In the act made by the government of India, the farmer can come out of contract farming at any time,” Tomar had said in the Upper House.Gandhi, busy with political rallies in poll-bound Kerala and Puducherry, had attacked the Centre on Monday. “These three [farm] laws are designed to destroy the agriculture system in the country and give the entire business to two or three friends of PM Modi,” he had said.Joshi also asked Gandhi to clarify his position on why the Congress party has a different alliance in different states and said politics is not just for grabbing power and having "some alliance here and some alliance there,"“The Left Democratic Front (LDF) and United Democratic Front (UDF) are fighting in Kerala. 'Kushti' in Kerala, 'dosti' in Delhi and other places. See the hypocrisy of these parties. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee is supporting Congress in Delhi but not doing the same in West Bengal as Congress has become a liability on various regional parties," Joshi.Also read | When will petrol and diesel prices drop?

23-02-2021||India||Fragmentation of tiger habitat is leading to inbreeding, low survival: Study||A new research paper has concluded that fragmentation of habitat has already disrupted the natural evolutionary process in wild tigers and will continue to do so in future as anthropogenic pressures increase, leading to higher inbreeding and lower survival.A team of researchers from Stanford University, the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in Bengaluru, and various zoological parks and wildlife NGOs sequenced 65 genomes from four of the surviving tiger subspecies—Amur tigers, Bengal tigers, Sumatran tigers and Malayan tigers—over a period of three years to gain insight into the genomic variation in tigers.The study published in journal of Molecular Biology and Evolution published on February 16 suggests that these four tiger subspecies are genetically distinct but there is inbreeding among Indian tigers, which is a result of isolated populations due to habitat loss. “What the paper points out is that although Indian tigers as a whole (all Indian tigers looked at in this study) have the highest amount of variation compared to any other subspecies, some Indian tigers do show signs of possible inbreeding or founding events (loss of genetic variation). We do not see this, by comparison, in the Russian far east or Amur tigers. They have very low variation, but individuals do not appear to be inbred,” explained Uma Ramakrishnan, co-senior and co-corresponding author, NCBS. Another co-author from India is YV Jhala, Wildlife Institute of India’s faculty of wildlife science dean.Also Read | Mumbai’s Byculla zoo reopens after Covid shutdown, draws 1,400 visitors on Day 1Several individual tigers in India had low genetic variation, suggesting possible inbreeding, but tigers from northeast India were the most different from other populations in India.Genomes of Amur tigers suggest adaptation to the extreme cold, while those of Sumatran tigers suggest adaptation based on body size, which is comparatively smaller. “The tiger is an excellent example of the myriad historic events that sculpt species’ genomic diversity and points to the importance of understanding this diversity as we attempt to stave off extinction of our most precious species on Earth. While some populations demonstrate the importance of adaptation to local conditions, other evidence suggests that particular populations may suffer the effects of climatic change in the Anthropocene,” co-senior author Elizabeth Hadly of Stanford University said in a statement issued by NCBS.The study suggests that extreme fragmentation and high human population density in India has resulted in isolated populations, where individuals may be more likely to mate with relatives (inbreeding). In contrast, despite low Amur tiger population densities in the Russian Far East, individual movement is not hindered by significant barriers and there is less inbreeding.“Tigers will continue to lose genetic variation. Further, inbreeding due to living in small and isolated populations could cause inbreeding depression, or lowered survival. We do not have any evidence for inbreeding depression yet, but it is something we should study,” Ramakrishnan added.The paper has recommended managing local populations by minimising anthropogenic pressures as a conservation strategy for future. “In summary, ongoing human impacts like fragmentation will likely continue to disrupt natural evolutionary processes in wild tigers. Managing local populations to minimise human impact may be the key to species survival, and the important conservation strategy for the Anthropocene. Additional historical and genomic sampling may provide an informed roadmap for genetic rescue and augmentation.”Genetic variation is like money in the bank: the more you have, the better your chances of survival in the future. Population bottlenecks decrease genetic variation, especially in endangered species, the NCBS statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fragmentation-of-tiger-habitat-is-leading-to-inbreeding-low-survival-study-101614075757765.html

A scuffle ensued and the petitioner tried to pacify the situation but to no avail, it said.The petitioner alone was caught and arrested by police officials. She was beaten, tortured and suffered multiple injuries, it claimed.The petitioner was taken to the police station in the absence of any woman police official and was beaten up by police officials, the plea alleged.Kaur was arrested in Haryana's Sonipat on January 12, the Haryana police had earlier said.Sonepat police officials had also said that a police team was attacked with sticks when they reached the site and some policemen sustained injuries in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bail-plea-nodeep-kaur-claims-she-was-beaten-and-tortured-by-police-101614073439736.html

Addressing the 66th convocation of IIT Kharagpur in West Bengal virtually, Modi said, “ You will face many questions on the road you have chosen – is this the right path? Will there be a loss? Will there be a waste of time? The answer to these questions is Self-Three: Self-awareness, self-confidence and selflessness. Identify your capabilities and move forward with a selfless attitude.” Modi said that India can become a major player in the field of science, technology, research, and innovation in the world. “In the fight against Corona, the software solutions developed by IIT are helping the country. You will have to work on health front. I am not just talking about gadgets. I am taking about an ecosystem. We have to give solutions to the nation starting from prevention to cure,” he said. Also Read | PM Modi pushes PPP model for ‘aatmanirbhar’ health sectorThere is a huge market of personal health care equipment as people have started monitoring their blood pressure, sugar and oxygen levels at home, he said. “We also need to come up with technologies which can offer affordable and accurate solutions,” he added. Floating the idea of a clean cooking movement based on solar power, the Prime Minister also said at least 250 million households in India still use chullah [traditional clay stove]. “If we get success here, then the search for cheaper batteries for electric vehicle can be cross subsidised. Who else can do this work if not the youths of IIT?” he asked. Referring to the recent Uttarakhand glacier burst, Modi said the country needs to think how to make its infrastructure resilient, starting from small houses to big bridges. “IITs should not just remain as Indian Institute of Technology but should work to become Institute of Indigenous Technology and take it to the next level. The more our IITs do research and come up with solutions to meet the challenges of India, the more they would become a medium of global application,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-s-new-mantra-for-iit-students-selfthree-101614073237769.html

The Prime Minister said that if IITs start addressing the problems India is currently facing then it will also gradually be able to address global issues. He added that India’s large population provides a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to exercise their ideas.“IITs have to be taken to the next level so that they not only remain Indian Institute of Technology (IITs) but also become Institutes of Indigenous Technologies. If IITs address problems that Indians are facing then they can also address global issues. If experiments are successful in India, then globally they are bound to be a success,” the Prime Minister said while addressing the 66th convocation of IIT Kharagpur in West Bengal.He said that as engineers students of IIT have the ability to study problems at different levels. He said that engineers can study the pattern of a problem and can provide long term solutions. “As an engineer, you have the ability to move things from patterns to patents. That is, in a way, you have the vision to see subjects in more detail. In this way, you have the vision to see subjects in a more detailed way,” the Prime Minister added.PM Modi in his address also asked students to practice three mantras. He said that students should follow the goals set by them in their lives by following the mantras of self-confidence, self-awareness and selflessness. “You have to become startups to bring about a change in the lives of people. You have to work on self three - self-awareness, self-confidence and selflessness. You should recognise your potential and move forward, move ahead with full confidence, move ahead with selflessness,” he said.During his address, PM Modi also asked students to develop infrastructure which can withstand the effects of natural disasters. “Climate change is a major challenge before the world. India drew the attention of the world to the issue of disaster management. You can see what happened recently in Uttarakhand.

Gandhi, who is the party's general secretary in-charge of UP, had visited Prayagraj on Sunday to meet the members of the community.“The real claimants and protectors of the river are the people of the Nishad community. In Banswara, Prayagraj, we will fight against the oppression of UP police and for the rights of Nishad society. The Nishad families whose boats have been demolished will be provided with a financial assistance of ₹10 lakh,” Gandhi said in a series of tweets.Gandhi announced that Congress will organise a ‘Nadi Adhikar Yatra (Right to the river rally) in support of the Nishad community. Adding that since Nishads have a primary right over the resources of the river, a cooperative society should be formed for legalising and regulating sand mining activities in the Yamuna river. “Congress will take out the Nadi Adhikar Yatra for the rights of the Jan Nishad community. Nishads have the primary rights over the resources of the river. With this idea in mind we demand the formation of a Nishadraj Cooperative Society for sand mining activities,” she tweeted.The Nishad community is a caste group listed under Other Backward Classes (OBC) in UP. It subsumes many castes and subcastes, such as the Mallahs, Binds, Manjhis, Kewats, Kashyaps, Turhas, Majhwas, Bathams, among others. These communities are all primarily engaged in fishing and boating, as well as farming along the river banks. Many Nishads are also engaged in daily-wage labour such as sand mining.Nishads are heavily dependent on the tourism industry as they ferry tourists in the famous ghats of Varanasi and Prayagraj. In early February during a drive against illegal sand mining in the Yamuna river, the UP police had damaged boats plied by the community.In 2013, the National Green Tribunal stopped the extraction of sand from rivers using heavy machinery, but companies continued mining activities using small boats. The UP government had in June 2019 banned the use of small boats in sand mining, which coupled with the pandemic induced lockdown financially crippled the river-reliant Nishad community. Nishads have been demanding mining contracts for its community members from Yogi Adityanath’s government.Gandhi had lent her support to their demands during her Prayagraj visit. "If the mining mafia is allowed to mine here, why can't those, who live here, who have a right on contracts, on this land, on this river, work here," she had said.In the 152-member assembly of UP, Nishads hold considerable sway. In both the 2014 and 2019 general elections, Nishads had supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Nishad Party president’s son Praveen Nishad is a sitting member of Parliament, who joined BJP after walking out of the Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party alliance in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-after-dip-in-sangam-priyanka-gandhi-continues-outreach-in-nishad-community-101614072525218.html

The condition of the farmers continues to deteriorate. It is Kejriwal who speaks the language of middlemen," said Lekhi.The BJP leader reiterated that Kejriwal wishes that the farmer keeps committing suicide, should never get a better price for their crops and their condition continue to worsen."The farm laws have been brought out to exclude middlemen and their corrupt practices. However, Kejriwal ji opts to speak in favour of these middlemen. I do not think that he is working in our country's interest or in the interest of the farmers.

23-02-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi targets Centre, says it is imposing its will and power on judiciary||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi once again targeted the central government on Tuesday and accused it of imposing its will and power on the judiciary in Delhi. Gandhi also said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government is "not allowing the judiciary to be or do what it must." "Not just courts, they do not allow discussions in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha either and drop elected governments repeatedly," Gandhi said in Mallapuram."For the first time, winning the election means losing and vice-versa," the Congress leader, who is on a two-day visit to poll-bound Kerala, said.Gandhi’s comments come a day after Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy resigned after falling short of the majority in the assembly. The Narayanasamy government lost the majority after five Congress and one Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) legislators resigned. Since 2019, Congress has lost power similarly in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.It also comes in the backdrop of farmers' protests continuing for more than two months now. The farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are agitating against the contentious farm laws which were passed by the voice vote in Parliament in September last year amid uproar by opposition.The central government has projected the laws as "historic reforms" in the agriculture sector that will work in favour of farmers by removing middlemen and giving them the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, farmers fear that it will put them at the mercy of the big corporates and will remove the Minimum Support Price (MSP).Earlier in the day, Gandhi had slammed the government for its plans to privatise railways. Terming it as a "threat to millions of poor people who travel using our railways", Gandhi said, "It is also going to create a problem for millions of employees who work for the Railways.""Railways are a fundamental part of our country. Railways do not belong to one person, they belong to the whole country. It allows millions of people to travel cheaply...I noticed in the last Budget that the government is intent on privatising this Indian asset," he also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-targets-centre-says-it-is-imposing-its-will-and-power-on-judiciary-101614070974894.html

23-02-2021||India||Indian officials explain why buzz around Prez Xi’s India visit is misplaced||South Block is flummoxed by reports about Chinese President Xi Jinping’s possible visit to India for the Brics summit as neither the dates nor the format has been decided given that the coronavirus pandemic is showing no signs of abating, people aware of the matter said.The buzz around President Xi’s possible visit to the summit of the five-nation group comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa was triggered by positive comments of the Chinese spokesperson about relations with India on Monday. The spokesperson also expressed Beijing’s support to host this year’s meeting though he hadn’t responded to a direct question about President Xi’s visit to Delhi.Pangong Tso disengagement: Why China blinked?Indian officials said that it was too early to speculate.“The dates of the BRICS summit have still not been decided. Once the date and the format, virtual or physical, has been decided by India, only then consultations will be held with Russia, China, South Africa and Brazil. As it is, President Vladimir Putin and President Xi Jinping are not travelling outside their countries due to the global pandemic,” said a senior official at the ministry of external affairs.Diplomats based in Moscow told Hindustan Times that the no Brics dates were mentioned by visiting foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to his Russian interlocutors either. “Not even the dates of the annual India-Russia summit have been finalised due to the pandemic,” said a senior diplomat.India assumed the rotating chairmanship of the Brics forum on January 1, 2021, taking over from Russia, which hosted the last summit as an online event in November 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic.India’s assumption of Brics leadership, the third time since the group was formed in 2006, comes at a time when New Delhi’s relations with Beijing are facing their worst challenge in decades. Troops of the two neighbours had been engaged in a standoff for over nine months and have only now started disengaging from one of the friction points; the south and north banks of Pangong lake.While Beijing would like to portray that it was business as usual after the Pangong Tso disengagement, Indian military commanders are not so convinced and are still wary of the intentions of PLA commanders till such time there is complete peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also Read: What Pangong means for Asian geopoliticsChina’s approach all along the past nine months has been to delink the bilateral relationship with border friction to revive the economic relations. The Indian stand is quite the opposite and stresses that peace and tranquillity on the border is the prerequisite to a normal bilateral relationship. It is in this context that India wants status quo ante to be restored all along the LAC before the revival of ties, a position that has been agreed to by Chinese interlocutors during the backchannel talks.While much of the speculation around President Xi possible visit for the Brics summit has been flagged as a breakthrough in bilateral relations, officials underline that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has shown no signs of withdrawing troops from anywhere along the 3,488 km long LAC except Pangong Tso. The Chinese military infrastructure build-up all along the eastern sector across Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh is showing no signs of receding with the PLA redeploying forces for tactical reasons. There is no change of force in either the Depsang Bulge area or the Gogra-Hot Springs area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buzz-around-prez-xi-s-visit-surprises-india-says-no-dates-for-brics-summit-yet-101614070583354.html

23-02-2021||India||When will petrol and diesel prices drop? Oil minister Pradhan weighs in||Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Tuesday prices of petrol and diesel have gone up after fluctuation in the international markets and will eventually come down. “Due to an increase in prices of crude oil in international markets, consumer price (for petrol and diesel) has risen. This will soften gradually. Global supply was reduced due to Covid in turn affecting production as well,” Pradhan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“We are consistently requesting the GST Council to include petroleum products under its purview as it will benefit people. But it is their call to take,” the oil minister added.Petrol and diesel prices have been increasing continuously for more than 10 days and in some states, the price of petrol has even crossed ₹100. Petrol price has already surged past the ₹100-mark in some places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, states which levy the highest Value Added Tax (VAT) on the fuel. The price of petrol touched an all-time high of ₹97 per litre in Mumbai last Saturday and the diesel rate crossed the ₹88-mark. It was the 12th straight day of price hikes and the largest daily increase since oil companies started to revise rates on a daily basis in 2017.Also read | Why are prices of petrol and diesel increasing? Petroleum minister explainsPetrol and diesel prices were up again in the national capital and stood at ₹90.83 and ₹81.32 per litre, respectively on Tuesday. Petrol price was raised by ₹25 paise while that of diesel by ₹35 paise. The price of liquefied petroleum 14.2kg domestic cylinder was also raised by ₹50 per unit in Delhi on February 14, taking the cost of LPG gas to ₹769 per cylinder.Opposition parties have held protests in different parts of the country over the rise of prices of diesel and petrol. Congress president Sonia Gandhi last Sunday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convey "every citizen's anguish and deep distress regarding the spiralling fuel and gas prices."Also read | Jharkhand petroleum dealers body demands reduction of VAT on dieselResponding to Gandhi’s letter, Pradhan pointed out the issue of taxation in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, states where the Congress party is in power on its own or as part of an alliance. “Sonia ji must know Rajasthan and Maharashtra have maximum tax.

23-02-2021||India||SC adjourns hearing on CBI plea against discharge of Kerala CM, others in graft case||The Supreme Court Tuesday adjourned the hearing on CBI's plea against the discharge of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and two others in a graft case related to awarding of a contract to Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin when he was the power minister.A bench headed by Justice U U Lalit deferred the matter to April 6 after Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, appearing for the CBI, sought adjournment in the matter."I am engaged in a part heard matter in another court. Please have it next week," the ASG said.The bench then posted the hearing to April 6.The case pertains to allegations of corruption and causing a loss of ₹374.50 crore to the state Exchequer in awarding of a contract to SNC-Lavalin when Vijayan was the power minister in 1996.The top court had earlier asked the CBI to come up with very strong grounds against the discharge of Vijayan and two others in the SNC Lavalin graft case.The high court and the lower court have held that they should not be tried in the matter.The CBI said this was a cross-appeals matter filed in 2017 and it will file a comprehensive note giving the factual aspect of the matter.On August 23, 2017, the Kerala High Court had upheld the discharge of Vijayan in the SNC Lavalin graft case, saying the CBI had "wrongly picked" him as prima facie there was no case against him. The high court had also upheld the discharge of two others in the case while rejecting the CBI's plea that their full-fledged trial was necessary to prove the conspiracy.The high court's verdict had come in a revision petition filed by the CBI in 2014 challenging the discharge of Vijayan and five others in the case by a special CBI court in Thiruvananthapuram.The CBI special court, Thiruvananthapuram, had in November 2013 discharged Vijayan and others.The probe agency had filed the charge sheet in the case arguing that there was sufficient evidence to prove the charges against the accused.The discharge by the special court was 'illegal', CBI had stated in its revision petition.The special judge had ruled that the CBI had failed to prove the charges of conspiracy and corruption levelled against Vijayan and other accused.The CBI had argued before the high court that a trial was must to prove the conspiracy in giving the contract to revamp the power projects to the Canadian firm when Vijayan was power minister in 1996.Claiming that the conspiracy was hatched at different stages in awarding the contract, the CBI had assailed the lower court order discharging Vijayan and six others and said a full-fledged trial was necessary to prove the conspiracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-adjourns-hearing-on-cbi-plea-against-discharge-of-kerala-cm-in-graft-case-101614069867022.html

The last year was a test, particularly for the health sector, but I am happy to announce that India managed to pass the test successfully as it managed to save lives and create testing infrastructure in a few months, with currently 2,500 labs active for Covid-19 testing and 210 million tests administered so far,” said Modi.What is PM Modi’s ‘self-3’ solution for students? Watch to find outGiving credit to the private sector as well, Modi said the successful handling of Covid-19 pandemic in India has been possible because of the collaboration between the government and the private sector.Also Read | How states are stepping up as Covid-19 cases rise“Covid-19 has taught us that we don’t have to just fight this pandemic but also be prepared to handle such epidemics in the future. We have to keep India ready for any eventuality, which is why it is equally important to strengthen the health sector. From medical equipment to medicines, from ventilators to vaccines, from scientific research to surveillance infrastructure, and from doctors to epidemiologists, we have to focus on each and every segment so that we are better prepared to deal with any health emergency in future,” Modi said.He added that PM Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojna (PMANSBY) has been initiated keeping this focus in mind.“Under this scheme, from research to testing and treatment, the idea is to establish an advanced ecosystem within the country. PMANSBY will increase our strength in every spectrum. Based on the 15th finance commission recommendations, our local bodies will get more than ₹70,000 crore to strengthen health sector services. The government’s focus is not merely on investing in the health sector but also to ensure health services are accessible in the remotest parts of the country,” he said.Modi also mentioned that the government was aware that investing in the health sector would also increase employment opportunities in the long run.“The world has noticed India displaying its strength in the health sector during the pandemic in great detail,. Globally, the reputation and trust in India’s health sector has reached the next level. We have to be future-ready keeping in mind this trust. In future the demand for Indian doctors, nurses and paramedics globally is going to further increase. Made-in-India medicines and vaccines have also garnered trust among global community. We have to make preparations keeping this in mind,” said Modi.He also said that India’s medical education system will become more popular and more students will come to study medicine here, and that needs to be encouraged.“Due to Covid-19, India gained expertise in manufacturing ventilators and other equipment. The country will have to act fast to be able to handle the global demand, especially to make cost-effective medical devices that the world needs,” he said.Emphasising on public-private partnerships, Modi said that the government’s budget is a catalytic agent but it will work better if everyone cooperates.Modi also said that the government’s approach towards the health sector was holistic. “Earlier, the health sector was handled in a fragmented manner but our government has adopted an integrated approach towards health, which is why we are not merely focusing on treatment but also wellness. From prevention to cure, we have adopted an integrated approach,” said Modi.To keep India healthy, Mode added, the government has adopted a four-pronged strategy.“The first strategy is the prevention of illness and promotion of wellness, for which there have been initiatives such as Swachch Bharat Abhiyan, focus on yoga, care and treatment facilities for pregnant women and newborns, drinking water and sanitation etc. The second strategy is to make effective and affordable treatment accessible for the poorest of the poor, for which there are Ayushman Bharat insurance and Jan Aushadhi schemes. The third focus area is improving health infrastructure and increasing the quantity and quality of healthcare professionals, for which the government has made efforts in the past six years to expand AIIMS and AIIMS-like institutions in remote states; and the fourth strategy is to look for solutions in a time-bound manner and in mission mode, such as immunisation coverage or achieving the tuberculosis elimination target of 2025 etc.,” said Modi.Another focus area, said Modi, is Ayush. He added that India’s traditional medicines are becoming popular globally, and Ayush needs to be expanded further as India’s traditional medicines are herb-based with no side-effects.“It is a moment of pride for India that WHO is starting its global centre of traditional medicine in India. WHO has announced it and it is under process. It is time to take accessibility and affordability to the next level,” he said.Modi also said that the use of advanced technologies in the health sector also needs to be increased, with a special focus on digital health mission. This transformation is necessary for India to become aatmanirbhar (self-reliant).“India may be called the pharmacy of the world, but even today we are reliant on foreign countries for raw material of drugs and medical devices, which hampers the process of providing cheap drugs and medical equipment to the poor. We have to look for a solution to this problem, as India needs to be made self-reliant in this field. Steps are being taken, that was also mentioned in the budget, and companies are being provided production-linked incentives for producing raw material for drugs and medical devices in the country; and mega parks for manufacturing drugs and medical devices are also getting a good response. We have to reach every single citizen,” said Modi.India will be working at different levels, be it creating wellness centres, district hospitals, critical care centres, health surveillance infrastructure, advanced laboratories, or telemedicine facilities.“When centre, state governments, local bodies and the private sector come together then we will get better results. We have to devise solutions together and fast in the health sector, keeping in mind the poor of the country,” said Modi.He also said that from April 1 all initiatives announced in the Union Budget will be implemented across the country, and February and March should be used for making preparations for implementing all initiatives mentioned in the budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pushes-ppp-model-for-aatmanirbhar-health-sector-101614069576865.html

23-02-2021||India||Maharashtra records sudden jump in Covid-19 cases, triggers panic||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s office on Sunday morning announced he will address the state that evening at 7pm. As soon as the message was aired on television, tweets, Facebook posts, WhatsApp messages across Mumbai, Pune, and other cities wondered whether another lockdown was in the offing amid what has been unofficially been referred to as the second wave of Covid-19.From February 10, Maharashtra, which was until then witnessing a flattening of both new and active cases, began recording a jump in infections. From February 1 to 9, Maharashtra recorded an average of 2,489 cases a day. In the same period, active cases fell from 43,701 to 34,640. Due to faster recovery numbers, active cases fell to 30,265 on February 11.But from February 10, the number of infections has only risen. Since then, until February 22, Maharashtra has added 59,937 new cases, averaging 4,610 cases daily. Active cases have risen to 53,113. As many as 22,848 cases have been reported in 11 days.Also Read | How states are stepping up as Covid-19 cases riseIn terms of the proportion of deaths, too, Maharashtra is the worst-hit in the country. On Friday, 44 of India’s 100 Covid-19 deaths (44%) were in Maharashtra. Overall, of the 144,329 deaths recorded in India till February 22, Maharashtra accounts for 53,113 or 36.8%.The government and the local bodies have been alarmed at the rise, most of which has been reported in Vidarbha, Pune, and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which includes Thane district, one of the largest in India.What has led to the spike?Health department officials say that they have been unable to pinpoint the exact reasons for the sudden surge. Some of them attribute it to laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour, weather, a possible mutation of the virus in the Vidarbha region, local elections, and social events such as weddings that were put on hold in 2020.The health department has sent over 350 random samples from the worst-affected districts for genome sequencing to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to “better understand if there was a mutation of the virus.”Earlier this month, a genome sequencing study by the BJ Medical College in Pune suggested an E484K in one sample from Amravati and N440K mutation in another from Yavatmal. The state government on February 19 denied the presence of any foreign mutants in Amravati, Yavatmal and Pune districts.As per the state health department data, Akola’s active cases have more than doubled between February 15 and 22 from 809 to 1,981. Amravati’s active cases rose from 3,090 on February 15 to 5,404 on February 22.Mumbai, too, reported a jump of 11.42% in active cases between February 10 (5,372) and February 22 (5,986). Mumbai’s overall caseload is now 319,889, the highest for any city in the country, except if you count Delhi as a city and not a state where the caseload on February 22 was 638,028.Maharashtra’s state surveillance officer, Pradeep Awate, said besides faster transmission and cold weather that is conducive for the increase in viral activity, laxity and increased movement of people could have led to the spike in cases. “There have been functions, get-togethers, weddings with 500-1000 attendees. In January, we had elections to over 14,000 Gram Panchayats, where the turnout was 80%. The movement of people has increased, coupled with a lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour. This has led to an increase,” he said.Awate added that the reports that there was mutation were unfounded. “The medical college where the samples were sent was unauthorised. Meanwhile, we are still studying the sequencing. Over 350 samples from Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Pune, etc, have been sent to NIV in Pune,” he said.Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force, echoed Awate’s assessment. He added this is just a “blip” in the first wave, which can be brought under control if protocols are strictly followed.“There are a complex set of things that triggered this spike,” he said. “I do not think this is a second wave. This is a blip in the first wave, which had never really gone away. If we go back to our Covid-appropriate behaviour and with micro-geographic lockdowns, I think we will see the cases come down in a two-week period. But this should happen in the true spirit. If this is not followed, then this can turn really ugly,” Pandit warned.He said cities such as Amravati, Yavatmal, Akola, etc, had not seen viral activity as much as the state had seen in the earlier part of the outbreak. Amravati (both the city and district) has never seen such a rise during the entire pandemic. Even when the cases peaked in the state in September, the situation in the district was not like it is today.On September 11, when the state reported the highest cases--24,886--the district had 545. On February 20, 21 and 22, it reported 1,055, 926 and 649 cases. The positivity rate of the district is 29.8.%.In regions such as Vidarbha bordering Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, social activities like weddings put on hold for almost a year due to Covid restrictions have been blamed for the spike.“With the relaxation of the lockdown and start of the vaccination, people started behaving carelessly,” said Suresh Asole, district health officer, Akola. “People have been attending wedding and family functions without wearing masks. This may have contributed to spreading the virus to a large population. Along with that, we have increased the daily testing. So, with more testing, the daily count of new Covid-19 cases would increase.”Similarly, in the MMR, which includes Mumbai and six neighbouring cities, and Pune district, the cases have surged over the last few days. MMR reported a jump of 45.29% in its active caseload between February 15 and 22. The Thane district, which has five municipal corporations and a substantial rural belt, has seen an increase in active cases by 26.5% during the same period.Authorities said cases have gone up after local train services were opened to the general public from February 1. Over three million people have been travelling daily on the trains that run across Mumbai and parts of MMR.Pune district saw a 52% rise in active cases.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) took stock of its preparedness on Monday, four days after it issued a new set of strict guidelines for the city. It warned cases will be filed against those breaking home quarantine rules. BMC said new containment zones will be created in buildings with over five Covid-19 cases. It will allow the police to penalise people for not wearing masks in public places.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “The availability of beds is at 75% now. We took stock of laboratories, jumbo Covid facilities, private hospitals and have decided to maintain the preparedness that was there in September... The laboratories have been directed to turn in reports within 24 hours. They must ensure proper contact details with PIN code mentioned so that tracing patient does not take more time.”Pandit said the protocol to contain the rise in cases is no different for Mumbai and MMR than the rest of the states. “It is no different than what we are doing in other places. We have controlled it once and we can do it now. Masking and micro containment zones will help tremendously,” he said.The overall mortality rate in the state has decreased from 2.56% on January 1 to 2.47% on February 21. Also, districts like Pune, Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola that are recording the highest positivity rate in the state have also witnessed a decrease in mortality during the same period.“Since the start of February, the state-wide testing has been increased. With the rise in testing, it is accepted that the new Covid-19 cases would also increase. So, there is nothing to be scared of,” said Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid-19 task force.He said in Amravati, the mutation can be a reason for the faster spread of the virus. “But so far, we have not seen any mutation in Mumbai or Pune. However, samples have been sent for analysis so. We have to wait for that.”Unlike the beginning of the pandemic, the severity of infection among patients has gone down. “Though recently the number of admissions has increased, we are not witnessing many deaths,” said St George’s Hospital medical superintendent Akash Khobragade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-sudden-jump-in-covid-19-cases-triggers-panic-101614066816825.html
23-02-2021||India||Toolkit case: Delhi court to rule on Disha Ravi's bail plea today||A Delhi court is likely to pronounce its verdict on Tuesday on the bail plea of climate activist Disha Ravi, arrested by the Delhi Police in connection with the toolkit case. The Delhi Police allege that the online document was created to defame India and spread misinformation among people.Earlier in the day, Ravi was brought to the Delhi Police Cyber Cell office to be confronted with the two other suspects -- Shantanu Muluk and Nikita Jacob. Both are now out on transit bail and police say they may arrest them again if need be.On February 21, the court heard the arguments during which police have Ravi's bail plea vehemently, while her counsel has rubbished all the charges levelled against her.During the hearing, the judge asked the police whether there is evidence that proves the link between the tool kit and Republic-Day violence in Delhi. Additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju, appearing on behalf of the Delhi Police, replied that the document will have to be read along with the hashtags and links it contained, which were meant to "instigate people asking them to come on streets thus resulting in public disorder". The police further said that they have arrested seven people and an investigation is on."The toolkit says that people should join the march of Republic Day. Police gave permission for the march and if I call people to join the march, then can I be called seditious?" Ravi’s counsel asked while rejecting the allegations of instigating violence.The 22-year-old Ravi used to volunteer for Fridays for Future (FFF), an organisation founded by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. She used to help with the organisation's event management work in Bengaluru. The document was first publicised by Thunberg on Twitter.Ravi was arrested on February 13 night along with two other activists. The police have claimed that the toolkit was in support of the farmers’ agitation against the three contentious laws and created with an aim to spread misinformation and incite unrest. Police also alleged a link between the tool kit and the clashes that occurred in the national capital on Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-delhi-court-to-rule-on-disha-ravi-s-bail-plea-today-101614065589425.html
23-02-2021||India||Study suggests loss of habitat is leading to inbreeding of Indian tigers||While Indian tigers have the highest genetic variation compared to other subspecies of the feline across the world, their populations continue to be fragmented by loss of habitat, leading to inbreeding and potential loss of this diversity, says a new study that may inform conservation strategies."As human population started expanding, so also their signatures on the land. We know that some of these signatures would result in disrupting the ability of tigers to move," Uma Ramakrishnan, co-author of the research, published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, told PTI.According to Ramakrishnan, molecular ecologist and assistant professor at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, this habitat loss from human activities leads to tigers being "hemmed into their own protected area.""Now, they can only mate with the other tigers in their own population. Over time, this will result in inbreeding, they will end up mating with their relatives," she explained."Whether this inbreeding compromises their fitness, their ability to survive, we do not yet know," the molecular ecologist added.While genetic diversity across a population improves their chances of survival in the future, the study said population fragmentation of tigers can decrease this variation, and endanger them further.Although tigers have received significant conservation attention, the scientists said very little is known about their evolutionary history and genomic variation, especially for Indian tigers.With 70 per cent of the world's tigers living in India, the researchers said understanding the genetic diversity of tigers in the country is critical to the feline's conservation worldwide.The results of their three-year long study offer insights into genomic variation in tigers and the processes that have sculpted it.Based on the results, the scientists believe there have been relatively recent divergences between subspecies, and intense population bottlenecks that may have contributed to inbred individuals.According to the NCBS scientist, maintaining structural connectivity, enabling tigers to move between protected areas can help overcome these bottlenecks."This would require the right types of habitat between protected areas, for example having densely populated human settlements would not work. Further, there also needs to be functional connectivity, that tigers do actually move," Ramakrishnan added.In the study, the scientists sequenced whole genomes from 65 individual tigers from four subspecies of the feline, and conducted a variety of population genomic analyses that quantify genetic variability.They investigated the partitioning of genetic variation, possible impacts of inbreeding, and demographic history, and possible signatures of local adaptation.While the total genomic variation in Indian tigers was higher than in other subspecies, the study found that several individual tigers in the country had low variation, suggesting possible inbreeding.According to the research, tigers from northeast India were the most different from other populations in India"Given our results, it is important to understand why some Bengal tigers appear inbred and what the consequences of this are," said Anubhab Khan, co-first author of the research.The study showed recent divergences between tiger subspecies, within the last 20,000 years, which the scientists believe is concordant with increasing human impacts across Asia and a transition from glacial to interglacial climate change in the continent.However, the scientists believe this finding needs to be investigated further with expanded data and analyses of more tiger genomes."Most studies focusing on species of conservation concern use limited numbers of specimens to try to gain understanding into how genomic variation is partitioned," said Ellie Armstrong, co-first and co-corresponding author of the study from Stanford University in the US.  "It is clear from our work here, and a growing number of other studies, that it is crucial to increase our sampling efforts and use caution when interpreting results from limited sample sizes," Armstrong added.According to Ramakrishnan, the genomic variation of Indian tigers continues to be shaped by the ongoing loss of connectivity."Population management and conservation action must incorporate information on genetic variation. I hope doing so will help India maintain the gains in tiger conservation achieved so far," Ramakrishnan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-suggests-loss-of-habitat-is-leading-to-inbreeding-of-indian-tigers-101614064865294.html

23-02-2021||India||Congress’ balancing act in Rajasthan: Navigating Ram Temple and Hindutva||With its proactive approach in getting mining clearance from the Centre for a particular stone being used in the construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya, the Rajasthan government is sending a signal on how the Congress will navigate the issue of Hindutva, according to party leaders and political observers.Pink sandstone mined from the Banshi Pahadpur hills in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan was being supplied to Ayodhya for the construction of the Ram temple. Mining in this area was banned after it was notified as a sanctuary in December 1996. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had been pressuring the Bharatpur district administration for resuming the supply of the stone since September-October 2020, soon after the process of temple construction began.Also Read | Ayodhya’s ‘Maryada Purushottam Sriram airport gets ₹101 crore in budgetSensing the issue might snowball against it, the Congress-led state government, at the end of January, initiated the process to de-notify the forest area. A survey, which had found that there were no animals or forests in the area, was made the basis for seeking the de-notification from the Union ministry of forest and environment. In seeking the de-notification after a 24-year ban, the Congress government apparently did not want to be seen as a hurdle in the construction of the temple.Earlier, this month, the student outfit of Congress, National Students’ Union of India launched a campaign, ₹1 Ram Ke Naam, to collect monetary contributions from students for the construction of the temple.The Rajasthan government’s move has prompted Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders to claim that it showed that the Congress had accepted Hindutva. For its part, the Congress has claimed that it was the original proponent of the Ram Temple and is keen to take credit for respecting the Hindu faith.Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, “If the stone is going for Ram temple, then what is wrong with it? The Congress is not anti-Hindu, and we all believe in Ram. The Congress is always into positive politics and respects all religions. We are happy that the stone from Rajasthan is being used in building the temple. We have never stopped any work. The BJP stalls work, and Congress starts it.”A second minister in the Ashok Gehlot government, who did not wish to be named, said illegal mining was rampant in the area and seeking a de-notification was a long pending demand of the labourers and traders. “There is no flora and fauna, and reserving the area was of no use. There is no other way of employment in this area. Earlier also proposals to de-notify the mining were submitted but nothing happened. But now, the government of India wants stone and state wants revenue and employment,” he said.But he admitted that with denotification, the party was also trying to send the political message across India that it was not anti-temple as being projected by the BJP. “It was during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure that doors of Babri Masjid were reopened, and prayers were allowed,” he said.VHP state general secretary Suresh Upadhyay said they welcomed the government’s response on the matter. “We had urged the government to send proposal to the government of India to de-notify the area. We welcome the state and Central governments’ response, who promptly acted on the request, which paved way for the Ram temple,” he said A BJP lawmaker on condition of anonymity said the demand for stone was long-pending and made by many Hindu outfits. “The temple has to be made in a time-bound manner and requires stone. If the state stalled or delayed [the de-notification], certainly the opposition would flare the issue in and outside the assembly,” he said.State BJP chief Satish Poonia concurred, “Our party unit, social organisations, and saints had approached the administration for the supply of the stone. The memorandums had been submitted to the administration. Besides, the government had this apprehension that delay would make it an issue.” Political analyst Shyam Sunder Sharma said the Congress and BJP both need the Hindutva issue politically. “The Rajasthan chief minister is an experienced leader, and wise enough to foresee that any delay in such issues can give the opposition a chances to corner them. The CM doesn’t want that the opposition to accuse the government of delaying the process or being a hurdle in the temple construction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-balancing-act-in-rajasthan-navigating-ram-temple-and-hindutva-101614062555754.html

Some state governments have also said they will screen visitors from high-risk areas. The Centre has cautioned states about rising cases of the coronavirus disease and said that Covid-19 protocols and guidelines must be followed strictly to check the spread of the infection.Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have been asked by the Centre to ramp up testing and monitor new strains of the coronavirus after a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases across the country.India recorded 10,584 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 78 deaths in the last 24 hours, which have taken the country’s tally to 11,016,434, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday.Here's what states are doing to contain the further spread of the coronavirus disease:MaharashtraThe worst-hit state in the country, which is witnessing a surge in infections, has imposed a one-week lockdown in Amravati and night curbs in Pune. The Maharashtra government has issued clampdown orders in Mumbai, Nagpur, Pimpri Chinchwad, Nashik, Aurangabad, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Akola, Yavatmal, Washim and Buldhana. It has also asked people to strictly follow Covid-19 norms, including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.

23-02-2021||India||Video of jail guard assaulting Chhattisgarh doctor goes viral, doctors on strike||Enraged over the assault on a doctor at Bhim Rao Ambedkar Hospital, Raipur by a jail guard, the Junior Doctor’s Association of Raipur boycotted routine out-patient department (OPD) services along with all elective procedures on Tuesday.The association further said if no satisfactory action is taken against the jail guard in the next 24-hours, the doctors will withdraw from all emergency services from Wednesday. The association is demanding immediate termination of the accused jail guard and strict action against duty police officers. A letter in this regard was written to the dean of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College by Indresh Yadav, the president of Junior Doctor’s Association.On Monday, a jail guard, Shatrughan Rao assaulted a doctor after a verbal spat over the alleged delay in attending a prisoner, a Maoist.The video of the spat went viral on social media. Subsequently, doctors and technicians staged a dharna outside Maudhapara police station demanding action.Chhattisgarh health minister TS Deo tweeted to say that orders for strict action against the accused has been given."The video of the ruckus at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Raipur is very shocking and unacceptable. Orders have been issued for strict action against the jail guard involved and also for a transparent investigation of complete matter," said DeoHe went on to say that the matter will be treated with "total seriousness" and any violence or ill behavior against our health workers is "totally intolerable".Meanwhile, talks between the dean and the association were going on since Monday.Also Read:MP, Chattisgarh witness spike in daily cases of Covid-19Later, police registered an FIR against Rao and started investigation.

23-02-2021||India||Amid push for Indian apps, an alternative to WhatsApp in the works||Three domestic mobile messaging applications, two developed by the government and one by the army, are likely to be pitched to the Prime Minister Office (PMO) as an alternative to the popular messaging application, WhatsApp, as privacy concerns shroud its latest privacy policy update, officials familiar with the matter said.The three mobile applications include Secure Application for Internet (SAI), developed by the army and launched in October last year; Sandes, developed by the National Informatics Centre with the first version being released in August last year, and SAMVAD, developed by the Centre for Development of Telematics.While all three applications have been around for at least a year, an official familiar with the matter said that the Prime Minister may put his weight behind one of the applications after the presentations are completed. “All the three applications will co-exist,” the official said. “After presentations are done, PMO will decide the future course, which may involve PM pitching for one for secure messaging.”Also Read | WhatsApp to launch public outreach exercise to push policyHT reached out to the PMO, but did not receive a response immediately despite several attempts. The push for domestic apps comes at a time when WhatsApp is in the crosshairs of the government over its privacy policy update. Critics have said it would allow WhatsApp to share more data with its parent company, Facebook, without giving users the opportunity to opt-out of it. The ministry of electronics and information technology on January 19 wrote to WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart expressing “strong concerns” over the policy and asked the company to roll it back. Last week, the Supreme Court also issued a notice to WhatsApp, asking it to explain its plans, with a remark that Indians highly value their privacy.Homegrown apps have an advantage over companies such as WhatsApp as the data is stored locally in servers, which is considered more secure.An army official familiar with the matter said that the SAI mobile application was almost out of the trial stage and would eventually be opened up to other government departments. At present, the mobile application has 18,000 users and is not open to the public. “The application was developed in June 2018,” the official said. “It is very likely to be pitched as an alternative to WhatsApp in the near future.”In a press statement issued in October last year, the army had said that the application supports “end to end secure voice, text and video calling services for Android platform over internet”. “The model is similar to commercially available messaging applications like WhatsApp, Telegram, SAMVAD and GIMS and utilises end to end encryption messaging protocol. SAI scores over on security features with local in-house servers and coding which can be tweaked as per requirements,” the statement said.It added that the application had been vetted by a CERT-in empanelled auditor and the Army Cyber Group, and would be utilised pan Army to “facilitate secure messaging within the service”.The army official, quoted above, added that the advantages of the app include server located within the country, a complete command and control of the eco-system and integrated indigenous encryption algorithms.The second application up for a presentation is SAMVAD, which, at present, is being tested by the central government and state government agencies. A second official familiar with the matter said that the app has collected feedback to create an ecosystem that helps ease organisational issues for the government. It also offers multiple levels of encryption, including user-end encryption. Unlike the other apps, SAMVAD also provides a separate dashboard where users can choose to access news regarding a particular subject.“The app also has options such as disappearing messages and confidential message,” the second official. “There has been very positive feedback from the agencies.” It also offers non-forwardable messages. Organisations can use the interface to create a group for seamless interaction.The official added that the greatest advantage is that since the application has been designed internally, any changes required can be made easily. “Moreover, the app has been designed for heavy load. Tomorrow if it has one million users, it won’t crash. The data is stored in the country, which ensures utmost security for departments that need to keep data completely confidential.”The third mobile application in the fray is Sandes, earlier known as Government Instant Messaging System (GIMS). Developed by the National Informatics Centre, the application also provides end-to-end encryption and in-house servers. All the information on GIMS will be stored in a government-based cloud. The application was launched last year and is still in the trial stage. The first official mentioned above said that Sandes has nearly 80,000 users.A third official familiar with the matter said that the government was closely monitoring the app’s progress.On Monday, Sandes was number seven on the Apple app store in the social networking category. According to the information provided on the app store, NIC has declared that Sandes collects contact information, user content, identifiers, diagnostics and other data, and links it to the user’s identity. “Sandes combines all the features of govTalk and GIMS,” a fourth official said. “In terms of alerts and sharing of data and information, Sandes is exactly like WhatsApp and a lot of officials are using it to communicate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-push-for-indian-apps-an-alternative-to-whatsapp-in-the-works-101614059377016.html

23-02-2021||India||A look at British architect Edwin Lutyens’ imprint beyond Delhi||A little over 100 years ago, the British architect-town planner Edwin Lutyens was given a rather significant brief — to design the imperial seat of power and its environs in the newly formed Indian capital city, New Delhi. Today, as the Central Vista redevelopment project aims to revisit Rajpath and the Central Vista avenue and build new structures to suit the needs of modern governance, the vision of Lutyens—and his partner, Herbert Baker — has become a subject of much debate.While it is true that Lutyens had a strong sense of history and the design of his public buildings in Delhi, such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan, is deeply influenced by their location, it is also important to remember that the architect was prodigiously prolific designing hundreds of structures around the world, including a castle, a bridge, and even affordable flats, in the post War era.Here are five other buildings Lutyens designed:Cenotaph at Regina, SaskatchewanAt the end of the First World War, Lutyens erected a temporary memorial at Whitehall in London; an empty sarcophagus elevated on a plinth, ornamented with stone flags and laurel wreaths. The design quickly became popular with British territories overseas looking for a model for creating their own memorials for absentee soldiers killed in the war. In 1926, the Canadian city of Regina unveiled the cenotaph at Victoria Park, an elegant variation of the original sketch Lutyens had made for Whitehall. Of course, his most famous cenotaph lies in the Capital city and remains an important part of our Republic Day celebrations to this date.Also Read | Central Vista: Govt starts work on Rajpath redevelopmentBritish Ambassador Residence, Washington DCLutyens first visited America in 1925. Despite being neck-deep with the construction in Delhi, his office produced 68 drawings between 1925-27 and work commenced in 1928. The building is in many ways a scaled-down version of the Viceroy’s House (what we now call the Rashtrapati Bhavan) in Delhi, with a similarly detailed door, handles, mirrors, columns, and high ceilings. The exterior, however, is quite the opposite, with the sense of a country home in an idealised English country garden.Social Housing, Grosvenor Estate, LondonBetween 1929 and 1935, Lutyens designed a multi-storey building for affordable housing in Pimlico, London. Already commissioned by the Duke of Westminster to design Grosvenor House, he drew up the plans for flats surrounding a central courtyard. The bold checkerboard geometry of the plastered wall and exposed brick on the facade is uncharacteristic of Lutyens, who always preferred classical details, some of which can be seen on the entrance porticos.Castle Drogo, DevonAll architects succumb to the whims and fancies of rich, eccentric clients at least once in their careers and Lutyens was no exception. In Julius Drewe, a self-made retailing millionaire, he met a scale of ambition perhaps only exceeded in the princely palaces at Delhi. Between 1911-31, Lutyens designed a castle that easily confounds the casual observer, with most assuming it to be from medieval times.Hampton Court Bridge, LondonNormally dismissive of architectural intent, Lutyens’ design for this bridge is uniquely influenced by Christopher Wren, the architect of many of London’s beloved and important buildings. Completed in 1933, the bridge is the fourth on the same site, surprisingly replacing an older bridge made in wrought iron. His brick-clad, three-arched design was made in reinforced concrete and stands to this day.Amit Khanna teaches at the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, and has a special focus on the transformation of cities. He is founder, AKDA, an architecture and urban design firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-look-at-british-architect-edward-lutyens-imprint-beyond-delhi-101614059015343.html
23-02-2021||India||Chamoli glacier burst: Uttarakhand to declare 135 missing persons ‘dead’||Uttarakhand health department, under the directions from Centre, has decided to declare those missing in the February 7 Chamoli disaster, as “dead”, officials said on Monday. Of the initial 204 people missing in the Chamoli disaster, search and rescue workers have recovered 69 bodies while 135 are still missing. Following a notification issued by the state health secretary Amit Negi on Sunday evening, the government has invoked the Birth & Death Registration Act, 1969, under which the designated government officer will issue death certificates of the missing people to their family or relatives. The notification stated, “In normal circumstances, the birth and death certificates are issued to a person at the place where he is born or died. But in exceptional circumstances, like the Chamoli disaster, if a missing person is possibly dead beyond all possibilities of being alive but his body is yet to be found, in that case the authorities could declare him dead by issuing the death certificate to his family members after a required inquiry.” Also Read | Expert team widens mouth of Rishiganga lake by 15ft to prevent repeat tragedyFor the purpose of issuing death certificate, the government has divided the missing people in three categories. “The first category has the residents of the area near the site who went missing from the site. The second has those from other districts of state who were present at the site while the third category comprises tourists or people from other states who were present at the site,” said Negi in the notification. He added, “Under the process, family members will have to submit an affidavit regarding the missing person along with all the necessary details to the designated government officer concerned who will then issue the death certificate after proper inquiry. This will help in settling compensation for the families of those missing.” On February 7, a glacier breach at Joshimath in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district triggered a massive flood that hit two hydropower projects near the Naina Devi National Park, about 300 kilometres north of Dehradun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chamoli-glacier-burst-uttarakhand-to-declare-135-missing-persons-dead-101614058776024.html
23-02-2021||India||World is looking up to India's health sector, especially after Covid-19: PM Modi||Congratulating both government and private health sectors of the country in fighting Covid-19 pandemic in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said, "Last year was a test for the country as well as the world. We have been successful in this fight and the credit also goes to private sectors.""Covid-19 has taught us that we need to be prepared for future diseases too. So it is important to strengthen all aspects of the health sector — from medical equipment to medicine, from ventilators to vaccine, from doctors to epidemiologists," PM Modi said, terming this year's budget allocation to the health sector as "unprecedented".Covid vaccination: People over 60 likely to be allowed to self-registerThis is the time to take accessibility and affordability to the next step, the PM said as he said how India's health sector has been an example in front of the world. "In the coming days, the World's dependence on India will only go up. India's medical education, Indian doctors, nurses will soon be in high demand. We need to keep this in mind," PM Modi said.The world has taken note of the strength of India's health sector, PM Modi said. "We have to be prepared for this growing demand from the world. In the coming days, students from other countries will be flocking to India to study medicine and we should encourage that," he said."Government's budget allocation is a catalytic agent. On the ground, things will change when we all work together. Our approach towards the health sector is different from that of the previous government. Our approach is holistic as it encompasses cleanliness, nutrition, wellness, the prevention of diseases and all other allied sectors. Before, the health sector was fragmented," PM Modi said addressing a webinar on the effective implementation of the provisions of Budget 2021 in the health sector.Drawing a parallel between Covid-19 and tuberculosis, PM Modi said, "If the same preventive measures are taken against TB, we will be able to free India from TB by 2025 as TB too spreads from the droplets of an infected person.""There might be some sections which did not get the expected allocation, but this is not the last budget. So it is time to get going and put the money to the best use as fast as possible," PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-sector-got-unprecedented-allocation-in-budget-2021-says-pm-modi-101614057041207.html

23-02-2021||India||Decoding PM Modi’s pre-poll run in Bengal and Assam||Voters in West Bengal, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has gone on a war footing against the Mamata Banerjee government, and Assam, where the saffron camp wants its coalition government to continue, have had a special visitor thrice over the last 30 days — Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Modi’s plane landed in each state on January 23, February 7 and February 22 and BJP leaders are planning his fourth visit on February 28. During these day-long tours, Modi not only inaugurated projects and welfare schemes as prime minister but also sent strong political messages as the BJP’s face. The location of Modi’s events, be it political or administrative, also gave a glimpse of BJP’s geographical priorities in the upcoming state elections. So what are the broad patterns that can be gleaned from the PM’s pre-poll visits to eastern India? Owning Bengal’s icons Modi’s first visit to Kolkata in this period, on January 23, was focused entirely on the Centre’s decision to celebrate the birthday of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, Bengal’s cultural icon, as Parakram Diwas, or day of valour, but the political subtext was hard to miss. The Trinamool Congress, for its part, celebrated January 23 as Desh Nayak Diwas (day of the national hero) while the Forward Bloc, the party Bose formed in 1939, observed Desh Prem Diwas (day of patriotism). This competitiveness was in stark display when Banerjee disapproved the raising of the Jai Sri Ram slogan by BJP supporters present at Modi’s main event. That was the last time she shared the dais with Modi. Also Read | PM Modi to inaugurate super specialty hospital at IIT Kharagpur todayThe visit — and the tussle — represented a deeper battle. The BJP is keen to own and appropriate a Bengal icon, at a time when the Trinamool is accusing the BJP of being a party of “outsiders” with no organic connection to the state. The slogan of Jai Sri Ram — which so irked the CM — is a feature of the same battle; it has become a rallying cry for the BJP, particularly among the subaltern, while the TMC sees it as out of tune with Bengal’s cultural vocabulary. Vikas, welfare, identity in AssamOn the same day, the PM then visited Assam, where he distributed land allotment certificates to 106,000 landless indigenous families who will get seven bighas (a bigha is equal to 14,400 sq. ft.) of agricultural land and another bigha for building a house. In urban areas, people will get 1.10 katha while in Guwahati, the state will allot 1.50 “katha”. In Assam, a “katha” is equal to 2,880 sq. ft. In 2016, this was BJP’s electoral promise, and the party clearly wanted to be seen as “delivering” before the polls. The move also aligns with the BJP’s attempts to tap into the indigenous vote, and build on its politics of welfare. Significantly, Modi also addressed a rally at Jerenga Pathar, a historic site where Joymoti, an Ahom princess, sacrificed her life in the 17th century to save her husband, Prince Godapani, who later became a king of the Ahom dynasty. “Jerenga Pathar is the ‘balidan-bhoomi’ (land of sacrifice) of Joymoti. We are taking steps to include this land in a list of five iconic archaeological sites in the country,” Modi told the crowd. But with it, he was sending a signal to the broader Ahom community, as well as acknowledging the cultural distinctiveness and rich history of the state. Also Read | Will make more trips till poll dates out: PMModi’s next visit to Assam on February 7 was marked by his rally at Dhekiajuli, launch of an ambitious road network project and laying the foundation stones of two medical college and hospitals to be built at a cost ₹1,122 crore in Biswanath and Charaideo districts. The Asom Mala statewide road project will cost another ₹5,500 crore. This was clearly an attempt to showcase the infrastructure and development-oriented political messages of the party. But that day, the big takeaway from Modi’s public remarks was his allegation, at a tea garden, that an international campaign is on to tarnish the image of the Indian tea industry to which Assam’s contribution is sizeable. “I want to tell these conspirators from Assam’s soil that the country will never allow their plans to succeed. Our tea workers will win this fight as these attacks are not capable of countering their hard work,” he said. The PM also spoke about giving ₹3,000 each to 750,000 tea garden workers and praised the Union budget which allocated ₹1,000 crore for tea garden workers in Assam and West Bengal. The PM appeared to be attempting multiple messages here — a signal to the rest of the country about the looming “foreign conspiracy”, a key tenet of the government’s response to global tweets in solidarity with the farm protests, and a signal to Assam that only the BJP can protect the tea industry and cares for it. Selecting Dhekiajuli for Modi’s rally was also significant. In September 1942, police gunned down 17 people in this town in Sonitpur district during the Quit India movement. Modi did not miss the symbolism. “This is the land where the people of Assam defeated the invaders, showcased their unity, power and valour. In 1942, the freedom fighters of Assam sacrificed their lives for our freedom and the honour of the tricolour,” Modi said in his address. Experts feel that while the meeting at Sivasagar was held to address Ahom votes, the one at Dhekiajuli focused more on tribal people who work for the tea industry. The BJP has been promising to grant scheduled tribe status to both along with four other communities. Nearly 1.1 million workers are employed in around 800 large tea gardens in Assam. They can influence poll results in 35-40 of Assam’s 126 assembly seats. Similarly, Ahom votes play a crucial role in Upper Assam districts. “The BJP has been able to influence the tea tribes with a number of policies of which their political representation is a part,” said professor of political science at Gauhati University, Akhil Ranjan Dutta. “Though the party managed to win some seats in the Ahom strongholds in the last Lok Sabha and assembly polls, the margins of victory were not high. The PM’s rally in Sivasagar was an attempt to consolidate Ahom votes,” Dutta added. Winning over South BengalModi’s visit to Haldia in Bengal’s East Midnapore district on February 7 was significant. The district is in the eye of a political storm since December 19 when former cabinet minister Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP. His elder brother Dibyendu Adhikari, the TMC Lok Sabha member from Tamluk in East Midnapore, was present when Modi inaugurated some major power and road projects that day while their father, Sisir Adhikari, the TMC’s most senior Lok Sabha member from the district’s Kanthi seat, skipped the event citing illness. With the TMC in control of all 16 assembly seats in East Midnapore, which has Muslim and well as tribal voters, the Adhikari family now plays a crucial role for the BJP. Banerjee has decided to contest the Nandigram assembly seat that Suvendu Adhikari represented. Also Read | Focus should be on providing defence equipment to smaller nations: PM ModiAlthough the saffron camp won seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats in the north Bengal region in 2019, these seats comprise only 56 of the state’s 294 assembly segments, and that is why there is now focus on south Bengal. “South Bengal, which accounts for the remaining 238 assembly seats and where the BJP was ahead of the TMC in only 87 in 2019, will decide the fate of Bengal,” a senior executive of IPAC, the company owned by Banerjee’s election strategist Prashant Kishor, told HT. At the BJP rally on February 7, Modi talked of East Midnapore district’s contribution to Bengal’s history but focused on development in entire south Bengal as well as east and north-east India. At the government event, he launched an LPG import terminal built by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited at a cost of ₹1,100 crore. “The project will provide LPG to Bengal and other states in east and north-east India,” said Modi.He also launched the 348 km Dobhi-Durgapur Natural Gas Pipeline section, which is part of the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga project and will help revive the HURL Sindri (in Jharkhand) fertiliser plant, supply gas to Matix Fertiliser Plant at Durgapur in Bengal’s West Burdwan district, and provide gas to industrial, commercial and automobile sectors as well as domestic consumers in major towns of Bengal. The PM returns to the east On his third visit to Assam on February 22, Modi launched several oil and gas projects, inaugurated an engineering college and laid the foundation stone of another. He accused the erstwhile Congress governments of treating the north bank of Brahmaputra in a step-motherly manner. After his plane touched down in Bengal later that day, Modi called for “asol paribartan” (real change) while mounting an attack on the TMC at a rally in Hooghly district where the BJP would win only one Lok Sabha seat in 2019. Later, he flagged off some railway projects, including the extension of the north-south Metro corridor, which connects Kolkata to its adjoining areas where the BJP could not make much headway in 2019. “Development of Bengal is not possible as long as extortionists rule. No investor will come to Bengal,” Modi said in Hooghly in a bid to connect with the region’s jobless industrial workers. The ruling party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, tweeted the image of a decade-old press release which said Banerjee, who was then Union railway minister, introduced 34 projects, including the ones Modi inaugurated. An examination of the venue for the PM’s speeches, political messaging, and the projects he has chosen to unveil indicate that not only are elections in Bengal and Assam are high up on the agenda for him, and the BJP is betting a mix of development, infrastructure, identity-based pride, specific welfare measures for specific communities, and its broader nationalist appeal to win Bengal and defend Assam. With the PM promising to return to them states before elections are announced in early March, even before the campaign has officially begun, Narendra Modi has set the stage for the BJP’s outreach to voters in the two states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decoding-pm-modi-s-pre-poll-run-in-bengal-and-assam-101614056555582.html

Had we done the phase 2/3 combined, we would have captured efficacy faster. But anyhow, we should be coming out in two weeks with the efficacy point data,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, at the BioAsia 2021 conference.Also Read | Not only Maharashtra, Kerala; 5 other states report sudden spike in Covid casesCovaxin is the first indigenously developed vaccine against Covid-19 and was granted restricted use in emergencies and authorisation for sale in India early January this year by the national regulator, despite the lack of phase 3 efficacy data.The grant of approval without the phase 3 efficacy data had drawn a lot of criticism, with the government clarifying on different platforms that the vaccine was safe to use.“In a non-emergency situation, safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data are required. Existing pandemic situation with high mortality, available science, and a lack of definitive treatment are considered by a subject expert committee for accelerated approval that is in our legal provision. In a pandemic situation, we consider restricted use based on safety, and immunogenicity data while the phase 3 trial is still ongoing,” Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR, explained after the approval was granted.“Immunogenicity data generated through the phase 2 clinical trial serves as a surrogate for efficacy, and the Clinical Trials Rule 2019 provides for considering phase 2 results to guide approval. The subject expert committee guides the DCGI [Drugs Controller General of India] in the process of decision-making for restricted use in an emergency,” he said.The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed using whole-virion inactivated vero cell-derived platform technology that contains the dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an infection.According to the company, it is looking at scaling up production to nearly 40 million doses in a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-phase-3-efficacy-data-likely-out-in-two-weeks-bharat-biotech-101614056374950.html

Here is all you need to know about the emerging political situation in Puducherry:•The All-India NR Congress and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have a majority of 14 lawmakers including three nominated MLAs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 33-member House.• But they are unlikely to stake a claim to form the government, and the President’s rule is imminent.• The Narayanasamy government lost majority when five Congress and one Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) legislators resigned in the run-up to the trust vote.• It had the support of 12 lawmakers including two DMK MLAs, an independent legislator and speaker VP Sivakozhundu. The Speaker votes only when there is a tie.Also Read | Another thin majority, another defeat• With the collapse of the government, the Congress now is not a part of the government in any southern state or Union Territory.• Since 2019, the Congress has lost power similarly in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.• In an hour-long speech in the assembly, Narayanasamy attacked the BJP-led Centre and recently ousted lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi for colluding with the Opposition and topping his government.• Narayanasamy and his loyalists argued that the nominated members could not vote. Soon after, Narayansamy and his 11 MLAs walked out.• Narayanasamy, who had been at odds with Bedi since 2016, had appealed to the President to recall her.• Puducherry BJP president V Samithan said that while no move was discussed so far to stake claim to form the government, the party’s national leadership will take a decision.• Former chief minister and opposition leader N Rangasamy said the government lost “because they didn’t deliver on their promises but they are blaming the Centre”.• Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Puducherry on February 25 to inaugurate government projects.• He will later head to Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore district to participate in a BJP rally in the poll-bound state.• DMK chief MK Stalin called the government’s fall a “murder of democracy”.

This also makes her only the third MP from Amethi who would have a residence there.Irani arrived in Amethi on Monday to complete the formalities of the purchase. She has bought 11 biswa land for ₹12.11 lakh from local resident Phoolmati Devi to honour the promise she made in the Tiloi area of Amethi soon after defeating then Congress president Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. She also announced that people from each village of Amethi and Rae Bareli would be called for the bhoomi pujan (groundbreaking ceremony), the date of which is not decided yet. Once the paperwork was done for the land, a couple of kilometres away from main Gauriganj town, Irani took a dig at the Congress which has held the seat multiple times but none of its MPs has had a base here. “The people who poured their love and blessings on me wanted an MP who is available among them. In corona times, too, we connected with the people through e-chaupals and, before that, I reached out to them through programmes like Didi Aapke Dwar (Didi at your doorstep),” said Irani, who is locally known as didi [elder sister] among the people. Also Read | To enhance accountability, Cabinet clears changes to Juvenile Justice ActShe added, “People always wondered if they will ever have an MP who would reach out to the villages. At least, I consider myself fortunate that I was able to fulfil this.” Irani’s decision makes her only the third MP from Amethi to also have a residence there. Interestingly, her 2019 Lok Sabha win from Amethi was also the third Congress defeat on this seat since it came into being. The other two MPs who chose to have a residence here being the only two non-Congress MPs to have held this seat. They are: Ravindra Pratap Singh of Janata Party, who won the post-emergency 1977 election, and Sanjay Sinh of the BJP who defeated Congress leader Captain (retired) Satish Sharma in 1998 elections.For political observers, Irani’s decision to buy land in Amethi, just two years after her win and less than a year before the UP assembly elections, shows BJP’s intent to keep its grip on this former Congress bastion that it wrested in 2019. “Politics is all about symbolism and this surely is a powerful one. For the locals, it would mean that their MP intends to be among them. While its overall impact remains to be seen, it surely is a move that would be talked about. The land has been purchased, the house would take some time to be built and the idea of their didi wanting to be among them would be reinforced in the interim,” said veteran journalist Irshad Ilmi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smriti-irani-buys-land-in-up-s-amethi-to-build-home-in-her-lsconstituency-101614051634382.html

Based on the finding, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has declared six contagious blocks as a containment zone. Sanitisation has been carried out in the apartment premises and a health team with four doctors has been deployed.The apartment at Bellandur, a suburb in south-east Bengaluru, comprises nine blocks and has a population of around 1,500. The other three blocks are situated at a distance from these six blocks and have not reported any Covid-19 case.Covid-19: Gujarat, MP to screen select inter-state travellers at bordersA few days ago, another Covid-19 cluster was reported at Manjushree Nursing College in Bengaluru as around 40 samples collected from there had tested positive.On Monday, Karnakata reported 317 fresh infections with Bengaluru urban reporting 181 cases — the highest among districts. Bengaluru Urban district tops the list of positive cases, with a total of 4,03,943, followed by Mysuru 53,941 and Ballari 39,221.Out of the five fatalities that the state recorded on Monday, three were from Bengaluru Urban one each from Dharwad and Tumakuru.On Sunday, Karnataka became one of the top five contributors to India's daily caseload with 413 new infections, following Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.The state has already taken several actions to not allow the rise to spread. Among the new cases found in Bengaluru apartment, some have recent travel history in Kerala. But apart from imported Covid-19 cases, there have been cases that can be traced to weddings, gatherings, reports have said.What Karnataka is doing to check Covid-19 spread> Marshalls will now be deployed in marriage halls to ensure proper adherence to Covid-19 protocols.> Catering services will have to get mandatorily tested before they serve a wedding event.> Mandatory negative RT-PCR test for people travelling from Maharashtra and Kerala.On restrictions/lockdown if necessaryKarnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar has said the authorities are trying to avoid a situation like Maharashtra.

But just about 10,00,00 Indians living abroad are registered as voters. NRIs say their fundamental rights to work and live in places of their choice are impinged upon by the condition of voting physically in their constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-with-ministries-to-address-nris-demand-for-postal-voting-ec-101614050494084.html

23-02-2021||India||Court asks Uttarakhand government to submit details of Mahakumbh preparations||Uttarakhand high court on Monday directed the state government to submit a detailed affidavit on its preparations for implementation of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) released by Centre on Kumbh and what yet remains to be done by March 3.The court also directed Uttarakhand chief secretary to submit details such as how many frontline workers were given Covid-19 vaccination in Haridwar and how much medical staff is available for Kumbh.The division bench comprising chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma gave these directions while hearing a bunch of PILs filed by Sachdanand Dabral, Dushyant Mainali, and Rajendra Arya related to various issues regarding the fight against the Covid-19 epidemic in the state.Shiv Bhatt, counsel of Sachdanand Dabral said the court was not happy with the affidavit on Mahakumbh.“The court has directed the state government through Mela officer and chief secretary to file an affidavit by March 3 on preparations completed so far and yet to be completed, and para-wise details about the implementation of the SOP issued by Centre on January 22 this year. The court has sought details about the number of frontline workers that have been vaccinated so far and the list of Kumbh related infrastructural works completed and yet to be completed,” said Bhatt. The next hearing in the matter has been fixed on March 5, 2021.One million visitors are expected to attend the Mahakumbh on routine days while about five million are expected for Shahi Snaans (royal baths). The Centre issued the SOPs on Mahakumbh last month after the state government approached it for the same on the order of Uttarakhand high court.The SOPs make it mandatory for all the devotees to carry an RT-PCR negative test report for Covid-19, done within 72 hours. It also says that all the devotees should get a medical report from a competent medical authority near their house on the lines of Amaranth Yatra before attending the mega-event in Haridwar. It has asked the state government to ensure that the aforementioned reports are checked by the Mela authorities and to not allow anyone without them. Similarly, it has also asked the state government to discourage devotees aged above 65 years, pregnant women and children under 10 years of age from attending the event. It also asked the state to only deploy vaccinated healthcare and frontline workers at the Mahakumbh to ensure their protection from the disease.Also Read: Expert team widens mouth of Rishiganga lake by 15ft to prevent repeat tragedyBefore the epidemic, over 12 crore pilgrims were expected to participate in the four-month-long Mahakumbh.

23-02-2021||India||Expert team widens mouth of Rishiganga lake by 15ft to prevent repeat tragedy||The 30-member expert team succeeded in widening the mouth of the lake, formed upstream Rishiganga river in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district due to flash floods, by about 15 feet, leading to faster drainage, which is likely to prevent a repeat of the tragedy, according to state disaster response force (SDRF) commandant Navneet Bhullar.“In a daring effort, the team has widened the mouth of the lake in a very difficult terrain, which has increased the discharge from the lake. Due to this, the chances of lake burst or Chamoli-like tragedy happening again have been averted. And our team members are still camping there to try to widen the mouth further,” Bhullar said.An avalanche triggered by a glacier burst over upper Himalayan regions in Chamoli district on February 7 damaged two hydel power projects on Rishi Ganga river and possibly killed 150 people. The sludge from the flash flood also blocked the flow of Rishiganga and created a lake which experts fear could burst to create another tragedy. Scientists, Indian military personnel, Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and disaster management personnel and experts analysed the lake including its depth before widening its mouth proportionately from 20 feet to around 35 feet.“The special equipment, quick deployable antenna (QDA) based on satellite communication, has been set up there and it is helping us to have real-time communication with the expert team,” Bhullar added.The expert team formed by state chief secretary Om Prakash, includes scientists from the Uttarakhand Space Application Centre and Geological Survey of India, apart from officers from ITBP and SDRF. They had left for the lake area on Friday and reached there on Saturday.When inputs first came that a lake was forming again upstream Rishiganga, SDRF's eight-member high altitude rescue team (HART), which included six persons who had scaled Mount Everest in 2018 and Navneet Bhullar, was sent to the area for ground survey. The team sent one of its members, Manoj Joshi, to widen the lake mouth to some extent. He succeeded in widening it by around six feet, with the help of a rope.Also Watch: Navy divers, in IAF helicopter, measure glacial lake depth in Tapovan“It was a very dangerous incline and widening it (the lake mouth) was difficult. I could widen it by a few feet only,” said Manoj Joshi, an Everest summiteer, Joshi.On Sunday, a quick deployable antenna (QDA) was flown to the lake area in a chopper for the expert team to communicate from the remote terrain. Earlier on Saturday, an air force chopper took two navy divers to the lake to measure the depth of the lake. They used their hand-held echolocation devices for measuring the depth, found to be around 8 to 9 metres, according to SDRF DIG Ridhim Aggarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-team-widens-mouth-of-rishiganga-lake-by-15ft-to-prevent-repeat-tragedy-101614045878993.html
23-02-2021||India||What Covid-19 taught us about state of our prisons||By Justice Madan LokurThe pandemic taught us, and continues to teach us. In the context of prison reforms, one of the biggest lessons we learnt is that it is indeed possible to decongest prisons.On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 as a pandemic. In less than a week, the Supreme Court (SC) took suo motu cognisance of the pandemic and noted that the occupancy rate of our prisons is 117.6%. In some places, like in Uttar Pradesh, it was as high as 176.5%. Additionally, the rate of ingress and egress of prisoners, staff, visitors and lawyers was very high. For these reasons, the SC observed that prisons were “fertile breeding grounds for incubation” of Covid-19.The India Justice Report 2020 (IJR) released last month provides a good analysis that could form the basis of a sustainable programme of decongesting prisons. The report points out that undertrials constitute nearly 70% of all prison inmates. In 35 states and UTs, the share of undertrial inmates was above 50%. Over five years, the share of undertrial prisoners shows an increasing trend in 23 states/UTs.As per the High Powered Committees, appointed by the Supreme Court in March 2020 “to determine which class of prisoners can be released on parole or an interim bail for such period as may be thought appropriate”, prisoners (convicted and under trial) facing a maximum punishment of up to seven years or less, could be considered for release. Similarly, the Under Trial Review Committees (UTRCs) were directed to meet every week to take necessary decisions in accordance with that judgment.The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) found that the cumulative impact of the directions given by the SC resulted in the overall occupancy in prisons coming down to 93.3% between April 1 and June 30. Inspite of that about 27% prisons across the country were still overcrowded. It is noteworthy that an effort to decongest prisons was successful in reducing the overcrowding, and quite likely resulted in a decline in the spread of the virus. So why can’t this be done the rest of the time? If video-conferencing facilities had been operational across the country perhaps many more prisons would have been decongested. According to the IJR, as of December 2019, only 16 States/UTs had 90% of their jails equipped with VC facilities. Five of the large and mid-sized states were less than 50% equipped: Kerala (42%); Rajasthan (38%); West Bengal (32%); Karnataka (31%) and Tamil Nadu (9%).In 2018, the SC set up a three-member committee to look into prison reforms as well as to examine the functioning of the UTRCs, a district-level oversight mechanism to conduct periodic reviews of undertrials. More than two years later, a bulk of UTRCs remains partially operational. Coming to the issue of adequate human resources, vacancies at all levels continue to haunt prison administration, worsening the condition of inmates. IJR records that nationally, medical staff vacancies have risen from 35% (as of Dec 2016) to 41% (as of Dec 2019). The Model Prison Manual 2016 mandates a minimum of one medical officer for every 300 prisoners and one full-time doctor in central prisons. In half the States/UTs about 1 in 4 positions remains empty. Uttarakhand had no sanctioned medical officer appointed.Our criminal justice jurisprudence shifted long ago from being custodial, punitive and deterrent to correctional, rehabilitative and restorative. Many states have not thought in these terms and IJR informs us that there are no sanctioned posts of welfare/ probation officers, psychologists, lawyers, counsellors, social workers and so on in some states. This has resulted in skewed figures where nationally there is one probation/ welfare officer for 1617 prisoners and one psychologist/ psychiatrist for 16,503 prisoners. These shortfalls are indicative of a mindset that dehumanizes persons in prisons; relegating them to the recesses of our mind, undeserving of good medical care.Magistrates and judges need to consider prison conditions and whether they are in consonance with Article 21 of the Constitution, which guarantees life and personal liberty to all.Justice Madan Lokur is a former judge of the Supreme Court of India, and is currently a judge in the Supreme Court of Fiji. The India Justice Report 2020 released by Tata Trusts examines the state of justice delivery across prisons, judiciary, legal aid and police.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-covid-19-taught-us-about-state-of-our-prisons-101614046131817.html

23-02-2021||India||Karate association secy held for forgery to avail govt privileges||Mumbai police have arrested the secretary of the Karate Association of India (KAI), Bharat Sharma, from Delhi in connection with a cheating and forgery case registered in 2019 for an elaborate fraud he is suspected to have committed.Sharma and other office bearers of KAI allegedly forged documents and fraudulently represented themselves as representatives of the All India Karate-Do Federation (AIKF) to the World Karate Federation (WKF). They then got the AIKF’s name changed to KAI and got it fraudulently recognised by the WKF, the police said.Sharma and his colleagues made false representations to the ministry of youth affairs and sports and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), enjoyed many privileges and received government funds, the police complaint states. HT reached out to Kiren Rijuju, the sports minister, who said he was aware of the case, but did not offer any comment.Ananda Hodage, senior inspector of MRA Marg police station in Mumbai, confirmed Sharma’s arrest.“Sharma, who was arrested on February 13 from Delhi, has been charged with sections 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) 471 (using as genuine a forged document) 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code. Presently he is in police custody. He would be produced in court on Tuesday,” said assistant police inspector Himmat Jadhav, who is investigating officer of the case.Mumbai police are likely to elaborate on how much money was siphoned off in the fraud in their second remand application on Tuesday to seek further custody of Sharma. Officials did not provide any more details on Monday. Sharma has been arrested on a complaint filed by Nandji Prasad, secretary of the AIKF. Prasad stated in the FIR, a copy of which is with HT, that AIKF is a recognised trust that encourages young talent in karate and also trains and grooms potential karatekas for the Asian Games and other International Olympic Committee-recognised tournaments. Karate was made a part of the Olympics for the first time in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, deferred until this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, with eight gold medals on offer.“KAI is an illegal body and they also got recognition from the government showing the World Karate Federation etter in 2014,” alleges Nandji Prasad, the general secretary of AIKF.The sports ministry declined to comment on the issue.The FIR filed by Prasad also names Thiyagarajan and another KAI office bearer, Virat Vaccha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karate-association-secy-held-for-forgery-to-avail-govt-privileges-101614045471341.html
23-02-2021||India||Another thin majority, another defeat||For the Congress, winning an election is important but these days the margin of victory seems to be more important.The collapse of its government in three states displays the party’s vulnerability when pitted against an aggressive Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It was Karnataka (the Congress was in a coalition with the Janata Dal-(Secular) in 2019, then Madhya Pradesh in 2020, and finally Puducherry on Monday.“The striking similarity in three states — all with narrow majority (for the Congress) — is that the use of the BJP’s specialised technique, i.e. using unconstitutional means to create artificial majority in their favour,” said senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi, who had fought the Karnataka case in court.But some leaders also believe that the episodes also underline the Congress’s inability to keep its flock together in a crunch situation. In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress government did have a wafer-thin majority of just seven MLAs, but the party failed to address the issues of Jyotiraditya Scindia, who joined the BJP in March 2020.Similarly, in Puducherry, many local leaders had an uneasy relationship with V Narayanasamy, who resigned from the chief minister’s post on Monday, right from the beginning. A Congress leader based in Chennai alleged that “the perception was that the CM had been paratrooped from the party headquarters and the central leadership only listens to him”.In states where the party has a comfortable majority, the Congress has been able to avert crises. In August 2020, the Congress government in Rajasthan was threatened after fissures widened between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and deputy CM Sachin Pilot. Pilot and his loyal MLAs even left Rajasthan and camped in neighbouring Haryana, putting the Congress leadership on the tenterhooks.“We managed to handle the situation as the Congress was way ahead of the BJP in the assembly. Even in Chhattisgarh, there are strong frictions but the legislative strength of the party make us feel comfortable,” said a senior party strategist.Some senior leaders of the party also feel that the real test of party’s crisis managers is not when there is a wide majority in the legislative house but when the stakes are high and numbers are low.“We definitely need to improve internal management. After all, we came to power in MP after 15 years, but lost our government in 15 months,” said another senior leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-thin-majority-another-defeat-101614045099403.html

The government is not going to take back these laws unless it is forced to. These three laws are designed to destroy agriculture system in the country and give entire business to two or three friends of PM Modi,” said Gandhi after taking out a tractor rally in Wayanad in solidarity with agitating farmers.“Agriculture is the only business that belongs to Bharat Mata and a few people want to own this business,” he said, urging people to force the government to take back the three laws that are “detrimental to the farming community”. He drove the tractor from Thrikaripatta to Muttil covering six kilometres.After his Wayanad trip, Gandhi will also attend the concluding session of Kerala opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala’s rally in Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday.State leaders have asked Gandhi to campaign extensively in the elections due to be held in April-May. During the 2019 general elections, when the party had delivered its best result winning 15 of the 20 seats, Gandhi had taken a position of not criticising the LDF government too much. Now, party leaders have asked him to shed his soft posture and go all-out against the arch-rival in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/even-pop-stars-concerned-over-farmers-plight-but-not-central-govt-says-rahul-101614044867813.html

With the people’s blessings in the forthcoming elections and [Prime Minister Narendra] Modiji’s leadership, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will form a government with the BJP and its alliance partners, All India NR Congress and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, in May,” Puducherry BJP president V Saminathan said.The Puducherry government fell on Monday as Narayanasamy resigned ahead of a confidence vote with his ruling coalition slipping below the majority mark due to the recent resignations of Congress MLAs and a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) legislator.With two Congress legislators already defecting to the BJP since January, there are speculations that more could follow suit. “For the past two years, there have been some people who have shown interest in joining the BJP; and this is not surprising since the Congress lacks leadership,” said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.Even though the BJP is still in a nascent phase in the UT and relies heavily on its allies, the party is hoping to benefit from the joining of influential leaders. “There may not be a dramatic increase in the vote share or the number of seats, but even small additions make a difference...,” said the leader quoted above.Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, who is the election in- charge of the UT, tweeted: “Puducherry is celebrating as it becomes free from the misgovernance & corruption-ridden regime of Congress. This moment will be marked as a significant milestone in the growth trajectory of #ProsperousPuducherry #CongressMuktPuducherry.”On the other hand, the Congress hoped to turn the tide in the elections. In the assembly, Narayanasamy said former lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi, who was removed on February 16, and the central government colluded with the Opposition to topple his government. He said the Centre did not grant statehood to Puducherry despite requests. The Congress hoped the charge that the BJP “manufactured rebellion” in the UT can also be clubbed with the allegations of high-handedness by Bedi. A senior leader based in Chennai added that a frontal attack on the BJP is the “best option”.Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said, “In the present case, the impact of the toppling of the government will be less lethal for the simple reason that elections are round the corner and this will arouse great sympathy for the Congress in Puducherry.”Setting the tone for the poll campaign, Dinesh Gundu Rao, Congress’s incharge for Puducherry and Tamil Nadu, tweeted: “BJP4India kills democracy again. Using ED, IT & other agencies, spending crores of rupees they have toppled an elected govt. @INCIndia will go to the people, the people of Puducherry will give a befitting reply in the elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-may-not-stake-claim-cong-sets-eyes-on-elections-101614044552146.html
23-02-2021||India||SC to hear if CBI can probe coal scam case||The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine whether the (CBI) could investigate a coal smuggling case in which a notice has been served to Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee’s wife.Apart from Abhishek’s wife Rujira Banerjee, the agency also served a notice on his sister-in-law Maneka Gambhir. CBI officials on Monday questioned Gambhir at her residence in Kolkata.The top court decided to ascertain the validity of a February 12 order of the Calcutta high court which permitted the CBI to continue its probe in the state despite the chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led state government, in November 2018, withdrawing general consent to the agency for carrying out probes in West Bengal.The Calcutta HC order was passed ny its division bench on the appeals filed by the CBI and Anup Majee, an accused in the case, who has now filed a petition in the apex court.The bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah issued a notice to the CBI on the question whether these petitions before the division bench were legally maintainable and if the high court could pass the order on the CBI probe.During the hearing, the West Bengal government, through senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, disputed the CBI’s jurisdiction, saying that the state was contemplating to file an appeal in the apex court to challenge the order on the CBI probe.Singhvi pointed out that the state government withdrew consent for the CBI to investigate in West Bengal in November 2018, and hence the agency could not carry out its probe in this case.Majee, director of a private company has been named as an accused in the case lodged in November 2020 of corruption and criminal breach of trust with regard to illegal mining and pilferage of coal from leasehold area of Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) in certain parts of West Bengal. ECL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Coal India Ltd, a Public Sector Undertaking.Majee, in his petition filed through advocate Jaikriti S Jadeja, challenged the HC order on the ground that the accusations related to transportation of the illegally extracted coal from West Bengal to other states, besides illegal mining in the “railway areas”, which is under the union government.Appearing for Majee, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi contended: “The entire case is politically motivated. I have also been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate…The question of CBI’s authority must be determined.”Singhvi supported Rohatgi “on the point of law”. “Why should the CBI come and investigate after the withdrawal of consent by the state government? We are already looking into this case and the state police is competent of investigation,” he said.The bench sought to know from the senior lawyers about any specific rule that allowed order of a single judge to be challenged before a division bench in the Calcutta high court since such intra-court appeals in criminal cases were disallowed in other high courts.Rohatgi replied that the division bench could not have heard an appeal against the single judge’s order but since both his client and CBI had gone to the division bench, the petition was now moved before the Supreme Court to protect his client from arrest.However, the bench said no interim order on protection from arrest could be passed without hearing the CBI on the point whether the petitions before the division bench of the high court were maintainable or not. The court then issued a notice to the CBI, calling upon the agency to make submissions on March 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-if-cbi-can-probe-coal-scam-case-101614044270204.html

The leaders had denied the allegations.Advocate Satya Sabharwal, appearing with Swamy, said the trial was stayed till April 12.Swamy moved HC aggrieved by a trial court order of February 11 that declined, for now, his plea to lead evidence against the Gandhis and others in the case.HT could not reach the Congress for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-herald-case-delhi-hc-seeks-reply-from-sonia-and-rahul-101614043622134.html
23-02-2021||India||Turkey to help build naval vessels at Vizag shipyard||Visakhapatnam-based Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL) is expecting an order from the Indian Navy by the year-end for building five mammoth naval support vessels with transfer of technology from a Turkish shipbuilding firm, people familiar with the development said on Monday.The project, estimated to cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, will involve transfer of technology from Anadolu Shipyard, part of the TAIS consortium of Turkey, with which HSL signed an agreement for technical collaboration last year.HSL is expected to deliver the first fleet support vessel (FSV) to the navy within four years of the go-ahead, with the other ships to be delivered at the rate of one every 10 months to 12 months. The vessels will be 230 metres long and have a displacement of 45,000 tonnes. FSVs carry fuel and other supplies for warships.“The agreement with the Turkish consortium will kick in after HSL gets an order from the Indian Navy. If all goes well, that could happen by October 2021. Several Indian vendors will also be involved in the project,” said one of the people cited above, requesting anonymity.Unlike other projects of this type, which usually witness at least one of the vessels being constructed in the country providing the technology, the Turkish side has decided to go ahead with transfer of technology from the initial stages and back the Make in India initiative by constructing all five vessels at HSL, said a second person, who too declined to be named.“Turkey’s shipyards are fully booked for a long time and there is nothing to lose by transferring technology and having all the vessels built in India. Turkish engineers will come to India to assist with the project,” the second person said.Maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral (retired) Sudarshan Shrikhande said: “There is a need for the navy to have fleet support ships. While HSL may have a sort of a collaborative arrangement for transfer of technology and building these in Visakhapatnam, one is not aware if a contract may be in the offing or whether discussions are continuing.”TAIS, which is a member of Turkey’s largest industrial group, and HSL concluded an agreement for cooperation in the first quarter of last year, after the issue had been under a cloud for some time because of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s criticism of the Indian government’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in 2019. Questions were raised in some quarters because of the strong defence ties between Turkey and Pakistan.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said, “Turkey under President Erdogan has focused on building commercial relations with all countries. This pragmatism is being seen in this effort to collaborate with India despite the proximity with Pakistan. India wants to build its naval capabilities and Turkey has a defence industry that is very advanced.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/turkey-to-help-build-naval-vessels-at-vizag-shipyard-101614043364955.html
23-02-2021||India||India, France to hold naval drills||India and France will cement their defence cooperation in April when the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier strike force will conduct exercises with INS Vikramaditya in two phases in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, according to people familiar with the matter.The dates of the exercises are being scheduled between the two navies, the people added.The nuclear-powered French carrier force, comprising two frigates and one support ship, has for several months been on mission “Clemenceau 21”, which deals with fighting terrorism in the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea/ Persian Gulf.According to Indian Navy officers aware of the developments, the Western Fleet with its newly appointed commander Rear Admiral Ajay Kochhar will conduct advanced exercises with the French carrier task force. While Charles de Gaulle is a 42,500 tonne aircraft carrier with Rafale M fighters on board, INS Vikramaditya is a conventionally powered aircraft carrier with displacement of 44,500 tonne and has MiG-29K aircraft on board.April will also see renewed engagement with France with foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian visiting India to deliver a lecture at a think-tank and engage in a political dialogue. Both India and France have convergence over freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific, with Paris appointing a special envoy for the region.To add to this will be the arrival of seven Rafale jets from France between April 19 and 23, after which the first squadron of the French omni-role fighter will be completed at the Ambala airbase. The remaining 18 fighters will be deployed at Hashimara in the eastern sector to cover the strategic Siliguri corridor.India and France have strengthened their bilateral relationship with convergence in the UN Security Council and building the Indian Air Force’s capacity through the purchase of medium transport aircraft and multi-role transport tankers.The two countries have also joined hands in development of air independent propulsion for conventional submarines for future Indian submersible ships.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-france-to-hold-naval-drills-101614043125884.html
23-02-2021||India||SC raps Centre over delayed reply to RTI plea||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre why it had not filed its response to a petition challenging the constitutional validity of amendments to the Right to Information Act despite being asked to do so in January last year.“This is a very important matter,” remarked a bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah.The petition challenging the RTI (Amendment) Act of 2019 and the RTI (Term of Office, Salaries, Allowances, and Other Terms and Conditions of Service) Rules 2019 was filed in the top court by senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh.“Notice was issued on the petition on January 31, 2020. What have you been doing for over a year,” the bench remarked as advocate Kanu Agarwal, appearing on behalf of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, sought an adjournment to file a response by the Centre.The bench said: “Having regard to the fact that this matter has been pending for over a year, let the reply be filed within a short period. List after two weeks.”In January last year, the court had granted Centre four weeks’ time to file a response. Ramesh, in his petition, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes submitted that the amendments to the RTI Act go against the objective sought to be achieved by the parent Act.According to the petition, the amendments brought about by Parliament in July 2019 permitted the government to fix the tenure, salaries, allowances and terms of service of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners of the Central Information Commission (CIC) and State Information Commissions (SECs).This was achieved under the Right to Information (Term of Office, Salaries, Allowances and Other Terms and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2019 by which the tenure of members of CIC and SICs had been reduced from five years to three. The Rules also affected the salaries of the Chief Information Commissioner and information commissioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-raps-centre-over-delayed-reply-to-rtiplea-101614042438387.html
23-02-2021||India||Unethical to promote Patanjali’s Coronil without checks: IMA||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday criticised the promotion of Patanjali’s ayurvedic drug Coronil as “unethical” and a “blatant deceiving of the people of the country”.This comes days after the company relaunched its medicine as the “first evidence-based medicine for Covid-19.”“How can a drug be effective for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation from the disease? If Coronil is effective for prevention, why (is the) government spending ₹35,000 crores for vaccination?” the association said in a statement.“As per the code of act of Medical Council of India, which (is binding) on every modern medical (practitioner), no doctor can promote any drug.”Also Read | Patanjali claims Coronil gets Ayush Ministry certification as per WHO schemeThe relaunch of the medicine took place on Friday in the presence of the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari.“We are delighted and proud to state that Coronil has been granted a CoPP license by DCGI, in accordance with the WHO GMP quality approvals,” tweeted Acharya Balakrishna, chairman of Patanjali Ayurved.Following this, the World Health Organisation’s South East Asian Region had to issue a clarification stating, “@WHO has not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment #Covid19.”In June, when the company first launched the product, the AYUSH ministry directed the company to stop advertising the product till the claim was verified. The company then submitted initial data of its trial at the National Institute of Medical Sciences, Jaipur.The study has recently been published in the journal Phytomedicine and states that 71% of the patients recovered after being administered the treatment as compared to 50% in the placebo group at day 3.At day 7, 100% of those administered the treatment recovered while only 60% of those in the placebo arm did.Doctors on social media have contended that the sample size for the experiments was too small and anyone with severe disease (those with oxygen saturation of less than 90% or acute respiratory distress syndrome) were excluded from the study.The parameters for “recovery” were not defined, several experts said, questioning the paper released by Patanjali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unethical-to-promote-patanjali-s-coronil-without-checks-ima-101614023963099.html
23-02-2021||India||Suspect in rape case that ousted a CM finally held||After 22 years, Odisha Police have arrested the third and the last accused in a gang rape case that triggered state-wide outcry and led to the ouster of then Congress chief minister JB Patnaik in 1999, officials said on Monday.Police said 50-year-old Bibekananda Biswal, alias Biban, was picked up from Maharashtra’s Aamby Valley township on Sunday. He was working as a plumber, allegedly masquerading as a man identified as Jalandhar Swain, said Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissioner Sudhansu Sarangi.“After getting a tip-off on Biswal, we started ‘Operation Silent Viper’ to catch hold of him. With the help of Pune Rural police, we tracked him down...,” Sarangi told the press in Bhubaneswar.Sarangi said Biswal got an Aadhaar card and a new voter identity card made in his fake name. “He used to send money to his family. He was asking his family to get a death certificate made so that Biban Biswal can be shown as dead in police records. We have informed the CBI about his arrest and waiting to hand him over,” Sarangi said.Biswal, Padia Sahoo, then 26, and Dhirendra Mohanty, then 25, were named in the gang rape of Anjana Mishra, then 29, on a desolate stretch of a highway connecting Cuttack and state capital Bhubaneswar on the night of January 9, 1999. The three intercepted her and her journalist friend while they were on their way to Bhubaneswar. Her friend was held at gunpoint.The incident came about a year and half after Mishra, the estranged wife of an Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer, accused Indrajit Ray, the then Odisha advocate general, of molesting her in his chamber. In her first information report (FIR), Mishra alleged that top functionaries of the government ordered the rape to silence her.The gang rape of Mishra became a politically sensitive case and eventually led to the stepping down of then CM JB Patnaik at the insistence of the Congress high command.As the news of Biswal became public, Mishra demanded that he be hanged till death. At a press conference in Bhubaneswar on Monday, she accused the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the case, of denying her justice.“Over the years, multiple attempts have been made to eliminate me. My house (Bhubaneswar) was vandalised. I was not allowed to stay in my house. I am forced to live with my mother (in the same city),” Mishra, who has separated from her husband, said. She alleged that Biswal evaded arrest for years due to a section of Congress leaders backing him.Congress legislator Suresh Routray, however, dismissed the charge. “It is a laughable allegation. We are happy that Biswal has been arrested,” said Routray.At the time of the incident, Mishra was locked in a marital dispute with her husband. On July 11, 1997, she visited the chamber of then advocate general Ray to discuss a case of dowry harassment.Later, she alleged that Ray tried to sexually harass her.On February 2, 2000, a CBI court in Bhubaneswar found Ray guilty of molesting Mishra and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment and handed him a ₹5,000 fine. He was arrested the same day but released minutes later on a bail bond of ₹40,000 and two sureties. He appealed against the order in a higher court, but died in 2008 before the judgment was out.In her FIR, Mishra accused CM JB Patnaik of engineering the gang rape so as to scare her into withdrawing the case against Ray, a friend of the Congress leader. As opposition parties mounted pressure for his resignation, JB Patnaik quit his post on February 17, 1999. In April 2000, assembly elections were held and a government by the Biju Janata Dal, which is still ruling the state, came to power.Sahoo and Mohanty were arrested in January 1999, days after the crime. The Orissa high court ordered a CBI investigation into the gang rape case and a charge sheet was filed that May. In April 2002, a CBI court in Bhubaneswar sentenced Sahoo and Mohanty to life imprisonment and fined each of them ₹5,000. The high court upheld that verdict in 2010. Sahoo died in 2020, while Mohanty is serving his sentence in special jail of Bhubaneswar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspect-in-rape-case-that-ousted-a-cm-finally-held-101614023166218.html
23-02-2021||India||Police get Disha’s custody for a day||A Delhi court asked the Delhi Police on Monday to produce climate activist Disha Ravi before it again on Tuesday as it sent her to one day’s custodial interrogation during which she will be confronted with co-accused, lawyer Nikita Jacob and engineer Shantanu Muluk, in connection with the toolkit case related to the farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders.The bail plea of the 22-year-old is pending before additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana, who is expected to pass an order on the petition on Tuesday.Chief metropolitan magistrate Pankaj Sharma sent Ravi to one day’s custodial interrogation by the Delhi Police special cell, saying the remand was being granted for a shorter period than the five days sought by the police because she only has to be confronted with Mumbai lawyer Jacob and Pune-based engineer Shantanu Muluk.Also Read | Order on Disha’s bail reserved for TuesdayRavi was produced at the end of her three-day judicial custody. The police had sought a remand for five days to confront Ravi with Jacob and Muluk.“As the case involves the allegations of vituperous campaign to spread hatred and dissatisfaction to disturb peace and tranquility, to undermine sovereignty, integrity and security, the investigating authority must be provided fair time and chance within the ambit of law to reach out to truth through custodial interrogation and confrontation.“However, at the same time, a balance has to be struck with individual’s right and considering the same, police custody remand of the accused is deemed necessary for a shorter period than required by police as only confrontation of accused with other co-accused is sought and accordingly, accused is remanded to one day {in} police custody…,” the judge said.Ravi was arrested on February 13 in connection with an online toolkit which Delhi Police claimed was created by her in support of farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws.Jacob and Muluk were granted transit pre-arrest bail by courts in Mumbai.On Monday, appearing for the police, public prosecutor Vikas Singh told the court the department required Ravi’s custody to question her along with the two other accused in the case who joined the probe on Monday.He said the present request for police custody was not punishment, but rather would be helpful to Ravi because she was shifting the blame onto the other two accused.The police, in its remand application, said that from the collective confrontation of the accused, the role played by each of them in deletion of the original Toolkit document would come to light.Ravi’s lawyer Siddharth Agarwal opposed the demand saying she has already been questioned by the police and facts conveyed in the earlier remand application remained the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-get-disha-s-custody-for-a-day-101614022472776.html
23-02-2021||India||Will make more trips till poll dates out: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday suggested that the schedule for this summer’s assembly elections could be announced by the Election Commission in the first week of March, even as he flagged off new projects in Assam and West Bengal, two of the battleground states where polling is due in April-May.“I know you are waiting for the election...since last time it (poll schedule) was announced on March 4 (2016), this time it could be announced around that time. It’s the Election Commission’s job and it will take a call. Whatever time I get in the interim, I will try keep coming to meet you all,” he said at a meeting in Assam’s Dhemaji.“If we consider March 7 as the date of announcement, whatever time I get...I will try tirelessly to return among you,” he added.Also Read | After Sonar Bangla, PM Modi calls for Ashol Paribarton in poll-bound BengalTo be sure, EC is an autonomous constitutional authority responsible for administering election processes in India.Chief election commissioner Sunil Arora and election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar have visited Assam, Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry, where polls are likely to be completed before May-end. The dates and the number of polling phases are yet to be announced as the commission is still deliberating on the matter.During his third visit to Assam in a month, Modi dedicated to the nation three major projects in the petroleum sector worth over ₹3,222 crore, inaugurated Dhemaji Engineering College and laid the foundation stone for Sualkuchi Engineering College, carrying on with his development push evident during his previous visits as well.“Despite immense potential, previous governments treated the north bank of Brahmaputra (in Assam) in a step-motherly manner. Connectivity, hospitals, educational institutions or industry was not a concern of earlier governments,” Modi said at a public meeting at Silapathar, apparently hitting out at the Congress. “Such bias was done away with after the arrival of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government led by Sarbananda Sonowal (in 2016),” he added.Among the oil and gas projects, he dedicated the INDMAX unit at Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)’s Bongaigaon refinery to the nation. INDMAX is an indigenously developed technology of IOC to produce a high yield of LPG and high-octane gasoline from petroleum fractions.The Congress hit out at Modi, calling him a “migratory bird” who visits the state often but does not solve any problem. “Why did he not come when the state was suffering from flood? Why did he not come when five youngsters were gunned down by police during the anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) movement (in December 2019)?” Assam Pradesh Congress committee president Ripun Bora asked.In West Bengal, Modi called for “ashol paribartan (real transformation)”, while sharpening his criticism of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her ruling Trinamool Congress. He also flagged off the extension of the city’s north-south Metro corridor from Noapara to Dakshineshwar along with a slew of other railway projects. It was his second public rally in the eastern state this month.At a public rally in Hooghly district, around 50 km north of Kolkata, he came down heavily on the TMC over alleged corruption and alleged that the TMC government was not allowing development programmes in the state. “Development of Bengal is not possible till the time there is syndicate rule, reign of extortionists, culture of cut money, and the administration gives shelter to goons. Voices are being raised from every corner demanding ashol paribartan,” he added.“Paribartan” was the main slogan of the TMC in 2011, the year it ended the 34-year Left Front rule.“Modi has raised false and baseless allegations...BJP is not in power. But their workers and leaders have already started extortion. If BJP comes to power it would be devastating,” said TMC MP Saugata Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-make-more-trips-till-poll-dates-out-pm-101614020752328.html
23-02-2021||India||China says it supports India hosting the BRICS 2021 summit||China on Monday said it supports India hosting this year’s BRICS summit and will work with New Delhi to strengthen the bloc, allaying concerns that the India-China border dispute will impact the forum.India assumed the rotating chairmanship of the five-member summit, comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa on January 1, taking over from Russia, which hosted the last summit as an online event in November because of the Covid-19 pandemic.India taking over the BRICS leadership, for the third time since the group was formed, comes at a sensitive time as New Delhi’s ties with Beijing are facing their worst challenges in decades. It’s only after nine months and several rounds of negotiations that border troops have disengaged from the south and north banks of Pangong Lake.Also Read | Anti-India propaganda continues online in China“We support India in hosting this year’s meeting. We will work with it and other members to strengthen communication and dialogue and consolidate the three-pillar cooperation, expand BRICS plus cooperation and work for greater progress under BRICS,” the foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, when asked whether the India-China border dispute will impact BRICS.The “three pillars” Wang referred to are policy and security; economy and finance; and culture and people-to-people exchanges.China will “also help the world to defeat Covid-19, resume economic growth and improve global governance,” Wang further added.Wang said that BRICS is a cooperation mechanism of global influence consisting of emerging economies and developing countries which “in recent years it has seen greater solidarity, deeper practical cooperation and a greater influence”.It is now a positive, stable, and constructive force in international affairs,” he said.“China attaches importance to this mechanism, and we are committed to deepening strategic partnership within it to consolidate solidarity and cooperation,” Wang said.He did not respond to the question on whether President Xi Jinping will attend the BRICS summit in India.In his address during the last summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India would focus on improving cooperation within the bloc.“During our presidency in 2021, we will try enhancing intra-BRICS cooperation by strengthening all the three pillars. We will endeavour to enhance intra-BRICS solidarity and develop a solid institutional framework for this purpose,” Modi said.In December, China complimented India for hosting the Council of Heads of Government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in late November, saying all member states spoke highly of the conference’s outcomes. It was the first-time India had hosted the SCO Council of Heads of Government after it joined the eight-member grouping in 2017.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday attended the virtual meeting of the bloc which was also addressed by Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-supports-india-hosting-the-brics-2021-summit-101613996181212.html
