We urge citizens to use water judiciously. Water tankers etc. in adequate numbers are being deployed and all possible efforts being made to reduce turbidity. (2/3)“Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi Water Treatment Plants are currently operating at reduced capacity due to the increased turbidity in water,” he said.Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. Turbidity is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). High turbidity can be caused by debris, silt, mud, algae, plant pieces, melting glaciers, sawdust, wood ashes or chemicals in the water.“The Delhi Jal Board urge citizens to use water judiciously. Water tankers inadequate numbers are being deployed and all possible efforts being made to reduce turbidity,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uttarakhand-floods-may-affected-water-supply-in-south-east-and-north-east-delhi-101613326963220.html
14-02-2021||City||Six elephants die of bacterial disease in Odisha, highest in any sanctuary||Even as two more female elephants in Odisha's Karlapat wildlife sanctuary of Kalahandi district succumbed to bacterial disease in last two days, wildlife veterinarians on Sunday confirmed that all the six animals died of haemorrhagic septicaemia or Pasteurellosis.While four female elephants were found dead in the Karalapat Wildlife Sanctuary of Kalahandi between February 1 and 12, two more died in last two days taking the death toll to six.The veterinary experts from the Centre of Wildlife Health in Odisha University of Agriculture Technology, Bhubaneswar, conducted tests on the viscera of the carcasses. The experts also carried out molecular tests and confirmed that the deaths were due to haemorrhagic septicaemia or Pasteurellosis. The disease affects mainly water buffaloes, cattle, and bison in tropical areas of southeast Asia where the population of water buffaloes is high. Acute infection can persist up to three days and less often 5 days. The disease and is characterised by high fever ranging 104°–106°F, restlessness and reluctance to move, hypersalivation and nasal discharge."Our tests confirmed that the elephants were infected by a bacteria called Pasteurella multocida, that resides mostly as a commensal in the nasopharynx of animals. It's a disease that affects the respiratory and digestive tracts of the affected animals. However, we are yet to pinpoint the source of the bacteria. There are 4-5 villages located inside the sanctuary with domestic cattle population that may have spread the bacteria," said Dr Niranjan Sahu, head of the College of Veterinary Sciences, who had conducted the tests.Also read: JeM planned terror attacks in Delhi, says J-K DGPSahu confirmed that this is the first case of haemorrhagic septicaemia in the wild in Odisha. "There have been some cases of haemorrhagic septicaemia in India and the rest of the world. But not in Odisha," he said. He said no case of death due to haemorrhagic septicaemia have been reported from any of the livestock in Karlapat wildlife sanctuary so far.Divisional Forest Officer, Kalahandi (south), T Ashok Kumar said of the 17 elephants in the sanctuary, the dead elephants were part of a 7-member herd. "The male elephant of the herd is fine. The other male elephants in the sanctuary are also doing fine. We believe the elephants have developed an immunity. We have separated the other elephants and started vaccination of the livestock across the 4-5 villages of the sanctuary. We have also disinfected the water bodies in the area over fears of possible contamination," he said.Renowned wildlife veterinary expert Arun Zachariah from Kerala said that the death of six elephants due to haemorrhagic septicaemia could be the largest ever in Indian forests. "There have been sporadic deaths of elephants due to haemorrhagic septicaemia, but never a case of mass deaths. The animals developing haemorrhagic septicaemia can die of pneumonia. But there are various other symptoms. The Odisha deaths could be the single largest case of deaths due to haemorrhagic septicaemia," said Zachariah.In 2020-21, so far, 61 elephants have died in Odisha of which 28 were due to unnatural causes. While 10 elephants have been either poached or poisoned to death, more than a half a dozen were been electrocuted.In August and September 2019, five elephant calves in Nandankanan zoo and adjoining Chandaka elephant sanctuary had succumbed to elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus. It was the first reported case of EEHV-related deaths in an Indian zoo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-elephants-die-of-bacterial-disease-in-odisha-highest-in-any-sanctuary-101613326853653.html
14-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports over 4,000 new Covid cases first time since January 6||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 4,092 Covid-19 infections, first in excess of 4,000 since January 6, taking its tally to 2,064,278. The 39-day high came after the state averaged around 3,500 new cases for the past four days.Mumbai, meanwhile, reported over 600 cases after 31 days with 645 fresh infections. The city last saw over 600 cases in a day on January 14. The rise is particularly noticeable in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), and it is being attributed to resumption in local train services, lifting of most curbs and laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour.As of Sunday, there were 35,965 active cases in the state. The positivity rate in the state has been over 13% for the past 18 days, data showed. Mumbai’s total tally rose to 314,076, while the city’s active cases count stood at 4,193.The state reported 40 fatalities on Sunday, taking the toll to 51,529. Mumbai reported four deaths, taking its tally to 11,419. Of the 40 deaths reported, 15 occurred in the past 48 hours and seven in the past week. The remaining 18 deaths were from the period before last week.Cases in MMR, including Mumbai and cities like Nagpur, Nashik and Pune, have witnessed a spurt in cases over the past two weeks. Daily caseload of MMR touched 1,141, on February 14, up from 592 on February 1. The rise in these two weeks in Pune (353 from 102), Nashik (122 from 45) and Nagpur (437 from 200), too, was sharp.Health experts, who are also on state government panels and task forces, have attributed the rise in cases to increased movement of people post unlocking, resumption of trains in Mumbai and MMR, and Covid fatigue in wearing masks and sanitising.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 and former director-general of health services, said that he was “warning” of a possible surge in daily cases. He said, “I was warning about it for the past few days. The daily cases that we were seeing for the past few weeks fluctuated. But there was no declining trend week-on-week. Now we are seeing an upward trend.”Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid task force in the state, said, “Kerala and Maharashtra are outliers. And it has coincided with three things, full unlocking, gram panchayat elections, and some degree of schools and colleges. All these three things have a significant role. In geographies like Mumbai, MMR, the floating population of trains is increasing. These are the reasons that are propping up the cases and needs to be looked at urgently.”Salunkhe added that resumption in local train services could be a danger for Mumbai if people remain lax in following Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Mumbai could get into trouble with local trains starting and flow of people from its surrounding areas. The numbers were expected to rise as people are lax in Covid-appropriate behaviour. We are seeing a similar rise in Pune district as well as people are behaving as the pandemic has passed,” Salunkhe said.Dr Joshi added that the train traffic has gone up from 2 million to 3.4 million after the general public was allowed to use trains from February 1. “We definitely need to remain on a red alert and should avoid complacency,” said Joshi.The experts added that increased public awareness is a key factor in preventing the spike to turn into a surge. Besides that, they said the administration needs to ramp up community testing and tracking. “Community testing has gone down drastically. We need to restart it and tell people that it is their responsibility to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. There is Covid fatigue that is set in for lack of masking. It should be told to the people that if they do not want another lockdown, they have to start stringent Covid appropriate behaviour and remain on guard,” said Joshi.Salunkhe added that the vaccination drive is progressing slowly and it will take time for herd immunity to build after inoculation. He said, “The vaccination is happening at a slow pace. The inoculation of the general public (above age 50, and with comorbidities) will start only next month. Till that period at least, people have to remain vigilant.”For Mumbai, Dr Joshi said that the population that was thus far unexposed to the virus could be getting affected. He suggested that areas should be relooked and put them on “red alert”. “Covid is going to become endemic in Mumbai. We will routinely see cases between 400 and 600 daily. But it should not drastically spike. The exposed population could have been herd immunity, but the unexposed population, which is getting hurt now. For example, children who never stepped out earlier are now going to schools. We might see a spurt in these cases. We need to relook local geographical spots and put them on red alert. Increase testing, tracking and isolation,” Dr Joshi said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra will start administering the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine to healthcare workers from Monday. Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer, said that those healthcare workers who got their first vaccination shot on January 16 will be given their second dose on Monday.On the first day, 18,582 healthcare workers had taken the vaccine in Maharashtra, including 1,926 from Mumbai. The second dose of the vaccine is supposed to be given at a minimum interval of 28 days after the first dose.“We will start the second shot for healthcare workers. The sessions [on the Co-WIN] have been created, they have been intimated via SMS,” said Dr Patil. The state has so far not planned to increase the vaccination centres so far, Dr Patil said. He said that they would see the response of HCWs and accordingly centres will be increased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-over-4-000-new-covid-cases-first-time-since-january-6-101613327145514.html

14-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Actor-businessman Sachiin Joshi arrested in money-laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Sunday arrested businessman and actor Sachiin Joshi, 36, for his alleged involvement in laundering ₹100 crore in the business activities of Omkar Developers, one of the key builders in Mumbai, said sources. The ED has been questioning Joshi for two consecutive days and he has been charged under relevant sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). He will be produced in the PMLA court on Monday. Recently, income-tax officials raided Joshi’s house in Mumbai, however, the agency did not reveal the details of its ongoing probe. The money laundering case against Omkar Group is based on the FIR registered by Aurangabad Police in March 2020 for alleged cheating and criminal breach of trust. The ED has stated that Omkar Realtors and Developers Pvt Ltd and its directors had bought a firm Surana Construction, which had slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) rights for redevelopment of Anand Nagar SRA Cooperative Housing Society, Wadala, Mumbai. Omkar and its promoters did not pay back the due amount to seller and also mortgaged future FSI of the said SRA project and took huge amounts of loans. ED officials state they diverted ₹410 crore taken in loans. Omkar Group’s spokesperson had previously said that the Omkar Group is not in violation of any lending norms and slum approvals. Previously, promoters of Omkar Group – Babulal Varma, 50, and Kamal Kishore Gupta, 62, were arrested on January 27 under the provisions of the PMLA. Joshi was also in the news for buying fugitive offender Vijay Mallya’s Kingfisher Villa for ₹73.01 crore. Joshi’s website describes him as “the man behind the Viiking Mission, entrepreneur, businessman, actor, sports enthusiast, franchise and team owner and movie producer”. Actor and producer Joshi is known for his works in Tollywood and Bollywood. Joshi has done number of films in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages. He was also a lead in the 2013 film Jackpot, in which he starred opposite Sunny Leone and Naseeruddin Shah. His most recent film is ‘Amavas’, which he self-financed and co-stars Nagris Fakhri. In October 2020, the Cyberabad police in Hyderabad had registered a cheating and Trademark Act violation case against Joshi and his father for allegedly running a gutkha manufacturing unit at Gaganpahad on Hyderabad’s outskirts. Joshi also owns the Dambulla franchise of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) called as Dambulla Viikings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-actor-businessman-sachiin-joshi-arrested-in-money-laundering-case-101613327026017.html

About 35% work on the ₹467-crore project has been completed and it will be completed by the end of December this year, they said.The UP State Bridge Corporation (UPSBC), the state agency that is building the road, had started work on the project in June last year with a deadline of December 2022, said the officials.The proposed six-lane elevated road will start from Sector 39/43 crossing and end at Sector 82 T-point. Once developed, the elevated road will decongest major traffic in Noida’s Barola, Bhangel, and sectors 49, 45, 47 and 46, among other areas.On Sunday, UPSBC joint managing director Asheesh Srivastav and Noida authority chief general manager Rajiv Tyagi revised the completion schedule after conducting an inspection at the construction site. “Since the work is in full swing and one year ahead of its actual deadline, the two agencies revised the deadline on papers today after the joint inspection. We have directed the agency to carry out work day and night so that it gets completed by end of December this year. So far, we have finished 35% of work on this project,” said Tyagi.The elevated road will ease traffic pangs at DSC road which begins from Delhi-Noida border and ends at Dadri town that is located on GT road. The Noida authority is building the elevated stretch to ensure that the thousands of commuters, who travel from Delhi to offices in Noida’s Phase 2 industrial areas, do not face traffic congestion. This project will immensely benefit the residents in Noida and Greater Noida as it is likely to cut travel time between the two cities by 20 minutes, said the officials. The Noida authority is funding this project.“We have instructed strictly to finish the work on time and also deliver quality construction on this project,” said Srivastav of UPSBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-bhangel-elevated-road-project-to-get-complete-by-end-of-this-year-101613326967498.html

The authority allotted these plots through a lucky draw under a scheme launched in July 2011, officials said. The draw event at Indira Gandhi Kala Kendra started at 9pm and went on till 1am, the officials said, adding that many farmers stayed at the centre till late night. “We followed all laid down rules to organise the lucky draw and allotted the plots to those farmers, who were found eligible,” said Santosh Upadhyay, officer on special duty, Noida authority.The authority could not allot the plots in the past nine years due to objections from farmers with regard to plot rate and dispute over the eligibility criteria. The authority finally decided to allot the 644 plots (each having an area of 162 square metres) at a rate of ₹29,000 per sqm and farmers agreed, the officials said.The authority had come up with the scheme after farmers’ consistent demands for the same. “The Noida authority allotted 5% (of total land acquired) residential plots to those farmers, whose land was acquired after 1997 following an order of the Allahabad high court. Subsequently, those farmers whose land was acquired between 1976 and 1997 started demanding plots. So, the authority had come up with the plot scheme,” said a Noida authority official, not authorized to speak to media.A total of 3,788 farmers had applied for the plots in 2011. Subsequently, 1,904 farmers were found to be eligible for the scheme. “We organised the lucky draw for 1,904 farmers and selected successful allottees for 644 plots,” said Upadhyay.The farmers who could not get the plots after the lucky draw said that they should also be given the plots. “We kept demanding a rate less than the market rate but nothing happened. The authority should have provided plots to all the eligible farmers, including their heir after death of an original land owner,” said Raghuraj Singh, a farmer leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-farmers-get-residential-plots-after-nine-years-101613326904788.html
14-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor Koshyari meets Amit Shah in Delhi post aircraft controversy||Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari reportedly met Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi in an unscheduled visit to New Delhi, on Sunday. He met Shah in the morning in a closed-door meeting before leaving for Mumbai in the afternoon. The details of the meeting are still under wraps. The Governor returned to the city in the evening after a gap of three days.The move is significant in the backdrop of the controversy over denial of the state’s six-seater Cessna Citation XLS airplane, to travel to Dehradun by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Koshyari, who was expected to return to the city on Saturday, changed his plans and reached Delhi on a commercial flight the same day. The Governor is locked in a bitter tussle with the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, which is now deepening with new issues.The Governor had to face an embarrassment on Thursday as he went to the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSMIA) and boarded a state’s aircraft for travelling to Dehradun but had to deplane and take a commercial flight since the chief minister’s office (CMO) had not approved the use of state’s plane.The incident led to a blame game between the Raj Bhavan and CMO as the latter has said the former should have ensured that they had permission to use the aircraft before the Governor departed from his official residence. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said the state government will also seek a report from the Governor’s office over the incident following the directive of the chief minister. The report will be sought from the secretary to Governor Santosh Kumar by the state general administration department.Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, in its editorial on Saturday, termed it as a personal tour. “The Governor was informed a day before his scheduled departure that he cannot be permitted to use the aircraft as his tour was a personal trip. Despite that, he went to the airport out of his stubbornness. He should maintain the honour and dignity of the post he is holding. He is being used as a ‘puppet’ and it’s an ‘insult’ to the nation,” the editorial stated.On Friday, Thackeray also avoided reacting to the controversy and remarked that the government is developing an airstrip at Palghar so that everyone’s aircraft can be landed there. He was responding to a question about the incident. Thackeray further chose to use a helipad at Mahalaxmi racecourse instead of the one at Raj Bhavan (Governor house at Malabar Hill) following the aircraft controversy, the officials said.He was on a visit to Palghar district where he reviewed the development schemes and basic infrastructure.Koshyari attended the 122th IAS induction program at the Lal Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie on Friday. He also met Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and discussed the ongoing rescue operation following the glacier disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-koshyari-meets-amit-shah-in-delhi-post-aircraft-controversy-101613326846070.html

14-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC issues notice to American embassy for New Jersey resident in a murder appeal||The Bombay high court (HC), on February 9, directed the court registry to issue notice to the American embassy and directed the state to send the nonbailable warrant (NBW) issued against an accused residing in New Jersey, the United States, to the embassy. The court has sought a report from the state within two weeks. The court has also directed commissioner of police, Thane to execute the NBW against another accused residing in Baroda. The directions came after the court was informed that both the accused, who were acquitted of a 2003 murder case, were not appearing for the hearing of the appeal against their acquittal filed by the state in 2004. The court also directed issuance of a lookout notice against both the accused and to circulate the same to all airports to ensure their presence for the hearing of the appeal. On February 9, a division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice Nitin Borkar, while hearing an appeal filed by the state of Maharashtra against the acquittal, was informed that the state wanted to adduce further evidence in the case, and hence the appeal against the acquittal should be heard. The appeal was filed in 2004 wherein both the persons had been represented by their respective lawyers. In an earlier hearing on February 4, the court was informed by advocate Nitin Sejpal, for the second respondent who lives at Baroda, that his client had not responded to the notice of final hearing of the appeal despite being repeatedly informed of the same and that the respondent had blocked all communication from the advocate. With regards to the first respondent, the court was informed by additional public prosecutor PP Shinde that as per the trial court records, he was residing in New Jersey, US and no advocate represented him for the hearing of the appeal. The court took cognisance of the submissions and directed for the issuance of an NBW against the two acquitted persons. While directing the registry to issue notice to the American Embassy, the court directed the state to send the NBW to the embassy to ensure that the first respondent was present for the hearing of the appeal. The court also directed the commissioner of police, Thane to communicate with the commissioner of police, Baroda to ensure the presence of the second respondent and to personally look into the matter and make every possible effort to get the NBW executed. The matter has been posted for hearing on March 9. Advocate Ashraf Ahmed Shaikh said that as per section 105 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), reciprocal arrangements were made by the Central government with foreign governments, and in light of this the ministry of home affairs on February 11, 2009 issued comprehensive guidelines with regards to the service of summons/warrants/judicial processes. “As per the guidelines, the service of nonbailable arrest warrants amounts to the extradition of the individual and such requests are to be forwarded to the ministry of external affairs, New Delhi,” said Shaikh. He added that the NBW issued by the Bombay HC was enforceable on the first respondent living in New Jersey, but it had to be done based on certain legal procedures contained in applicable treaties negotiated on the basis of the International Principle of Extradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-issues-notice-to-american-embassy-for-new-jersey-resident-in-a-murder-appeal-101613326785482.html
14-02-2021||Noida||Protesting farmers light candles on second anniversary of Pulwama terror attack||Ghaziabad: The protesting farmers at the UP Gate on Sunday evening carried out a candlelight march in memory of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans killed in the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 in 2019. The farmers said that the event was held to symbolise that “jawan” (soldier) and “kisan” (farmer) are together and come from the same families. The event was also organised to express solidarity with families of the farmers who died during the ongoing agitation, farmer leaders said. “The candle march was held at the UP Gate for one hour in remembrance of our soldiers who got martyred during the Pulwama attack and also in remembrance of over 200 farmers who have died during the ongoing agitation. It is to show that farmers and soldiers are not different but sons of same families,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand who is also member of UP Gate farmers’ committee. Forty CPRF personnel had lost their lives during the Pulwama attack. Meanwhile, some farmer leaders also carried out their rallies to garner support in Haryana. The Bharatiya Kisan Union national spokesperson, Rakesh Tikait, held a meeting with farmers at Indri in Karnal on Sunday. Tikait said that they will not let the government sit in peace till the demands of farmers are met. “They will have to decide our issues while talking to our committee members. Till that time, we will not let the government sit in peace. The government has to give a guarantee of purchase on MSP as well as repeal the three new laws,” Tikait told the gathering while also claiming that the new laws will finish the public distribution system. “Farmers should concentrate on their organisation and believe in the ‘gathbandhan’ (core committee of farmers talking to the government). There is not a single weak link in the core committee, which will decide our issues and farmers will abide by its decisions,” he said, adding that the panchayats will also be held in states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. While returning to the UP Gate site, Tikait stopped at the Panipat toll plaza where he lit candles in memory of the Pulwama martyrs and also the farmers who died during the ongoing agitation. “This is to remember our soldiers who got martyred on February 14 (2019) in Pulwama and also our farmers who died and got ‘martyred’ during the ongoing agitation and even those farmers who died during earlier agitations anywhere. It is to remember jawan and kisan as both come from same house,” Tikait said. The farmers led by Rakesh Tikait are camping at the UP Gate since November 28 last year to press for repeal of three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. The last talks between the leaders of farmers’ unions and the government were held on January 22 and thereafter no talks are scheduled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/protesting-farmers-light-candles-on-second-anniversary-of-pulwama-terror-attack-101613326664904.html

14-02-2021||Noida||Noida: Control room fields queries about vaccine effects, dispels fears||NOIDA: It was a hectic weekend for the Integrated Control Room (ICR) at HCL premises in Noida Sector 59. All 30 phone lines attached to the helpline 18004192211 (extension number 6) at the vaccination cell of the ICR received calls every 10th minute for three hours, starting 2 pm, on Sunday.A Border Security Force (BSF) personnel, called to ask: “I tested positive for Covid-19 last month and was admitted to the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) referral hospital at Lakhnawali camp in Greater Noida. While being discharged from the hospital, the doctors had told me that since I’ve developed antibodies to fight the viral infection, there is no need to take the jab unnecessarily.”Set up on January 27 to provide solutions to the pre and post-inoculation queries of beneficiaries, the vaccination cell has received over 1,000 calls in the last 18 days. A team of four doctors is led by Dr Lalit Kumar, the additional chief medical officer (ACMO) and the in-charge of ICR, besides Dr Akanksha Kanoujia, Dr Naina Gupta, Dr Nitin Kumar and Dr Akash Kumar, work in three shifts 24x7 – 8am to 2pm, 2pm to 8pm and 8pm to 8am.The ACMO said the vaccination cell here receives several calls these days.“While beneficiaries who have received their vaccine dose ask about the medication and precautions to be taken in the post-vaccination days, the listed frontline workers often want to know what is the accuracy and efficiency of the vaccine whether it should be taken or not. There is another lot of callers who want to know the difference between the two types of vaccines being administered here,” he said. The vaccination cell also has seven support staff for each shift.“They (mostly teachers from government schools) support us in making and receiving the calls and forwarding it to doctors. The support staff also work in shifts. These days, we are making calls to beneficiaries who were left out in the first phase of the vaccination drive, for the mop-up round on February 15. Besides, we are also calling beneficiaries who had taken their first dose on January 16 to come to their respective booths for the second dose on February 15,” the ACMO said. Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, who was present at the vaccination cell of ICR, located inside the premises of in HCL Technologies, Sunday, said the district health department is leaving no stone unturned to try for a 100% turnout during the vaccination. “Eighty vaccination booths at 26 hospitals in the district have been for the mop-up round and the second dose of the vaccination in the district on Monday,” he said. “Those who have been vaccinated are being asked to motivate others. Video messages of vaccination ambassadors are also being circulated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-control-room-fields-queries-about-vaccine-effects-dispels-fears-101613326545417.html
14-02-2021||Noida||Police look for suspect in 4-yr-old’s abduction, murder case||Greater Noida: The Surajpur police have launched a search for a suspect in the abduction and murder case of a four-year-old boy. The victim had gone missing on January 24. His body was recovered after 20 days. So far one suspect – Anil (24) – has been arrested, while another suspect Vijay, 25, is on the run. According to police, the two suspects had allegedly strangled the child to death and dumped the body at an isolated location.The victim’s father runs a grocery shop. He also delivers grocery items to retailers. According to his brother, the boy’s father had gone to deliver some products while his wife was inside the room when the victim went missing at 10:30am. “My brother lives with his wife, a daughter and two sons. We had informed the police the same day when the boy went missing,” he said. He said that on January 13, Vijay and his wife had shifted to their neighbourhood. A few days later, Anil also shifted to Vijay’s place. The suspects used to play marbles with the victim, he alleged. “It appears they kidnapped my nephew to extort money, believing my brother had applied for a loan of ₹8 lakh which was under process,” he said. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that the suspects, both residents of Kannauj, lived in a rented accommodation. “The suspects killed the boy and dumped the body but could not muster the courage to make extortion calls,” he said.Ajay Kumar, station house officer, Surajpur said that the police found that the two suspects, who had shifted to Greater Noida recently, had allegedly been absconding from their rented accommodation since the incident. “Anil and Vijay had fled the spot the same night while Vijay’s wife fled two days later. This led us to suspect their role in this case. Their door was also open and the police team found some kanche (marbles) from their room,” the SHO said. On Saturday, the police team conducted a search and arrested Anil from Surajpur area. Police said he allegedly admitted his involvement in the murder along with Vijay.

14-02-2021||Noida||Poor turnout in Ghaziabad resulting in wastage of Covid-19 vaccine||Ghaziabad: Each vaccine vial contains several doses. Once opened, the doses have to be administered within about four-five hours, after which the medicine, if any left, has to be thrown away. With the dwindling turnout for the vaccination drive against the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in Ghaziabad resulting in wastage of myriad unused doses, district health department officials have said they are now “taking steps to save the doses”.Since January 16, the officials have administered Covishield and Covaxin doses to beneficiaries in eight rounds in Ghaziabad.In the district, about 8-9% Covishield vaccines and about 19-20% Covaxin vaccines are being wasted, they said, adding that each vial of Covishield makes up for 10 doses, and a Covaxin vial for 20 doses.“The wastage is especially due to the low vaccination coverage. We can’t store the leftover doses, we have to dispose of them. Covaxin wastage is higher as a single vial has more doses. We can’t deny vaccination even if there’s only one beneficiary in a room. So, the remaining doses go to waste,” said Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr NK Gupta.At each centre, each session room has a target of 100 beneficiaries.The district, according to official records, has received about 49,000 Covishield doses and 14,500 Covaxin doses so far. Total 18,501 Covishield doses and 3,101 Covaxin doses have been administered to beneficiaries so far in the district, the officials said.The first six rounds, held on January 16, 22, 28 and 29, February 4 and 5 were for only for healthcare workers. However, 1,037 frontline workers were also included in the drive held February 5. The sessions held February 11 and 12 were only for frontline workers. “Since the turnout among frontline workers has dipped considerably, as compared to healthcare workers in the previous sessions, due to which the vaccine wastage is likely to increase. Only four or five beneficiaries come to get the shot per session. If the downward trend in vaccination turnout remains so, we will see more wastage,” the chief medical officer added.To remedy this, the CMO said they are now going to make sure each vial opened is exhausted before the next one is opened. “We have decided that all the session rooms in a centre will first exhaust one vial by providing doses to all beneficiaries, only after which the second vial will be opened. This will reduce the wastage. We are also trying to increase awareness among frontline workers to improve the turnout,” he said. The department used Covaxin during two rounds on February 11 and 12.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls for a comment on the issue.HOW THE NUMBERS STACK UPOn Day 1, 94.75% (379 of 400) beneficiaries received vaccine shots. On January 22, the turnout dropped to 81.28% (3,251 of 4,000); it was 71.91% (4,095 of 5,695) on January 28, 72.69% (4,190 of 5,764) on January 29, 70.05% (3,557 of 5,078) on February 4, 63.74% (3,129 of 4,909) on February 5; 45.33% (1,559 of 3439) on February 11; and 39.41% (1,555 of 3,946) on February 12.At the end of eight vaccination sessions, from January 16 to February 12, the overall coverage in the district stood at 65.35%, with 21,715 beneficiaries out of 33,231 receiving the shots. The remaining healthcare workers, who were not vaccinated during the previous rounds, will get a chance to receive the shots during the mop-up round on Monday, officials said. It will cover 62 centres across the district.“Beneficiaries who took vaccine shots on Day 1 (January 16) should come to the centres for the second dose on Monday, for the mop up round,” Dr Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/poor-turnout-in-ghaziabad-resulting-in-wastage-of-covid-19-vaccine-101613326424822.html
14-02-2021||Mumbai||At ₹95.21 for a litre, petrol price reaches all-time high in Mumbai||Prices of petrol and diesel increased for the sixth consecutive day and reached an all-time high in Mumbai on Sunday. The price of one litre of petrol was ₹95.21 while that of diesel was ₹86.04. This is the highest rise in fuel prices in the city till date. Citizens and transporters have reacted strongly on the constant rise in prices and urged the Central government to reduce excise duty on petroleum products. They have also asked the Maharashtra government to intervene and reduce Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel to give them some relief from skyrocketing prices.Earlier, the highest rise in fuel prices was witnessed in 2018 when the price of petrol and diesel crossed ₹90 and ₹80, respectively. The highest price of petrol was recorded at ₹91.34 for one litre back then.Following the constant rise in fuel prices, the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), an apex body of transporters, on Saturday gave a 14-day ultimatum to the Central government, demanding immediate reduction in central taxes in diesel and to issue advisory to the states to bring down VAT on fuel prices.“The road transport fraternity, in its general council meeting, vented out their resentment at the deteriorating conditions of the road transport sector and the government’s apathy towards it. We demand immediate reduction of diesel prices by bringing down central taxes. We want the Centre to issue an advisory to states to cut down VAT, bring uniformity of diesel prices across the country and its quarterly revision etc.,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, AIMTC.“We also demand immediate resolution of issues related to e-way bills, rationalisation of presumptive tax and discussion on scrapping the policy of vehicles with the transport fraternity before its roll-out. We have given a 14-day notice to the Centre for implementation, else we will declare complete suspension of transport services across the country,” he added.Residents have also urged the state government to intervene by reducing VAT on petroleum products in the state. “VAT can be reduced directly by the state government which will bring immediate relief to the people. Petrol has crossed ₹95 a litre and it is becoming more expensive with each passing day. Other state governments are reducing VAT. Maharashtra government should also reduce it,” said Ajay Rathore, a Parel resident.On Saturday, one litre of petrol was available at ₹94.93 and one litre of diesel at ₹85.70. On Friday, it was ₹94.64 and ₹85.32 for each litre of petrol and diesel, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-95-21-for-a-litre-petrol-price-reaches-all-time-high-in-mumbai-101613326245637.html

The suspect told the police during questioning that he did so to boost memory of his students. He said picked up the idea from videos on the internet, said an officer who is associated with the probe. The suspect has been detained for “detailed investigation” and booked under section 336 of the IPC for acts endangering human life or personal safety of others.Police said so far none of the parents of the suspect’s students have reported any medical complications to their children because of the injections. They are all, however, being medically examined, the police said. Another investigator said the matter was reported on Saturday when one of the students, a resident of the same neighbourhood, returned home with the injection after telling the suspect that he would take it from a doctor known to his parents. The child showed the injection to his parents and told them that they were getting the jab at the coaching centre to boost their memory, the investigator said quoting information given by the suspect.The parents of the child reported the matter to the police. They handed over the fluid to a team from Mandawali police station. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said during initial examination it was found that the liquid was NS solution (normal sodium chloride). “We also found that the tuition teacher is a second year gradation student. He told police that he saw on YouTube that the memory of the children improves if NS solution is administered to them. He was booked under section 336 of the IPC for acts endangering human life or personal safety of others,” Yadav said. The DCP said tuition teacher was yet to be formally arrested. “The matter is being probed from all possible angles,” he said.Normal saline is a prescription medicine used for fluid and electrolyte replenishment for intravenous administration. Faster heart beat, fever and rashes are among are its probable side effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tuition-teacher-booked-for-giving-saline-jabs-to-his-students-for-boosting-memory-101613326065995.html

In a series of tweets, Chadha said that turbidity in raw water collected from Delhi’s Upper Ganga Canal had increased to an “unprecedented level of 8000 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) because of the recent Uttarakhand floods.” “Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi Water Treatment Plants are currently operating at reduced capacity due to the increased turbidity in water,” he said. Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. Turbidity is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). High turbidity can be caused by debris, silt, mud, algae, plant pieces, melting glaciers, sawdust, wood ashes or chemicals in the water. “The Delhi Jal Board urge citizens to use water judiciously. Water tankers inadequate numbers are being deployed and all possible efforts being made to reduce turbidity,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/water-supply-in-south-east-and-north-east-delhi-to-be-hit-101613325946244.html

The farmers, under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), also called for candelight marches across the country in remembrance of the fallen soldiers of Pulwama. On Sunday evening, hundreds of farmers gathered at Singhu, Tikri, and Ghaziabad borders lighting candles to mark the event. Farmers at the main stage also sat with roses in their hands to spread the message of peace, even as agitators raised slogans of “jai jawaan and jai kisan” at the spot. Balwinder Singh, 46, a farmer from Moga district in Punjab, said, “Farmers fighting for their rights were branded as anti-nationals by the government and some media outlets. They forgot the fact that every protesting farmer here has relatives or knows someone who is a jawan (soldier). We observe this to honour the martyred soldiers and their families.” During the event, farmer leaders also saluted the “sacrifice of the protesting farmers” who died during the agitation. “Along with remembering the martyred CRPF personnel, we also remember the farmers who laid down their lives while protesting for their rights here at Delhi’s borders,” said farmer leader Jagjeet Singh Dallewal. “The true tribute to the fallen farmers would be to continue the fight to repeal the laws,” he added. Farmer leader Darshan Pal also remembered the sacrifice of “jawans and kisans” at the kisan mahapanchayat in Indri of Karnal. SKM also condemned the government for not acknowledging the death of farmers who lost their lives during the agitation. “…The government is unashamedly admitting in the parliament that it has no data of the farmers who sacrificed their lives in the ongoing movement. SKM is maintaining a blog site where such data is readily available if the government cares,” they said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-hold-torchlight-march-in-honour-of-fallen-pulwama-soldiers-101613325944982.html
14-02-2021||Other||Despite clearing NEET, why government school students set to reappear for test again||New Delhi: Even though 569 students from Delhi government schools cleared the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) last year, data compiled by the government shows that only around 10% scored the cut-off necessary for admission to government medical colleges. With private institutions charging exorbitant fees, and a majority of students in Delhi government schools from low-income backgrounds, a majority have been forced to reappear for the tests, in the hopes of securing a seat in a public medical institution.As per data analysed by Hindustan Times, only 18 students scored 580 or above, out of 720, the usual cut-off for admissions to government medical colleges under the so-called general category. Nineteen others eligible under the reserved categories were ranked below 10,000, the usual cut-off trend for admission to government colleges.Experts added that the cut-off for reserved seats mostly ranges between ranks 10,000-20,000 for Other Backward Classes (OBC), 50,000-60,000 for Scheduled Castes (SC), and 80,000-90,000 rank for Scheduled Tribes (ST) category in government colleges. Students with ranks below this can also secure admission if seats are not filled.Around 1.35 millions aspirants had appeared for NEET last year for around 80,000 MBBS seats. In Delhi, approximately around 1,100 seats are available in eight government colleges. “This is the usual trend. It can fluctuate to a certain degree at times depending on the availability of seats,” said Mahesh Verma, vice-chancellor of Delhi’s Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, which has five undergraduate medical colleges affiliated to it.According to preliminary data from Delhi’s education department, 29 students of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Molarband cleared the medical exams. However, only two were able to get admitted to undergraduate medical courses, said the school’s principal Sujata Tamta.“The updated numbers show that 42 students from our school cleared the tests. Two got admitted to government medical colleges in Delhi and two more enrolled in other medical professional courses. Most the others are preparing to reappear for the entrance exam. Since most of our students come for low-income backgrounds, these students could not get admitted to private medical institutes, where the fees are exponentially higher than government colleges,” she said.The scenario was similar in Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Okhla’s Noor Nagar, where none of the 23 girls who qualified for NEET 2020 could opt for a degree in medicine in any college this year owing to financial constraints. For instance, 17-year-old Areeba Naeem, whose father works as an electrician in the neighbourhood, was eligible for multiple private institutes but the cheapest fee among these was ₹75 lakh, which was far beyond their means to pay.“We are a family of five, and only one is an earning member. So I decided to take a drop year and prepare again,” said Naeem, adding that she was disappointed with her rank, because she knew she wouldn’t be eligible to get admitted to a government college. School authorities said only one student among the 23 took admission in a pharmacy course at a polytechnic college.Head of the school Mudasir Jahan said, “Our students are children of drivers, hotel staffers, vegetable vendors, cloth-sellers, among others. They could not take admission in private colleges where the fees are very high. We reached out to non-governmental organisations and civil society members to arrange for coaching classes for these students. A former principal of our school sponsored two students and Jamia Cooperative Bank sponsored 10 others for classes at a private coaching institute. The remaining have also been engaged with other coaching institutes at a nominal fee,” she said.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said students seeking admission could opt for the Delhi government’s financial assistance programmes. “It’s good that our students are confident they will score better marks and make another attempt at NEET. It is significant that so many students are passing this exam. However we have loans and scholarships for students who are in need of financial support,” he said.Several government schools are in constant touch with the aspirants and provide them with learning materials and guidance necessary to reappear for NEET this year, which is usually held in April-May.Anurag Tiwari, national academic director (medical) at Aakash Institute with nearly two decades of experience in the area, said, “The range of cut-offs varies across states, but students need to score at least 625 for admission government medical colleges in Delhi under the general category. Students scoring 580 or above can seek admission in government colleges across India under general category. This is the usual trend.”Tiwari explained that qualifying NEET only means that the students will be eligible for medical counselling. “Students getting 150 out of 720 will also be considered among those who have cleared the tests. This means that they are eligible to participate in counselling. While their chances of getting into medical programmes in government colleges are low, these students can seek admission under management quota in private colleges.”IP University vice-chancellor Mahesh Verma said, “Though there are over 800,000 eligible aspirants for nearly 100,000 medical seats, around 900 seats are still vacant across deemed universities because of the high fees. There should be a mechanism to regulate the fee and put a cap so that meritorious students who cannot seek admission in government colleges have a chance to opt at private colleges.”Apart from the fees charged by private institutions, the cost of living in another city is one that most students of Delhi government schools can barely afford.Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, said, “Many students also want to get admitted to institutions in Delhi so that they don’t incur additional living expenses that come with living in another city. So students often take a drop year and prepare again. The results have, however, have motivated students. While they have qualified this year, we believe many will secure admission in government colleges next year.”In November, the Delhi government had asked schools to arrange for sessions where those who cracked competitive exams like NEET and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) to motivate their juniors and be their “role models”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-clearing-neet-why-government-school-students-set-to-reappear-for-test-again-101613325884710.html
14-02-2021||Other||DMRC plans for QR Code, other digital payments in post pandemic world||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation — in the post pandemic world — has decided to introduce Quick Response Code (QR Code) and other digital payment-based systems on its entire network to make ticketing cashless and contactless.For this, the Metro has invited Expression of Interest (EOI) from private firms to upgrade its existing Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) system to enable QR code, bank account and RuPay based ticketing facility on its network.Currently, the QR code-based ticketing system is available only on Delhi Metro’s airport express line. The tickets on the airport express line are issued using a mobile application and the commuters have to scan the QR code ticket, which is sent on the user’s mobile phone, at the AFC gate at the station. Apart from the QR code facility, the airport Metro also allows the use of National Common Mobility Card (NCMC), which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December last year.In the QR code system, users have to register on the mobile application, Ridlr, using mobile number and email ID and buy QR tickets by selecting the starting point, the destination station and the number of passengers who will travel. At a time, a maximum of six tickets can be purchased. Metro users can use their credit or debit card (new cards which have NCMC facility) while travelling on Metro’s airport express.The Metro now plans to make the QR code system available on its nine corridors, spread over 314 kilometres, and 245 stations by 2022. DMRC official said that this is being done following the National Common Mobility Card standard model specified by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry. The DMRC’s average daily ridership is 2.86 million and it served 100 crore riders in the financial year 2019-20.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “DMRC has invited expression of interest for implementation of QR code, EMV (enabled Account Based Ticketing (Master/VISA), and RuPay based ticketing.”The expression of interest also includes upgrading and maintenance of the existing AFC technology. Currently, Metro users have to swipe the Metro travel card or token against the AFC gates to gain entry.DMRC officials said that the entry AFC system on all corridors developed in Phase I, II and III will have to be upgraded. “There is a need for comprehensive maintenance of the AFC system of our Phase I, II and III stations. The existing AFC technology and infrastructure (hardware and software) needs to be updated. The key dates for delivery and commissioning will be detailed out in the Request for Proposal document,” said Dayal.As per the expression of interest document, the work will be awarded for a period of almost 11.5 years, including five years of operation and maintenance, from the date of commencement.While DMRC has been planning to upgrade its ticketing system to become cashless for a while, the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has now only made the need for such technology a necessity.The NCMC will allow passengers with RuPay debit cards, issued in the last 20 months by nearly 23 banks, to be swiped for Metro travel.”It is currently available only on the airport express line. The NCMC will enable seamless travel in different modes of public transport across the country besides shopping and purchases, said the official.The Covid pandemic has severely impacted the public transport system across the country and contactless ticketing is the need of the hour, say experts.Metro services were closed for a period of 169 days last year due to the pandemic. The Centre had allowed Metro operations to resume in September but in a graded manner and with social distancing inside trains and on stations. As part of preventive measures, the DMRC has stopped the sale of tokens at its counters on Metro stations. Currently, metro users have to use DMRC’s travel card while commuting.While Metro trains continue to operate on 50% occupancy, transport and health experts say, contactless ticketing will have long term benefits for different reasons.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said, “This is a good move. In the next few years, there will be different modes of transportation — such as RRTS — will be available. While infrastructure integration is already being done by various agencies to provide seamless travel to commuters, common mobility card will be an added benefit. In the long run it will help in collecting data about passenger movement which will prove beneficial in improving the public transport services. But this facility should also be extended to feeder system.”Public health experts say that while the vaccine will soon be available for the public at large, people will have to continue to observe social distancing, hand hygiene and other basic precautions. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department community medicine, Safdarjung hospital, said, “QR code ticketing will help in ensuring public safety. But hygiene in public transport and other preventive measure should continue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dmrc-plans-for-qr-code-other-digital-payments-in-post-pandemic-world-101613325885292.html

14-02-2021||Gurugram||Farmers hold candle march to remember soldiers who died in Pulwama attack||Farmers protesting at various sites across the Haryana-Rajasthan border on Sunday carried out candle marches to remember the sacrifices of soldiers who died during the Pulwama attack two years ago. Besides marking the second anniversary of the Pulwama attack, protesting farmers also recalled the sacrifices of farmers who had died during the course of the farmers’ agitation and raised slogans calling for the unity of farmers and workers. Sanjay Madhav, a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders, and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that farmers believed in the slogan, “Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan” and had honoured their sacrifices through the march on Sunday. “Around 7pm in the evening, we started our march with candles and torches to honour soldiers who laid their life during the Pulwama attack. From the protest site, we marched till the highway and returned. Farmers also pledged their support for the continuation of the agitation,” said Madhav. Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. He added that the agitation was gaining steam in Rajasthan with a number of farmers mahapanchayats slated to take place in the region. “We will continue our fight against the three laws till the laws are rolled back. A number of mahapanchayats are taking place in Haryana and Rajasthan due to which mobilisation is increasing in both villages and cities,” said Madhav. Maulana Arshad Meel, who is spearheading the Haryana-Rajasthan Mewati Kisan Andalon (movement) protest at Sunehra-Junehra, said that farmers marched from Jurehra till the protest site with candles. “Around 7pm, we started our march and covered over a kilometre to remember the sacrifices of soldiers who lost their lives in the attack,” said Meel. Naveen Sohlot, a farmer from Bawal, said that besides the candle marches that were undertaken at protest sites, residents in various villages also took out marches. “Even at the village level, marches were taken out. This shows that the message of protesting farmers is reaching a wider audience,” said Sohlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-hold-candle-march-to-remember-soldiers-who-died-in-pulwama-attack-101613325586507.html

A case has been registered in this regard at the Sector 50 police station.The woman, in her complaint to the police, said that she was walking to her house in Block D from Block B when two miscreants on a speeding motorbike snatched her gold chain, which, according to her, is worth ₹80,000.

The move to implement digital payments will effectively come into force from Tuesday morning, but is expected to cause heavy congestion at the toll plaza as almost 20% of the vehicles, on an average, still make cash payments, said officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Another issue that is likely to cause congestion is that the volume of traffic on the highway has increased significantly over the last week. The number of toll-paying vehicles, which stood at around 65,000 passenger car units (PCUs) on an average till last week has increased to 80,000 PCUs, said an official of the concessionaire, Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL). The recent decision to do away with the minimum balance in FASTag accounts has also not been implemented fully yet, the official said. Shashi Bhushan, project director, NHAI, however, remained upbeat and said that all steps have been taken to ensure smooth movement of traffic at the toll plaza. “New RFID tag readers have been installed recently, more traffic marshals have been deployed and multiple stalls for the sale of FASTags have been set up at the toll plaza to ensure vehicle owners can buy these,” said Bhushan, adding that drive to implement digital payments has been going on for quite some time. Bhushan, however, said that full implementation of electronic payments could lead to traffic congestion initially because the penetration of FASTags is still at 80%. “Around 20% of vehicles still make cash payment but hopefully, in the next few days, they will also get tags installed,” he said. NHAI officials also said that vehicles entering the lanes without valid tags would have to pay double the fees. An MCEPL official, meanwhile, said that given the recent spurt in traffic, there could be heavy jams at the plaza. “We request all commuters to get FASTags installed on Monday itself and keep the minimum balance so that vehicles don’t get stuck in lanes. We are prepared for the situation but it could get difficult,” the official said. The mandatory digital payment was to be implemented from January 1 but the date was extended to February 15. The FASTags are operated through Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to collect toll. The stickers are fixed on windshield and these are detected at the toll plaza by the readers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/kherki-daula-toll-plaza-to-go-100-digital-from-tuesday-jams-expected-101613325584686.html

The residents also alleged that the developer has also failed to handover the books of accounts, files of residents, and other legal documents to the office after the new RWA took over. The residents on Sunday gathered inside the condominium and sat on a protest with placards against the company. Emaar Palm Drive was launched in 2007 and the apartments were handed over between 2015 to 2020, an RWA member said. Dhiraj Batra, president of RWA, said that they have already complained to the authorities in this matter and they will now approach the economic offences wing, if the developer refuses to release their funds and share the relevant documents. “Non-availability of books and files is causing a lot of inconvenience to the RWA in the recovery of dues from its residents. It is also limiting the efforts of RWA to file legal returns with GST, income tax and registrar,” said wing commander (retd) Baljeet Singh Ahluwalia, a resident.The residents said that they have also filed a complaint with department of country and town planning(DTCP) on January 4 to look into this matter of misappropriation funds. “There are also lot of deficiencies in the project and pending facilities, which were promised in writing at the time of booking, A golf range, a squash court and a bowling alley are some facilities that remain undelivered even today,” said another resident. A spokesperson from Emaar said, “ We are in discussion with all the members of the RWA of Palm Drive regarding their issues and concerns. Modalities are being worked upon. Few meetings have already been held on the matter, and we are working towards arriving at an amicable solution soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-of-housing-project-in-sector-66-hold-protest-against-developer-for-withholding-funds-101613325525306.html
14-02-2021||Gurugram||Fewer than 10% of projects approved by MCG last year executed||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has completed fewer than 10% if the engineering projects that were approved, on basis of the agendas, in last year’s House meetings, civic body officials said on Sunday.Overall, agendas for 159 engineering projects were approved during MCG House meetings last year. Work on 15 of these projects has been completed so far, while work on 33 projects is underway, with no development with regard to 111 projects.Engineering officials of the MCG and municipal councillors cited several reasons for the delay.“We were informed that several projects are facing litigations issues; some are interdepartmental or involve multiple public bodies and thus, paperwork and approval are taking a lot of time. Further, in a large number of projects, estimates have either been prepared incorrectly or are yet to be completed,” said Madhu Azad, mayor, MCG.Azad said that with most projects stuck in administrative approvals, letters have been written to all MCG officials concerned, interdepartmental heads and officials concerned with other public bodies.“Projects being stuck for administrative approvals just show that the MCG officials aren’t taking the House meetings seriously and there is serious laxity on part of the engineering wing. As the mayor and the head of the MCG, I have written to all officials concerned for expediting the works and directed both the additional commissioners to take further review meetings with engineering officials regarding all the incomplete projects within their respective zones,” said Azad.Azad said that a few projects are yet to be sent to the departments concerned, such as the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB), for approval.Last week, the MCG had a review meeting at the PWD rest house regarding the status of all the agendas that were approved in MCG House meetings last year. As part of the review process, the engineering wing gave a presentation to MCG councillors regarding the status of all engineering wing projects and discussed the issues hindering many of them.According to MCG officials privy to the matter, the 15 projects which were completed were local, ward-wise projects. Among the important projects that have not witnessed any progress since their approval during MCG House meetings is the long drainage line, covering multiple wards along the Khandsa Road.The drain is aimed at resolving the waterlogging issue in areas located next to the Badshahpur drain during monsoon.“I had joined MCG only earlier this month. Next week, I have directed officials in my department to both submit and give a detailed explanation on all of the projects concerned. We will be reviewing the matter at our internal level as well and subsequently, fast track all projects,” said TL Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fewer-than-10-of-projects-approved-by-mcg-last-year-executed-101613325524700.html
14-02-2021||Dehradun||Matri Sadan to resume agitation for closure of hydropower projects on Ganga||By Sandeep RawatMatri Sadan ashram which, has been the flagbearer of agitations against hydropower projects in Garhwal Himalayas, has decided to resume its agitation post-Chamoli glacial breach tragedy.From February 23, a seer of the Matri Sadan ashram will go on an agitation (which they call tapasya or acetic practice) demanding scrapping of all hydropower projects being constructed or in the pipeline on river Ganga and its sub tributaries in Uttarakhand.Swami Shivanand Saraswati, a spiritual ideologue of the Matri Sadan ashram, on Sunday re-asserted the commitment of the ashram for the cause of holy Ganga and the ecology.Citing the 2013 Kedarnath flash flood and the recent Rishiganga and Dhauliganga area glacier breach, Swami Shivanand linked the two disasters due to haphazard, unplanned construction of hydropower projects in the eco-sensitive Himalayan belt."Without scientific, environmental evaluation and impact assessment, dozens of hydropower projects have been built in the upper reaches of Garhwal on the Ganga and its adjacent tributaries. After 8 years, nature has again shown the ill effects of these hydro projects as well as rampant construction activities in the eco-sensitive zone," said Swami Shivanand SaraswatiHe further added that either he or any other seer will stage the silent mode of agitation from February 23 to draw attention to the negative bearing of these project activities on the environment.Also read: Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada killed in Pakistan ‘months ago’ - ReportsFrom February 23, a seer, who will be decided by next week, from the ashram will start an indefinite agitation on four demands.The demands include the closure of all hydropower projects on Ganga, prohibition on stone crusher units within 5-kilometre periphery of Ganga river bed, total prohibition on quarrying from Raiwala till Bhogpur and formation of Ganga council to look into issues related to the sacred river.Brahmachari Dayanand, a disciple of Matri Sadan, said that every seer associated with Matri Sadan is ready to opt for the agitation and give his life too for the cause of sacred Ganga.This is not the first time when seers associated with Matri Sadan have started agitations for the cause of Ganga. In January last year, Uttarakhand police forcibly lifted 24-year-old Ganga activist Sadhvi Padmavati from Matri Sadan ashram premises in Haridwar where she had been on a fast unto death for 48 days.In 2019, 22-year-old Brahamchari Atmabodhanand, hailing from Kerala, and a computer science graduate had undertaken a 194-days-long fast unto death for the same cause.In 2018, Gyan Swarup Sanand, a former Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) professor, whose original name was Professor GD Agarwal, died in AIIMS Rishikesh on the 112th day of his hunger strike on October 11, 2018. After his demise, Sant Gopal Das had announced to carry forward the agitation.However, within 10 hours of his announcement, a team of the district administration, along with doctors, reached Matri Sadan ashram and lifted the seer during the night on a stretcher and took him to AIIMS Rishikesh in an ambulance. Earlier on June 13, 2011, after 114 days of an indefinite fast unto death at Matri Sadan ashram on same demands, young Swami Nigmanand had died in suspicious circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/matri-sadan-to-resume-agitation-for-closure-of-hydropower-projects-on-ganga-101613324523369.html

Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column ‘RokhThok’, said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would not have reached this level in the country had it not been for its various agitations, including the Ram temple movement, the removal of Article 370 and agitation against inflation.Sena also accused PM Modi of ridiculing protesters including the farmers agitating against the three farm laws.“Prime Minister Modi has made fun of the country's agitations. The BJP continued its agitation from the emergency to the Ayodhya movement, from inflation to the removal of Article 370. Had the Ram movement not happened, the BJP would not have been seen today. When PM Modi of that BJP ridicules protesters as 'andolanjeevi', the freedom movement is also insulted,” Raut wrote in the column published in party's editorial mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday.Also read: Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada killed in Pakistan ‘months ago’ - Reports﻿He added that the country has a history of agitations and Mahatma Gandhi and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar were the biggest 'andolanjeevi'. “Several statues are instants in the Parliament complex and all of them have a history of agitation. All the statues are now saying, ‘You are sitting on the throne because of our agitation.’“The Prime Minister has ridiculed the activists who took to the road by mentioning the word 'andolanjeevi'. Not only farmers who have been protesting against the agricultural law for three months but those who protested for the country's independence were also ridiculed with his remark,” it said.The Shiv Sena parliamentarian also took a jibe at BJP saying that Jana Sangh leaders including its founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee have had held protests. Mukherjee led an agitation against the revocation of Article 370 and now his sacrifice is being called 'andolanjeevi'.“What should the agitations by the BJP be called? The party held many agitations. Then they were done for political interests and to gain power, that is to say. The abrogation of Article 370 was the biggest movement of the BJP. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee did protest to revoke Article 370. Mukherjee's sacrifice is now called 'andolanjeevi'. When revolutionaries come to power, they take the sacrifice of ideals of revolutionaries first. This is happening in our country,” Raut wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm-modi-s-andolanjeevi-remark-is-insult-to-freedom-movement-shiv-sena-101613322622288.html

They have threatened to resign if the central party leadership fails to intervene in the crisis within the state unit by February end.In a letter addressed to BJP national president JP Nadda on February 12, the nine party functionaries alleged state president Temjen Imna Along of carrying out "arbitrary and duplicitous" functioning with 'his henchmen'".They accused Along, who is also the state minister of higher education and tribal affairs, of resorting to undemocratic practices at all levels of the party organisation "to cover up his mismanagements and failings" which they said is bogging down the functioning of the BJP at the organisational level and damaging its image.The leaders also appealed to implement the party's ‘One Man, One Post’ principle in Nagaland as the incumbent state president is a legislator and minister with many important portfolios to look after and "cannot provide time to our party Karyakartas from all levels".Reminding Nadda that they had petitioned the central leadership on the same issue several times in 2020 as well, the dissidents further expressed apprehension of having to face the next Nagaland assembly elections in 2023 under the present leadership as they felt BJP’s historical tally of 12 MLAs in the current assembly would be reduced to a single digit.Asserting that they were genuinely concerned about the party's image, the nine functionaries stated that in the event the central leadership failing to urgently intervene in the crisis by the end of February 2021, they would be compelled to put up their resignations even though they would continue to serve as loyal party Karyakartas (functionaries).While the party officials did not wish to comment on the issue, a close aide of the state president said the matter was an internal party issue. He said the central leadership was aware of the dissidence of the district leaders but had made it clear that the incumbent president would continue and complete his tenure in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dissidence-in-nagaland-bjp-9-district-chiefs-seek-removal-of-state-party-prez-101613316828837.html
14-02-2021||Pune||Consumer forum directs bank to pay ₹40,000 to retired army officer for delay in breaking open locker||Pune: The Pune district consumer redressal forum has directed the Union Bank of India to pay compensation of ₹40,000 to a retired army officer towards mental and physical agony caused for delay in breaking open the locker in his name. Brigadier Vijay Kumar Arora (retired), 71, lodged a consumer complaint under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, alleging deficiency in service from the bank. In the complaint lodged on December 21, 2017, the complainant sought relief of ₹60,000 towards denial of the locker facility at the rate of ₹15,000 per month for four months after discounting the demonisation period. He also sought relief of ₹3.45 lakh towards compensation of demonetised currency notes which could not be exchanged by the due end date of December 2016.Arora, along with his wife Rekha Arora (64), had jointly hired a locker in the bank since January 2011. Unfortunately, the locker key got misplaced by the couple. Arora wrote to the bank on November 4, informing about the loss of locker key and requested for breaking open the locker. The bank admitted that the said referred letter was duly received by them on the same date. Despite numerous visits, the locker was finally broken only on March 22, 2017. The bank took about 10- 12 days for getting the locker opened as informed by the bank when the letter was given as they had to coordinate with Godrej company (suppliers of locker) for breaking open the locker, the complaint stated.However, the bank took more than four months (137 days) from November 4, 2016 to March 22, 2017 for breaking open the locker. Even after allowing 26 days of November 2016 when the bank was busy with other urgent official works due to demonetisation, they still took 112 days from December 1, 2016 to March 22 to get the locker opened. Hence, the complainant’s wife could not take out any jewellery kept in the locker and had to suffer embarrassment at social gatherings as she had no ornaments to wear. They also could not exchange ₹3.45 lakh kept in the locker in demonetised currency notes, according to the complainant. The locker was broken open on March 22, 2017 and emptied of its contents, including demonetised currency notes, in the presence of Himani Jain, bank official and incharge of the locker room, and a Godrej technician. When the complainant approached the bank to compensate them for denying the locker facility for a long time, vide their email dated March 23, 2017, the bank blamed the complainant by stating that the latter never expressed the urgency for breaking open the locker and also that he did not respond to the several telephone calls made by the bank.The bank filed its response in written on April 1, 2018. The complainant denied the bank’s allegations. “The bank did not admit that it took more than four months for breaking open the locker as it was busy with demonetisation work from December 1, 2016 to March 22, 2017 and took 112 days to break open the locker. It also denied that they have denied locker facility for a long period and the bank issued an email on March 23, 2017 to that regard (denying facility of locker) is not true. It is not true that the complainant did not express the urgency for breaking open the locker in spite of several telephone calls made by the bank. It is pertinent to note that, after incident of loss of key, the complainant did not apply for new locker facility so that to prove how much the complainant is a diligent customer. On these main grounds, the bank prayed that the complaint may be dismissed with compensatory costs,” the complainant stated.After hearing the bank’s response, the forum directed the manager, Union Bank of India, BT Kawade road branch, to pay to the complainant ₹40,000 by way of compensation towards mental and physical agony and for being late in breaking open the bank locker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/consumer-forum-directs-bank-to-pay-rs-40-000-to-retired-army-officer-for-delay-in-breaking-open-locker-101613315864081.html

14-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to soon start facilitating registration of e-autos: Kailash Gahlot||The Delhi government will soon start facilitating registration of e-autos that can save up to ₹29,000 as compared to their CNG equivalents, Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said on Sunday.Under its 'Switch Delhi' campaign, the Delhi government will now focus on adoption of electric three-wheelers, including e-autos, e-rickshaws, and e-carts "The Delhi government has led the way in promoting e-rickshaws for the last few years by giving subsidy of ₹30,000. After the EV policy, the same subsidy has been extended to e-carts and e-autos. Scrapping incentives of up to ₹7,500 are also available on it," Gahlot said.Under Delhi's electric vehicle policy, 177 three-wheeler models are available and eligible for purchase and scrapping incentives.The Switch Delhi campaign is an eight-week electric vehicle mass awareness campaign to sensitise Delhiites about the benefits of switching to electric vehicles. The second week of the campaign focuses on the outreach for electric three-wheelers and aims to sensitise, inform, and encourage Delhiites to adopt electric three-wheelers in the national capital, said a Delhi government statement.Three-wheelers are one of the major contributors to vehicular emissions in Delhi and the policy lays special focus on incentivising the transition of this segment to electric. "Two and three-wheelers contribute to two-thirds of the pollution in Delhi. Three wheelers run on the road for 12-16 hours everyday. The focus of Delhi EV policy on this segment to enable their transition to electric will greatly benefit Delhi's air quality," Gahlot said on the occasion of launching the next leg of the Switch Delhi campaign. While e-rickshaws have a top speed not exceeding 25 kmph, e-autos are comparable to CNG autos and have top speed of around 50-60 kmph and can travel longer distances, he said."E-autos can complement e-rickshaws in providing zero pollution last mile connectivity in Delhi. The Delhi government will soon bring out a scheme to facilitate easy registration of e-autos in Delhi," said Gahlot.Road tax and registration fees will also be waived for all electric three-wheelers, he said."Subsidies provided by the Delhi government under the EV policy, on electric autos reduce their total cost by up to 26 per cent. By switching to electric auto, an individual can save about ₹29,000 annually," the minister said.The subsidy provided on e-rickshaw under the EV policy reduces the total cost of ownership by up to 33 per cent, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-soon-start-facilitating-registration-of-e-autos-kailash-gahlot-101613309664871.html

The Jat farmers in 18 districts have left them (the BJP). So, now they have turned towards the eastern part of the state, and are focusing on this area, which has a sizable Rajbhar voters. Their sole aim is to garner votes," he told PTI in an interview.Hitting out at the BJP, the former ally of the saffron party said, "They name Mughalsarai station after Deen Dayal Upadhyay, write Sardar Vallabhai Patel at the statue of Sardar Patel and also write Prithviraj Chauhan, we have no problems with that. Why do they have a problem in writing the name of Rajbhar after Suheldev."The BJP should start liking the name Rajbhar while writing the name of Maharaja Suheldev, who is said to have killed the Ghaznavid general Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud in the early 11th century.The former Uttar Pradesh minister also claimed that owing to the intense hardwork of SBSP workers over the past few decades, almost all the political parties in the country, the Centre and state governments are celebrating the birth anniversary of Suheldev Rajbhar.At present, the SBSP has four MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly.On February 11, the Uttar Pradesh government released the reservation policy for the upcoming three-tier panchayat polls in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sbsp-chief-claims-jat-farmers-have-left-bjp-in-18-districts-of-up-101613303389437.html
14-02-2021||Other||Fleecing of consumers by authorized automobile centres needs to stop||The comparison may sound a little incongruous, but I must say that authorized automobile service centres are like private hospitals. They make every effort to jack up your bill through unwarranted services and procedures.After utilizing the first few free services offered by the manufacturer, you get ready for the paid service and hand over your car to the company’s authorized service station. The manufacturer’s manual tells you the maintenance requirements and their website gives you a rough estimate of how much it costs. However, when you get the bill, you realize that it is two to three times the costing given by the manufacturer. When you protest, you are told that the company’s website from which you picked up the estimate is outdated!A consumer recently complained about how he had specifically told the service centre that they should not go beyond what is prescribed by the manufacturer in the service manual. Yet, when he got the bill, there was an additional amount of ₹2000 for engine decarbonizing. He says he protested not only because it was not required –the car had done only 20,000 kms- but also because it had not been authorized by him, but eventually paid up. In fact there are many complaints about service centres undertaking (or claiming) engine decarbonization - a process to remove carbon deposits on the cylinder head, piston and other working components of the engine- when it’s not even required. In one case, the car had barely run 3,500 kms, yet the bill included decarbonization! Since there cannot be carbon deposits on the engine after such short run, the service centre obviously just added that in the bill! Like private hospitals that suggest unnecessary tests just to put to good use the diagnostic equipment that they have invested in, authorized service centres add wheel balancing to the work required to be carried out and charge a steep price for it. Here again, there are complaints of extracting payment for wheel balancing, without actually undertaking the work.Another trick is to call the customer after she or he has left the car for servicing and say that the vehicle requires additional work not provided in the earlier estimate. Since most car owners are not automobile engineers and want their car to run without any trouble, they agree. Ironically, Covid is also being used by some service providers to their advantage- they blame the steep bill on the additional services required to get the car into order after a long spell of inactivity or low use!.This kind of fleecing of consumers by authorized centres has to stop and that can only happen if automobile manufacturers exercise stringent control over them and not have a mutualistic relationship. This requires regular auditing of the work of authorized centres and it should include consumer feedback and also regular consumer surveys. Those who indulge in unfair practices should lose their authorization. Manufacturers in fact need to remember that they can also be held liable for the unfair trade practices of their authorized centres.The service centers on their part, should respect the consumer’s right to information, informed choice and maintain complete transparency in respect of their work and billing. In this age of digital communication, it does not take much effort to Whatsapp a picture of the part being changed or a service being undertaken, to the customer. Returning the replaced parts is also a must.. So also an independent customer complaint redress system.I am not aware of consumers going to consumer court on some of these issues, but it’s time they did. In this context, I must refer to an interesting case quoted in the Australian consumer magazine-Choice, about a service centre found guilty of making false representation to the consumer and fined $ 5000. The service centre had told the customer, who had taken his car for servicing, that it required new break pads and discs at a cost of $798. A subsequent independent inspection of the vehicle found both unnecessary!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fleecing-of-consumers-by-authorized-automobile-centres-needs-to-stop-101613303262855.html
14-02-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Are flyovers in Pune a problem or solution to traffic woes?||Pune: In one of its documents published on Smart City project around five years ago, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had stated that the city “aspires to become global urban centre”. The document also had a footnote that mentioned citizens of Pune enjoy “safe” and “liveable” environment with good connectivity. The situation on ground suggests that the city is witnessing an alarming rise in traffic jams, resulting in deterioration in air quality and increasing noise pollution. The reality, citizens say, is grim. To deal with the “grim” situation, politicians have a pet answer. That is to build flyovers. Pune along with Pimpri-Chinchwad currently has over 50 flyovers with another 10 either under construction or proposed. The latest addition to this list is a flyover at Katraj junction and its construction will begin within a month. PMC had earlier proposed to build a flyover at Katraj junction to resolve the traffic woes at the spot, where two highways intersect and the stretch is also an entry point for the city. As the civic body could not take up the work due to fund shortage, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to finance it. Once complete, the flyover will supplement the six-lane Katraj-Navale bridge stretch, work for which is underway. But that was not the only flyover announcement by Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari during his visit to the city on Saturday (February 13) when he also reviewed another flyover in the making at Pune’s western front of Chandani chowk. During the visit, the minister also proposed a 45-kilometre triple decker 16-lane road on the Pune-Ahmednagar highway. Most of the flyovers operational in the city have often been a source of relief from traffic woes. However, the benefit is temporary for vehicle users and people residing in suburbs. If bottlenecks at intersections have often led to traffic jams, flyovers constructed to decongest the city have merely shifted congestion from one point to another. So, those coming from areas as far as Wagholi or Kharadi on eastern parts to Ambegaon and Warje on the south and west may look at flyovers an easy way to enter into the central parts of the city. For those living in central areas, these structures have become an eyesore as it has resulted in streets of older parts getting further crowded, a common grumble of citizens. So, it is interesting when Deccan residents oppose PMC’s proposal of internal lane widening project tooth and nail. They have cited the heavy crowd on main streets adjoining these bylanes. The traffic scenario that the city is witnessing is no exception to what other places are going through. In Pune, the civic body and other bodies are merely following the global path where planning and development authorities have only fetishised the flyover as panacea for traffic mess. As putative symbols of modernity or technological advancement, these flyovers have often helped lawmakers get votes. These structures have often pushed addition of new private vehicles in urban spaces that are already congested by growing population. So, the newly made flyover attracts more traffic, which in turn forces authorities to look for more flyovers as solution. Such goes the vicious cycle. With over 500 square kilometre area (post merger of 23 villages) and population above 50 lakh, Pune’s civic limits will see more vehicular traffic, and road congestions. In Pune, there is another problem too – flyovers with faulty design. Be it the now demolished University junction flyover or one at Wakad, they have only added chaos. To build a flyover and demolish it within 14 years was not a “smart thing” that the city is aspiring to be. To be really “‘smart”, Pune needs a robust public transport with flyovers as a complementary mean instead of the other way round. Globally, flyovers are being demolished to make way for spaces. Locally, we may need flyovers, but not at the cost of creating a situation where they have become problem than solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-are-flyovers-in-pune-a-problem-or-solution-to-traffic-woes-101613303142935.html
14-02-2021||Other||No magic: Late night advertisements offering supernatural cure are illegal, must be curbed||If you surf television channels a little late in the night, you will come across advertisements that shock you for their brazen violation of the laws of the land, for the crude vulgarity of the messages, and most of all, for the blatant lies that they convey. And yes, despite laws against them, these advertisements continue to proliferate and exploit the vulnerable.The Advertising Code formulated under the Cable Television Network Rules says that “ No advertisement shall contain references which are likely to lead the public to infer that the product advertised or any of its ingredients has some special or miraculous or supernatural property or quality, which is difficult of being proved”. Yet, you will see innumerable advertisements of so-called ayurvedic formulations promising miracles!The Code also says that “Advertising carried in the cable service shall be so designed as to conform to the laws of the country and should not offend morality, decency and religious susceptibilities of the subscribers”. Yet there are advertisements that exploit religious beliefs or sentiments to peddle lies! The recent Bombay High Court order prohibiting the advertisements of ‘Hanuman Chalisa Yantra’ and similar products befooling consumers with promises of magical powers is a case in point. The Order, which came in response to a complaint filed in 2015 against such advertisements telecast on four channels, said not only the advertisers and sellers of the product, but also TV channels that telecast them were liable under the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013. The Yantra, in the form of a pendant and costing ₹4,900, was touted to have extraordinary powers – it guaranteed huge profits to businessmen suffering losses, jobs to the unemployed, marriage to those looking for a life partner, good health to those suffering from diseases! What was even more shocking was the endorsement of such falsehood by celebrities!The high court order of January 5 in fact draws attention to the poor implementation of laws meant to prevent such advertisements. In this case, the detailed reference to the provisions of the Black Magic Act in the high court’s order, also shows that besides the central laws, some of the states have equipped themselves with additional laws, yet have failed to effectively tackle the menace.In fact most of the advertisements promising miracles or magical cures violate the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act. The law prohibits not only misleading advertisements pertaining to drugs, but also advertisements of drugs and magical cures for a number of diseases and disorders specified in the law. Contravention is punishable with six months imprisonment and fine However states have a poor record of enforcing this law.Now the government has armed the Central Consumer Protection Authority, constituted under the new Consumer Protection Act, 2019, with powers to regulate false and misleading advertisements. In addition to imposition of hefty fines on endorsers and advertisers, the law also seeks to punish manufacturers or service providers guilty of issuing false or misleading advertisements with imprisonment extending to two years for the first offence. However, for all these laws to be effective, what is most crucial is the monitoring of the media to detect violations of the laws pertaining to advertisements. And this is where the efforts are lacking, particularly by the state governments, which are required to set up monitoring committees at the state and the district levels to prevent infringement of the Programme and Advertising Codes under the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act and Rules. The Information and Broadcasting ministry, in a communication sent to all the states in 2017, had lamented that monitoring committees had only been set up in 19 states, five union territories and 327 districts, and even where they were set up, not every one of them was active.Better monitoring, better coordination between the centre and the states and quick action against advertisements and advertisers contravening the law are the need of the hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-magic-late-night-advertisements-offering-supernatural-cure-are-illegal-must-be-curbed-101613302842866.html

If citizens want good quality roads, they will have to pay for it.”When asked why NHAI is funding the Pune-Satara road project instead of Reliance, Gadkari said, “The project got delayed due to a controversy between bank and contractor. As the bank was not giving toll collection money to the contractor, they were not able to carry out the work. Termination and all legal process would take a long time. To avoid all this, I instructed the NHAI to fund the project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/toll-collection-will-continue-on-pune-satara-road-gadkari-101613300266082.html
14-02-2021||Pune||Intensive cyclones due to warmer sea temperature: IITM study||Pune:Warmer sea surface temperatures (SST) and subsurface temperatures are responsible for the rapid intensification of cyclones that India has witnessed in the recent past, revealed research done by scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). Recently, we have seen that in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, the temperature of the ocean has been warmer, said scientists. The paper was recently published in Scientific Reports, published by Nature. Scientists Vineet Kumar Singh, MK Roxy and Medha Deshpande were part of the study. The paper stated that the north Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, accounts for about 6% of the global tropical cyclones. Speaking about the study, Vineet Kumar Singh, scientist at IITM who also worked on the paper, said that ocean surface temperatures have been warmer than normal. “The sea temperature has been around 30 degrees Celsius which is warmer than normal. This warm water further fuels the intensification of cyclones. Cyclone Fani which hit the coast of Orissa and intensified in the Bay of Bengal had a lifespan of eight days. On an average, cyclones have a lifespan of four days. This increased time span is due to the warmer SST. We have seen recently that the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, both are experiencing record warm sea surface temperature. High SST provides more energy to cyclones,” said Singh. In recent years, India has seen super cyclones like Maha, Amphan and Nisarga. Scientists are now attributing the intensity of these cyclones to the warmer SST. Even on the coast of Maharashtra, cyclone Nisarga was seen to intensify in just 24 hours. “In the future as well, we are likely to witness more such cyclones as the SST and sub-surface temperatures are warmer. Though, the number of cyclones that India experiences every year may not increase, but their intensity will certainly see an increase. This can be harmful for life and property along the coast,” said Singh. The cyclone frequency in this region varies between one and three in the pre-monsoon (March–May), to two to five cyclones in the post-monsoon (October–December) season. Studies show that there is an increase in the intensity of pre-monsoon cyclones in the Bay of Bengal during recent decades. He further added that multiple studies across the world have reflected that high SST fuels the cyclones. Singh further said that Arabian Sea, earlier, had less conducive conditions for cyclones. “But, in the last 10 years, there are more cyclones in the Arabian Sea. Due to the rotation axis of the Earth, the cyclones tend to take a path towards the Yemen and Oman coast. Nonetheless, their intensity and frequency has increased. Nisarga is one such example which hit the coast of Maharashtra and Gujarat in 2020,” Singh added. What the study claims *Cyclone Fani is the strongest pre-monsoon cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal after 1994. *This is the second fastest rapid intensification in 24 hours among all the pre-monsoon cyclones in the Bay of Bengal during the period 1990–2019. *Cyclone Fani is the strongest pre-monsoon (March–May) Bay of Bengal cyclone after 1994. *The average SST prior to the genesis of cyclone Fani was 30.4 °C. This is the highest SST observed at the genesis centre prior to genesis of any cyclone in April in the Bay of Bengal during the period 1990–2019. Source: Scientific Reports, Nature Warm January The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which is based in the USA noted that the January global land and ocean surface temperature were 0.80 of a degree Celsius warmer than normal. This makes January the seventh warmest January in the 142-year climate record for earth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/intensive-cyclones-due-to-warmer-sea-temperature-iitm-study-101613300262869.html

The number of working PACS last year in February was 4,598, which has now risen to 6,179.The clarification came after chief minister Nitish Kumar said on Friday that farmers only needed to register on the agriculture department’s portal to sell their paddy produce through PACS.“I had said this earlier also, but despite this if farmers were registering at two places, action would be taken against the erring officials,” he had said.There was no distress sale of paddy by farmers in Bihar this kharif season owing to several corrective measures, claimed a senior government official. “The target of paddy procurement has been increased from 30 to 45 lakh metric tonnes,” said Bandana Preyashi, secretary (cooperative department) on Saturday.Compared to last year, there has been a 132.22% increase in registrations by farmers for procurement of paddy, she said. “This is the result of direct contact we established with them through various means, including kisan salahkar (farmers’ advisers).

14-02-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand law to levy water tax on hydropower projects in state held valid||Uttarakhand high court has upheld the constitutional validity of 2012 legislation enacted by Uttarakhand government to levy water tax on hydro power projects of more than 5 MW capacity in the state on water drawn for power generation at the rates decided by the state government, as per the order. The court dismissed a bunch of writ petitions filed by hydro power project companies challenging the law.The HC ruled, “There is no prohibition in the Constitution that the State legislature cannot enact any law for the imposition of tax on water for non-consumptive use in the State of Uttarakhand, therefore, in absence of any provision in this regard, no fault can be attached to the act in question”.The court order stated that a bare reading of the 2012 act reveals the nature of impugned tax is not on “generation of electricity” but on the “use of water”’ or say “water drawn for the generation of electricity”.The HC noted that since Uttarakhand is mainly a hilly, cash-starved state with limited revenue resources, therefore, a uniform tax has been introduced on all who use the water of the state rivers- Bhagirathi and Alaknanda-- in order to give sustenance to its economy. It stated that the act on water tax does not infringe upon the fundamental right of the petitioners in any way.The court also vacated an interim order issued by a coordinate bench of Uttarakhand HC in 2016 directing authorities concerned not to take coercive measures for recovery of the water tax demand from the petitioners.The 87-page order, delivered by the single bench of justice Lok Pal Singh on Friday was made available on Saturday. HT has a copy of the order.The petitions, challenging the constitutional validity of the Uttarakhand Water Tax on Electricity Generation Act, 2012 and the notices issued to them for realisation of due water tax, were filed by companies including Alaknanda Hydro Power Co. Ltd (2020), THDC India Ltd (2016), National Hydro Power Corporation (2016), Swasti Power Pvt. Ltd (2016), Bhilangana Hydro Power Ltd (2016), Jaiprakash Power Ventures Ltd (2017).Petitioners had alleged that their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution were violated by the state under the 2012 act. They also claimed that authorities neither installed any flow measuring device within the dam premises nor they adopted any alternative method to measure the quantity of water used.Also Read: 2 bodies found in Tapovan tunnel, 164 missing amid good news on glacial lakeThe petitioners also claimed that the tax on the generation of electricity falls under List I (Union List) and, therefore, the state legislature was incompetent to levy tax under the act. They also argued that Entry 17 of List II (State List) does not authorise or empower a state to levy any such tax on the use of water.While dismissing the petitions, the court order also stated it has been informed that the nodal officer of the Uttarakhand government had made a provisional assessment of water drawn by petitioner companies and the tax due from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-law-to-levy-water-tax-on-hydropower-projects-in-state-held-valid-101613279792379.html

14-02-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena says PM's 'andolanjeevi' jibe also insults freedom movement||Shiv Sena on Sunday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ridiculing protesters including farmers agitating against the three farm laws and those who fought for India's independence after he used word 'andolanjeevi' (one who thrives on protests).The editorial of Shiv Sena's mouthpiece Saamana pointed out that the BJP would not have witnessed such a meteoric rise if it had not held protests on several issues, including the Ram temple movement and inflation."Prime Minister Modi has made fun of the country's agitations. The BJP continued its agitation from the emergency to the Ayodhya movement, from inflation to the removal of Article-370 from Kashmir. Had the Ram movement not happened, the BJP would not have been seen today. When PM Modi of that BJP ridicules protesters as 'andolanjeevi', the freedom movement is also insulted," it said."Stop protests in the country. Protest means conspiracy of foreign powers. Some people are only living on the movements. The Prime Minister has ridiculed the activists who took to the road by mentioning the word 'andolanjeevi'. Not only farmers who have been protesting against the agricultural law for three months, those who protested for the country's independence were also ridiculed with his remark," it said.The Shiv Sena also took a jibe at BJP saying that Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee protested against the revocation of Article 370 and now his sacrifice is being called 'andolanjeevi'."What should the agitations by BJP be called? BJP held many agitations. Then they were done for political interests and to gain power, that is to say. The abrogation of Article 370 from Kashmir was the biggest movement of BJP's life. Syama Prasad Mukherjee did protest to revoke Article 370. Mukherjee's sacrifice is now called 'andolanjeevi'. When revolutionaries come to power, they take the sacrifice of ideals of revolutionaries first. This is happening in our country," read the editorial.PM Modi first mentioned 'andolanjeevi' word while replying to the motion of thanks on President's address in Rajya Sabha on February 8.He had said a new community has come up in the country - 'andolanjeevi' -- who can be spotted in every protest and are parasite for the nation."We are well aware of some terms like 'Shram Jivi' and 'Buddhi Jivi'. But, I am seeing that from some time a new entity has come up in this country- 'Andolan Jivi'. This community can be spotted wherever there is a protest, be it agitation by lawyers, students, or labourers, sometimes at the forefront and sometimes from behind. They cannot live without protests. We have to identify such people and protect the nation from them. They are parasites," the Prime Minister had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-says-pm-s-andolanjeevi-jibe-also-insults-freedom-movement-101613275921125.html

Jagdanand Singh, party leaders said, did not participate in the campaign, inviting Tej Pratap’s ire. Lalu Prasad has been suffering from multiple ailments and was airlifted to Delhi for treatment on January 23.Tej Pratap Yadav went on to allege that ever Singh took charge, the party has weakened. “He does not meet MLAs. Party workers and leaders are angry with him.

Only one is left," the Pradhan of the gram panchayat, Ashok Chikboraik, said.The local MLA has taken up the matter and it was reported to the chairman of the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri Development Authority, he said."We are trying our best to get the work done," Chikboraik said. The Block Development Officer (BDO) of Mal block, Biman Chandra Das, said that no written application was sent to his office regarding the problem.The BDO said that people should not mix up their demand with their democratic right."We will go and try to convince the people there," Das said.Assembly election is due in the state in April-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-tea-garden-workers-want-connecting-road-say-won-t-vote-if-demand-not-met-101613262837567.html

14-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab civic polls: Video of spat between ex-Akali MLA and SHO goes viral||A day before the civic body polls in Punjab, two clips purportedly showing a spat between former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA and Bhikhiwind station house officer started doing the rounds of social media. The incident reportedly took place at SAD candidate Manjit Singh’s residence in Bhikhiwind on Friday, the last day of campaigning.In the video, Bhikhiwind SHO Sarabjit Singh and a few cops are seen standing on the ground floor while the former MLA Virsa Singh Valtoha, who is also the party’s district president, is on the first floor. Valtoha is heard accusing the cops of threatening the party’s candidates at the behest of the ruling party. Reacting to him, the SHO is heard saying that the party’s leaders were violating the model code of conduct. The SHO is seen telling Valtoha that people from outside were gathering in the area and that some weapon-wielding people had fled after seeing the police team. To this, Valtoha tells him that the SHO himself is responsible for “allowing goons to resort to firing” on Akali workers. He also asked the SHO to “cast down his eyes” when the latter asked the former to “come down”.Bhikhiwind is a hyper-sensitive polling station where SAD and Congress workers had resorted to firing on the second last day of filing of nominations.Talking to HT, Valtoha said, “On February 2, the returning officer had given our candidates time to file the nominations, but the Congress workers in collusion with the police, headed by the SHO, had laid several obstructions. Our candidates were attacked with sticks, sharp-edged weapons and firearms. Even after this, the SHO had registered a case of attempt to murder against SAD candidates only.”He added, “After getting interim bail, our candidates started campaigning from February 10, and since then the SHO had been threatening our candidates by sending police teams to their houses.”He said on Friday at around 2 pm, he had given time to the local media for a press conference. “I was addressing a press conference when I heard some commotion outside. When I went outside, the SHO was threatening our workers,” he said.The SHO, on the other hand, said, “I had gone there to stop the gathering of outsiders. There were some people who were possessing firearms. They fled from the spot after seeing the police team.”Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Bhullar had earlier stated that February 2 incident was a result of instigation by SAD workers. On Friday, tehsildar of Bhikhiwind, Lakhwinder Singh, former returning officer, was suspended by the state election commission for remaining absent from the election duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-civic-polls-video-of-spat-between-ex-akali-mla-and-sho-goes-viral-101613245593862.html
14-02-2021||Other||Amid aircraft row, Maharashtra Governor makes unexpected visit to Delhi||Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is locked in a bitter tussle with the state government, made an unscheduled visit to New Delhi on Saturday instead of returning to Mumbai from Dehradun. Koshyari was to travel back to Mumbai on Saturday after attending the 122nd induction training programme of IAS officers at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy of Administration at Mussoorie, held on Thursday. He, however, changed his plan and reached the national Capital on a commercial flight from Uttarakhand. Koshyari’s secretariat did not reveal about his scheduled visits. He will now return on Sunday evening. According to central government officials, Koshyari may meet authorities in Delhi amid the controversy over the denial of the state aircraft by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray for the Governor’s Dehradun visit on Thursday. “There is no official meeting scheduled, but there could be meeting on Sunday in relation to this entire episode,” an official said. The governor is also expected to report the entire episode to the Union home ministry. In an embarrassing instance, Koshyari had to deplane after he was told that the CM’s office had not approved a request sent by the governor’s secretariat for the government-owned aircraft to travel to Dehradun. Koshyari took a commercial flight after the incident. This led to a row once again between the governor and the Uddhav Thackeray-led government.The state government’s attempt to turn the table on Raj Bhavan by issuing a statement on action against the secretariat officials, seeking a report from them and the Saamana’s editorial terming the tour as “private” is believed to have been taken seriously by the Raj Bhavan. The state has not sought any formal report from the Raj Bhavan yet. “We have not asked for any report formally so far. If honourable CM instructs us to do so, we will write for such report,” said Sanjay Kumar, chief secretary, Maharashtra. Meanwhile, there was no statement from the Raj Bhavan over the reports on Thursday’s incident.An official from the Mantralaya said, “It’s a matter of interpretation whether the tour was official or not, as he was invited at IAS academy as the Maharashtra governor. It cannot be termed as his personal visit just because the academy is in Dehradun [Koshyari hails from Uttarakhand]. Also, the aircraft was procured to fly VVIPs — with Governor being on the top in the list — after permission from CM. As the head of the state, the governor does not need the permission, but only needs to intimate the government. He boarded the flight assuming that the permission will come last minute, as usual.”The official said all other technical permissions for the flying were in place. The official said Koshyari had asked for the state government’s aircraft for the first time to go to Dehradun. The Saamana editorial stated, “The governor was informed a day before his scheduled departure that he cannot be given permission to use the aircraft as it was a personal trip. Despite it, he went to the airport out because of his stubbornness. He should maintain the honour and dignity of the post he is holding. He is being used as a puppet and that’s an insult to the nation.” It added that the governor has not appointed the 12 members recommended by the state government to the legislative Council from his quota because he “follows the orders from Delhi”. “The appointment has been stalled at the behest of the BJP,” the editorial had stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-aircraft-row-maharashtra-governor-makes-unexpected-visit-to-delhi-101613245115679.html
14-02-2021||Chandigarh||Martyr Sukhdev’s Ludhiana house in a shambles despite govt promises||Ludhiana Three years after Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh announced ₹1 crore grant for beautification of ancestral house of martyr Sukhdev Thapar at Naughara Mohalla in Chaura Bazaar area of the city, the historic land mark continues to be a dilapidated state. The government has also committed to provide a direct approach to the house, but has failed to deliver. Sukhdev Thapar, referred to mostly as Sukhdev, was executed along with Bhagat Singh and Rajguru on March 23, 1931, by the British colonial government. Now, walls of the house have also been damaged due to leaking water pipes and the house is in urgent need of repair/renovation. Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Memorial Trust president Ashok Thapar said in 2013, the Centre had announced a grant of ₹81 lakh for the maintenance of the house and providing a direct approach after their trust moved the Punjab and Haryana high court. “Even after this, only ₹12 lakh was spent and the rest of the fund lapsed. We have been running from pillar to post seeking a direct approach to the house from the Chaura Bazaar area since 2012, so that more people visit this historical landmark of the city. As of today, people have to negotiate narrow lanes to reach the house. Authorities have to acquire only a small piece of land for this purpose, but the process has been delayed for long.” “Authorities have failed to maintain a landmark to preserve the memory of a martyr. The damaged walls do not give a good impression. The building will lose its strength with passage of time. Now, authorities have told us that the process has been initiated and the project will be started. Hope something concrete emerges this time,” said Thapar.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We have received the file of the case from the deputy commissioner’s (DC) office around a week ago. The MC has to take permission from the local bodies department before starting the land acquisition process. A land acquisition officer has to be deputed by the state government. The building branch officials have been directed to ensure that there is no delay in the process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/martyr-sukhdev-s-ludhiana-house-in-a-shambles-despite-govt-promises-101613245113853.html
14-02-2021||Chandigarh||117 Punjab civic bodies go to the polls today||The polling for 117 urban local bodies, including eight high-stake municipal corporations, will be held in Punjab on Sunday with 9,222 candidates in the fray. Tight security arrangements are place as nearly 18,000 police personnel have been deployed to conduct free and fair elections, senior officials said. The voting will take place from 8am to 4pm through electronic voting machines (EVMs). Keeping in view the incidents of violence during the election campaigning in various civic bodies, the state election commission has instructed the police to keep an extra vigil at sensitive polling stations. Special security cover, though temporary, has been provided to the BJP leaders and candidates in some sensitive areas as the party is facing anger of the farmer unions in the wake of protests. Of the 2,569 polling stations declared and sensitive (1,708) and hyper-sensitive (861), most are in the Majha and Malwa regions. In the municipal corporations and A and B-grade councils, 2,037 candidates of the Congress, 1,606 of the principal opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), 1,569 of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), and 1,003 nominees of the BJP are in the fray. Elections at the C-level councils are being held without party symbols. Even as the electioneering ended on Friday evening, the parties were seen making last-ditch attempts to woo the voters even on Saturday with the candidates and their supporters trying to reach out to residents through door-to-door canvassing. The state election commission’s official spokesperson said 30 IAS/PCS officers have been deputed as poll observers. Also, the commission has deputed IG/DIG-rank officers, including Mukhwinder Singh Chinna for SAS Nagar, Rupnagar and Fatehgarh Sahib districts; Surjit Singh for Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts; Baljit Singh Rathore for Bathinda, Mansa and Faridkot districts; Surinder Kumar Kalia for Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala and SBS Nagar districts, as police observers. Harbaz Singh is observer for Ferozepur, Muktsar, Moga and Fazilka while Gurinder Singh Dhillon is deputed as one for Patiala, Ludhiana, Barnala and Sangrur districts, said the official spokesperson. “More than 20,500 employees are on election duty. Only those who enter the polling station before 4pm can cast their vote. February 14 and 17 have been declared as dry days. The counting of votes will start at 9 am on February 17,” he added.

14-02-2021||Other||Mumbai civic body plans to utilise footpaths for food hubs||In a bid to create food hubs by setting up food trucks and stalls across the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is considering to open up locations such as Marine Drive, Chowpatty, Worli sea face and Madh Island. The BMC plans to utilise the footpaths at these locations as food hubs between 6pm and 11 pm every day. BMC said the traffic movement on smaller streets will be diverted on alternate streets during the operational hours of these food trucks and stalls, if required. However, experts claimed that in a city like Mumbai, BMC should ensure that footpaths are not encroached further for such projects. BMC identified 65 locations to accommodate 3,331 vendors operating food trucks or stalls. The plan is an extension of BMC’s proposal to have food trucks across the city, for which it had prepared a draft policy last year. For the purpose, the BMC has reserved ₹200 crore for creating food hubs, beautification of footpaths and space below flyovers etc, in its 2021-22budget. State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray has also pushed for the idea and had announced that food trucks can boost the city’s tourism. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “We are not looking at congested streets but at Marine Drive, Mahim Beach, Manori Beach and Carter Road, where people gather to hangout. As per our policy, 10-12 trucks can sell different cuisines between 6pm and 11pm on the last lane near footpaths, only where the streets are big such as at Marine Drive. We will issue detailed standard operating procedures for this. Also, no traffic movement will be hindered as these food stalls will not be on the streets but on footpaths. This is just to provide people an option to eat and come quickly, and I do not think there should be any problem.” Alternatively, several wards in the city are looking at small streets which the BMC can afford to shut between 6pm and 11pm. During this period, traffic will be diverted to alternate routes. A ward officer from the western suburbs said, “Each ward is trying to have at least two locations, one on the east and the other on the west. We are also exploring spaces on smaller streets where traffic can be diverted daily for five hours, considering in suburbs it will be difficult to find streets where everything can coexist.” Interestingly, BMC has in the past spoken about following the ‘pedestrian first’ policy. In the past three financial budgets, BMC has been allocating Rs50 crore-Rs100 crore for the beautifications and improvisation of footpaths in the city. Experts said the plan is ideal but BMC should ensure that it does not come at the cost of the pedestrians’ walking space. Dr Rohit Shinkre, from the Rachna Sansad Academy of Architecture, said, “I say we should welcome it if it serves the purpose of the unorganised sector who are street food vendors or stall owners. Considering 68% of the city’s workforce is in the unorganised sector, we need to have urban planning for them%. But it should also not be at the cost of pedestrians. We all know that MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) is an expert in the engineering aspect of infrastructure, but such policies will need better regulation of public space use and better understanding of socioeconomic significance of the informal sector. I am not saying we should not try new things, but the execution should be such that everything is accommodated. “ Vivek Pai, an urban transport planner, said the pedestrians should be consulted first before coming up with such plans. “The plan is definitely good and we need such plans. But I feel BMC should involve all stakeholders including pedestrians, activists and corporators from all the wards before going ahead with the plan. Pedestrians should be the first involved because they will be the first one to be hit,” said Pai. Meanwhile, Mahendra Hemdev, a Marine Drive resident said, “It is a welcome move considering the fact that we hope that the food will be affordable and there is no littering around or nuisance in the form of traffic jams at Marine Drive. Today, Marine Drive is one of the cleanest locations because it is hawker-free, and we hope its status remains the same, if there are any food hubs planned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-plans-to-utilise-footpaths-for-food-hubs-101613244454512.html
14-02-2021||Chandigarh||Petrol crosses ₹85/litre mark in Chandigarh||A litre of petrol breached ₹85 mark for the first time while diesel went past ₹78 mark in Chandigarh on Saturday.Fuel prices have been on the rise in the city since the beginning of this year, with new records being set every passing day. The rise in prices of both fuels is nearly ₹5 since January 1, when petrol was available for ₹80.35 per litre and diesel for ₹73.58 per litre. Petrol now costs ₹85.11 and diesel is available for ₹78.45.A similar trend is being seen in the neighbouring cities of Mohali and Panchkula. Fuel in Mohali remains the costliest, with petrol at ₹90.38 per litre and diesel at ₹81.28 per litre. In Panchkula, prices stand at ₹86.27 and ₹79.13, respectively.The fuel hike is affecting the common man and has a cascading effect on prices of other commodities, said Arjan Singh, president of the Chandigarh Petroleum Dealers Association. “Earlier, two-wheeler riders used to usually buy petrol for at least ₹100 at a time, but now they are not spending more than ₹50, highlighting how much they are stretching their budget to meet the expenses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petrol-crosses-85-litre-mark-in-chandigarh-101613244334420.html
14-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity buzz: Tracker on all those making, or faking, news||Yamraj promotes road safety in Chandigarh To drive home the message of road safety, Chandigarh Traffic Police took the help of Yamraj, the lord of death. Artistes from Navyug Ramlila and Dusshera Committee, Sector 7, were roped in to generate awareness about traffic rules at busy intersections, including the ISBT at Sector 17, as part of the National Road Safety Month. Yamraj was seen asking people not to park on the zebra crossing at traffic signals besides urging two-wheeler riders to don the helmet and requesting cyclists to stay in their track for their own safety. Inspector Gurjit Kaur of the traffic police said the aim was to make city roads safe for all. 8 months and waiting for UT finance secretary It’s been eight months and the post of UT finance secretary has been vacant. Punjab-cadre IAS officer AK Sinha completed his three-year tenure in August last year and the UT administration forwarded a panel of three names to the Union home ministry in the same month. The Chandigarh administration could be in for a tricky situation if the Centre delays the appointment any further. At present, UT home secretary Arun Gupta has been given the additional charge of finance secretary, but his three-year term ends in May. Insiders say while routine and urgent matters of the UT finance department are being taken care of, important policy decisions are pending and await the new finance secretary. Sukhbir takes a dig at former mayor Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal took a jibe at Mohali’s former mayor Kulwant Singh, who was earlier with his party but is now contesting Sunday’s municipal corporation as head of the Azad Group. Addressing a rally at Sohana on Friday, Sukhbir said, “A mayor is nothing, he just supervises the cleaning work in a city. Whatever he (Kulwant) is today is because of the SAD.” Having parted ways with the SAD, Kulwant Singh floated the Azad Group on January 21 and fielded 50 candidates. Post-lockdown, thieves prefer cycles Bicycles have caught the fancy of thieves in Chandigarh. Police say on an average, they get at least one complaint of a cycle being stolen daily. The rise in the number of cycle thefts is being seen as a fallout of the growing trend of cycling ever since the Covid-19 induced lockdown was lifted. Advocating a cause at district courts With the decline in footfall in Covid-19 times, Chandigarh’s district courts have become a point to support a cause. It’s either a venue to collect funds for the Ram Temple at Ayodhya or a site to support the farmers’ protest against the Centre’s farm laws. One can see banners in support of the agitation and advocates taking time out to express solidarity with the farmers. A few metres away, another banner of the Ram Temple is put up with people collecting donation for the project. Take the shot to fight Covid-19 To encourage health and frontline workers to undergo vaccination against Covid-19, the Chandigarh health department has installed a selfie corner where one can strike a proud pose with a certificate after taking the shot. The message at the selfie corner says, “I have done my bit. Have you? Vaccination is the only way to fight Covid-19. Get your shot.” The health authorities are trying innovative ways to remove the hesitancy for the Covid-19 vaccine among priority groups.

14-02-2021||Chandigarh||Vijay Hazare Trophy: Coach confident of Chandigarh’s good show||For the head coach of the Chandigarh team, VRV Singh, the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy will bring in a new challenge.Chandigarh has been placed in the Elite group this time, with formidable teams like Bengal, Services, Jammu & Kashmir, Saurashtra and Haryana. Although the Chandigarh team has not had much time to prepare for the tournament as the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the Vijay Hazare Trophy schedule quite late, Singh is confident of his team doing well.Team remained unbeaten in T20VRV’s confidence can also be attributed to the fact that the Chandigarh team led by Manan Vohra remained unbeaten in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy in the Plate group. They could not finish as table-toppers as their game against Nagaland was abandoned due to wet conditions.“Chandigarh team did a fine job in the T20 tournament winning all games except one that was abandoned. We always aspired to be in the Elite group and show mettle. Fortunately, this time we have been placed alongside strong teams. It would be challenging to play against seasoned teams and test our skills. We would like to give our best and leave a mark,” said Singh, a former fast bowler who has played five test and two ODIs for India.The Vijay Hazare Trophy will take place from February 20 to March 14 and Chandigarh will play their matches in Kolkata.In the recently-held T20 trophy, Shivam Bhambri and Manan Vohra stood out in the batting department for Chandigarh, scoring 198 runs and 154 runs in four games each, respectively. In the bowling line-up, left-arm spinner Bipul Sharma and off-spinner Gaurav Gambhir did well. ‘Players will deliver again’“We have some good players waiting for a chance. Manan, Shivam and Ankit Kaushik did well recently and I am hoping they will deliver again along with Arslan Khan in batting. Bipul is an asset to the team and does the all-rounder’s job pretty well. Medium-pacers Shresth Nirmohi, Jagjit Singh and Mandeep along with left-arm spinner Gurinder Singh are talented too. They can have an impact and win matches for Chandigarh,” said Singh, who is taking a preparatory camp at the Sector-16 stadium.Singh, who quit cricket in 2019, became Chandigarh team’s head coach in their debut season. Enjoying his stint as a coach after a long career as a cricketer, Singh believes Chandigarh cricket is going to rise in the coming years as there is abundance of talent and the UT Cricket Association (UTCA) is making all efforts to provide them with the right platform.“Chandigarh teams made a great impact last season in all age groups. In the coming years, Chandigarh cricket is going to grab more attention. Despite limited resources, UTCA is working in the right direction and making sure players get the best facilities and tournaments. As far as senior men’s cricket is concerned, it’s the best time to show our mettle and garner attention. It will do a great deal for the confidence of the team. The players are hungry to do well,” shared the 36-year-old coach.The league phase of the competition will run from February 20 till March 1. After reaching Kolkata, Chandigarh team will undergo three Covid tests, on February 13, 15 and 17, with practice allowed on February 18 and 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vijay-hazare-trophy-coach-confident-of-chandigarh-s-good-show-101613244094667.html

Sahoonja said they had heart-shaped chocolates made specially for the occasion, and most of them have been sold. Many major bakeries in the city have also reported high demand.Rohit Kumar, proprietor of Ovenfresh, said, “The week before Valentine’s day, our sales start to pick up every year, especially for chocolates and other confectionary items. However, the Valentine’s Day tradition in the city has changed. Around a decade back, it was mostly celebrated by younger couples, but it has become a family affair now. With Valentine’s Day on a Sunday this time, we expect more families to show up than couples.”Flower sales dwindleHowever, florists say there has been a dip in sales. Rajesh Bhatia, proprietor of Mehak Florists in Sector 35, said, “Mostly youngsters studying in college and living in PGs gift flowers. But, many of them are at their native places this year. With “Flower Day” and Valentine’s Day both on a Sunday, the enthusiasm faded further, and sales are down by over 50%.”He added that flowers in the city are mostly procured from Ghazipur, where the supply has been cut off due to the farmers’ protest. Most florists are also facing a shortage of stock and suppliers are charging inflated prices, he said.Police to maintain vigilPolice have also made preparations to maintain decorum on the roads on Sunday. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP traffic central), Palak Goel said, “Traffic police personnel will be deployed with teams of local police along the “geri route” to take action against those violating traffic norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/valentines-day-sales-in-chandigarh-unaffected-despite-pandemic-101613243977105.html

14-02-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai civic chief urges all health workers to get vaccinated as turnout is poor||After the turnout of healthcare workers for vaccination goes down, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) commissioner has written to all the doctors asking to sensitise their staff to get vaccinated.The lowest turnout till date was on Thursday with 29 per cent followed by 35 per cent on Friday. As opposed to this, the turnout of the frontline workers in the city is overwhelming with more than 101 per cent turnout of frontline workers on Friday.On Saturday, the turnout of health care workers was 29 per cent while that of frontline workers was 92 per cent. Till date, a total of 58% health care workers and 92% frontline workers have got vaccinated.On January 16, when the phase I of vaccination started with the health care workers, the turnout was 78 per cent, which increased to 86 per cent a week later. On February 1, the turnout came down to 71 per cent, which further went down to 56 per cent on February 4. On February 7 and 8, the turnout went down to 40 per cent.Meanwhile, from February 3, the first day of the second phase, the turnout was 65 per cent, it increased to 72 per cent% on the second day and since then it kept increasing to 98 per cent by February 10. On Friday, 101 per cent front line workers were vaccinated wherein 784 were vaccinated while the target was 780.The NMMC chief, Abhijit Bangar, said, “There seems to be less acceptability among the health care workers for vaccination, which is surprising. There is a good response from the frontline workers. Hence, we have written to all the doctors asking to sensitise the staff about the vaccination drive and why it is important to take the shot while fighting against the virus. Explicitly, there has been no specific reason given behind the less turn out. In order to motivate the health care workers, we are releasing many videos of the people who have taken the vaccination and sharing it via social media and WhatsApp groups.He added that even as taking the vaccination was not compulsory, sensitisation is important. “We have also asked each one of them to mention the reasons for not taking the vaccination. Some of them who received vaccination have felt mild symptoms of dizziness and fever, which is a signal that the vaccine is working and the body is responding to it. It is not necessary that all will face it and if faced, there is nothing to worry. This misconception needs to be cleared,” Bangar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-chief-urges-all-health-workers-to-get-vaccinated-as-turnout-is-poor-101613243135225.html

14-02-2021||Mumbai||BJP demands resignation and probe against Sena minister in suicide case||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday demanded the resignation of Maharashtra forest minister and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rathod, and sought to file a case against him in the case of a 23-year-old Pune woman’s alleged death by suicide.The deceased, a popular figure on social media, died by suicide in Pune on February 8. The police registered a case of accidental death, ruling out foul play. She did not leave a suicide note. The episode came to the fore when 11 audio clips of a person allegedly talking with a Sena worker about the woman went viral. The BJP alleged that one of the persons in the audio clip is Rathod. BJP leader Chitra Wagh alleged that the audio clips point to Rathod’s connection to the case. “The audio clips clearly showed that the woman was forced to commit suicide. The audio clips and pictures in the social media clearly indicate this. The police department should file a suo motu offence of manslaughter against him. But this requires political will,” said Wagh. She said it was time for chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Anil Deshmukh to show that they will not tolerate atrocities against women. CM Thackeray told the media that a detailed investigation would be held in this matter. “We will first have a detailed investigation in this case and based on this we will take action,” said Thackeray. “We have been witnessing such type of cases in recent time and people need to take appropriate steps. The truth will come before the people and we will take appropriate action,” he added.Former CM and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has written a letter to Maharashtra director general of police (DGP) Hemant Nagrale demanding a probe in the matter. Rathod hails from Yavatmal and is considered a key Sena figure in the Vidarbha region. Rathod was not available for comment on the allegations against him. Both his phones were out of reach for the whole of Saturday. Shiv Sena, however, called it an attempt by the Opposition to politicise the death. “There is no sign of foul play in the preliminary investigation. The opposition parties are seeking to destabilise the state government,” said Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-demands-resignation-and-probe-against-sena-minister-in-suicide-case-101613242593628.html

Now, the local administrations in these cities have ordered its citizens to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, even as Nagpur and Amravati have started imposing restrictions on gatherings and postponing the reopening of educational institutions in order to contain the spread. For a fourth consecutive day on Saturday, Maharashtra reported more than 3,000 fresh infections and Mumbai saw more than 500 cases, a mark which had not been breached for at least two weeks. With the addition of 3,611 new cases and 38 deaths, the state’s case tally touched 2,060,186 and the toll went up to 51,489.Mumbai’s tally after 529 cases were reported on Saturday stood at 313,431, while the death toll touched 11,415 with six more deaths. Cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including Mumbai, cities like Nagpur, Nashik and Pune, have witnessed a spurt in cases over the past ten days. Daily caseload of MMR touched 1,016 on February 12, up from 627 on February 2, while in Mumbai it was 599, up from 334. The rise in these ten days in Pune (266 from 188), Nashik (158 from 61) and Nagpur (392 from 161), too, was sharp.Pune, Nashik and Nagpur city reported 342, 143 and 436 new cases respectively.

Nagpur municipal commissioner Radhakrishan B said after they found huge gatherings at the wedding ceremonies, they have started taking action over violation of the government orders. “We have also identified 8-10 areas with high number of cases and have been aggressively tracing contacts. We are focusing on superspreaders such as vegetable, milk venders and domestic helps via regular check-ups and testing to contain the spread,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope said although cases in some districts and corporation areas are on the rise, the situation is totally under control. “Districts and corporations with high cases have been instructed to get their act together and increase testing by aggressively tracing the contacts. The testing has to be increased where positivity rate is high. There would not be any lockdown, but the people will have to continue following protocol by wearing masks and maintaining social distancing,” he said.“The rise in cases is majorly because of the unlocking of activities, including schools-colleges, along with local trains, that have contributed to the spurt in the cases. Hundreds of people crowd at wedding ceremonies and cultural-political functions violating the norms of the lockdown,” said an official from the state health department.Meanwhile, the percentage of daily vaccination beneficiaries dropped to 46.21%, as 31,976 healthcare and frontline workers were inoculated at 692 vaccination centres.

14-02-2021||Mumbai||Depression, sleep disorder common among road crash victims and families||At a time when discussion on mental health is gaining prominence, a survey revealed that 40.2% of road crash victims or their family members from low-income households in Maharashtra suffered from depression after the accident. Around 24.4% of those surveyed in the state also said they had sleeping disorders post the incident.The report — Traffic Crash Injuries and Disabilities: The Burden on Indian Society — released on Saturday by the World Bank Group along with SaveLIFE Foundation (SLF) looks at the socioeconomic realities of road crashes in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The study categorises households in low-income and high-income groups. Overall, around half of the low-income households (48%) stated that the family members suffered from depression, while about 26% from high-income groups stated the same.For Maharashtra, the study also states that 22% of the victims from low-income groups admitted that their family/ household members developed health problems after the crash, while the figure stood at 24.1% for high-income households. In Maharashtra, a total of 528 respondents (victims and household members) participated in the survey, of which 113 belonged to high-income groups and 415 in low-income groups.At the release of the report, Union minister for road transport and highways as well as micro, small and medium enterprise, Nitin Gadkari, said, “This report highlights the link between poverty and impact of road crashes. I urge all state governments to effectively implement the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 and work together to mitigate the effects of road crashes on poor and disadvantaged sections of the population.”With 27,286 road crashes and 14,608 road crash deaths in 2019, Maharashtra was the second-highest in road crash deaths in the country that year. While India accounts for 1% of the world’s vehicles, it accounts for 11% of road crash deaths.The report recommends making health infrastructure and coverage more accessible and inclusive, providing social security net for crash victims from low-income households through state support, creating an accessible legal framework for availing insurance and compensation for road crash victims.Piyush Tewari, CEO and founder of SaveLIFE Foundation, said, “The findings of the report identify the areas that require immediate improvements such as efforts towards post-crash emergency care and protocols, insurance and compensation systems. It also presents an opportunity for development agencies, policymakers and respective state governments to prioritise a complete policy overhaul of the existing system and implement sustainable solution-oriented, inclusive measures to improve their performance on road safety.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/depression-sleep-disorder-common-among-road-crash-victims-and-families-101613241637052.html

14-02-2021||Gurugram||Committee will take call on steps to resolve waterlogging near Najafgarh drain: Khattar||To resolve the waterlogging issue on the agriculture land around the Najafgarh drain, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said that affected farmers should form a committee and coordinate with the state government to take steps to prevent the same. “A committee of five to 11 people should be formed by the affected farmers, whose land gets inundated with drain water. A couple of suggestions by the state government will be given to the committee. The suggestion approved by the committee will be implemented to permanently resolve the issue,” said Khattar, who has been in the city for the last two days for multiple programmes. Badshahpur member of legislative assemble (MLA) Rakesh Daulatabad raised the issue with Khattar on Saturday. Nearly 5,600 acres of agriculture land at the Delhi-Gurugram border along the Najafgarh drain get waterlogged. Last year, farmers from eight villages near the Najafgarh drain submitted a memorandum to the MLA asking for a dam to prevent the overflow from inundating their agricultural land. As reported by HT earlier, around 388 million litres of sewage discharge from Gurugram meets Najafgarh drain through Badshahpur drain, creating a lake around the year. The CM also laid the foundation stone for the Institute of Business Management and Agripreneurship in Daulatabad to promote agriculture in the area. The institute, which will be under Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture University, will help in selling and management of agriculture produce by applying new methods, said Khattar.“To fulfil the demand and increase the supply of vegetables, fruits, milk and fish in the Delhi-NCR, having a population of more than four crores (40 million), farmers in the Haryana region are being motivated to adopt peri-urban agriculture,” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/committee-will-take-call-on-steps-to-resolve-waterlogging-near-najafgarh-drain-khattar-101613241633510.html
14-02-2021||Gurugram||Landowners voice grievances on land acquired by HSIIDC||Landowners of five villages, whose land was acquired in 2006 by Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), held a panchayat on Saturday in Ghadoli Khurd village and demanded the formation of a committee comprising all stakeholders to decide on their grievances. The villagers want the government to allot them residential and commercial plots, give jobs and stipends to youth as per the policy of HSIIDC, which acquired the land. The panchayat also criticised the authorities for allegedly evicting an activist representing them from the monthly grievance meeting on Friday.“After the land was acquired, the farmers should have got the promised plots, jobs and stipend within the next few years as per policy but nothing has happened in the last 14 years. Our land was bought at ₹37 lakh per acre but the plots are being offered at a rate of ₹15 crore per acre, which is beyond the means of farmers to pay for,” said Dr Ravi Dutt, spokesperson, Kisan Panchayat Gurugram, who was evicted from the grievance meeting. The farmers said that HSIIDC had sought applications for plots in 2007 and 2010 but these were cancelled. In 2016, the HSIIDC again sought applications for plots but fixed the rate at ₹37,200 per square metre, which is ten times the rate of acquisition, they said.“We submitted that rate of plots should be fixed at the market rate of 2010 but this contention was rejected. As such, we have approached the court to seek relief but the matter has remained stuck despite depositing 10 percent deposit money for the cost of plots,” said Kanwal Singh, numberdar (a person who assigns plot numbers), Ghadoli Khurd.The farmers also said that policies of HSIIDC regarding allotment of plots is confusing as different rates are being offered under different policies. “We are farmers and not a part of the market. Government should not treat our rehabilitation as business,” said Dutt, who added that incident during grievance meeting happened in the heat of moment and he had no intention to create commotion. The farmers also said that they were law-abiding citizens, who would hold discussions with government and approach the court for relief. A senior official in Haryana chief minister’s office when asked about the matter, said that the chief minister on Friday had already said eligible applicants will be allotted plots by HSIIDC and jobs will be also given as per the policy. Khattar, while interacting with media on Friday, said that a proposal to allot plots has already been sent to the HSIIDC board for approval. “Plots and jobs to eligible applicants shall be given,” he said. An HSIIDC spokesperson said that plots have already been allotted to several farmers, who deposited money within the given time. “A proposal for condoning the delay of farmers who deposited the money late has also been sent to the board. A committee has been formed to review the rates as demanded by farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/landowners-voice-grievances-on-land-acquired-by-hsiidc-101613241634083.html
14-02-2021||Gurugram||Advisory board to oversee developmental works in Manesar||The newly formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) will have a 21-member advisory board to oversee developmental projects of the civic body and assist officials with the creation of municipal wards, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said during a programme organized at the HSIIDC auditorium in IMT Manesar on Saturday.Khattar said that the advisory board will operate until municipal elections are held in Manesarits first set of councillors is elected. The MCM was formed in December last year.“MCM has been formed by incorporating 29 villages of the Manesar region. Now, wards for this municipal corporation will be formed and subsequently, elections will be held,” said Khattar. “This is the first municipal corporation formed during the tenure of the present government and till its election, the administrative work will be looked after by MCM commissioner Munish Sharma and an advisory board of 21 members will be formed to support him in the development of Manesar,” Khattar said.He said that the board will include the MLAs of Pataudi and Badshahpur, the chairman of Gurugram block committee, a few members of industrial associations and village leaders, among others.Officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) who attended the meeting said that the advisory board will also include block pramukhs and zila pramukhs. They said that the advisory board will play a similar role to the one executed by councillors in Gurugram — to oversee all new demands or projects that will be carried out for the development of Manesar.Khattar said that there will be an overall improvement in facilities such as sewerage, drainage, streetlights, roads, parks, traffic system, horticulture-related works, drinking water arrangements, among others, now that the MCM has been formed. He said that tenders for solid waste management will be floated, an ID for each property will be created and its value will also be added along with it, to assign the collector rate.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, who had the additional charge of MCM till earlier this month, said that survey work for property ID has started and counters in this regard will be installed in tehsils from Monday.Khattar said that the state government has approved a ₹61-crore scheme to provide drinking water supply to 24 villages and nine dhanis (settlements) in MCM area. He also said that water will be provided to 73 villages and 17 settlements in the next year.In addition to drinking water, he emphasised that the government is also focussing on recycling water. Khattar said that only canal-based water will be used in households, while for horticulture and industries, only treated water will be used.The CM also assured attendees that there will be no shortage of funds for development works in the MCM area.“The Haryana CM gave an example of the MCG having a deposit of more than ₹1,000 crore in various banks of Gurugram and said that it is the only civic body in the state which is self-reliant, in terms of funds. He said that the MCM region is even more affluent than the MCG as there are more industrial units and high-rises in the area and in such a situation, higher revenue can be generated. He said MCM would not be dependent on the government for its cash flow,” said an MCG official, who had attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/advisory-board-to-oversee-developmental-works-in-manesar-101613241573455.html
14-02-2021||Gurugram||Kherki Daula toll plaza to be shifted in six months: Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday announced that the Kherki Daula toll plaza will be shifted in six months, much to the relief of residents and owners of factories based in Manesar. Khattar made the announcement while interacting with citizens during an event in Manesar and reiterated the same during an interaction with factory owners later.“The land that has been earmarked for construction of a new toll plaza will be transferred to the agency concerned by February 28. Thereafter, it will take three to four months to construct the toll plaza and shift it,” said Khattar, while interacting with factory owners in Manesar, adding that the process will be completed within six months.As per the government’s plan, the Kherki Daula toll plaza will be shifted to Panchgaon on Delhi-Jaipur highway. Due to litigation, there has been a considerable delay in handing over the land, but officials privy to the matter said that the transfer of land has been worked out.During the meeting, Khattar also said that there is a plan to connect Manesar with Bawal through Metro rail. The Metro rail project is being developed by Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation, at the cost of around ₹8,000 crore. This, he said, will improve connectivity across south Haryana.Removal of the Kherki Daula toll plaza and better connectivity between Gurugram and Manesar has been a longstanding demand of city residents, especially those in the newer sectors, and factory owners and workers in both municipal areas.In 2017, union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had announced that the toll plaza will be shifted if the state government makes land available for the same to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). However, the proposal has remained stuck as land first identified at Sehrawan near Manesar and later at Panchgaon came under litigation. The concessionaire of the project has also approached the Delhi high court in this matter.Earlier on Tuesday, Gurugram member of Parliament, Rao Inderjit Singh, had also met Gadkari and raised the issue of shifting the Kherki Daula toll plaza, citing jams and pollution.On Saturday, Khattar also announced setting up a new hospital in Manesar, increase in Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for industrial plots from 125 to 200, increase in height limit for fire NoC from 15 metres to 18 metres and setting up of a women’s police station in the industrial township.The announcements made by the chief minister on Saturday enthused the Manesar-based factory owners, who said that freeing the highway from toll was the need of the hour and easing the estate management norms necessary for industries to survive.“The toll should be shifted at the earliest and the decision related to plots and providing streetlights and other basics will boost industry in a big way,” said Pawan Yadav, president IMT Industrial Association, Manesar.Manoj Tyagi, an industrialist based in Manesar, said that setting up a new municipal corporation would ensure basic civic services to people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/kherki-daula-toll-plaza-to-be-shifted-in-six-months-khattar-101613241574004.html

According to MSEDCL, around 8 million consumers in the state, which includes 4.1 million residential consumers, have not paid even a single month’s bill in the past 10 months, between April 2020 and January 2021.The state discom said it was under severe stress with arrears to the tune of ₹71,506 crore. The arrears stood at ₹51,146 crore in March 2020, before the lockdown was imposed.“Every month, 80-85% of power purchase is done via the revenue generated. During the lockdown, we did not disconnect the power supply for any consumer category. However, now we have started to temporary disconnect [supply] since the past one month, after giving several warnings to consumers,” a senior MSEDCL official said.On Saturday, the discom also stated that of the 980,499 complaints that it has received, 933,324 have been resolved. “We are in the final stages of resolving the rest of the complaints too. Looking at the financial status of the discom, we appeal to consumers to pay their bills on time,” MSEDCL said in a statement. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharastra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had earlier promised relief after a public outcry over consumers receiving hefty bills during lockdown. However, state energy minister Nitin Raut, on November 17, said the state cannot provide any relief and consumers have to pay their bills.In January 2021, MSEDCL, which supplies power to over 20 million consumers in the state, had also warned consumers of disconnecting power supply if they do not pay bills on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/msedcl-arrears-at-71k-crore-appeals-to-consumers-to-pay-bills-101613241454280.html

We are waiting for the report of the directorate of industrial safety and health (DISH), Vasai. We have registered a case of accident and are probing further.”The pharma unit, set up in 1993, manufactures bulk drugs, hydroxychloroquine, intermediates used in pharma, nutraceutical and food industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/blast-at-pharma-unit-in-boisar-near-mumbai-2-injured-101613241274255.html
14-02-2021||Mumbai||Amid tussle with Thackeray govt over airplane fiasco, Guv visits Delhi||Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is locked in a bitter tussle with the Maharashtra government, made an unscheduled visit to New Delhi by changing his plan to return to Mumbai from Dehradun on Saturday.According to information, Koshyari may meet some central authorities in the backdrop of the controversy over denial of the government aircraft by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for his visit to Dehradun on Thursday. In an embarrassing instance, Koshyari had to deplane after boarding the state's plane when he was told that the CMO had not approved a request sent by his secretariat for the six-seater plane to travel to Dehradun. Koshyari then took a commercial flight to travel to his destination.He was expected to return to Mumbai on Saturday after attending 122nd induction training program of IAS officers at Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy of Administration at Mussoorie on Thursday. He, however, changed his plan and reached Delhi on Saturday by a commercial flight from Uttarakhand. He will be staying at Maharashtra Sadan (state's guest house in Delhi) on Sunday, though his secretariat did not reveal any scheduled visits by him. He will now return on Sunday evening.Also read: Delhi records no deaths from Covid-19 in last 24 hours, second time this monthAccording to the officials in Delhi, Koshyari may meet some officials from Central government in the backdrop of the airplane row. “The Governor generally meets leaders from Delhi and Uttarakhand whenever he is in the capital. There is no official meeting scheduled but there could be a meeting on Sunday regarding this entire episode,” the official said.State government’s attempt to turn the table on Raj Bhavan, by issuing a statement about action against officials in Governor secretariat, seeking report from them and the Saamana’s editorial terming the tour as ‘private’, is believed to have been taken seriously by the Raj Bhavan. The Governor is also expected to report the entire episode to the Union home ministry.On Thursday, the state government denied the use of government-owned Cessna Citation XLS aircraft for Governors’ visit to Uttarakhand. This led to a row bringing the differences between the Governor and the Udhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government to the fore again.Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', in its editorial on Saturday, termed it as a personal tour. “The Governor was informed a day before his scheduled departure that he cannot be permitted to use the aircraft as his tour was a personal trip. Despite that, he went to the airport out of his stubbornness. He should maintain the honour and dignity of the post he is holding. He is being used as a ‘puppet’ and its an ‘insult’ to the nation,” the editorial stated.“It is the matter of interpretation if the tour was official or not, as he was invited at the IAS academy as the Governor of Maharashtra. It cannot be termed as his personal visit just because the academy is in Dehradun. Secondly, the six-seater Cesna was procured for the flying of VVIPs including the Governor, the chief minister and other ministers with the permission from the CM. As head of the state, the Governor does not need permission for flying but just intimate the government. He boarded the flight assuming that the permission will come at last minute as usual,” an official from the Mantralaya said.He said that all other technical permissions for flying were in place, barring the official nod from the government. The official said that it was his first visit to which he asked for the state government’s aircraft.Though the state government has said that they will seek a report from the Raj Bhavan, no such formal letter has yet been sent. “We have not asked for any report formally so far. If honourable chief minister instructs us to do so, we will write for such report,” said Sanjay Kumar, chief secretary, Maharashtra.Saamana editorial has also said that the Governor has not appointed 12 members to the legislative council on the recommendation by the government because he follows the orders from Delhi. The appointment has been stalled at the behest of the BJP, it stated.Meanwhile, there was no statement or clarification from Raj Bhavan over the reports on Thursday's incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-tussle-with-thackeray-govt-over-airplane-fiasco-guv-visits-delhi-101613240705907.html

There were no deaths on Monday – as reported a day later on February 9 – for the first time since May 11, much before Delhi saw the first surge in the cases of the viral infection.So far, the most single-day deaths were recorded on November 18, when 131 were reported to have succumbed to the illness as Delhi dealt with the third and most brutal surge in the number of cases.Delhi, which was one of the earliest Covid-19 hot spots in India, is the only region in the country that has reported three distinct waves of infections.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“Today again within a week no death has been reported due to Covid infection. Please continue to take all precautions,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain tweeted.So far, 10,889 people have died of the viral infection since the first death, of a 69-year-old woman – the mother of a Janakpuri resident who had travelled to Japan, Italy and Switzerland – was reported on March 13.New deaths usually reflect infections that took place three-four weeks ago.As per the government data, the infection has affected 636,796 people in the city. However, many more cases remain undetected as shown by the seroprevalence in January that showed 56% or over 11 million Delhiites had been exposed to the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-covid-19-deaths-in-the-capital-for-2nd-day-in-a-week-101613238753699.html
14-02-2021||Delhi||Around 43% in Delhi get second dose of Covid-19 vaccines||Less than half of the health care workers in Delhi who were scheduled to receive their second dose of the coronavirus vaccine turned up to get the jab on Saturday, even as the 43% turnout rate in the Capital far exceeded the overall turnout across the country on the day.Across India, only 4% of those who received the shot on January 16, when the inoculation drive kicked off, turned up for the second shot on Saturday, according to provisional data shared by the Union health ministry.With 1,856 people getting the second shot, Delhi accounted for over 24% of the 7,668 second doses administered, as per the provisional data.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageEven then, administration officials in the city attributed the low turnout in Delhi to the weekend, and the fact that hospitals were open only for half the day.“Today, fewer vaccinations happened in total at the centre, largely because it is a Saturday, when many of our employees have their weekly off or leave the hospital by mid-day,” said Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, where 247 people received the shot in comparison to 319 the day before.Dr Rana himself missed his second dose of the vaccine as he was in a kidney transplant surgery.“It is a very delicate surgery and I did not want to take the vaccine before it, because of the slightest possibility that I might develop a fever or any other side effects. By the time I was done with the surgery the vaccination centre had closed,” he said.The number of people who receive the second dose of the vaccine is likely to go up Monday onwards.Among those who did receive the second shot of the vaccine on Saturday was 34-year-old Manish Kumar, a sanitation worker from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, who the first person in the Capital to get a jab of a Covid-19 vaccine.Also Read | Only 4% beneficiaries turn up for second vaccine shot: Centre“When I had gone to the vaccination centre on the first day, everybody I spoke to wanted to wait for Dr Randeep Guleria (the AIIMS director) to get the shot. But I went ahead and said I would like to get it first, if possible. That’s why the staff at the vaccination centre was surprised that I turned up very late at about 4pm for my second dose; my shift was from 1pm, so I decided to come in late,” said Kumar. He also urged all eligible people to get the vaccine, and said the jab had no side-effects on him.Dr Sandeep Nayyar, head of the centre for chest medicine at BL Kapur hospital, was first in line to get his second shot of Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday. “I experienced no adverse events after either shot and continued my day as usual. I will urge everyone to get the vaccine so that we do not have to go through what we did in 2020. However, getting the vaccine does not mean that people stop following the precautions as it will still take a long time to immunise everyone,” he said.On Saturday, in addition to the 1,856 people who received the second dose of the vaccine, 11,912 people received their first shots. The total, 13,768, is slightly less than the 14,843 people who were vaccinated yesterday and 15,807 the day before that.Among those who received the first shot of the vaccine, around 30% were health care workers, while the rest were those classified as “frontline workers”. In North district, no healthcare worker received their first shot on Saturday and only five healthcare workers in Northeast district got a jab of the vaccines.As per the centre’s directions, the immunisation of healthcare workers will end on February 20 and that of frontline workers on March 1. Five days after each deadline will be allotted for mop up to give the shots to those who might have missed it. After this, immunisation of those over the age of 50 will begin.“There is a lot of messages going around among doctors and other healthcare workers that the immune response is better when the doses are given 12 weeks apart. This is the reason many might want to wait till the six week cut-off to get the shot. Some might be scared of adverse reactions as there could be more reactogenecity during the second dose,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College.No adverse events following immunisation(AEFI) were reported in people who got their second shot on Saturday and six AEFI were reported among those who got the first shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/around-43-in-delhi-get-second-dose-of-covid-19-vaccines-101613238753167.html
14-02-2021||Delhi||Mangolpuri murder case transferred to crime branch||The Delhi Police on Saturday said that the murder case of Mangolpuri resident 25-year-old Rinku Sharma has been transferred to their crime branch that will look into the allegations levelled by his family members and the local police’s theory that the crime was a result of personal enmity.Sharma, who worked as a lab technician at a private hospital, was stabbed while returning home from a birthday party on Wednesday night.The murder of the 25-year-old had taken communal colours on Friday, with some leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stating on social media that Sharma was collecting money for construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.The tension that has gripped the neighbourhood since, continued on Saturday with a group of people allegedly attacking the house of one of the suspects despite deployment of extra security personnel to prevent any untoward incidents.The family of Sharma on Saturday also refuted Delhi Police’s theory of the murder having happened over personal enmity, and stated that Sharma had a tiff with the arrested persons last year because of his links with Hindu groups. Sharma’s brother, Mannu Sharma said that his brother was associated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal.Additional deputy commissioner of police (outer) Sudhanshu Dhama did not comment on Saturday’s mob attack at the suspect’s house despite multiple attempts.Five persons, identified as Mohammad Danish,36, Mohammad Islam,45, Zahid,26, Mohammad Mehtab,20, and Tajuddin,39, have been arrested in the case, even as Sharma’s family members have alleged that five-six more persons were involved in the killing.“We are happy that the case has been transferred to the crime branch. Local police cooperated with us but they could not have solved this case. At least a dozen people were involved in my brother’s (Rinku) murder, but only five were arrested. We hope that the crime branch will do a fair investigation” said Mannu Sharma.On Saturday, a crime branch team, along with forensic experts, visited the crime scene, lifted evidence, and met Sharma’s family members. According to Mannu, the crime branch officials took names of the persons involved in his brother’s murder from his family members.A police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that the crime branch team will look into all angles related to Sharma’s murder and will once again record the statements of his family members, eyewitnesses, and other people related to the case. It will also examine all the video footage pertaining to the crime.On Friday, the police had said that Sharma and the accused were known to each other for a long time, and had got into a fight at a party over the shutting down of a mutual friend’s restaurant. The row escalated and Sharma was stabbed on Wednesday night. Sharma’s family members have, however, maintained that some of the accused had fought with him last August because of his links with Hindu groups.Some leaders from the BJP — including Kapil Mishra and Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta — had said on social media on Friday that Sharma was collecting money for construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Mishra even linked the killing to the collection drive, as posts demanding “justice” for Sharma gained traction through the day. Gupta and party MP Hans Raj Hans also visited Sharma’s house, as did AAP MLA Rakhi Birla.A fundraiser has also been started to support Sharma’s family. On Saturday morning, Mishra tweeted that R35 lakh had been raised for Sharma’s family. Mishra also mentioned that he will be meeting Sharma’s family on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mangolpuri-murder-case-transferred-to-crime-branch-101613238696082.html
14-02-2021||Delhi||AAP demands Amit Shah’s resignation over Mangolpuri killing||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday condemned the murder of 25-year old lab assistant Rinku Sharma in Mangolpuri and demanded the resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah over the deteriorating law and order situation in DelhiAddressing a press conference, senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said even the Hindus are now not safe under the BJP-ruled Central government. “Union home minister Amit Shah should take responsibility for the murder of Rinku Sharma and immediately resign. Earlier only Muslims used to feel threatened under the BJP, but now Dalits, Sikhs and Hindus also feel threatened. The BJP and Shah are conspiring atrocities against the Hindus for their political benefits and AAP condemns such mentality,” said Bhardwaj.Also Read | Mangolpuri murder: Delhi Police transfers case to crime branchHe said that under Shah, the Red Fort was vandalised, and Rahul Rajput was murdered a few months ago. And now, there’s a murder in Mangolpuri case. He said the AAP also demands stringent punishment for those responsible for Rinku Sharma’s murder.“On behalf of the AAP, I want to make it very clear that the Union home minister is responsible for these heinous crimes which are taking place in the national capital of India. These crimes and murders are taking place in Delhi and the Delhi Police is completely failing to protect the citizens,” he said.The Union ministry of home affairs did not comment on the matter.The Delhi BJP, on the other hand, questioned the silence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over the brutal murders and riots in Delhi which have taken place over the past few years. “People of Delhi have seen that the AAP leadership first tries to ignore such murders or communal riots killings by a minority community but mildly condemns the killings when the public and BJP pressure mounts,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.“People of Delhi very well know that AAP politically stands behind a minority community of youths involved in the killings of Hindu youths. The biggest proof is that the AAP has till date not expelled the alleged February 2020 riots conspirator AAP councilor Tahir Hussain. AAP in-fact stands by Tahir Hussain and other conspirators, Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid and Pinjda Tod members,” Kapoor said.Sharma’s murder on Wednesday night by five men, supposedly known to him, took a communal turn on Friday with many leaders, such as Kapil Mishra, linking Sharma’s killing to a donation collection drive for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Delhi BJP cheif Adesh Gupta had said that Sharma was collecting donations for the temple. On Friday, posts on social media demanding justice for Sharma gained traction throughout the day.While Delhi police maintained that the killing was a result of personal enmity over losses after a restaurant owned by Sharma’s friend shut down, his family members refuted police’s theory and said that Sharma had a tiff with the arrested persons last year because of his links with Hindu groups. Sharma’s brother, Mannu Sharma said that his brother was associated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal. On Friday many leaders from AAP and BJP had also visited Sharma’s family in Rohini. The leaders of the BJP, AAP and Congress have sought harshest punishment for the arrested persons and a speedy trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-demands-amit-shah-s-resignation-over-mangolpuri-killing-101613238694400.html
14-02-2021||Delhi||Two elderly men nabbed for Republic Day violence make bail||Two elderly men from Punjab — Gurkmukh Singh,80, and Jeet Singh, 70 — who had been arrested by Delhi Police for assaulting security personnel during the Republic Day violence, were granted bail by a city court on Friday.The two are the eldest, among the 146 persons arrested for the violence on January 26, so far. The court while granting the bail took into account the age of the two men, the fact that they had no criminal past and the fact that they had served in the defence forces.Friday’s bail for the elderly duo also meant that the number of people who had received bail after being arrested for their alleged involvement in the Republic Day violence so far jumped to six. Papers seen by Hindustan Times, show that in these six cases, the courts observed that the men had no criminal record and were merely picked up from the spots of violence. In one case, where three men were arrested, the court noted that police are yet to connect them directly with the violence.To be sure, the six are only out on bail and are yet to be cleared of the charges. As part of the probe and legal process, police will gather evidence against the six men and present it in their charge sheet. The court will then start trial against the six men. The courts have directed the six men to not leave the country without permission and not to threaten or influence witnesses or complainants.Sample this observation by a city court in FIR 50 registered by the Baba Haridas Nagar police. Police had arrested three men for allegedly assaulting police personnel when they were asked not to deviate from the pre-approved route of the farmers tractor rally.The court observed that the alleged rioters Jaswinder Singh, Lovepreet Singh and Ramdeep Singh, were on a motorcycle at the spot of the violence on January 26 but police are yet to link them to the violence. “...It is observed by the court that nowhere in the reply, it has been averred as to what was the role of the accused/applicant...The court has also observed that there is no specific involvement of the accused/applicant in any violence or breaking of the barricade in the present case,” the court said, while granting bail to the three men. The court also observed that the three did not have a criminal record.Jaswinder, Lovepreet and Ramandeep were the first to get bail on February 8.In another case, related to the violence in Uttam Nagar, police had arrested Sandeep Kumar. Delhi police had alleged that Kumar was part of an unlawful assembly that indulged in riots and caused injuries to nine persons. Police also said that the mob, of which Kumar was a part, damaged public property. The court while granting Kumar bail observed that the police report was “conspicuously silent” about the role of Kumar’s criminal antecedents. Kumar’s lawyers had said that he was a bystander who owns an iron rods shop where the violence happened. The court observed that because police had not given any report of Kumar’s antecedents, there was no reason to his submission that he had clear antecedents. The court during the hearing also observed that in the same case, another accused person was released by the police after issuing a notice, but Kumar was arrested.In response to the release of the six men on bail, former MLA and president of the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said, “Delhi police have arrested many innocent farmers for the violence that day. The DSGMC is working with a panel of lawyers and offering pro-bono services to ensure that all innocent people arrested are released on bail at the earliest.”While Delhi police spokesperson DCP Chinmoy Biswal was not available for a response, a senior Delhi police officer who did not wish to be named, said, “Bail is a legal process and the right of the accused. We have arrested 143 persons. We have evidence, which is why the courts have not given bail in other cases. There are more than 100 people arrested for the violence. The circumstances of the arrest of each person and their specific crime are bound to be different, even if the main allegation is of rioting. There are also prominent people, like Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu and Iqbal Singh, against whom we have concrete evidence. We have presented the evidence gathered (so far) against him in court. Also, we have arrest only 143 persons, when the mob comprised of a larger number. We arrest only those who were violent that day. Further investigations are on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-elderly-men-nabbed-for-r-day-violence-make-bail-101613238693813.html
14-02-2021||Other||Curtain call: Time to cut it out||There has been a rising demand for the need to censor content on the OTT platforms, now more than ever as consumption on these platforms has increased. A few years ago the censor board was in the news (again) because of the antics of Mr. Nihlani and also because of the controversy the roast video of the now disbanded All India Bakchod had created. I had begun questioning the need to “censor” anything. Those feelings resurfaced after I read the news that there might be a regulatory body for OTT platforms. I recently had a funny experience with the film censor board during the screening of a biopic I have co-written and directed. I was very confident that there is nothing objectionable in my film and was pretty relaxed when the board members were watching it. I was surprised when they raised a concern after the screening. A scene in my film shows an eminent personality having a drink. (The reason why I am not taking any names here is not self-censorship, but because I do not want to divulge the details of my film before it is released.) They asked me to get a letter of no objection from the personality’s family in order to get the censor certificate. I was taken aback because the scene showed the person merely having that drink. He was not misbehaving because of it nor was he presented in any undignified light. In fact, we did not even show alcohol! In the scene, he transfers the liquid in question from a metal flask to a metal container. And it is also public knowledge that this personality used to have a drink or two in real life. I mentioned all this to the board members, but to no avail. I was told that if I wanted my film to have a censor certificate with that scene intact, I had no choice but to get that letter of no objection. I can now laugh about all this because eventually we were able to get the letter in time and the family was also gracious to praise the film and the depiction of their father in the letter. Why couldn’t the board members see this? To equate smoking or alcohol with something negative doesn’t need any intelligence. A computer program could have identified this and given this result. To have a minute-long advertisement before the start of the film and also immediately after the interval to prevent tobacco use is also something that doesn’t make sense to me. It is included in the length of the film! I have always believed that the job of a censor board should not be to remove, or to object to, the content, but to certify it. They should mention who the content is suitable for. Based on that, the audience should make a choice whether they want to give their time or money to this. People in our country get influenced by films and film stars. True. They emulate their stars - their fashion, their styles, their behavior, everything. Films might play a major role in the prevalence of a sexist society too. It is easy and unfair to blame only art forms for this. We have enough political and moral censorships to deal with anyway. Depicting real-life personalities is always very tricky. And in a country like ours, you never know why some people might get offended. I wonder if that should stop a person from telling stories. Criticism or such reactions are part and parcel of this profession. I was happy when OTT platforms entered India and started producing content for and by Indians. I enjoyed the freedom and range of topics it offered to the creators. I may not agree with everything that is shown, but then I stop watching it and shift to something else just by pressing a button on the remote. It is that simple! Yes, there will be some hiccups, but people and their choices will dictate what will get produced in the long run. There is no need for a middle-man to dictate that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/curtain-call-time-to-cut-it-out-101613236473586.html
14-02-2021||Pune||Suicide case: Pune police to question deceased woman’s flatmates||The Pune police will question the two men with whom the 23-year-old woman, who died by suicide recently, was living with in Mohammadwadi, Pune, according to officials. Earlier on Thursday, BJP sought probe into woman’s death after some audio clips indicating her association with a minister in Maharashtra cabinet went viral. Meanwhile, the National Commissioner of Women (NCW) has written to the regional additional commissioner of police to file a report in the incident. “When the incident happened, it was not the right time to push the family members to talk about it. The initial statements of the two men were recorded. However, we have called them again for a detailed statement. We have also informed the family members to record a statement. We will get it done in the course of the investigation,” said Namrata Patil, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-5, Pune police. The 23-year-old woman, who is believed to have been in Pune for a spoken English course, enjoyed a mini-celebrity status on a social media application with 166,000 followers. The woman had posted on her profile on the day she was reported to have died by suicide. Her posts indicated that she felt helpless and suffocated. When asked about the post mortem report, senior police inspector Deepak Lagad of Wanowrie police station said, “The initial doctor’s opinion has only informed us about the cause of death - head and spinal injury due to the fall. Her family members have said that she had issues like psoriasis.” The girl’s sister took to Facebook to speak out against social media posts about her sister and the allegations surrounding the cause of her death. Social media platforms are rife with posts about the recordings of the alleged minister with one of the boys that the girl was living with. The veracity of those recordings is yet to be verified. However, the issue has gained traction after multiple leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made multiple posts about the woman. “The National Commission for Women (NCW) has been tagged in a Twitter Post wherein the Commission has been requested to take cognisance of the alleged suicide of a girl named PS in Pune on February 7. The Commission has taken cognisance of the matter. Chairperson Ms Rekha Sharma has written to Director General of Police, Maharashtra seeking appropriate action. The Commission has also sought a detailed action taken report in the matter at the earliest. A copy of the letter has also been sent to additional commissioner of police, East Region, Pune, Maharashtra,” read a statement by the NCW. Even though the opposition BJP party has mounted pressure on the Pune police to register a case in the matter, the police are investigating the initial accidental death report which was registered on February 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/suicide-case-police-to-question-deceased-woman-s-flatmates-101613236472989.html

14-02-2021||Pune||Six held for vandalising multiple vehicles in Wanowrie, Pune||The Pune police arrested six people on Saturday for vandalising multiple vehicles in Wanowrie late on Friday night. Among the vandalised vehicles is a car, two-wheelers and auto rickshaws. The vandalism was in reaction to the police action of invoking the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against the brother of one of the arrested men. The arrested men were identified as Shubham Harivansh Tiwari (19), Aniket Raju Vaydande (22), Omkar Gorakh Waghmare (20), Swapnil alias Rishab Mahendra Hivale (24), Magdum Shaikh (27), and Aslam Popat Shaikh (23), according to the police. “Six people have been arrested. They will be produced in court tomorrow,” said senior police inspector Deepak Lagad of Wanowrie police station. The seven men who were booked under MCOCA were identified as Girish alias Sunny Mahendra Hiwale (21), Akash Santosh Bharti (20), Chetan Pandurang Dhebe (22), Aniket alias Monty Sharad Mane (20), Kajal Madhukar Wadkar (21), Ambika Arjun Misal (21), and Suraj Mahadev Navgire (19), according to police. MCOCA was invoked on the order of Additional Commissioner of Police, West Region, Namdev Chavan. The stringent law was invoked in a case of attempted murder registered against the seven people including two women. The seven people were booked for assaulting a man named Pandharinath Misal with the intention of killing him on January 17. The complainant states that one of the accused, Ambika Misal, was asked to not talk with one of the other accused - Aniket Mane. Mane then said that Pandharinath’s brother was instrumental in the murder of one of his friends and fired two shots at him. However, the shots were misfired and were followed by an attack with swords and wooden rods, according to the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/six-held-for-vandalising-multiple-vehicles-in-wanowrie-101613236413726.html

Due to this, Pune became a laughing stock in transportation circles. At best what we have in Pune can be called a mixed transport system. If that is the case, why eat up major portion of the median by laying it there?The state needs to take a courageous call to order PMC to stop constructing and demolishing bits and pieces of the 2006 Pilot BRTS project. and in 2014 for Pune Phase-1. If PMC had used even 10% of the Rs1,400 crore (and counting) spent on this conceptually flawed BRTS, Punekars would have had a world-class bus transport system on the conventional left side. Through the years, because PMC did not prepare the basic documents such as pre-feasibility report, DPR, socio-economic state report, financial feasibility report, the implementation and execution lacked vision. This project just guzzled up public funds which were available through NURM scheme because no one official was made accountable. Historically, funds once received were used for construction in a lackadaisical manner to suit PMC top officials whims and fancies on many stretches, ignoring that public funds must be used with responsibility.Over these years, PMC’s intention was never to ensure a safe, affordable, commuter friendly public transport system, giving way to increase in purchase of private vehicles.Phase 1 - Ahmednagar road-Vishrantwadi-Sangamwadi: (i) railings at Sangamwadi corridor where there is no bus shelter need to be shifted to the median to streamline rest of traffic in MV lanes. (ii) Ahmednagarnagar Road is a mess as MahaMetro has cannabalised and demolished most of the bus shelters. Corridors remain unused as MahaMetro has taken over large small stretches. (iii) Vishrantwadi is wide enough for football to be played with multiple lanes with markings.Pilot Project – Katraj to Hadapsar via Swargate: (i) no BRTS corridor on 7 kms was constructed in the middle as PMC wrongly assumed that PCB would give permission (ii) BRTS corridor even outside PMPML office at Swargate has been demolished to construct the Jedhe chowk flyover (iii) Hadapsar stretch is a like adventure rides at Disney Land (iv) PMC ignored the 22 corrections pointed out by Creations Engineers and Pavetech Consulting Engineering Services. Successive PMC Commissioners agreed verbally, but bowed to their political bosses. Even now logical suggestions to correct the flaws have been ignored. Feedback that comes in when questioned through the years is that the alignments laid cannot be corrected or shifted because it is through NURM funding. On the other hand, it does not matter to PMC in the least that they did not follow basic documentation, but used the basic premise of have money, use it. As typically the attitude of senior officers has been that let someone else bell the cat. No one builds a public transport system for it’s very basic purpose to be defeated if citizens continue to buy private vehicles.-Qaneez SukhraniA loss of public revenueThe Pune Municipal Corporation introduced the BRTS (Bus Rapid Transit System) and projected it as an ambitious scheme that envisaged the implementation of a high-quality public transport system to put an end to the rising vehicular traffic and the congestion within city limits. Earlier, it was promised the construction and layout of dedicated bus corridors will have facilities like new air-conditioned buses and high-end terminals and stations.The Swargate–Katraj corridor required much-needed repairs which have now been taken care off, but the entire process was messy. For instance, the Katraj to Swargate stretch was un-operational in places as the work of building bus stations along the route was half-done and showed shoddy nature of the administration.The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has time and again said that Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not been able to carry out improvement works on the Katraj-Swargate Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) stretch despite the Pune Mayor demanding that it be commissioned at the earliest.The 5.5km stretch soon still needs essential works of signal synchronisation, CCTV installation which have not been done yet while doors of bus stops are also still not in place. It shows the callous attitude of the PMC towards public transportation projects. Nothing much is expected from the current arrangement as bureaucracy of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is apathetic and controlled by private -money groups who are interested in only squeezing public revenue for private growth and power.-Mitali MankikarNo safety measuresThe work of signal synchronisation and door installation has been done, but safety is not up to the mark in the said corridor. When the project started, it was branded as the first BRTS in the country. However, both Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) have proved to be completely ineffective for not being able to run the projects smoothly. It is seen that the civic body administration has worked smoothly for the private gains of elected representatives and officialdom which has built a very strong nexus in PMC and operates like a lobby group against the wishes of citizens and its criminal behaviour has caused untold suffering to Puneites. The reasons for the BRTS project not working are the ongoing Metro work near BRTS stretches and lack of adequate staff and infrastructure to ensure smooth plying of buses on BRTS stretch between Swargate and Katraj.The police have been saying that the increasing volume of traffic in the city was making it difficult to negotiate the narrower stretch of the roads due to the presence of BRTS. Till Metro work is going on, BRTS will be affected and safety of commuters will always be in question. BRTS has been an absolute failure in Pune city and the very concept is dead and redundant. While the PMC has failed to provide the right infrastructure, PMPML has failed to provide quality buses, frequent service and well-trained staff for manning this mammoth project.- Amardeep DesaiStrict rules neededThe first BRTS in Pune city was operationalised in the Katraj-Swargate stretch as a pilot project and since then citizens have no hope in the administration as it was done to please the political and business interests operating in New Delhi under the protection of UPA government .The PMC carried out road widening and created separate lanes for private vehicles as the flow of traffic increased. The PMC has carried out a safety audit of the road and redeveloping work of the BRTS route from Swargate to Katraj was taken up in 2016, but the work was inordinately delayed due to technical issuesThe PMC started renovation work on the BRTS and since then, the civic body, which is spending approximately ₹100 crore on the project, missed at least four deadlines to reopen the BRTS. The PMC has maintained that it had to undertake renovation to put in place a new design and all this was to deceive the citizens of Pune. Now, the stretch is operational under the watch of the civic body, it is witnessing traffic jams and bottleneck as citizens no longer follow discipline. When they see their representatives and officialdom being unprofessional and corrupt, they no longer fear action from any government body.- Neha SharmaHeavy fines neededEven though the intention of it, BRTS, being the safe and fast roads for passengers, its implementation was not done properly due to improper study and research by the officials. Secondly, controlling the bikers and four -wheelers and encroaching the lane led to a number of fatal accidents in the past. Having spent crores of rupees on the project in the past and then dismantling it, led to a lot of confusion. It was a waste of public money.Laws were not implemented strictly by the security guards with heavy fines for those drivers cutting and entering the BRTS lane.- Nitin Bokey||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yourspace-brts-joke-not-funny-anymore-101613236354291.html

Datta is one among many athletes who are missing their regular training as Baburao Sanas Ground is still not made available for athletes by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The entry at the ground was restricted after PMC built a Covid Care Centre in March and it was shut on December 27, 2020. Sanas ground is the hub of athletics training in Pune, there are around 500 athletes from the city who used to train daily. Now, in post-Covid these athletes are hopping between different grounds and also going to Taljai hills for practice. “The maintenance work (cutting of grass, cleaning work) is still going on, once it is done the ground will be reopened for athletes”, said Kishori Shinde, assistant municipal commissioner, sports department. With all the grounds in the city being available for training of other sports, parents and coaches are visiting the PMC office for regular inquiries but no written assurances are given by the PMC. “We were told that the ground will open from February 1 but when our children went to the ground, officials at the ground denied them permission. After that, there has been no new date given by PMC,” said a parent from Prerna Palak Sang – a parents’ body of athletes. A spot visit from HT confirmed that ground maintenance work is still not completed. “It’s been more than one month since PMC is still not able to finish the work. Our athletes have to travel more, and synthetic tracks are not available everywhere which is making things harder for training and impacting their performance,” said Atul Sharma, parent. Arvind Chavan, coach of Datta said, high jump needs regular practice. “Abhar only had three days of practice after reaching Guwahati other than that he was doing only fitness training. The color of the medal could have been different if he was in regular practice. With all these circumstances I am happy with his performance,” Chavan said. Chavan who runs the Pune athletics club is taking his athletes to Taljai hills, Kataria high school ground, and Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex, Balewadi for practice. “We are left with no options since Sanas ground is still not available for practice. Travelling is impacting the practice schedule of athletes,” said Chavan. Refurbishment of track still pending? On February 4, 2019, ₹3.73 crore tender was floated by the PMC for the refurbishment of the existing track, and even after 24 months the work at the Sanas Ground has not started. “The work will start soon by PMC Building department. Currently, we will open ground for athletes after maintenance work is completed,” said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sanas-ground-closure-impacting-city-athletes-performance-experts-101613231192516.html

The PCMC has been calling upon the registered Covid-19 beneficiaries who are refusing to come up for vaccination said the health chief. The civic body has also not increased its session sites which continue to remain the lowest at just eight sites The PCMC which led the vaccination drive reporting the highest percentage in the initial days of the drive now has a difficult time getting the registered beneficiaries on board for the vaccination. On Friday, while the PCMC reported 59 per cent while the district reported 61% vaccination, on Thursday this stood at 41 per cent while the district’s average percentage was 51 per cent and on Wednesday the PCMC reported only 32 per cent of the target beneficiaries being vaccinated which pulled down the district’s average vaccination percentage to 52 per cent. Dr Pavan Salve, chief medical officer at PCMC states that the reason for a low turnout is the refusal of the registered beneficiaries which is bringing down the daily vaccination percentage at PCMC. He said, “We have been calling up the registered beneficiaries to come up, but they seem to refuse to come up for vaccination. While on the other side we also have beneficiaries, who did not register but now want to take up the jab. However, we cannot register them now. We are following up with the registered beneficiaries to come up with the vaccination, but they give various reasons. We have about 30 thousand registered health care workers and frontline workers.” As of Friday, Pune rural had 23 session sites and Pune Municipal corporation (PMC) has 24 sites, PCMC has only eight session sites. According to the state health department, the Pune district has vaccinated a total of 59621 beneficiaries including 55,001 health care workers and 4,620 frontline workers until Friday. Indian Medical Association (IMA) hospital board chairman for Pune chapter Dr Sanjay Patil said, “In the PCMC area there is hesitancy it seems and also there is a fear of efficacy among health care workers. There must be a positive awareness drive conducted by the administration. The IMA’s stand is to encourage its members to take the vaccine. The members I spoke to also have questions about whether there would be enough supply for the second dose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/registered-beneficiaries-not-willing-to-be-vaccinated-pcmc-health-chief-101613231133875.html

As the civic body couldn’t take up the work due to shortage of funds, NHAI decided to fund it.Once complete, the flyover will supplement the six-lane Katraj-Navale bridge stretch, work for which is currently underway.“We have invited tenders and work for the flyover at Katraj will begin in a month. The work for six-laning of Katraj-Navale bridge stretch has also started and will complete soon,” said Gadkari.A total of ₹169 crore has been sanctioned for the flyover which will be 1.3 kilometres in length with service road on both sides.“I have already signed the papers for the contract,” said Gadkari.Part of the flyover will also pass through Rajiv Gandhi zoological park for which national zoo authority has given permission, said PMC officials.Vijaykumar Deshpande, secretary to national highways, public works department (PWD), said that the central PWD has got permission from national zoo authority for erecting two pillars inside the Katraj zoo premises.“Now there are no hurdles and the work will be carried out smoothly,” he said.The minister, meanwhile, also asked the officials from NHAI and PMC to prepare a plan to the expedite the work for Chandani chowk flyover in the next one year though the expected completion period ends in January 2023.Gadkari said, “Given that this stretch attracts extremely heavy traffic, work needs to be completed on time. I have asked NHAI to ensure the new deadline can be advanced by a year as there has already been a delay due to various reasons including land acquisition process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gadkari-directs-nhai-to-expedite-chandani-chowk-flyover-work-bids-invited-for-katraj-flyover-101613231073290.html

He was caught from Samaypur Badli area in Delhi in a joint operation by Rohtak and Delhi police. We will bring him to Rohtak on production warrant and seek his remand.” “Prima facie it appears that the incident took place due to rivalry between the accused and head coach Manoj Kumar. We are collecting CCTV footage from the Jat College and nearby areas. The victims’ bodies have been handed over to their family members,” the SP added.On Friday evening, coach Manoj Kumar of Sonepat, his wife Sakshi, two NIS-certified coaches Satish Dalal of Jhajjar and Pardeep Malik of Rohtak, were shot dead along with national-level wrestler Pooja on the campus. Manoj’s three-year-old son Sartaj is in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, while the other injured, coach Amarjeet Singh, is undergoing treatment at Medanta hospital in Gurugram. Deceased couple belonged to a family of sportspersons Talking to Hindustan Times at the PGIMS mortuary, coach Manoj Kumar’s younger brother Parmoj Kumar, a commonwealth medalist in boxing, said his brother, Manoj, and sister-in-law, Sakshi, were national-level players. He added that their family had cordial relations with the accused. “Sukhvinder was working as a wrestling coach at the Jat College akhara. My brother, who was the head of the akhara, had asked Sukhvinder to leave the college after Pooja filed a complaint against him. Sukhvinder had strained relations with his wife and had started harassing Pooja. He had even asked Pooja to marry him following which she complained about him,” said Parmoj.Jat college principal Sangeeta Dalal, however, refuted claims that Sukhvinder worked at the institute. “Manoj Kumar was a coach at our institute but Sukhvinder was not on the rolls. He was a former student of the college. He may have visited our akhara for practice but he was not a coach here,” she maintained.An employee of the college, on the condition of anonymity, said that Manoj had barred Sukhvinder from visiting the akhara after Pooja filed a complaint against him.Meanwhile Pooja’s father, Ram Gopal, said his daughter had become a victim of rivalry between coaches. “My daughter was to return home to Mathura on Saturday. She had won two medals at national-level events. She had moved to Rohtak with an aim of becoming an international-level player. Despite financial constraints at home, I had ensured that my daughter’s practice never suffered. Unfortunately, she was caught in the rivalry between two coaches,” said Gopal. An NIS coach at Patiala, pleading anonymity, said the accused, Sukvinder, had obtained a diploma in coaching from NIS in 2017. “Satish Dalal was also in his batch and the two were good friends. While Dalal was a sincere person, Sukhvinder had behavioural issues,” he said, adding that Sukhvinder held grudges against Amarjeet (injured) as he had got him expelled from his previous akhara in Rohtak. Akhara sealed, players practice affected Meanwhile, the police have sealed the akhara where the firing took place. Over 100 players, including 20 national-level players, train here. The players said that the incident took place when the victims were having a meeting with Sukhvinder to sort out their differences. “We came to know about the incident when we heard Manoj Kumar’s son, Sartaj, screaming. After shooting at the victims, Sukhvinder had locked the doors of the meeting room and fled the spot,” said the players. They added that the incident had left them shocked, and their families were asking them to return home. PROFILES THE DECEASED: Manoj Kumar, 39, director of physical education (DPE), Sonepat He was a national-level player before being appointed the director of physical education at Jat College, Rohtak.

We need Trump-plus.”The South Carolina senator’s comments reflect the internal struggle facing the party after a minority of Republican senators sided with Democrats on Saturday and voted to convict Trump of inciting supporters to breach the Capitol, clash with police, and interfere with the certification of his election defeat by the Senate.Trump’s level of support among the GOP base will help determine his future role in the party. Graham said there’s no question Republicans need to work with Trump to win future elections and that he’ll be meeting him in Florida “next week.”“We can’t do it without him,” Graham said on “Fox News Sunday.”McConnell’s speech, in which the top Republican in the Senate denounced Trump as “practically and morally responsible” for the storming Capitol -- despite voting to acquit him on the impeachment charge -- was “an outlier” that will weigh on the party down the road, Graham said.“He got a load off his chest, obviously.” Graham said. “But unfortunately, he put a load on the back of Republicans. That speech you will see in 2022 campaigns.”Republicans who have crossed Trump, including House members who voted for his impeachment in January and the senators who joined Democrats in Saturday’s vote, have already met pushback from within the GOP.Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Richard Burr of North Carolina were both censured on Saturday by their state parties. Burr plans to retire from the Senate at the end of his term; Cassidy was re-elected in November and won’t face voters again until 2026.“I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” Cassidy said Saturday in a tweet.In another sign that Trump’s influence could live on, Graham predicted the former president’s daughter in law, Lara Trump, could run for Burr’s Senate seat in 2022.“I think she represents the future of the Republican Party,” Graham said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-alive-and-well-as-republican-party-force-says-lindsey-graham-101613324499020.html

However, the White House has expressed its deep concerns about the probe, saying the findings must be free from intervention by the Chinese government.The WHO appeared to back away from an outright rejection of the lab-leak theory on Friday. All avenues of research remain open, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing. In an interview with Face the Nation/CBS News broadcast on Sunday, Johnson said it’s vital to get to bottom of how the pandemic originated.“Was it in a - in a wet market? Did it come from the bats? Were the bats associated with the - the pangolins? All these questions are now matters of speculation,” he said. “We need to see the data. We need to see all the evidence. So I thoroughly support what President Biden has said about that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-thoroughly-supports-biden-over-call-for-china-to-release-covid-19-data-101613320941234.html

Walensky also said vaccinating teachers should be a priority.While the guidance did not mandate reopening, it said that schools should open “as safely and as quickly as possible,” weighing in on a prickly debate over how to educate children amid the coronavirus crisis that has often put teachers and local school districts at odds.“Our guidance is really dependent on how much disease is in the community,” since most transmission within schools is from staff-to-staff contact and when mask-wearing requirements are breached, Walensky said on NBC.In recent weeks, the pace of vaccinations has picked up in the US, with about 11% of the population having received the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-let-down-guard-on-virus-cdc-head-warns-amid-lethal-covid-19-strain-101613318770735.html
14-02-2021||World||Doctors who say no to opioid use face threats from patients||One patient threatened to shoot Dr. Terry Hunt if physical therapy didn't relieve his pain as effectively as opioids did. Another harassed his staff, then roamed a hospital searching for Hunt after being told he would be weaned off painkillers he had used inappropriately.Hunt was unharmed, but shaken enough to ask the central Illinois hospital system where he worked to dismiss both patients.So when he heard about Tuesday's attack at a medical clinic in Buffalo, Minnesota, that left one person dead and four injured, “the first thing I assumed is that it was something to do with pain medication,” said Hunt, who now works for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and a Mayo Clinic Health System facility in Red Wing, Minnesota. “It makes us ask about our own workplace: How secure are we?”Authorities said Gregory Paul Ulrich, 67, was angry about his medical treatment before he shot five workers and detonated three apparent pipe bombs at an Allina Health clinic. A police report says he had threatened a similar mass shooting in 2018, allegedly as revenge against people who he said “tortured” him with back surgeries and prescribed medication.A former roommate said Ulrich became upset when a doctor stopped prescribing painkillers, and that Ulrich also used other drugs and had untreated mental health issues. Law enforcement and the health system have not addressed the specifics of Ulrich’s treatment or medications.Doctors who treat pain say threats of violence escalated markedly in recent years as mounting legal and regulatory pressure stemming from the deadly opioid epidemic led many to prescribe alternatives and taper their patients off addictive painkillers.While some patients benefit from careful use of opioids, and doctors don't want to stigmatize them, many would be better off treating pain with other therapies, experts say. But many become addicted to the drugs that are usually intended for short-term use following surgeries.“It hijacks their brain,” said Dr. Carrie DeLone, regional medical director at Penn State Health Community Medical Group. “They don't see themselves as having a problem.”Pain specialist Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a professor at Braindeis University and a founder of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said patients are convinced that opioids are treating their underlying problem because if they try to go without a dose or as their previous dose wears off, “they’re feeling horrible, agonizing pain,” when it can be the withdrawal that is causing pain hypersensitivity.“It’s much easier to give the patient what they want. You write the prescription ... they walk out the door happy and there are no problems. To try and help a patient taper down ... is much harder,” Kolodny said.And when a doctor says no, things can turn ugly.“We’ve had patients waiting for doctors in parking lots to harass them. We’ve had them say ‘We’re going to shoot you’ or ‘We’re going to burn your house down,’” DeLone said.Almost half of pain specialists surveyed during a violence education session at a 2019 American Academy of Pain Medicine meeting cited opioid management as the reason they had been threatened, said Dr. W. Michael Hooten, president-elect of the organization.In response to threats, doctors have dismissed patients. But they have also installed alarm systems and panic buttons and set up exams rooms so doctors are closest to the door. Some even advocate carrying weapons, said Hooten, noting that smaller clinics are at greatest risk because they might not be able to afford security.After his 2018 threat, police took Ulrich for a mental health evaluation, and Allina took legal action to bar him from the company’s property. A restraining order prohibited Ulrich from contact with the doctor or going into the clinic and nearby Allina-run Buffalo Hospital, where he once frightened a nurse so much that a colleague hit a panic button for help.Police said they had had no recent interactions with Ulrich that would have raised alarms before the attack in Buffalo, a small city about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis.St. Joseph County, Indiana, Prosecutor Ken Cotter said he didn't know that such threats were common until 2017, when a man shot and killed a doctor who refused to prescribe opioids to his wife. Michael Jarvis ambushed Dr. Todd Graham in a parking lot hours after the appointment, said Cotter, adding there was evidence that Jarvis also was using opioids. Jarvis took his own life soon after.Before that, “I do not recall ever reading a threat report” from a doctor, said Cotter, who said he received calls from about 20 doctors after the shooting telling him how common they were. “They took (threats) as a cost of doing business.”Cotter said about a dozen meetings were held with doctors, law enforcement officials and others to discuss how to keep doctors safe, including deescalating tense situations, but also alternatives to opioids, disposal of old medications, and tackling the addiction problems that plague their communities.“When you've got doctors calling to say we have to do something, this is ... literally our whole community's crusade,” Cotter said.Kolodny, from Brandeis, said he has been compared to Hitler, threatened on Twitter, and a bag of nails was mailed to his home. Last month, protesters carried signs near his office demanding that he be fired because of his work advocating less opioid use and helping to sue opioid manufacturers.“The threats have “gotten really scary,” he said. “It’s just gotten really heated up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctors-who-say-no-to-opioid-use-face-threats-from-patients-101613317891641.html
14-02-2021||World||WHO’s Wuhan probe found signs of much wider Covid-19 outbreak in 2019: Report||The team of experts sent to China’s Wuhan to probe the origin of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reportedly discovered several signs of a much wider outbreak in December 2019 than it was reported earlier. In an interview with CNN, World Health Organization (WHO) expert Peter Ben Embarek said that the investigators are seeking access to hundreds of thousands of blood samples from the Chinese city that Beijing has not allowed them to examine.According to Embarek, the team also established that there were already over a dozen strains of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, circulating in December. “The virus was circulating widely in Wuhan in December, which is a new finding,” the head of the WHO-led team was quoted by the US media network as saying.In December 2019, the UN health agency had picked up a media report about a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause emerging in China’s Wuhan. The virus outbreak was later identified as a novel coronavirus and China shared its genetic sequence with the WHO in early January. However, many scientists studying the origin of Covid-19 had indicated that the virus may have been spreading in China long before it was officially reported.The Chinese scientists presented the visiting WHO team with 174 Covid-19 cases detected from in and around Wuhan in December 2019. The WHO food safety expert said the number suggests that the virus could have infected more than 1,000 people in Wuhan in that month, given around “15 per cent end up severe cases” that had been noticed by Chinese doctors but the “vast majority are mild cases.”Read | 'Deep concerns' about WHO Covid-19 report from China: White HouseDuring the interview, Embarek noted that broadening the type of genetic samples from early Covid-19 cases allowed them to examine partial genetic samples as well, instead of only the complete ones. He said that the scientists gathered 13 different genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019, which could provide significant clues about the origin and scale of the outbreak if they are able to examine it along with wider patient data from 2019.“Some of them are from the markets...some of them are not linked to the markets," the expert was quoted as saying by CNN.Over 108 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 2.4 million related deaths have been reported from across the globe, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center of Johns Hopkins University & Medicine. The United States remains the worst-hit country in terms of absolute numbers, with more than 27 million reported cases of coronavirus and over 484,000 related deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whos-wuhan-probe-found-signs-of-much-wider-covid-19-outbreak-in-2019-report-101613315826615.html

14-02-2021||World||Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada killed in Pakistan ‘months ago’: Reports||Conflicting reports emerged on Sunday about the fate of Afghan Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, with a section of the Afghan media reporting that he was killed in a blast in Pakistan’s Balochistan province last year.However, senior Taliban leader Ahmadullah Wasiq described the reports of Akhundzada’s death as “false news and baseless rumours” and contended the Taliban chief was alive.If the reports of Akhundzada’s death are accurate, he will be the third Taliban chief after Mullah Omar and Mullah Akhtar Mansour to have died in Pakistan.Akhundzada was killed with Mullah Matiullah, the Taliban’s intelligence chief, and Hafiz Abdul Majeed, the group’s head of finance, in a blast at a safe house in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, “months ago”, Hasht-e-Subh newspaper reported, citing its sources.The house belonged to Majeed. While Akhundzada and Matiullah were killed almost instantly, Majeed died “two or three days later in a Pakistani military hospital”, the report said.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the blast was believed to have occurred in April 2020. The people confirmed that the blast had occurred in a house belonging to Majeed. They added that some more senior Taliban leaders were believed to have been killed in the blast.Hours after the reports of Akhundzada’s death spread on Sunday, senior Taliban leader Ahmadullah Wasiq said on Twitter: “This is false news and baseless rumours have no truth. Spreading such rumours and false news is a failed propaganda attempt by the enemy's intelligence services. The enemy wants to hide its defeats in such rumours and distract the people’s minds.”There have been reports in the past of Akhundzada’s death that have proved to be inaccurate.However, it is not unknown for the Taliban to hide the death of its leaders. Mullah Omar’s death in Pakistan in 2013 was kept hidden from the public by the Taliban for about two years. The group confirmed the death in July 2015 only after Afghanistan’s spy agency went public with the development.Mullah Omar’s successor, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, was killed in a US drone strike in Balochistan, in May 2016. Akhundzada was named the new head of the Taliban days later.Akhundzada’s brother Hafiz Ahmadullah was killed with three others in a blast at a mosque located 25 km from Quetta on August 16, 2019. Akhundzada’s son was injured in the incident. The mosque was frequented by Afghan Taliban members and Akhundzada himself used to lead prayers there, reports at the time had said.It is no secret that scores of top Afghan Taliban leaders are based in Pakistan. The top leadership council is called the “Quetta Shura” because most of its members are based in Quetta.During Taliban deputy leader Abdul Ghani Baradar’s visit to Pakistan in December, video footage emerged that showed him acknowledging that the group makes all decisions related to the Afghan peace talks after consulting its leadership and clerics’ council based in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-chief-haibatullah-akhundzada-killed-in-pakistan-months-ago-reports-101613312039343.html

We have to carry out a protest action that riot police can’t stop and that anyone can join.”President Vladimir Putin said he can understand why people support the recent rallies, according to his meeting with the chief editors of major media outlets broadcast on state television Sunday.“Irritation is growing, there are many problems, there is not enough money,” Putin said. He referred to Navalny only as a “figure” that was being used by Europe, the US and other countries to destabilize Russia.The flashmob, which organizers call “Love is more powerful than fear,” started in the Russian Far East, Volkov said in his Twitter post, showing a photo of a group of people with the lights on the Bering Island. Navalny’s team accounts posted similar photos from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and other Far East regions.Front RowNavalny himself only posted a photo with his wife, Yulia, on Instagram, with the message: “I love you. And all the jokes I make in the courts, I make only for you to laugh in the first row.”Russia has 11 time zones, so the event should reach the capital, Moscow, in several hours. The organizers didn’t have information on how many people took part in the flashmob so far.Riot police detained more than 11,000 when protesters took to the streets in dozens of cities on Jan. 23 and 31. The largest nationwide protests in a decade came after police detained Navalny when he returned to Moscow last month from Berlin, where he’d been recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he and Western governments blamed on Putin’s security service. The Kremlin denies responsibility.The flashmob takes place as the European Union works on a proposal to sanction Russia over the imprisonment of Navalny, according to two people familiar with the discussions. A Moscow court jailed the opposition leader for two years and 8 months Feb. 2 for breaching probation terms from a 2014 fraud conviction while he was recovering in Germany.Navalny’s allies have urged the EU, the UK and the US to sanction 35 top Russian officials and business figures close to the Kremlin. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Friday that Russia is ready to break off ties with the EU if the bloc imposes sanctions that damage the nation’s economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-opposition-holds-valentine-s-day-flashmob-protest-for-alexei-navalny-101613308651905.html

Trump’s impeachment trial was already a historic event as he was the first US president to face a second impeachment trial and the first former president ever to face an impeachment trial. However, these two firsts were achieved by Trump even before the Senate voted on the one article of impeachment - “Incitement of Insurrection”.In the previous impeachment trial, Trump administration was accused of withholding $400 million in military aid, approved by Congress and the Pentagon, to Ukraine and pressurising President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. On February 5, 2020, Trump was acquitted from the charges and Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican member who voted to convict the president on one charge of "Abuse of Power”.Although the former president was once again acquitted by the Senate on the charges of “Incitement of Insurrection”, it was a historic rebuke of a president by his own party as seven Republican senators joined Democrats to convict Trump. The evenly split US Senate voted 57-43 in favour of the article of impeachment, falling 10 votes short of the two-thirds of the Senate required to convict the Republican leader.Read | Donald Trump indicates active public life after second impeachment acquittalThe seven Republicans, who joined all Democrats, and two independent senators to vote in favour of Trump’s conviction were Susan Collins, Patrick J Toomey, Richard Burr, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse, Bill Cassidy and Mitt Romney. It was in sharp contrast with the past impeachment votes when the party rallied behind its president to help him acquit of all the charges.Apart from Trump, only two presidents, Andrew Johnson (1868) and Bill Clinton (1998), have faced impeachment trial in Senate. While Johnson, a Democrat, was acquitted with the help of seven Republicans voting against the conviction, all 45 Democrats rallied behind Clinton to acquit him of impeachment charges. In this context, Trump’s impeachment vote was the most bipartisan ever in favour of a president’s conviction and removal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-trump-s-acquittal-a-historic-rebuke-by-his-own-party-101613308045251.html
14-02-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson to host virtual meeting of G7 leaders||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to host fellow G7 leaders for a virtual meeting on February 19 ahead of its presidency of a summit in June of the Group of Seven countries including the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US, Downing Street said on Sunday.The virtual meeting, the first hosted by Johnson as part of the UK’s G7 Presidency this year and the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, will bring together the world leaders to discuss how leading democracies can work together to ensure equitable distribution of coronavirus vaccines around the world and prevent future pandemics.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the G7 Summit in Cornwall in June after India was invited as a guest country by the UK, alongside South Korea and Australia.“The solutions to the challenges we face – from the colossal mission to get vaccines to every single country, to the fight to reverse the damage done to our ecosystems and lead a sustainable recovery from coronavirus – lie in the discussions we have with our friends and partners around the world,” said Johnson.“Quantum leaps in science have given us the vaccines we need to end this pandemic for good. Now world governments have a responsibility to work together to put those vaccines to the best possible use. I hope 2021 will be remembered as the year humanity worked together like never before to defeat a common foe,” he said.The G7 leaders’ meeting on February 19 will be attended by the leaders of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US, and the Presidents of the European Council and the EU Commission.Downing Street said Johnson plans to use the virtual meeting, which will also be US President Joe Biden’s first major multilateral engagement, to call for leaders to work together on a “joined-up global approach” to pandemics that brings an end to the nationalist and divisive politics that marred the initial response to coronavirus.He will argue that putting citizens first should not come at the expense of working on a unified response, and that the last 12 months of the pandemic have showed that no country can be safe until every country is safe from the pandemic.The rollout of vaccines offers a fresh opportunity to demonstrate the value of international cooperation, he is expected to highlight.“International pandemic preparedness will be a major priority for the UK’s G7 Presidency and the Prime Minister will work with fellow G7 leaders to implement his five-point plan to prevent future pandemics announced at the UN General Assembly last year,” Downing Street said.The five-point plan includes a worldwide network of zoonotic research hubs, developing global manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines, the design of a global pandemic early warning system, the agreement of global protocols for a future health emergency and the reduction of trade barriers.There have already been positive steps to ensure equitable access to a coronavirus vaccine. Last month, the US announced it would join the COVAX initiative, becoming the final G7 country to do so.COVAX will provide developing countries with 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine this year and the UK is providing 548 million pounds to the scheme.Plans for the virtual meeting next week come as UK Chancellor of Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey held the first meeting of G7 Finance Ministers on Friday.During February, the UK also holds the Presidency of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which rotates between members every month.The UK has said it will use its Presidency to galvanise international action on coronavirus, climate change and conflict.On February 23, the UK Prime Minister will chair a virtual meeting of the UNSC on the link between climate change and conflict, marking the first time a UK Prime Minister has chaired a Security Council session since 1992.The session will also involve permanent UNSC members China, France, Russia and the US; non-permanent members Estonia, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Niger, Norway, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam; and the UN Secretary General.Downing Street has said that discussions at the meeting will inform crucial action ahead of the UK-hosted COP26 Summit scheduled for Glasgow in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-to-host-virtual-meeting-of-g7-leaders-101613306295406.html

The use of drone’s technology would be displayed towards the end of this month at few points on the motorways.The project was discussed at the National Highways and Motorways Police (NHMP) headquarters on Friday during a virtual conference attended by officers of the force from across the country.The meeting also discussed a five-year plan for catering to future requirements and demands of the motorway police for its modernisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-use-drones-to-monitor-motorways-highways-101613303914623.html
14-02-2021||World||Biden aide Cedric Richmond feels heat from all sides on White House equality vow||As President Joe Biden seeks to address racial inequities across the US, he’s turned to former congressman Cedric Richmond to help keep a promise to end discriminatory practices ranging from housing to voting rights -- a task complicated by the risk of alienating Republicans whose support is needed on key legislative priorities.Richmond, a Louisiana lawmaker who led the Congressional Black Caucus during the Trump administration, heads Biden’s Office of Public Engagement. There, he’s the counterpart for outside groups and activists ready to hold the president accountable for his pledge to address the nation’s deep-seated racial divisions.Together with his promise to fight inequality across all policies, Biden campaigned on healing the nation’s political rifts and working across the aisle to restore civility in Washington. But many Republicans have rejected the president’s call to address racial disparities -- and even the notion that institutionalized racism exists -- setting up a potentially persistent conflict for Richmond to negotiate.“We’re listening to everybody and we’re going to take input, but that doesn’t mean that we’re going to compromise our values,” Richmond said in an interview. “I’ll just give you one old African proverb as a way to think about it: When two elephants fight only the grass suffers. And so we want to make sure that the people are not the grass -- that you have endless fighting and they never get help.”Biden has staked his presidency on bringing the coronavirus pandemic to heel and reinvigorating the U.S. economy after the crisis dealt a disproportionate blow to minorities.But aside from immediate relief, civil rights groups demand structural changes that would help address racial economic disparities and rights going forward. That includes passing a new voting rights law to expand ballot access, even as Republican legislatures attempt to enact measures that would tighten rules on voting -- moves that would disproportionately affect minority groups, their advocates say.“It’s important that President Biden has named racism as one of the crises that he must attack, along with Covid, along with the climate crisis and the economy,” said Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project National Office, a civil rights group. “And so our task, as the outside groups, is to make sure that they are being real on their commitment.”As the main conduit between Biden and outside liberal groups pushing to undo former President Donald Trump’s policies and advance a progressive agenda, Richmond will deal with issues ranging from unequal health care to police brutality. Other important administration figures on those issues, Dianis said, include Catherine Lhamon, who’s in charge of racial justice and equity on the Domestic Policy Council; Kristen Clarke, Biden’s nominee for assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division; and Vanita Gupta, his nominee as associate attorney general.“I might be what my dad used to call a jack of all trades, a master of none. In baseball terminology, more of a utility player,” said Richmond, a former college ballplayer who helped Democrats dominate Republicans in their annual charity game.‘Transformational President’Biden, Richmond recounted, “said over and over on the campaign trail that he wants to be a very transformational president, that he wants to empower groups that generally were not empowered. And he wants his legacy to be that of the most empowering president to ever govern.”Biden made significant moves in his first weeks in office, issuing directives to rescind Trump’s ban on diversity training for federal workers, prevent discrimination in housing and end the use of private prisons. The president has infused his pandemic response with measures to address the virus’s out-sized toll on Black and Brown Americans, and has outlined plans to invest $150 billion in minority-owned small businesses and increase spending for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.Richmond said these early steps are a key signal to the public that Biden’s pledge to work toward equity was serious.“That is a big deal. That means we are looking for and watching and being intentional about equity throughout government. So that means advertising, procurement, that means education,” Richmond said in an interview. “But even within our Covid package and Covid response, so far we’ve done it through a lens of racial equity, too.”Richmond, 47, graduated from Morehouse College, a Historically Black College and University in Atlanta, before earning his law degree from Tulane University in New Orleans.He was first elected to Louisiana’s House of Representatives when he was 26 years old, and served for 11 years before being elected to the U.S. House in 2010. He chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2017 to 2019 -- a period characterized by deep racial strife as Trump’s divisive rhetoric helped fuel a resurgence of white supremacism.Under Richmond’s leadership, the caucus delivered a 125-page report to Trump rebutting his “what have you got to lose?” pitch to Black voters during his 2016 campaign. The report was titled: “We Have a Lot to Lose: Solutions to Advance Black Families in the 21st Century.”The group champions many of the issues on Biden’s agenda, such as criminal justice reform, eliminating health disparities and addressing the wealth gap. But Richmond can also help Biden reach across the aisle; as a lawmaker, he cultivated relationships with key Republicans including Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking GOP member in the House, who calls Richmond a “close friend.”Voting-Rights BattleRepublicans have already signaled that an uphill battle awaits Biden’s initiatives on race.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to allow a floor vote on the voting rights bill when his party controlled the chamber under Trump. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas has taken issue with Biden’s plan to end systemic housing discrimination and boost home ownership in communities of color.“Is it ever appropriate for the government to treat people differently based on their race?” Cotton asked during a confirmation hearing for Marcia Fudge, Biden’s nominee for secretary for Housing and Urban Development.And Republican Senator Rand Paul said that Biden’s inaugural address, which focused heavily on inequality, amounted to an allegation that Republicans were racist.But Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist, said Biden and Richmond may be able to win “surprise” Republican votes on some equity measures. For example, he said former Alabama Senator Doug Jones, whom he previously worked for, cosponsored legislation with Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, on reviving cold cases from the Civil Rights era.In Richmond, Biden has “an astute politician” who can manage the challenge, said James Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House.Clyburn -- who is largely credited with saving Biden’s faltering campaign when he endorsed him ahead of South Carolina’s Democratic primary -- was instrumental in introducing Biden to Richmond, leading to the prominent White House role. Clyburn is a powerful political figure among Black Americans and civil rights groups and said he expects Richmond to be involved in all major policy discussions at the White House.“He will make a very effective adviser to the president,” Clyburn said, cautioning Biden to heed Richmond’s counsel. “If he doesn’t, he’ll hear from me.”Biden has signaled he has no intention of defining Richmond’s role narrowly or limiting him to inequality issues. On February 5, for example, Richmond was part of an Oval Office meeting to discuss the pandemic relief package with House Democrats.Richmond is “a young man but a seasoned politician,” said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League and former mayor of New Orleans, who has known Biden’s aide since his political career began two decades ago.“The president needs him around the table on every big decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-aide-cedric-richmond-feels-heat-from-all-sides-on-white-house-equality-vow-101613302210573.html

Another patient from the area was hospitalized in the capital, bringing the total number of potential cases to eight, the news site reported, citing the head of the National Health Security Agency, Sakoba Keita.World Health Organization Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said in a tweet Sunday it’s preparing to stem the outbreak.Guinea, the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, was at the epicenter of the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa.A nurse who fell ill in late January and was buried on Feb. 1 was identified as the first case in the country since then, according to Guineenews.Following the nurse’s funeral, eight people have tested positive and a ninth patient is awaiting results, according to a government official contacted Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ebola-deaths-rise-to-four-in-guinea-as-disease-flares-again-101613301095628.html
14-02-2021||World||Saudi Arabia will continue to treat Houthis as terrorists: Saudi UN representative||Saudi Arabia will continue to treat Yemen's Houthis as a terrorist organisation despite a US decision to lift the designation on the group, according to the kingdom's permanent representative to the United Nations.There has been no other official response from Riyadh to the announcement on Friday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday that Washington would, effective Feb. 16, lift the terrorist group designation."Despite this, we will still deal with the Houthi militia as a terrorist organisation and address its threats with military action," Abdullah Al-Muallami, told Saudi-owned Asharq News in remarks retweeted by the kingdom's UN mission on Saturday.The Saudi government media office CIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment on the decision.However, on Sunday several commentators at state-controlled media outlets criticised the US decision, saying it would only embolden the Iran-aligned Houthis, who have recently stepped up attacks against Saudi Arabia."A clear contradiction exists between the new administration's claim to support the kingdom's security and its soft approach with the Houthis," wrote Hamoud Abu Talib in Okaz newspaper on Sunday.Fellow columnist Fahim al-Hamid, also writing in Okaz, said the decision was a "gift" to the Houthis and Iran that "sends the wrong signals".The Houthis, battling a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015, last week claimed several drone attacks on southern Saudi Arabia. Most were intercepted but one hit a civilian airport on Wednesday.The White House condemned the attack, and Blinken held a phone call with his Saudi counterpart to discuss joint efforts towards bolstering Saudi defences and diplomacy to end the Yemen conflict, seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Biden's administration has said it would halt US support for the Saudi-backed military campaign but continue to pressure the Houthis, who control northern Yemen after ousting the Saudi-backed government from power in the capital, Sanaa.Riyadh accuses Iran of supplying arms and training to the Houthis, a charge denied by the group and Tehran.Describing lifting the designation as a "terrible mistake", Saudi columnist Mohammed Al Al-Sheikh wrote in Al Jazirah newspaper, that Biden should build on his predecessor's "maximum pressure" campaign on Tehran, which saw Washington re-impose sanctions on Iran after quitting a 2015 international nuclear pact. Riyadh backed that policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-will-continue-to-treat-houthis-as-terrorists-un-representative-101613299878603.html

Wahid Qatali said first responders were quickly overwhelmed Saturday by the huge, out-of-control fire. “When each cylinder was exploding it was flying 100s of meters high,” he told The Associated Press.Two explosions at the border crossing were powerful enough to be spotted from space by NASA satellites. One blast erupted around 1:10 p.m. Afghan time (0840 GMT), the next around a half-hour later at 1:42 p.m. local (0912 GMT).The United States allows Afghanistan to import fuel and oil from Iran as part of a special concession that exempts Kabul from US sanctions against Iran. Satellite photos taken Saturday before the explosion showed dozens of tankers parked at the border crossing.Qatali said officials were concerned that windy conditions Sunday could fan the flames and spread the fire to even more fuel-laden trucks in the area. He said the government was able to save more than 1,200 trucks.Herat's chamber of commerce and industries chief Younus Qazizada said the explosion and fire started when provincial customs employees were inspecting a gas tanker. But an investigation into the cause of the fire continued Sunday.“If the government would have invested the income of a single day of customs (tariffs) in the firefighting department this chaos wouldn't have happened,” Qazizada said.Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency reported an estimated USD 50 million loss of goods and consignments in the catastrophe. Qazizada estimated the losses were twice that much.Qatali, the provincial governor, said the investigative team will inspect video footage of the area but Wakel Ahmad Karokhi, a Herat provincial council member, said the customs facility was entirely consumed by the fire.The fire spread Saturday to the Dogharoon customs facilities on the Iranian side of the border and first responders — including the fire department, the Iranian army and border forces — were assisting in extinguishing the blaze, according to Iranian state television. The Afghan side of the border crossing has its own fire department, but officials in Herat said they were never in control of the blaze.Iran sent 15 firefighting units to the Afghanistan side to help.The Islam Qala border crossing is around 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of the city of Herat and is a major transit route between Afghanistan and Iran.The Afghan government is working on an alternative to resume trade between the two countries, as Afghanistan is mostly dependent on imported goods from neighboring countries. Iran officials say that they will accelerate the custom process at other border crossings with Afghanistan.The fire continued to burn Sunday and the explosions shut down the power grid between Iran and Afghanistan, leaving Herat in the dark, said Wahidullah Tawhidi, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Power Supply.According to ISNA, Iranian authorities allowed 2,000 trucks to move into the Iranian side from Islam Qala to prevent further damage. Seven of the injured were transferred to hospitals inside Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firefighters-battle-afghan-iran-border-blaze-for-a-second-day-101613298068236.html
14-02-2021||World||Myanmar anti-coup protesters keep pressure on junta||Vast numbers of people all over Myanmar flouted orders against demonstrations Sunday to march again in protest against the military takeover that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Large demonstrations were held in the major cities of Yangon, Mandalay and the capital, Naypyitaw, as well as in far-flung areas dominated by ethnic minorities.Protesters in Yangon again rallied outside the Chinese and U.S. embassies. They accuse Beijing of propping up the military regime and applaud Washington’s actions sanctioning the military.“The civil disobedience movement and demonstrations show that the people of Myanmar want democracy. We stand with them,” said a statement Saturday on the U.S. Embassy’s Twitter account.Other protesters carried signs urging people to boycott businesses linked to the military.Civil servants have been very active in the protests, and social media postings on Sunday indicated that state railway workers have joined them, with some unconfirmed claims that they have gone on strike.The military seized power on Feb. 1, detaining Suu Kyi and members of her government and preventing recently elected lawmakers from opening a new session of Parliament.The junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, said it was forced to step in because the government failed to properly investigate allegations of fraud in last year’s election, which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won in a landslide. The state election commission refuted that contention, saying there is no evidence to support it.Eight days of street demonstrations are estimated to have drawn hundreds of thousands of people to the streets despite the threat of six months' imprisonment for violating an order banning gatherings of five or more people. The same order imposes an 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew.Protesters also have reason to fear for their personal safety, as police have used rubber bullets to try to break up some demonstrations. A 19-year-old woman who was shot in the head with what experts said was live ammunition at a protest in Naypyitaw was on life support in a hospital and was not expected to recover.Tributes to the woman were held Sunday by protesters in Yangon and Mandalay, Myanmar's second-biggest city.Public concern is also rising at what many charge is the military’s manipulation of criminals released from prison to carry out violence and instill panic.The government last week declared an amnesty that led to the release of more than 23,000 convicts. There are many claims on social media that some have been recruited by the authorities to carry out violent activities at night in residential areas to spread panic, especially by setting fires. Some areas have set up their own neighborhood watch groups in response.The truth of the allegations about government-directed thugs is difficult to verify, even with videos claiming to show their activities. There is historical precedent, as the military released convicts to carry out violence and cause chaos in 1988 during a failed popular uprising against a military dictatorship.There was already outrage at nighttime raids during the curfew period in which security personnel have tried to seize people from their homes.In several cases, neighbors and others people rushed to the scene in such numbers that security forces abandoned their attempts to haul in their targets. Videos of such raids were widely posted on social media.Detainees have included political leaders, government officials, civil servants, activists and student leaders. Medical personnel have been singled out because their community initiated the civil disobedience campaign against the military takeover and remains in its vanguard.The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says 384 people have been detained since the coup, with 360 still being held. Suu Kyi remains under house arrest, but a remand order holding her on a minor charge of possessing unregistered imported walkie-talkies expires Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-anti-coup-protesters-keep-pressure-on-junta-101613298953809.html

The World Bank, which helped fund the first batch of doses, has said it would monitor the inoculation drive to ensure the shots go to those most in need."I will not be receiving the vaccine today, for today is not my turn and the priority is for the medical sector that has done its duty and presented big sacrifices," caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab told reporters at the Rafik Hariri hospital, where Lebanon's first coronavirus case was quarantined about a year ago.Also read| New Zealand’s Auckland goes into three-day lockdownTizani, who is better known by his stage name Abou Salim, encouraged everyone to get the vaccine."For those who are afraid to get vaccinated, I swear by God, it is protection for them," he said.The country has also booked 2.7 million doses through the global COVAX scheme for poorer countries and officials say talks are underway for some 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.The total number of doses ordered so far would cover about half of Lebanon's population of more than six million, which includes at least a million Syrian refugees.Lebanon has been under a 24-hour curfew for nearly a month, although the government began lifting some restrictions this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-starts-covid-19-vaccination-drive-pm-says-will-wait-for-his-turn-101613292599429.html

All have risen to the call of public service and have been key agents in shaping politics and policy from a local to global scale. Their leadership will impact generations to come, Indiaspora said in an email.“It is incredible to see over 200 leaders from 15 countries answer the call of seva and public service. They represent over 550 million constituents," Indiaspora Founder M R Rangaswami, a Silicon Valley-based entrepreneur and investor told PTI.The list will be unveiled on Monday, he said.“It is a huge source of pride to have the first woman and first person of colour as the Vice President of the world's oldest democracy be someone of Indian heritage,” said Rangaswami.“We wanted to use this seminal moment on President's Day to highlight a host of others in the diaspora who also are in public service,” he said.The Indiaspora list highlights the accomplishments of leaders of the Indian diaspora from across industries and sectors.“With each list, we pay tribute to leaders from a specific area, whether business, government, philanthropy, academics, or to the leaders of the next generation.

14-02-2021||World||Indian fraudster sentenced to two years in US federal prison||A 32-year-old Indian national who played a key role in a telemarketing fraud scheme has been sentenced to two years in federal prison, the Department of Justice has said.Manish Kumar, was arrested by FBI agents on August 24, 2019, as he deplaned in New York City from a flight from India and ordered detention in federal custody. He pleaded guilty on November 5, 2020, to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, four counts of wire fraud, and two counts of aggravated identity theft.He was sentenced on Thursday to 24 months in federal prison to be followed by three years supervised release, and to pay restitution in the amount of USD5,000.As part of the investigation, FBI was able to intercept some of the fraudulently obtained funds and return them directly to victims, making additional restitution unnecessary.Kumar previously admitted to the court that he directed telephone calls to call centers in India as part of a scheme to mislead individuals into believing that their computers were infected by malware, and to buy computer protection services from call center operators.The call centers perpetuated the falsehood that malware had been detected on the callers’ computer, convincing callers to provide payment information to purchase putative technical support services. No putative services were provided, federal prosecutors alleged.“As part of the scheme, those who had been misled, were later victimised again. Call center operators called back and told the victims that they were entitled to refunds. The operators would then mislead the victims into believing that they had accidentally been sent far in excess of the refund amounts and urged the victims to return the overage,” the Department of Justice said.“Because no funds had actually been sent to the victims, in “returning” the overage, the victims were actually parting with more of their own money,” it said, adding that Kumar admitted to providing money routing services for this component of the scheme.Kumar provided the call center operators with a bank account in the United States, where the victim money would be sent and then forwarded to Kumar and his coconspirators.Additionally, Kumar admitted that he had obtained information sufficient to place charges on thirty-seven credit card accounts of US residents and had taken steps to have fraudulent charges placed on those accounts, the Department of Justice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-fraudster-sentenced-to-two-years-in-us-federal-prison-101613293923671.html

Tokyo police said they couldn't comment on how many people attended the event.The march came as tens of thousands took to the streets of Myanmar on Sunday in a ninth straight day of protests. Several demonstrations have been held in Japan since the Feb. 1 coup, mainly by Myanmar residents of Japan.While the detention of elected leader Suu Kyi is currently due to end on Monday, the coup has been denounced by Western countries, with the United States announcing some sanctions on the ruling generals. While other countries also considering measures, Japan and some other Asian nations are unlikely to cut ties given Myanmar's strategic importance in the region.Also read| Myanmar army ask locals to report visitors as cops hunt for protesters"It is very heart-rending," said Thant Zaw Htun, 45, originally from Yangon and now an employee at a recruitment agency, referring to the protests in Myanmar."I want to go back to Myanmar to join them but cannot because of the situation (travel ban due to the coronavirus pandemic). Instead, I join here today to do what I can do."While some carried portraits of Suu Kyi, others wore face masks and even earrings bearing Suu Kyi's image. Most remained silent rather than shout slogans as they marched in an effort to prevent spread of the coronavirus."As a Myanmar national, I absolutely cannot accept the military's coup in Myanmar," said Thwe Thwe Tun, 27, who works at a construction company."I think all Myanmar people in Japan have the same opinion."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-march-in-tokyo-to-protest-myanmar-coup-biggest-japan-demonstration-101613293232257.html

The government hopes to secure enough supplies for the whole populace - some 126 million people - by mid-year.Much of Japan is still under a state of emergency after its third and most deadly wave of the virus hit late last year. Cases and fatalities have trended lower in the past couple of weeks and Tokyo logged just under 400 cases in the capital on Sunday. Japan has so far recorded about 410,000 coronavirus cases nationally and 6,772 deaths. The Olympic Games are due to start July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-approves-its-first-covid-19-vaccine-developed-by-pfizer-101613292652965.html
14-02-2021||World||Spain: Catalans to vote in test of separatist movement||Voting has started in Spain’s northeastern Catalonia on Sunday as 5.3 million voters are called to cast ballots in a regional election that will test the region’s secessionist movement.Salvador Illa, who was in charge of Spain’s coronavirus response as its health minister until last month, will lead the ticket of the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. Illa is hoping to end the hold pro-independence lawmakers have held in the regional parliament for the past decade.Polls, however, predict a tight race between the Socialists and the two leading pro-secession parties, the left-wing Republic Left of Catalonia and the center-right Together for Catalonia.The goal of separatists is to not only maintain their slim majority of the Catalan parliament based in Barcelona, but also try to break the 50% barrier of the popular vote for the first time.The wealthy region, with its own language spoken alongside Spanish, has been the source of Spain’s biggest political crisis in decades since separatists leaders failed in a 2017 secession bid in defiance of court warnings it was unconstitutional. Several of those leaders ended up in prison, while others fled to other European countries.With Spain still suffering from a post-Christmas spike in coronavirus infections, the vote is being held under strict health regulations. Voters must wear face masks, use the hand disinfectant provided at polling stations, and remain at least 1.5 meters apart while queuing.Those particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 are encouraged to vote between 9 a.m. and noon. The general population is supposed to vote from noon until 7 p.m. That leaves the final hour until polls close at 8 p.m. for voters who are either infected or quarantined due to recent contact with an infected person.Preliminary results are expected to start being announced by government officials around 10:00pm, but a record number of mail-in votes may mean the full results will take longer than usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-catalans-to-vote-in-test-of-separatist-movement-101613291886719.html
14-02-2021||World||New Zealand’s Auckland goes into three-day lockdown||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a short lockdown for its largest city Auckland while authorities investigate three new cases of Covid-19 in the community.Auckland will enter a three-day lockdown at midnight, Ardern said at a news conference Sunday after an emergency Cabinet meeting. The alert level for the remainder of New Zealand will rise to 2, which requires social distancing and signals the risk of community transmission. Cabinet will meet again on Monday.“These new cases pose questions,” Ardern said. “We need to act with a high degree of caution” because they could be one of the more virulent strains, she said.It is the second regional lockdown in New Zealand since Aucklanders were asked to isolate at home for about three weeks in August. That outbreak was successfully contained and eliminated, and New Zealanders have enjoyed a summer free of any restrictions until now.Also read| Covid-19: Post-vaccine symptoms more common in young than elderly, says studyEarlier Sunday, the Ministry of Health reported three new cases of Covid-19 in a family from South Auckland -- a mother, father and daughter. It is not yet clear how they contracted the virus. In addition to visiting local shops, two of the people traveled to the city of New Plymouth last weekend, where they visited a number of tourist attractions.The woman works for LSG Sky Chefs, an airline catering company, which is an “obvious connection to the border,” Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield told the news conference. She is not involved in handling food for the company, he said.Auckland’s move to Alert Level 3 means people are asked to stay at home and work remotely if possible. Schools, daycare centers, shops and public venues are largely closed, and gatherings are restricted to 10 people.For the rest of New Zealand, Alert Level 2 requires social distancing and mask wearing, but schools and businesses remain open.

14-02-2021||World||Acquitted again by Senate, Trump still a powerful force in Republican politics||It is still Donald Trump's Republican Party - at least for now.The vote by 43 of the 50 Republican senators to acquit Trump on the charge of inciting last month's deadly riot at the US Capitol, with only seven voting for conviction, highlights just how powerful a grip he has on the party he remade in his image over the past five years.The former president, who has largely stayed out of sight at his Florida home since leaving the White House on January 20, commands fervent loyalty among his supporters, forcing most Republican politicians to pledge their fealty and fear his wrath.But after two impeachments, months of false claims that his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden was rigged, and an assault on the US Capitol by his supporters that left five people dead, Trump is also political poison in many of the swing districts that often decide American elections.That leaves Republicans in a precarious position as they try to forge a winning coalition in the 2022 elections for control of Congress and a 2024 White House race that might include Trump as a candidate."It's hard to imagine Republicans winning national elections without Trump supporters anytime soon," said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and aide to Senator Marco Rubio during his 2016 presidential primary race against Trump."The party is facing a real Catch 22: it can't win with Trump but it's obvious it can't win without him either," he said.Trump has not signaled his long-range political plans for after the trial, although he has publicly hinted at another run for the White House and he is reportedly keen to help primary challengers to Republicans in Congress who voted to impeach or convict him."Whether he does run again is up to him, but he's still going to have an enormous amount of influence on both the direction of the policy and also in evaluating who is a serious standard-bearer for that message," one adviser said. "You can call it a kingmaker or whatever you want to call it."Trump has maintained strong support from Republicans in polls even since the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.Just days after the riot, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found 70% of Republicans still approved of Trump's job performance, and a later poll found a similar percentage believed he should be allowed to run for office again.But outside his party he is unpopular. A new Ipsos poll published on Saturday showed that 71% of Americans believed Trump was at least partially responsible for starting the assault on the Capitol. Fifty percent believed he should be convicted in the Senate with 38% opposed and 12% unsure.Trump's defenders in the Senate argued that the trial was unconstitutional because Trump had already left office and that his remarks ahead of the riot were protected by the constitutional right to free speech. But a majority of senators including seven Republicans rejected that view.Democrats said many Republican senators were afraid to vote with their conscience to convict Trump out of fear of retribution from his supporters."If this vote was taken in secret, there would be a conviction," Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was among the Republicans who voted to acquit Trump on Saturday, though he later slammed the former president as "practically and morally responsible" for provoking the violence.His position illustrated how some Republican leaders are trying to distance themselves from Trump and limit his influence without triggering the full-blown fury of Trump and his supporters.Trump's continued sway was evident, however, in House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy's visit last month to the former president’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where they huddled on strategy for the 2022 congressional elections.That visit came just three weeks after McCarthy had enraged Trump by saying he bore responsibility for the Capitol riot. McCarthy later backtracked, saying he did not believe Trump provoked the assault.POLITICAL BACKLASHThe few lawmakers who have broken with Trump have suffered a stinging backlash.Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives and one of 10 who voted for Trump's impeachment, quickly faced an effort by conservatives to remove her from her leadership post. She survived it, but Trump has vowed to throw his support behind a primary challenger to her.In Arizona, which backed Biden and elected a Democratic senator in November, the state party censured three prominent Republicans who had clashed with Trump while he was in office - Governor Doug Ducey, former Senator Jeff Flake and Cindy McCain, widow of the late Senator John McCain.When Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska was threatened with censure by his state party for criticizing Trump, he suggested it was down to a cult of personality."Let's be clear about why this is happening. It is because I still believe, as you used to, that politics isn't about the weird worship of one dude," Sasse said in a video addressed to the party leadership in Nebraska. He was one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump on Saturday.The fissures have led to an open debate in conservative circles over how far right to lean. At Fox News, the cable news network that played a key role in Trump's rise to power, Fox Corp Chief Executive Lachlan Murdoch this week told investors the outlet would stick to its "center right" position.Trump tore into the network after its early, and ultimately accurate, election-night projection that he lost in Arizona, presenting an opportunity for further-right video networks to draw disaffected Trump supporters."We don't need to go further right," Murdoch said. "We don't believe America is further right, and we're obviously not going to pivot left."Dozens of former Republican officials, disillusioned by the party's failure to stand up to Trump, have held talks to form a new center-right party, though multiple congressional Republicans rejected the idea.Advisers say Trump himself has talked about forming a breakaway Patriot Party, exacerbating Republican divisions.While Trump maintains control over the party for now, several Republican senators said during the impeachment trial that the stain left by the deadly siege of the Capitol and Trump's months of false claims about widespread election fraud would cripple his chances of winning power again in 2024."After the American public sees the whole story laid out here ... I don't see how Donald Trump could be reelected to the presidency again," Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who also voted for a conviction, told reporters during the trial.With Trump out of office and blocked from Twitter, his favorite means of communication, some Republicans said his hold on the party could fade as new issues and personalities emerge.Republican Senator John Cornyn, a Trump ally, said the former president's legacy had suffered permanent damage."Unfortunately, while President Trump did a lot of good, his handling of the post-election period is what he's going to be remembered for," Cornyn said. "And I think that's a tragedy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/acquitted-again-by-senate-trump-still-a-powerful-force-in-republican-politics-101613282709120.html
14-02-2021||World||Donald Trump indicates active public life after second impeachment acquittal||Donald Trump has told millions of his supporters that he is ready for yet another phase of active public life after the US Senate acquitted him in his second impeachment trial.Following four days of the impeachment trial, the 100-member Senate voted to impeach the former US president by 57-43 votes, 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction.Trump, a Republican, is the first-ever president to have been impeached twice and the first president to have faced impeachment after leaving office.Trump, 74, faced the charge of incitement of insurrection over the deadly January 6 assault of the US Capitol by his supporters.“Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun. In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people. There has never been anything like it!” Trump said in a statement.“We have so much work ahead of us, and soon we will emerge with a vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless American future,” Trump, who received 74 million votes in the November 3 presidential election, higher than that of any president before him.While Trump has remained quiet on his post-presidency life, speculation has been rife that he might run for the presidency in 2024 or encourage someone from his family to fight out a battle for the White House.There is also some talk that the former president might part ways with the Republican Party to form his own party. However, there has been no statement on this from Trump.“Our cherished Constitutional Republic was founded on the impartial rule of law, the indispensable safeguard for our liberties, our rights and our freedoms,” Trump said.After the end of his term on January 20, Trump flew to his resort in Palm Beach Florida, where he has been staying since then.Trump has been banned from almost all the major social media platforms including Twitter and Facebook.Meanwhile, several Republican leaders slammed the party's Senators who voted against Trump.Also Read: What's next for Donald Trump, the Republican Party and Joe Biden?The seven Senators are Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse and Pat Toomey.“The Louisiana GOP immediately censured Sen. Bill Cassidy, while state party officials in North Carolina and Pennsylvania issued sharp statements expressing disappointment over the votes cast Saturday by Sens. Richard Burr and Pat Toomey,” Politico reported.“The moves are the latest in a series of censures and disciplinary actions doled out to lawmakers deemed to be critical of the former president in the wake of the Capitol riot,” it added.Republican Senator John Cornyn said that he had concerns about this snap impeachment from the start.“The arguments of the House Impeachment Managers that the Constitution permits the impeachment of a private citizen, the free speech protections of the First Amendment don’t apply, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment is optional, and that the trial may include a presiding officer who also serves as a juror all were a bridge too far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-indicates-active-public-life-after-second-impeachment-acquittal-101613282948033.html
14-02-2021||World||Biden administration appoints two Indian-origin experts to key positions||Two Indian-origin experts in public service have been appointed by the Biden administration to key positions at AmeriCorps, the federal agency for volunteering and service.Sonali Nijhawan has been named Director of AmeriCorps State and National, and Sri Preston Kulkarni, 42, was appointed the new Chief of External Affairs.Though having run for Congress twice unsuccessfully in Texas, Kulkarni was certainly noticed by the leadership in Washington.Kulkarni’s appointment, along with Nijhawan and Dan Kohl, reflects “the Biden administration’s commitment to diverse leadership,” according to the release by AmeriCorps.In their roles, these leaders will use service to support the administration’s agenda, focusing on four of the most urgent challenges of our time: Covid-19, economic recovery, racial equity, and climate change, the AmeriCorps said.Kulkarni lost his race for the Texas District 22 seat in the US House of Representatives to former Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls in November as the Democratic nominee in a deeply Republican district.Kulkarni brings a variety of experience in service and public affairs to AmeriCorps, including 14 years as a foreign service officer with the State Department where he specialised in public diplomacy and worked in public affairs and international information programmes, completing tours in Taiwan, Russia, Iraq, Israel, Jamaica and Washington, the statement said.Nijhawan has committed her career to developing leaders and growing national service. Most recently, she developed and served as the executive director of Stockton Service Corps, a six-year, $12 million initiative to address local needs through AmeriCorps.Her professional background also includes extensive experience in education, AmeriCorps said in a press release.Inspired by the students, families, and AmeriCorps community she met, she went on to help found City Year Sacramento and launch the organisation's 22nd site with 50 new AmeriCorps members.Nijhawan also served as the California director of Education Pioneers where she recruited, placed, and supported managers in urban school systems and education nonprofits, empowering people to challenge the status quo of our public education system.She earned a bachelor's in education and psychology from Marquette University and a master's in social work from the University of Maryland, Baltimore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-appoints-two-indian-origin-experts-to-key-positions-101613282197973.html
14-02-2021||World||Indo-Canadian groups seek action against attacks on them over farm law support||More than two dozen Indo-Canadian organisations have asked the Canadian minister of public safety to take action against “coordinated attacks” on the community for being perceived as pro-India or critical of the protests against India’s new farm laws.The letter was sent on Saturday to Bill Blair, the minister for public safety and emergency preparedness. It said it appeared that “separatist elements seeking to create ‘Khalistan’ are deeply embedded and engaged in the anti-legislation agitations in Canada and the attacks on Indo-Canadians has taken a sectarian turn.” Sent by the umbrella organisation, National Alliance of Indo-Canadians, the letter was signed by representatives of 28 community bodies.The letter added, “This is deeply troubling as Canada’s worst incident of terrorism, bombing of Air India flight 182, the Kanishka, also emerged from the Khalistan movement in the country. Even more problematic is how elements supporting separatism are indulging in Hinduphobia under the guise of protesting the Indian laws.” The bombing of the Kanishka in 1985 by Khalistani terrorists claimed 329 lives.The signatories sought “early and effective action” from Public Safety Canada and its departments, “reassure Hindu-Canadians, who are fearful of their future due to this recent phenomenon. We do not want a repeat of the Kanishka tragedy.”As reported by the Hindustan Times earlier, incidents of threats, including those of sexual violence against female members of families, have occurred in several parts of Canada including the Greater Toronto Area, Metro Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. Multiple police complaints have been filed by victims of these attacks.In one glaring instance, volunteers who helped organise a ‘Tiranga Rally’ in Vancouver earlier this month faced not just threatening calls but had protestors turning up outside their office.Nearly 350 cars participated in the rally from Surrey, a suburban city, to Vancouver, with several participants waving Indian national flags in front of the building housing the Indian Consulate.One of the volunteers was mentioned in a Hindustan Times report on the event and days later she, her husband and the immigration business they operate in Surrey, were targeted.The volunteer, who has requested that her name be withheld because of concerns over safety, said that threatening calls, of an abusive nature and at times, communal invective, commenced hours after the rally was held. “I’m scared,” she said, of these developments.Anti-India protestors have gathered in the parking lot outside the strip mall where the business of the couple is located. Khalistan flags were also visible in a video of the protest. They also said they have been cyberbullied and filed a complaint with the local Delta Police Department.The intimidation of the couple is the latest episode in a series of recent incidents in Canada, which includes threatening calls, visits to residences and businesses of those seen to be pro-India and critical of the ongoing agitation against the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadian-groups-seek-action-against-attacks-on-them-over-farm-law-support-101613282321782.html
14-02-2021||World||Imran Khan tightens noose over NGOs to silence dissent||Tightening the noose around non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Pakistan to crush dissent, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday alleged that NGOs have been receiving foreign funds to promote the "enemy agenda" and are working against the state, reported DW News Agency.Activists and rights groups asserted that the crackdown on civil society organisations is part of the authorities' broader plan to silence dissent, reported DW News Agency.Local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have been under pressure in Pakistan for many years, but suppression under the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan has intensified as he ordered 18 foreign NGOs to close their operations and leave the country since 2018.Khan took up the issue of NGOs' foreign funding in a Cabinet meeting last month amid increasing concerns that his government is suppressing freedom of speech in the country."The way Khan's government banned several international NGOs and took measures to create problems for local NGOs is alarming. We have never experienced this situation before. The government also wants to control the media," said Mohammad Tahseen, Executive Director of the South Asia Partnership Pakistan organization, told DW.Meanwhile, Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars negated the age-old allegations International NGOs are "essentially a front for intelligence operations.""In a country where foreign intelligence agencies, especially the CIA, have long made a mark, it's an easy narrative to sell. Many in Pakistan believe that Save the Children was involved in the CIA-sponsored fake vaccination campaign that helped track down Osama Bin Laden. Longstanding suspicion about foreign NGOs was heightened after the Bin Laden raid, and it has remained strong today," Kugelman told DW.Further, Tahseen lambasted Imran-government over the crackdown on NGOs and said, "It is easier for the government to target NGOs than to work for the welfare of the citizens. There is no evidence that NGOs are working against the country. NGOs are actually performing a very important role to enhance human development, fundamental rights and social justice in Pakistan."Moreover, political analyst Qamar Cheema pointed to the lack of trust between state authorities and civil society groups. "The state fears that these organizations might create national disorder. It hopes to manage the situation," he told DW.Conservative groups, state-influencers alleged that NGOs promote liberal values that go against the teachings of Islam.Regarding misuse of NGOs, Tahseen said, "NGOs are subject to multiple layers of scrutiny and clearances at different government levels before they can register and start their operations. It is unfair to accuse them of wrongdoings."Kugelman, taking the issue of foreign funding lambasted the Imran government and said, "There is a concern about how foreign money enters Pakistan, and how it is used. The irony is that the security establishment has long welcomed foreign assistance for itself. Expelling foreign NGOs just because they're not properly accounting for their funding sounds harsh".The clampdown on foreign-funded NGOs has, to a large extent, dissuaded international donors and NGOs from engaging with Pakistan. Experts say this will have a negative impact on the country's poor, who benefit from international cooperation, reported DW News Agency."The crackdown is tarnishing the country's image. Pakistan is losing international aid and support," asserted Tahseen.Kugelman shares a similar view: "If Islamabad continues to telegraph a message that foreign NGOs won't enjoy a welcoming environment, then that could temper the interest of these groups to enter Pakistan."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-tightens-noose-over-ngos-to-silence-dissent-101613281018076.html
14-02-2021||World||Japan quake brings back memories of deadly 2011 tsunami||The stench of alcohol filled the small bar on Sunday as Aoi Hoshino swept up glass from whiskey bottles smashed in a strong earthquake the night before, one appearing to be an aftershock from a devastating quake that hit the Fukushima area in 2011.The 7.3 magnitude quake struck shortly before midnight Saturday and cracked walls, shattered windows and set off a landslide in Fukushima, the area closest to the epicentre. More than 100 people were injured.Hoshino, 46, swept broken glass from some 20 shattered whiskey bottles into a garbage bag in her bar on a back street in the city of Iwaki, roughly 200 km (120 miles) north of Tokyo and not far from the quake's epicentre."We were hit by this coronavirus pandemic, and so we were looking forward to reopening our shops, and now this happens," she said, referring to a locally declared state of emergency that had closed her bar from January and was set to lift on Monday."It’s just one thing after another."The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake was believed to be an aftershock from the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011 that set off a tsunami, killing nearly 20,000 people along a wide swath of northeastern Japan, and the Fukushima nuclear accident, the world's worst in 25 years. The agency warned of aftershocks for several days.Hoshino said Saturday's quake brought back frightening memories."My body immediately reacted, and I couldn’t stop trembling. My legs were shaking too, but I couldn’t gauge whether it was safer to run out or stay in, so I ended up doing a weird little dance," she said with a chuckle.At least 121 people were injured, NHK national television said, including several who suffered fractures, but there were no reported deaths.BUILDINGS SHOOK IN TOKYOThe 11:08 p.m. (1408 GMT) quake shook buildings in the Japanese capital Tokyo, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of buildings across eastern and northeastern Japan. By morning, though, power was restored to virtually all.Several thousand households remained without water, forcing residents to line up with plastic jugs to receive water from trucks.Though much of Iwaki appeared as usual, tiles had fallen from the front of at least one building, and the sound of broken glass being swept up echoed from several shops and restaurants.On the wall of Noboru Endo's hair salon a hairline crack had opened, in the same place a wider one opened 10 years ago, but otherwise there was little damage.Endo, 64, said Saturday's quake did not compare to the one a decade ago, which went on for several minutes and had weeks of frequent aftershocks."We’ve all pretty much gone back to life as usual, save a few areas that are still badly affected," he said of reconstruction efforts in the area.There was no tsunami this time, and no reports of irregularities at any nuclear plants. NHK reported that about 160 millilitres (5 ounces) of water had leaked from a spent fuel pool at the Fukushima Dai-Ni reactor but that this presented no danger.Shinkansen bullet train service to much of northern Japan was suspended due to damage along the tracks. Service along one line was not expected to be restored until at least Tuesday.Beermakers such as Asahi Group Holdings and Kirin Holdings, which have factories in Fukushima and Sendai, said they were assessing the impact on their facilities. Kirin said its Sendai plant sustained light damage and it was still checking the situation.The power outages did not affect any of the Pfizer Inc Covid-19 vaccines that arrived on Friday for inoculations that are to start this week, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato.Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas, and Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-quake-brings-back-memories-of-deadly-2011-tsunami-101613280079733.html
14-02-2021||World||China fires back at US allegations of lack of transparency||China fired back Sunday at the US over allegations from the White House that Beijing withheld some information about the coronavirus outbreak from World Health Organization investigators.In a statement Friday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington had “deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the Covid-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them.”“It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government," he said, referring to the WHO mission investigating the origins of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late in 2019."To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak." Sullivan's statement said.China responded with a statement from its Washington embassy on Sunday, saying the US had already “gravely damaged international cooperation on Covid-19″ and was now “pointing fingers at other countries who have been faithfully supporting the WHO and at the WHO itself.”While it welcomed President Joe Biden's decision to reverse the Trump administration's move to leave the WHO, China hopes the US will “hold itself to the highest standards, take a serious, earnest, transparent and responsible attitude, shoulder its rightful responsibility, support the WHO’s work with real actions and make due contribution to the international cooperation on Covid-19," the statement said.Following allegations of Chinese withholding of data in the New York Times and other media outlets, investigation team member Peter Daszak tweeted, “This was NOT my experience on @WHO mission."“As lead of animal/environment working group I found trust & openness w/ my China counterparts. We DID get access to critical new data throughout. We DID increase our understanding of likely spillover pathways," Daszak tweeted.Another team member, Thea Koelsen Fischer of Denmark, also said that had not been her experience and implied some comments had been misrepresented in the media.“We DID build up a good relationship in the Chinese/Int Epi-team! Allowing for heated arguments reflects a deep level of engagement in the room. Our quotes are intendedly twisted casting shadows over important scientific work," Fischer tweeted.While in Wuhan, Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries.The British-born Daszak, a zoologist who now works in New York, affirmed Fischer's remarks, tweeting: “It’s disappointing to spend time w/ journalists explaining key findings of our exhausting month-long work in China, to see our colleagues selectively misquoted to fit a narrative that was prescribed before the work began. Shame on you @nytimes."Daszak had previously worked with the deputy director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, to track down the origins of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, that originated in China and led to the 2003 outbreak. He earlier told The Associated Press that the WHO team enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested.The 10-nation WHO team last week departed Wuhan after nearly a month. It visited markets, hospitals and research centers, including the highly secure Wuhan Institute of Virology that has been the subject of speculation because of its large collection of bat virus specimens.In their comments while in China, team members said they had some new insights into the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 2.3 million people, but that major questions are still unanswered.The mission was intended to be an initial step in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, which scientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat. They said transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, but an alternate theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab was unlikely.The WHO team’s visit was politically sensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. An AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and ordered scientists not to speak to reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-fires-back-at-us-allegations-of-lack-of-transparency-101613277433512.html

Service along one line was not expected to be restored until at least Tuesday.The March 11, 2011 quake set off a series of massive tsunami that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and killed nearly 20,000.Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trains-halted-scores-injured-as-japan-cleans-up-after-strong-quake-101613268873497.html
14-02-2021||World||Biden aide Ducklo resigns over report he threatened reporter||White House Deputy Press Secretary TJ Ducklo resigned Saturday amid allegations he threatened a reporter who was investigating his relationship with another journalist.Ducklo’s departure came after Vanity Fair reported Friday that he used misogynistic language as he tried to talk a Politico reporter out of writing about his relationship with an Axios reporter. He was initially given a one-week suspension as his boss, Press Secretary Jen Psaki, defended him. But by Saturday, the situation became untenable.“We accepted the resignation of TJ Ducklo after a discussion with him this evening,” Psaki said in a statement. “We are committed to striving every day to meet the standard set by the president in treating others with dignity and respect, with civility and with a value for others through our words and our actions.”President Joe Biden has long made clear he doesn’t accept disrespectful treatment of others by his staff. On Inauguration Day, as he swore in hundreds of political appointees, Biden laid out a zero-tolerance policy for misbehavior.“I’m not joking when I say this: If you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I will fire you on the spot. No ifs, ands, or buts,” Biden said.After word of Ducklo’s suspension, Biden aides expressed frustration that he’d been treated too leniently, according to three people familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. Given the nature of his comments to the reporter and Biden’s recent warning, they believed he should have been fired immediately.Ducklo, 32, warned a female Politico reporter against publishing a story about his relationship with Alexi McCammond of Axios, who’d covered the Biden campaign, according to the Vanity Fair report. He told the Politico reporter “I will destroy you,” and spoke in sexually explicit terms as he worked to kill the story, according to the magazine.The Vanity Fair article came after People magazine on Monday published a story about Ducklo’s relationship with McCammond and his treatment for lung cancer. The next morning, Politico Playbook ran its own accounting of the relationship, questioning the ethics of the situation and saying that it had notified the White House of its plans to publish on Monday, giving Ducklo time to rush out the People story.Ducklo on Saturday expressed remorse for his words. “No words can express my regret, my embarrassment, and my disgust for my behavior,” he said in a statement posted to Twitter.“I used language that no woman should ever have to hear from anyone.”Ducklo worked in the communications department at Bloomberg from April 2016 to March 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-aide-ducklo-resigns-over-report-he-threatened-reporter-101613268251222.html
14-02-2021||World||What's next for Donald Trump, the Republican Party and Joe Biden?||The US Senate acquitted Donald Trump on Saturday of the charge of inciting the January 6 assault on the US Capitol in an unprecedented second impeachment trial.Trump's acquittal raises questions about what's next for the 74-year-old former president, the Republican Party and President Joe Biden.- Donald Trump -Although Trump's acquittal by the Senate was a near certainty, the verdict must have come as a relief to the former president.In a statement, Trump denounced what he called a "witch hunt" and talked about the future."Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun," he said."We have so much work ahead of us, and soon we will emerge with a vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless American future."Trump has flirted with the idea of running for the White House again in 2024 and a conviction would have likely barred him from holding federal office again.Since leaving the White House on January 20, Trump has been holed up in his Mar-a-Lago resort, deprived of the Twitter account he used to communicate with his many millions of followers.Capri Cafaro, executive in residence at American University in Washington and a former Democratic member of the Ohio state senate, said the acquittal could be a "rallying cry" for Trump and his backers.But, Cafaro added, "the legacy of Donald Trump for many at this point may be the events of January 6, regardless of acquittal.""There will be Americans who think that Donald Trump had some kind of role," she said, and that could carry over to the real estate tycoon's activities in the private sector."It's almost like he has no choice but to continue to try to be in politics," she said.Wendy Schiller, a professor of political science at Brown University, agreed that Trump's future may be limited."If a corporation were to offer him a speaking appearance, the social media backlash would be swift and severe, with possible boycotts of their products," Schiller said."Even holding conferences or events at Trump properties will be a problem for large publicly traded companies, or companies that provide a direct to consumer product," she said.- The Republican Party -The fact that the vast majority of Senate Republicans voted to acquit Trump is a clear signal that he retains a grip on the GOP, the Grand Old Party."The party is his," Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his most fervent supporters, said last week. "It doesn't belong to anyone else."But seven Republican senators voted to convict the former president and 10 Republican members of the House of Representatives voted last month to impeach him, including the party's third-ranking member, Liz Cheney, daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell voted for acquittal but said Trump was "practically and morally" responsible for the January 6 violence.A number of Republicans have distanced themselves from the former president and are lining up to take their own shot at the White House in 2024.Among them is former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who said Republicans were wrong for supporting Trump's campaign to reverse the election results, a course that led to the January 6 attack on Congress."He went down a path he shouldn't have, and we shouldn't have followed him," Haley said in an interview with Politico magazine.Haley also dismissed speculation Trump will seek the presidency in 2024. "I don't think he can," she said. "He's fallen so far."But the Republicans advocating a complete break with Trump are in the minority and most remain fearful of the power he holds over his base."GOP senators who vote to acquit may be protecting themselves against primary challenges from the more extreme wing of their party in 2022, or even 2024," Schiller said. "But they may simultaneously make themselves more vulnerable to defeat in the general election."Cafaro said Republican lawmakers remaining faithful to Trump were making an "incredibly risky" gamble."They're making a decision based upon a snapshot in time that may not exist for them in two years," she said.A group of anti-Trump former Republican officials has raised the idea of creating a center-right third party but it is unlikely to gain much traction.- Joe Biden -Trump's impeachment trial has been hanging over the start of Biden's presidency and the Democrats must be glad it took just five days.The Senate will now be in a position to swiftly confirm Biden's cabinet appointees and work on his legislative agenda as the country struggles with the Covid-19 pandemic and severe economic woes."President Biden has done a very good job of separating himself from the impeachment trial proceedings and keep his messaging on the Covid-19 crisis and the accompanying economic crisis," Schiller said.But Trump remains a force to be reckoned with."There's no saying that we're immune from more protests, demonstrations, activism from the far right," Cafaro said. "If and when that happens how Joe Biden deals with them will be something to watch."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whats-next-for-donald-trump-the-republican-party-and-joe-biden-101613263493205.html
14-02-2021||World||UK meets key Covid-19 vaccine target, opening path to lifting lockdown||The UK has passed its target to vaccinate almost 15 million of its most vulnerable citizens against coronavirus, cementing a record of delivering one of the most successful immunization programs in the world.According to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker, the UK administered 15.1 million doses as of Saturday. Almost 22% of the population has been given one dose, with less than 1% getting two shots.Prime Minister Boris Johnson set the target at the start of the year with the aim of immunizing everyone over the age of 70, along with people who live or work in care homes, health service workers and those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19. These groups are estimated to account for about 88% of deaths from the disease in the UK.For Johnson, whose government has been slammed for its handling of the pandemic that has claimed more than 117,000 lives, the achievement is a welcome political boost. But hitting the crucial vaccine target also opens up new risks for the government.The vaccination program now offers a route out of the UK’s third lockdown, which has shuttered businesses and closed schools to most, compounding the damage of the worst economic slump in more than 300 years. Scientists also expect it to slow infections and limit the death toll, already the highest in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world.WHO EndorsementBritain was the first western country to start rolling out vaccines and the first to extend the delay between first and second doses to 12 weeks in an effort to give as many people as possible at least some protection from the virus. The approach provoked skepticism initially but has since been endorsed by the World Health Organization.But while the UK’s pioneering approach to vaccinations has given it a lead over nearly every other country in the world, passing the crucial milestone is likely to fuel demands to lift the lockdown and fire up the economy.Senior members of Johnson’s own Conservative government have been calling on him to move faster to ease restrictions and avert a wave of unemployment. Yet with infection levels still the highest in Europe, Johnson and his scientific advisers have explained they will need to stay cautious, with curbs remaining in place potentially for months to come.Over the next week, the government will review the lockdown restrictions in the context of the infection and case rates, and the vaccination program. Then, on Feb. 22 the prime minister is due to announce his “road map” to unlock the country gradually over the months ahead.On a visit Saturday to a vaccine manufacturing plant in Teesside in northeastern England, Johnson said he’s “optimistic” he’ll be able to detail plans for a “cautious” easing of restrictions this month.Schools, PubsIf all goes well, schools will be the first to reopen, potentially on March 8. The Sunday Telegraph reported that individuals in England will be allowed to meet a friend for a coffee on a park bench from that day, a possible signal that pubs may be able to reopen with outdoor dining in time for the Easter holidays.The government plans to offer a vaccine to everyone over the age of 50 by the end of April.There are potential challenges ahead for managing the pandemic, too. Mutations of the virus, some of which show signs of resistance to the vaccines, are emerging and threaten the government’s path out of lockdown. In response, Johnson has announced tougher border measures with a decade in jail as punishment for breaking new quarantine rules for travelers arriving in Britain from virus hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-meets-key-covid-19-vaccine-target-opening-path-to-lifting-lockdown-101613263229822.html
14-02-2021||World||Donald Trump's journey from poll defeat to acquittal in second impeachment trial||Former US president Donald Trump was acquitted Saturday in his second impeachment trial by a Senate vote of 57 to 43, surviving charges that he incited the deadly January 6 assault on the US Capitol by supporters bent on preventing Congress from transferring power to Joe Biden.Here is a timeline of events leading up to the trial and acquittal:- Election defeat -Despite the risks posed by the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the country, record numbers of Americans turn out to vote in the November 3 election.Trump had spent the preceding months warning of election fraud and trying to block mail-in voting, which he feared would massively favor his Democratic opponent Joe Biden.Because so many ballots are mailed in, the final results are delayed, though Trump is reportedly furious when conservative channel Fox News declares the traditionally Republican state of Arizona for Biden on election night.Within days, Trump's lawyers, led by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, embark on a series of fruitless court cases to challenge the election results.- Biden declared winner -On November 7, Biden is declared the winner after flipping the historically Republican southern state of Georgia. In his acceptance speech that night, he calls for unity and holds out an olive branch to Trump supporters, many of whom believed the outgoing president's unsubstantiated claims that the election was stolen."I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance," Biden said.- Georgia recounts begin -Under pressure from Trump, Georgia's Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger launches a hand recount of the Georgia ballots that confirms Biden's win. Trump demands an additional recount, which on December 7 shows Biden won the state by 11,779 votes.- 'Will be wild!' -On December 19, Trump tweets to his 88 million social media followers to come to Washington on January 6, the day Congress is due to convene to confirm the election results in what is normally a symbolic, procedural event, for a "big protest in DC.""Be there, will be wild!" he said.- Trump demands Georgia 'find' votes -On January 2, Trump calls Georgia's election overseer Raffensperger and begs him to find more votes to overturn Biden's victory. "What I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes," he says.- Mob storms the Capitol -Vice President Mike Pence releases a statement in which he declines Trump's unconstitutional demand that he reject the electoral college vote, as Congress gathers in the US Capitol to certify Biden's victory.Trump tells a gathering of thousands of angry followers at the White House to march to the Capitol and "fight" for him.The mob storms the building, causing lawmakers and Pence to flee in fear for their lives. Five people, including a police officer, die in the violence. After police and the National Guard restore order, Congress reconvenes and confirms the result.- Twitter ban -On January 8, Twitter, the defeated president's favorite channel for communicating with his followers, bans him from the platform indefinitely.- Second impeachment -On January 13, the House of Representatives impeaches Trump on grounds that he incited the insurrection. Ten Republicans vote with Democrats to back the motion.On January 20, Biden is inaugurated in front of the Capitol. Trump breaks with precedent and refuses to attend, instead flying to his Mar-A-Lago golf resort in Florida.Trump's second impeachment trial begins on February 9 in the 100-seat Senate, with its members -- witnesses to the mayhem -- serving as jurors.Jamie Raskin, the chief of the nine House members serving as prosecutors, calls Trump the "inciter in chief" for his role in stirring and encouraging the insurrection.The prosecutors give a detailed presentation featuring Trump remarks and tweets and video of the riot, including never before seen footage in which lawmakers are seen fleeing to safety as Trump supporters run amok and hunt down Democratic legislators.- 'Practically and morally responsible' -Trump defense lawyers Bruce Castor and David Schoen argue the trial is unconstitutional because Trump is no longer in office, and dismiss the proceedings as an exercise in political vengeance.On February 13 the Senate acquits Trump by a vote of 57 to 43, failing to muster the 17 Republicans that the prosecution needed to convict the former president.Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell votes to acquit, embracing the unconstitutionality argument, but later excoriates Trump for his behavior on January 6."There's no question -- none -- that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day," McConnell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-journey-from-poll-defeat-to-acquittal-in-second-impeachment-trial-101613262911600.html
14-02-2021||World||Here’s why seven GOP Senators voted to convict Donald Trump||Seven Republican senators broke ranks and voted to convict Donald Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol -- 10 shy of the 17 needed to reach a two-thirds majority, but still an unusually strong rebuke from members of the former president’s party.Each is likely to face significant blowback from other Republicans. Here are the seven senators and the explanations for their votes:Richard Burr of North CarolinaBurr had previously announced he won’t run for re-election in 2022, and has been a sometime critic of Trump’s. He ran a multi-year bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether it was aimed at helping Trump win.Also Read: Trump, after acquittal, says movement 'has only just begun'“The president bears responsibility for these tragic events,” Burr said in a statement after his vote to convict Trump. “The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a co-equal branch of government, and that the charge rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. Therefore, I have voted to convict.”Bill Cassidy of LouisianaCassidy, who just won re-election and won’t face voters again until 2026, had been agonizing over his decision all week, and was troubled by the inability of Trump’s lawyers to explain the former president’s inaction during the first hours of the riot as police were under attack, people were dying, and lawmakers --including Vice President Mike Pence -- were under threat.“Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty,” he said in a statement.Susan Collins of MaineCollins, who voted to acquit Trump at his first impeachment trial, had said she hoped the former president learned a lesson after that proceeding. This time, she voted to convict.Collins ripped Trump in a lengthy floor speech for inciting the insurrection and said he “bears significant responsibility for the invasion.” She said the trial for her was about his failure to follow his oath of office and respect the peaceful transition of power.Lisa Murkowski of AlaskaMurkowski has previously expressed a hope that her party could move on from Trump, and is arguably the most independent Republican senator. She plans to run for re-election next year and is sure to face a Trump-aligned primary challenger. However, in 2010, she won as a write-in candidate after losing a party primary.Mitt Romney of UtahThe 2012 GOP presidential nominee was the only Republican to vote to toss Trump from office a year ago, and his vote was not a surprise.Romney accused Trump of trying to “corrupt the election” by pressuring Georgia’s secretary of state to falsify results, and of inciting the insurrection.“Trump also violated his oath of office by failing to protect the Capitol, the Vice President, and others in the Capitol,” Romney said.Ben Sasse of NebraskaSasse has emerged as one of the few young Republicans willing to buck Trump, harshly slamming his efforts to overturn the election results. Conveniently for him, he also just won re-election and won’t face voters for six years.In a statement explaining his vote, he condemned Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election by a landslide and for spreading conspiracy theories about voter fraud.“The president repeated these lies when summoning his crowd -- parts of which were widely known to be violent -- to Capitol Hill to intimidate Vice President Pence and Congress into not fulfilling our constitutional duties,” he said. “Those lies had consequences, endangering the life of the vice president and bringing us dangerously close to a bloody constitutional crisis. Each of these actions are violations of a president’s oath of office.”Pat Toomey of PennsylvaniaToomey has long chafed at Trump, particularly on their divergent economic philosophies. He came out quickly against Trump’s efforts to overturn the results in his state. He’s retiring and doesn’t need to worry about a primary.“As a result of President Trump’s actions, for the first time in American history, the transfer of presidential power was not peaceful,” Toomey said. “A lawless attempt to retain power by a president was one of the founders’ greatest fears motivating the inclusion of the impeachment authorities in the U.S. Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heres-why-seven-gop-senators-voted-to-convict-donald-trump-101613262160711.html
14-02-2021||World||After not-guilty vote, McConnell says Trump morally responsible for Capitol riot||US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called Donald Trump "practically and morally responsible" for his supporters' deadly attack on the Capitol, only moments after voting to acquit the Republican former president on an impeachment charge of inciting the melee.The top Senate Republican explained the unexpected turnabout at the end of a five-day impeachment trial, by declaring it unconstitutional to convict Trump of misconduct now that the former president has left office and become a private citizen.The Senate earlier in the week found that the trial was constitutional in a 56-44 vote."There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day," said McConnell, who along with the rest of the Congress and former Vice President Mike Pence fled the mob that descended on the Capitol on Jan. 6."The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president," McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor.The remarks came soon after the 100-seat chamber acquitted Trump on a single charge of inciting insurrection in a 57-43 vote that failed to reach the 67-vote threshold necessary for conviction. Seven Senate Republicans joined Democrats to vote for conviction.The House of Representatives had impeached Trump on Jan. 13, a week before he left office.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced the senators who made Trump's acquittal possible as a "cowardly group of Republicans" and blamed McConnell for not allowing the House to deliver the impeachment charge to the Senate while Trump was still in the White House."Senator Mitch McConnell just went to the floor essentially to say that we made our case on the facts," said Representative Jamie Raskin, who had led the nine House Democrats who prosecuted Trump before the Senate.McConnell was not the only Republican to castigate Trump for his behavior after voting for acquittal."The question I must answer is not whether President Trump said and did things that were reckless and encouraged the mob. I believe that happened," Senator Rob Portman in a statement."My decision was based on my reading of the Constitution," the Ohio Republican added. "I believe the Framers understood that convicting a former president and disqualifying him or her from running again pulls people further apart."Senator Chuck Grassley, the Senate's most senior Republican, described Trump's language in a fiery speech to supporters just before the Capitol assault as "extreme, aggressive and irresponsible."But he said the Senate had no jurisdiction to hold a trial, agreed with Trump's legal team that the former president deserved more "due process" and said the prosecution had not made their case.In comments that echoed the prosecution's case, McConnell said Trump had orchestrated "an intensifying crescendo of conspiracy theories" and described the former president as "determined to either overturn the voters' decision or else torch our institutions on the way out."McConnell suggested that Trump could still face criminal prosecution for his acts."President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office as an ordinary citizen," McConnell said. "He didn't get away with anything. Yet."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-not-guilty-vote-mcconnell-says-trump-morally-responsible-for-capitol-riot-101613261710505.html

Waters, a Democrat, is Chair of the House Committee on Financial Services."We are working with the House Financial Services Committee and plan to testify," Reddit's Huffman said in an emailed statement. Representatives for Melvin, Citadel and Robinhood did not respond to requests for comment. Gill could not be reached for comment.Robinhood, Reddit, Melvin and Citadel have been at the center of the GameStop saga, which saw retail traders promote GameStop on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. Robinhood emerged as a popular venue to trade the stocks but was criticized for temporarily restricting trading in the hot stock.The GameStop surge resulted in massive losses for Melvin, after the hedge fund bet the retailer’s stock price would tumble. Citadel’s hedge funds, along with founder Griffin and firm partners, put $2 billion into Melvin.Democrats and Republicans are united in their outrage by Robinhood's decision to suspend trading in the so-called "meme stocks" on Jan. 28. Tenev said the company had to impose the restrictions after wild trading in the stocks triggered a $3 billion margin call by Robinhood's clearing house, straining the company's balance sheet.Massachusetts securities regulators have also issued a subpoena seeking Gill's testimony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roaring-kitty-to-testify-on-gamestop-alongside-hedge-fund-managers-101613254348751.html

He suggested that Trump could yet face criminal prosecution for his acts."President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office as an ordinary citizen," McConnell said. "He didn't get away with anything. Yet."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-morally-responsible-for-capitol-riot-says-mitch-mcconnell-after-not-guilty-vote-101613253752430.html

14-02-2021||World||Trump acquitted: Senate votes 57-43 at impeachment trial||The Senate on Saturday acquitted Donald Trump of inciting the horrific attack on the US Capitol, concluding a historic impeachment trial that exposed the fragility of America's democratic traditions and left a divided nation to come to terms with the violence sparked by his defeated presidency.Barely a month since the deadly Jan. 6 riot that stunned the world, the Senate convened for a rare weekend session to deliver its verdict, voting while armed National Guard troops continued to stand their posts outside the iconic building.The quick trial, the nation’s first of a former president, showed how perilously close the invaders had come to destroying the nation's deep tradition of a peaceful transfer of presidential power after Trump had refused to concede the election. Rallying outside the White House, he unleashed a mob of supporters to “fight like hell” for him at the Capitol just as Congress was certify Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. As hundreds stormed the building, some in tactical gear engaging in bloody combat with police, lawmakers fled for their lives. Five people died.The verdict, on a vote of 57-43, is all but certain to influence not only the former president's political future but that of the senators sworn to deliver impartial justice as jurors. Seven Republicans joined all Democrats to convict, but it was far from the two-third threshold required.Also Read | Trump, after acquittal, says movement 'has only just begun'The outcome after the uprising leaves unresolved the nation’s wrenching divisions over Trump's brand of politics that led to the most violent domestic attack on one of America's three branches of government.“Senators, we are in a dialogue with history, a conversation with our past, with a hope for our future,” said Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa.., one of the House prosecutors in closing arguments.“What we do here, what is being asked of each of us here in this moment will be remembered."Trump, unrepentant, welcomed the his second impeachment acquittal and said his movement “has only just begun.” He slammed the trial as “yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country.”Though he was acquitted, it was easily the largest number of senators to ever vote to find a president of their own party guilty of an impeachment charge.Voting to find Trump guilty were GOP Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania.Even after voting to acquit, the Republican leader Mitch McConnell condemned the former president as ‘practically and morally responsible’ for the insurrection. Trump could not be convicted because he was out of office, McConnell contended.The trial had been momentarily thrown into confusion when senators suddenly wanted to consider potential witnesses, an hours-long standoff Saturday that stalled the momentum toward a vote. Prolonged proceedings would be politically risky, particularly for Biden's new presidency and his emerging legislative agenda. Coming amid the searing Covid-19 crisis, the Biden White House is trying to rush pandemic relief through Congress.Biden has hardly weighed in on the proceedings and was spending the weekend with family at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Maryland.The nearly weeklong trial has delivered a grim and graphic narrative of the riot and its consequences in ways that senators, most of whom fled for their own safety that day, acknowledge they are still coming to grips with.House prosecutors have argued that Trump’s was the "inciter in chief" stoking a months-long campaign, and orchestrated pattern of violent rhetoric and false claims they called the “big lie” that unleashed the mob. Five people died, including a rioter who was shot and a police officer.Trump’s lawyers countered that Trump’s words were not intended to incite the violence and that impeachment is nothing but a “witch hunt” designed to prevent him from serving in office again.The senators, announcing their votes from their desks, were not only jurors but also witnesses. Only by watching the graphic videos — rioters calling out menacingly for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the January certification tally — did senators say they began to understand just how perilously close the country came to chaos.Many senators kept their votes closely held until the final moments on Saturday, particularly the Republicans representing states where the former president remains popular. Most of them ultimately voted to acquit, doubting whether Trump was fully responsible or if impeachment is the appropriate response.“Just look at what Republicans have been forced to defend,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “Look at what Republicans have chosen to forgive.”In closing arguments, lead prosecutor Michael van der Veen fell back on the procedural argument that Republican senators have embraced in their own reasoning of the case what he said is a “phony impeachment show trial.”“Mr. Trump is innocent of the charges against him,” said Michael van der Veen. “The act of incitement never happened.”The House impeached trump on the sole charge of incitement of insurrection one week after the riot, the most bipartisan vote of a presidential impeachment.The delay Saturday came as senators wanted to hear evidence about Trump's actions during the riot.Fresh stories overnight focused onRep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who said in a statement late Friday that Trump rebuffed a plea from House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to call off the rioters.Fifty-five senators voted for to consider witnesses, including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mitt Romney of Utah. Once they did, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina changed his vote to join them on the 55-45 vote.But facing a prolonged trial with defense poised to call many more witnesses, the situation was resolved when Herrera Beutler’s statement on the call was read aloud into the record for senators to consider as evidence. As part of the deal, Democrats dropped their planned deposition and Republicans abandoned their threat to call their own witnesses.Impeachment trials are rare, senators meeting as the court of impeachment over a president only four times in the nation's history, for Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and now twice for Trump, the only one to be twice impeached.Unlike last year’s impeachment trial of Trump in the Ukraine affair, a complicated charge of corruption and obstruction over his attempts to have the foreign ally dig up dirt on then-campaign rival Biden, this one brought an emotional punch displayed in graphic videos of the siege that laid bare the unexpected vulnerability of the democratic system.At the same time, this year's trial carried similar warnings from the prosecutors pleading with senators that Trump must be held accountable because he has shown repeatedly he has no bounds. Left unchecked, he will further test the norms of civic behavior, even now that he is out of office still commanding loyal supporters.“This trial in the final analysis is not about Donald Trump,” said lead prosecutor Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. "This trial is about who we are.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-president-trump-acquitted-by-the-us-senate-in-his-impeachment-trial-101613250209127.html

The Japanese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A federal appeals court in Boston had declined on Thursday to issue an order preventing the Taylors' extradition while they appealed lower-court rulings. The US State Department approved their extradition in October."The very least the US courts owe the petitioners is a full chance to litigate these issues, including exercising their appellate rights, before they are consigned to the fate that awaits them at the hands of the Japanese government," defense lawyers wrote.The Taylors were arrested in May at Japan's request after being charged with helping Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he had engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-top-court-rejects-bid-by-ghosn-s-accused-escape-plotters-to-avoid-extradition-101613249459837.html
14-02-2021||World||UK media watchdog fines Khalsa TV for violence, terror references||London: The UK’s media watchdog has imposed a total fine of 50,000 pounds on Khalsa Television Ltd or KTV in Britain for broadcasting a music video and a discussion programme that was an indirect call for British Sikh to commit violence and also contained a terror reference. The Office of Communications (Ofcom), the UK government-approved media regulatory authority, issued the order on Friday following its findings dating back to February and November 2019. Its order also includes a direction for the channel to broadcast a statement of Ofcom’s findings on a date and in a form to be determined by the watchdog and also for KTV not to repeat the music video or the discussion programme found in breach of its rules. “Ofcom has imposed financial penalties of 20,000 pounds and 30,000 pounds on Khalsa Television Limited in relation to its service KTV for failing to comply with our broadcasting rules. The 20,000 pounds penalty relates to a music video. The 30,000 pounds penalty relates to a discussion programme,” the Ofcom decision states. On July 4, 7 and 9 in 2018, KTV broadcast a music video for a song called ‘Bagga and Shera’. Following its investigation, Ofcom found that the music video was an “indirect call to action for Sikhs living in the UK to commit violence, up to and including murder”. It also included brief flashes, which, when slowed down, revealed frames of on-screen text. It appeared to be seeking to influence viewers by conveying a message to them or otherwise influencing their minds without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred, which Ofcom found was in breach of its rules of the broadcast. The discussion programme in question was aired live on March 30, 2019, as ‘Panthak Masle’. Ofcom found that the programme provided a platform for several guests to express views which amounted to “indirect calls to action and were likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder”. “Ofcom also found that it included a reference to the proscribed terrorist organisation the Babbar Khalsa, and which in our view could be taken as legitimising it and normalising its aims and actions in the eyes of viewers,” it notes. KTV is a television channel broadcasting largely to the Sikh community in the United Kingdom under a licence held by Khalsa Television Limited. Ofcom conducted its investigations after receiving complaints that the music video and discussion programme was likely to “encourage or incite crime or violence”. The music video in question contained an image of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which Ofcom noted “emphasised the video’s narrative of advocating violent action against the Indian state”. The discussion programme, being broadcast in Punjabi, meant Ofcom had to commission an English translation. It said that KTV was notified about the investigation and did not initially raise accuracy issues but later did, resulting in a second translation. It concluded that KTV failed to ensure that material which was “potentially highly offensive to viewers” was justified by the context and therefore in breach of its code. On its website, KTV describes itself as an exciting channel, airing a range of cultural, educational and entertaining programmes for audiences of all ages. It says it prides itself in being “completely independent, impartial and honest”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-media-watchdog-fines-khalsa-tv-for-violence-terror-references-101613244993839.html
14-02-2021||World||Closing arguments begin in Trump impeachment trial as Senate reaches deal to skip witnesses||The US Senate began hearing final arguments on Saturday in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump as the top Republican senator said he would vote to acquit the former president of inciting the deadly January 6 assault on the Capitol.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision means Trump is all but certain to be acquitted by the Senate of the charge of inciting an insurrection by his supporters.Before moving to final arguments, the proceedings were interrupted for a few hours after House prosecutors, in a surprise move, said they wanted to call witnesses at the trial.House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin said he wanted to call a Republican lawmaker as a witness but eventually agreed with Trump's defense lawyers just to have her testimony entered into evidence.Trump's lawyers had threatened in response to call witnesses of their own, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, and others.The Senate voted 55-45 to allow witnesses but senators, House prosecutors and defense lawyers then hammered out an agreement allowing the trial to proceed to closing arguments.The four hours of final arguments will be split equally between both sides with the House prosecutors going first.A vote on whether to acquit or convict the 74-year-old former Republican president is expected later Saturday afternoon.Raskin had wanted Representative Jamie Herrera Beutler to testify after she released a statement about the events of January 6.Herrera Beutler, a Republican from Washington state, was one of 10 Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach Trump in the House of Representatives.In her statement, she said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had called Trump while the attack was ongoing and implored him to call off the rioters."When McCarthy finally reached the president on January 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was Antifa that had breached the Capitol," Herrera Beutler said."McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters," the congresswoman said."That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said: 'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,'" she said.'A close call'Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House on January 13 for inciting the attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, who were seeking to block congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's November 3 election victory.A conviction in the 100-member Senate -- which is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans -- would require a two-thirds majority and appears highly unlikely after McConnell said he would vote to acquit.Also Read | Senate minority leader McConnell will vote to acquit Trump: Report"While a close call, I am persuaded that impeachments are a tool primarily of removal and therefore we lack jurisdiction," McConnell said in an email to his Republican colleagues."The Constitution makes perfectly clear that Presidential criminal misconduct while in office can be prosecuted after the President has left office," he said. "Given these conclusions, I will vote to acquit."Trump's defense lawyers argued on Friday that the former president bears no responsibility for the attack on Congress and wrapped up their presentation in just three hours.This followed two days of evidence from Democratic impeachment managers centered around harrowing video footage of the mob assault on the Capitol.Trump's defense lawyers called the impeachment unconstitutional and an "act of political vengeance."They argued that Trump's rally speech near the White House that preceded the January 6 attack, when he told supporters to "fight," was merely rhetorical.Seeking to turn the table on the Democrats' powerful use of video evidence, defense lawyers played their own compilations showing Democratic lawmakers at different times using the word "fight."House impeachment managers charge that after losing to Biden, Trump deliberately stoked tension with a campaign of lies claiming there had been mass voter fraud.On January 6 he staged a fiery rally near the White House, calling on the crowd to march on Congress, which was in the process of certifying Biden's victory.The mob then stormed the Capitol, disrupting the certification. Five people, including a police officer and a woman shot during the unrest, died in the mayhem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closing-arguments-begin-in-trump-impeachment-trial-as-senate-reaches-deal-to-skip-witnesses-101613240634576.html
14-02-2021||India||JeM planned terror attacks in Delhi; terrorists sourcing weapons from Bihar, says J-K DGP||Following the arrest of a top terrorist who had made a video of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval’s office, it has come to light that Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad is planning a strike in Delhi, J&K police chief Dilbag Singh said on Sunday.The Jammu and Kashmir DGP also disclosed that the terrorists in Kashmir have begun procuring weapons from Bihar and are using some students from Kashmir, studying in Punjab, for smuggling these illegal arms into the Valley. DGP Singh made these revelations in a news conference over the arrest of self-styled chief commanders Hidayatullah Malik and Zahoor Ahmad Rather, respectively of terror outfits Lashkar-e-Mustafa (LeM) and The Resistance Front (TRF).Malik was arrested on February 6 by the Anantnag police from Kunjwani in Jammu district while Rather was apprehended on February 13 from Bari Brahmana area of Samba district.The UT’s police chief said these two groups, LeM and TRF, are frontal organisations of Pakistan-based JeM and Lashker-e-Toiba (LeT) to give “Kashmiri name' to their terror activities. “Malik has been leading LeM floated last August although he had been an active militant for a long time. He had worked as an overground worker and floated the group on the directions of JeM,” said Singh.Malik was also planning to set up a base in Jammu to carry forward terror activities in the region besides receiving arms and ammunition, being smuggled from Pakistan through underground tunnels on the border or being dropped by drones before being smuggled to Kashmir, he said. Singh said JeM was involved in various terror activities in 2018 and Malik’s interrogation revealed that he was also a close associate of JeM commander Ashiq Nengroo who used to receive arms consignments from Pakistan in Jammu before escaping to the neighbouring country along with his family through an underground tunnel on the international border.The BSF has detected six underground tunnels along the IB in Jammu region over the past six months. After escaping to Pakistan, Nengroo alias doctor has been directing terror activities in Kashmir at the behest of Pakistani agencies, said the DGP, adding that Malik visited Delhi on Nengroo’s orders and forwarded him a video the NSA's office after recceing it, said the DGP.That means JeM is planning attacks on targets in Delhi as well, he said, adding Malik’s arrest is a big breakthrough for police as it has exposed the terrorist group’s plan.Malik, a resident of south Kashmir, had also set up a network to get weapons from Bihar and soured seven pistols from there till now and got them distributed among militants, the DGP said.“He had also roped in some students from Kashmir, studying in Punjab, and had been using them for any action in Kashmir or Jammu or transporting weapons from outside,” said Singh.In this context, the DGP also cited the example of a Kashmir-based nursing student in Chandigarh college who was arrested along with a seven-kg improvised explosive device from Jammu’s general bus stand area.The DGP said Malik was also involved in looting of ₹60 lakh from a bank’s cash van last November.This was established after the arrest of his four accomplices, including his wife, in this crime, he added.Terming TRF chief Rather’s arrest as another “major achievement”, Singh said he is a Pakistan-trained terrorist and is known by aliases “Sahil” and “Khalid” among militants. “He was also an active overground worker before crossing into Pakistan in 2002, where he underwent arms training and returned with five foreign terrorists through Rajouri route,” DGP Singh said “He, however, had surrendered in 2006 and remained inactive before resuming his activities in 2019,” the police chief said, adding his handlers in Pakistan know his potential and that is why made him the TRF’s chief. The DGP said he had set up a vast network in Kashmir and so far eight members of the group have been identified at his disclosure and some have also been arrested whose interrogation is on in Kashmir. Being a terrorist, who had surrendered earlier, helped Rather escape security agencies’ suspicion, said the DGP, adding the TRF chief was directly involved in the killing of three BJP workers in Kulgam and a policeman in Kokernag areas of south Kashmir last year.Rather is being questioned at present and his interrogation is likely to reveal new things, the DGP said.The Union Territory’s police chief also complimented his men for three major successful operations which led to the arrest of two self-styled commanders and recovery of IED to avert a major tragedy besides attempts by Pakistan to revive Al-Badr group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jem-planned-terror-attacks-in-delhi-says-j-k-dgp-101613323597867.html

Only those outside containment zones will be allowed to open up, it further mentioned.The guidelines said that mandatory hand hygiene and thermal screening should be ensured at the entrance and only asymptomatic staff and visitors should be allowed entry.The ministry further said that these measures need to be observed by all employees and visitors at all times. These include maintaining a minimum distance of 6 feet in common places, use of face covers or masks at all times and practising frequent hand washing.Meetings, as far as feasible should be done through video conferencing, it added.In case any covid case is reported despite taking the appropriate action, the management has to place the ill person in a room or area where they are isolated from others at the workplace, the guidelines mentioned"A risk assessment will be undertaken by the designated public health authority and accordingly further advice shall be made regarding the management of the case, his/her contacts and need for disinfection. The management of cases and contacts will be done as per the existing protocol," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/offices-can-resume-work-after-disinfection-if-covid-cases-reported-in-premises-101613317260863.html
14-02-2021||India||Centre issues fresh guidelines for offices. Here’s what you need to know||As India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are declining consistently and people are slowly transitioning from ‘work from home’ (WFH) to reporting to their offices, the Union ministry of health (MoHFW) has issued fresh guidelines for workplaces.The MoHFW said that offices could resume work after a disinfection process is carried out, in case infections were reported in the workplace. They would not be required to close or seal the premises if the disinfection is carried out properly, the ministry added.Listing out the guidelines, the ministry highlighted offices with relatively closer settings with shared spaces and the virus could spread faster. Therefore, there was a need to prevent the spread and respond “in a timely and effective manner in case suspect cases of Covid-19 is detected in these settings, so as to limit the spread of infection,” it said.Here is a look at the guidelines offices will be required to follow as they resume work:1. If an office premise records one or two coronavirus disease cases, then the disinfection process will be only limited to the areas or spots occupied by the infected person in the last 48 hours and work can restart post disinfection.2.

He did not use the word house-arrest. They didn’t trouble me but it was curtailing my movement. When I went for my morning walk at 7 on Sunday, the two cops followed me.”The policemen left by noon, he said. PM Modi arrived in Chennai at 11 am to inaugurate a slew of infrastructure projects and left for Kochi from the city.Balakrishnan said that he was in discussion with his associates about agitation in Chennai and had approached the commissioner’s office for permission which was denied and they had dropped their plans for other reasons. “We have a cordial relationship with the commissioner’ office," said Balakrishnan. “This seems pre-emptive and this usually doesn’t happen in Tamil Nadu.”A senior official belonging to the Pazhavanthangal police station, that covers the limit of Balakrishnan’s home, said, “I received instructions from higher officials to keep a watch on him.” The official did not wish to be named. “We didn’t ask for any reasons but we got to know that he may plan some agitation when the Prime Minister is visiting.”When asked about the incident, commissioner of police Mahesh Agarwal said that he wasn’t aware of it and his office hadn’t sent any instruction to keep him under vigil.During the prime minister's previous visits to Tamil Nadu in 2018 and 2019, several groups protested waving black flags led by pro-Tamil parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-keep-vigil-on-aikscc-tn-unit-head-during-pm-modi-s-chennai-visit-101613318297738.html
14-02-2021||India||PM Modi has no time for farmers, 'hopping' to poll-bound states, says D Raja||CPI National General Secretary D Raja on Sunday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "hopping" to poll-bound states,but not finding time to meet representatives of farmers who have been agitating for over two months, demanding repeal of the three contentious agri laws. The attack against Modi came on a day when he was in the city for inaugurating a slew of development projects,including the ₹6000 crore petrochemical complex of oil major Bharat Petroleum,hours after his visit to Tamil Nadu for inaugurating the Chennai Metro Rail phase-I extension and laying the foundation stones of various other schemes. Raja also attacked the opposition Congress led UDF for raking up the Sabarimala women's entry issue ahead of the assembly polls, due to be held in April-May. Addressing CPI(M)-LDF workers here after inaugurating the southern leg of the left rally, being led by CPI leader Binoy Vishwam, Raja said the Prime Minister was in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam and in Kerala. "Why is the PM hopping allover to states where elections are due?.... But Modi has no time to address farmers' concerns and has not met their representatives so far," he said. Lakhs of farmers have been staying put on the Delhi borders for over two months, demanding repeal of the three contentious farm laws, which, he said, are not in the interest of the country or the farmers. The states had not been consulted and this was an attack on the federal structure, he said. "Modiji aap kya Kisan ke sath hain?" (Modiji are you with the farmers?), he asked. Farmers create wealth and they should be protected. "Modi protects crony capitalists and he thinks serving their interests is serving the country", he alleged. The BJP and UDF cannot "hoodwink" people by raising religious issues, he said. "The Sabarimala issue is before the Supreme court. Let thecourt give its verdict. The LDF government will act appropriately. Politics and religion should remain separate. Why is UDF making it an election issue?, he asked. Kerala should emerge as a role model of the country to fight communal elements and corporates, he said. Hitting out at the BJP-RSS combine for posing a "grave threat" to the constitution of the country, he alleged that they have "unleashed aggressive campaigns against minorities, dalits adivasis We are seeing this from Karnataka to Uttar Pradesh". The Prime minister also came under attack for privatising public sector companies, which, Raja said, was the 'backbone' of the country's economy. He said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had stood up against the Centre over the privatisation of airports. "But the Modi government is determined to hand over airports and Air India and ports to private players,"Raja said. The CM had on Saturday inaugurated the northern part of the rally, being led by LDF convenorA Vijayaraghavan, at Kasaragod district. Vijayan had lashed out at the Opposition Congress and BJP, saying both the parties lost their moorings in Kerala and that the people were looking forward to the continuation of Left rule in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-has-no-time-for-farmers-hopping-to-poll-bound-states-says-d-raja-101613318030717.html

That is why the traffic on road during convoy movement is controlled, convoy limit has also been contained,” he said.Adil Dar, a resident of Pulwama, had blown himself up when he rammed an explosive-laden car into the CRPF convoy at Lethpora Pulwama killing 40 personnel. Terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for the suicide attack prompting the security forces to launch rigorous operations against militants in Kashmir.The attack had brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.Ratan said that a lot of movement of jawans now happens by air courier service. “Mostly the movement of ‘stores’ happens through convoys. Enough precautions are being taken on roads, bunkers have been installed and deployment has been made so that such an incident does not happen again, its possibility has been minimized,” he said.The forces are also making use of modern technology. “CCTVs have been installed at many points on the highway, drones are also being used. The movement of our vehicles generally takes places in bulletproof bunkers. Enough precautions, as well as equipment, have been installed to avoid such type of an incident,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-changes-made-after-pulwama-attack-inspector-general-crpf-101613316290603.html
14-02-2021||India||Punjab: SAD accuses Cong of misusing civil, police machinery in civic body polls||Chandigarh (Punjab) [India], February 14 (ANI): The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday lambasted the Congress party for misusing civil and police machinery to capture booths besides unleashing violence against the opposition to intimidate voters during municipal bodies in Punjab."The SAD had already cautioned the State Election Commission (SEC) about how democracy had been murdered in the runup to the municipal polls and how Congress goons were expected to indulge in booth capturing and other unfair practices today," said Daljit Singh Cheema, Former Minister and SAD spokesman in a statement.Cheema also said that despite the warning, no concrete steps were taken to control the situation and ensure free and fair elections in the state.Describing the law and order situation in the state, the SAD leader said that the Congress goons not only captured booths but also attacked opposition candidates and their supporters.He cited incidents and said that gunshots were fired in Patti in Tarn Taran district, the party supporters were injured with sharp weapons in Ropar and Fatehgarh Churian. Booths were captured in Mukatsar, Rajpura, Samana, Sultanpur Lodhi, Dinanagar, Ferozepur, Bhikiwind."An FIR was registered against Gauravdeep Singh Valtoha, son of senior SAD leader Virsa Singh Valtoha, and five others," Cheema said.Similarly, police raided the house of SAD candidates, Jaswinder Kaur, in ward number 26 in Khanna and registered a case against 13 members of the family including her husband. He said that same was done with Tej Chand Batra, the SAD candidate from ward number 18 in Mukatsar who was booked in an abduction case, as per the statement.The SAD leader also added that Congress goons openly tossed turbans of SAD workers and let loose a reign of terror but cases were registered against the victims. The police also opposed permission for videography in polling booths and no one was allowed to depute videography teams."The SEC also failed to ensure videography at sensitive places which resulted in large scale booth capturing," the leader alleged.The Congress party had repeated what it had done in the Zila Parishad and Panchayat Samiti elections because it knew it had lost the confidence of the people after failing to fulfill any of the promises made to them. The party was even jitterier in the municipal elections because it knew that all facilities were in shambles and people were suffering due to a thirty per cent increase in power tariff and other taxes, he added.Cheema said that the SAD had filed a complaint with all details with SEC and had demanded countermanding of elections at all places where there had been large scale booth capturing and violent incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-sad-accuses-cong-of-misusing-civil-police-machinery-in-civic-body-polls-101613312373664.html

Recently we had requested the state government to extend ₹113.47 crore financial assistance to make payment for the outstanding bills of PGCIL and to reinstate the letters of credit with central generating stations."Deliberations are going on at the highest levels of the government," the MeECL said in a statement.The MeECL was forced to regulate about 70MW of energy and the PGCIL wanted a firm commitment on payment of 50 per cent of dues in one week and a definite timeline for the remaining 50 per cent, it added.The state government has availed a loan of ₹1,345 crore under #AatmanirbharBharat from the Centre to clear all outstanding power purchase dues of the MeECL."The loan under the special package given by the Prime Minister will be disbursed to all gencos and transcos which include NEEPCO, OTPC, NHPC and PGCIL.

Five of the bodies were pulled out from the 1.7km long main tunnel of NTPC's hydel power project and seven others were recovered from various places.  Scientists have said that the flash flood in Chamoli was triggered by what could have been a large avalanche of glacier ice, which sent water, rocks and debris down the Dhauliganga river valley.Here what we know seven days after the disaster:1. Officials said the five bodies were recovered after the rescue workers cleared the muck inside the tunnel of the Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Plant at a distance of about 130 metres. They were among the 35 workers trapped inside the tunnel including about 30 workers trapped in another smaller underground tunnel beneath the main one.  2. "In the morning two bodies were first recovered inside the tunnel after clearing the muck at a distance of about 125-130 metres. Following that, three more bodies were recovered till Sunday afternoon,” Swati S Bhadauria, Chamoli’s district magistrate, said. 3. "The administration has kept seven ambulances and a chopper on standby in case any of the workers is found alive from the tunnel,” Bhadauria said. 4. Rescuers are also conducting vertical drilling to reach out to the smaller tunnel to rescue about 30 workers trapped inside.5. “On Saturday, the rescue workers finished drilling vertically in the main tunnel to reach out to a small underground tunnel beneath it at a depth of 12.7 metres. They, however, hit slush after drilling the required depth which they have been pumping out to get inside to search for workers trapped inside it." 6. Rescue workers recovered the seven other bodies from Raini village near the Rishi Ganga hydel power project, the first one to be hit by the flash floods on Sunday. The remaining one body was recovered from Rudraprayag district in the Alaknanda river.7. Nilesh Anand Bharne, deputy inspector general (law and order), said tout of the 50 bodies which have been pulled out, 25 have been identified. "Of the 50 bodies, 41 were recovered from Chamoli district, seven from Rudraprayag and one each from Tehri Garhwal and Pauri Garhwal districts," Bharne said.  8. Bharne said that rescue workers have also recovered 23 human body parts. “DNA samples of all the body parts and dead bodies have been collected to ascertain their identities,” he added. 9. Rescue workers have so far cremated 32 bodies and 11 human body parts “with complete rituals and respect”, he added.10. “The rescue workers are working tirelessly to recover the remaining bodies. The family members can contact helpline numbers- 01372-251487 and 9084127503 for any queries or help," said Bharne.  11. An eight-member team of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), which had gone on foot to gather information about the glacier lake about 8km above Raini village, said that the 350-metre lake poses no threat of any flash floods as water is continuously draining out in the form of a stream.  12. The SDRF team also created a makeshift helipad near the glacial lake that a helicopter could land there, if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-flash-flood-death-toll-reaches-50-154-still-missing-after-a-week-101613309013706.html

Therefore, we were on a high alert." Inspector General of Police (Jammu zone) Mukesh Singh told reporters.Two years ago on this day, a Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy in Pulwama killing 40 troopers.“Late Saturday our patrol nabbed a man from the bus stand area with a bag and recovered a 6.5 kg IED from it,” Singh said.Earlier in the day, a police officer had said that the IED was recovered on Sunday.The terrorist, a student of a nursing college in Chandigarh, has been identified as Suhail Bashir of Pulwama.The IGP said that during questioning Suhail divulged that handlers of al-Badr in Pakistan had given him the task to plant a powerful IED in any of the three to four areas of Jammu city."Raghunath Temple, Jammu railway station, general bus stand and Lakhdatta Bazaar (jewellers' market) were the targets," the IGP said.After planting the IED he had to take a flight to Srinagar where a top over ground worker of al-Badr, Athar Shakeel Khan had to receive him and induct him as an active member of al-Badr, the officer said.The IGP said that two more men - Qazi Waseem from Chandigarh and Abid Nabi - who had the information about the plan to plant the IED, have also been arrested."Had the IED exploded, it would have caused mass destruction," he said.Director General of Police Dilbag Singh said that police in recent times also arrested Hidayatullah Malik and Zahoor Ahmad Rather, self-styled chief Lashkar-e-Mustafa, an offshoot of Jaish-e-Mohammad and The Resistance Front, an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba from Jammu."Their arrest, recovery of IED and arrest of al-Badr militant are three big achievements of Anantnag, Jammu and Samba police,” he said.The DGP also said that another terrorist Ashiq Nengroo, who used to transport terrorists to Kashmir after receiving them on the international border in Jammu through tunnels and intrusions, escaped to Pakistan with his family via one such tunnel in December 2019 and has been given the task to fuel terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.The IED recovery comes close on the heels of the arrest of two top terrorists from Kunjwani in Jammu and Bari Brahmana area of Samba districts.Zahoor Ahmad Rather, a top terrorist affiliated with The Resistance Front (TRF) who was wanted in connection with the killing of three BJP workers and a policeman in south Kashmir last year, was arrested in Bari Brahmana area of Samba on Saturday.Earlier on February 6, self-styled commander of the Lashkar-e-Mustafa (LeM), Hidayatullah Malik, alias "Hasnain", was held from the Kunjwani area of Jammu."Obviously there are now attempts by Pakistan and various terror outfits to create disturbance in Jammu region", said a senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-police-foil-major-terror-plot-in-jammu-seize-ied-from-al-badr-man-101613309157211.html

Even if it is not necessary, if snakes are identified, the treatment will be better. WhatsApp groups for helping doctors identifying snakes are working with the help of research. This app will help doctors as well as the public."Das also said that there are about 3,600 species of snakes known so far in the world and over 300 species are found in India."Among 300 species, about 100 are known from Kerala who belong to 12 different families. Over 700 pictures of these are included with up to 20 photographs of various colour morphs for some snakes. These photographs were taken by more than 130 people inside and outside the state. This includes researchers, wildlife enthusiasts and photographers," he added.Naveenalal Payyeri and Dr Jinesh, who are part of the team that developed the app said that Snakepedia was developed as an answer to the question of how to find a useful way for the general public to identify snakes."It also has an online helpline menu for identification of snakes. Mostly this is an offline app. All features except podcast and online ID helpline are offline," they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/app-launched-in-kerala-to-help-people-doctors-treat-snake-bites-101613307055335.html

She is a founder of a group named Fridays For Future and is a graduate with a bachelor’s degree in business administration.Delhi Police officials had earlier said that Ravi is a key lead in the "toolkit" case as she had admitted during the initial interrogation to editing, adding some things in the "toolkit" and spreading it further.Earlier this month, the Delhi Police had registered a first information report (FIR) for sedition, promoting hatred among groups and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on February 4 after Thunberg tweeted the “toolkit” while expressing her support to the farmers’ protest in India.Also read: Breach of privilege for calling 'Greta Thunberg persona non grata'Last week, the Delhi Police had sent a communication to Google seeking registration details and activity log of the account through which the "toolkit" related to the farmers' protest was created and uploaded on the social media platform.The arrest by Delhi Police comes as the ongoing stir by farmers on the borders of the national capital enters the 81st day. Seeking a repeal of the three contentious farm laws, the protesters have been camping on Delhi's borders since late November last year and have also engaged with the government in 11 rounds of talks to end the continuing standoff with little progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-ravi-shared-google-toolkit-with-greta-thunberg-says-delhi-police-101613303796011.html

14-02-2021||India||Peter Mukerjea pens memoir, says not a set of 'kiss-and-tell' stories||Beleaguered media baron Peter Mukerjea has come out with his memoir, which he says is just a personal recollection of his experiences in the satellite television industry in India and is neither intended to open a can of worms nor is a set of kiss-and-tell stories."It is intended purely to share my journey, to highlight and showcase the plenty of mistakes made and the plenty of lessons learnt over almost three decades," says the former chief executive of Star India, who was media mogul Rupert Murdoch's right-hand man once in the television industry of the region."Starstruck: Confessions of a TV Executive" is the story of the Indian television industry, authored by the man who was at the forefront of it all."This book is a memoir. No more than that. It is a personal recollection of my experiences at the coalface in the formative years of the satellite television industry in India and a super-fast-changing media landscape. This is not intended to open a can of worms, nor is it a set of kiss-and-tell stories," Mukerjea says."It is intended purely to share my journey, to highlight and showcase the plenty of mistakes made and the plenty of lessons learnt over almost three decades," he writes.The early '90s marked an age of American TV dominating the world, from "Baywatch" to "Cheers" to "The Jerry Springer Show". Only that approach wasn't working so well in India, where access to one billion TV viewers was dominated by a powerful terrestrial network.Sensing a once-in-a-generation opportunity, Murdoch gave Mukerjea a seemingly impossible task - to grow a tiny foreign-owned TV channel in India into one of the biggest in the world. Mukerjea was instrumental in transforming a loss-making Star TV into a billion-dollar network.According to Mukerjea, neither Star founder Richard Li nor Murdoch had considered India to be a worthy market for their business model."The adoption of India as a key market was a completely new element and fell into their laps by default… The Indian consumer was changing rapidly and television was one of the main catalysts of this change. Ready access to a television and an international standard of content meant consumers were glued to their sets," he writes.The book, published by Westland, also talks in detail how Amitabh Bachchan was hired as a host for "Kaun Banega Crorepati".The author says that KBC was originally conceived as Kaun Banega Lakhpati with a prize of ₹one lakh. But Murdoch believed that the prize money was way too little to trigger any interest from viewers. Murdoch, who was in India that time, then decided to increase the prize to ₹one crore."Had Rupert not been in town that week and turned KBL into KBC, I doubt if Star TV would have been able to make a go of it in India," Mukerjea says."Amitabh would rise from the ashes like the proverbial phoenix and Star TV would propel itself off the back of KBC to heights that the television industry in India had never seen," he goes on to say about the deal.Soon, everyone at Star "focussed their attention on KBC and used it like a battering ram to knock a hole through their competitors' doors"."We had helped recreate and revive the legend of Amitabh Bachchan, and in turn he had carried Star Plus on his back, turning it into the most watched, most discussed and most profitable television channel in the country," says Mukerjea.He also writes about how Star roped in Ekta Kapoor and how her "soaps were able to touch on sensitive issues that Indian television shows either avoided or swept under the carpet".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peter-mukerjea-pens-memoir-says-not-a-set-of-kiss-and-tell-stories-101613296055126.html
14-02-2021||India||Premium petrol price crosses ₹100 mark in 3 Rajasthan districts||Premium petrol price crossed ₹100 mark in three districts of Rajasthan on Sunday riding on the sixth consecutive day of rise in fuel prices in the backdrop of a political blame game between the BJP and the Congress over fixing responsibility for the continued hike, which is likely to impact millions of consumers with a likely rise in prices of vegetables and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG).Premium petrol was selling at ₹102.07 per litre in Sri Ganganagar district, the highest rate in the state, followed by Hanumangarh – ₹101.42, Bikaner- ₹100.24 and Barmer- ₹99.43. In capital Jaipur, the price of premium petrol was ₹97.95.Both the Centre and the state governments have blamed each other for levying steep taxes on fuel prices.“While the Indian government is trying its best to reduce the prices of petrol, the Ashok Gehlot government in the state has enough allocations to reduce fuel prices. It depends on him how much he wants to ease the load on people,” said Union minister Smriti Irani, during a press conference at the BJP headquarters in Jaipur on February 7.The Rajasthan government late last month cut the value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel by 2% after the price of premium petrol crossed ₹100/litre-mark in Sri Ganganagar district. Despite this, the state has the highest VAT at 36% plus ₹1,500 per kilolitre road cess on petrol. On diesel, the state levies 26% VAT and ₹1,750 per kilolitre road cess.Prices of petrol and diesel across the country are market-determined and attract uniform central excise duty, but their prices differ from state to state because of the wide variations in the local levies or value-added tax. The Central government levies ₹32.98 per litre of excise duty on petrol and ₹31.83 a litre on diesel. Central and state taxes make up for over 61 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and about 56 per cent of diesel.The international oil prices touched USD 61 per barrel for the first time in more than a year on improving demand and hope amid the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines further sending the fuel prices through the roof.However, Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.The Ashok Gehlot government stated last month that it had decided to cut down VAT rates on fuel to ease the burden on consumers despite it hitting the state revenues.“With the reduction in VAT rates, the government’s revenue will reduce by approximately ₹1000 crore annually,” a statement from CM’s office said on January 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/premium-petrol-price-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-3-rajasthan-districts-101613296075834.html

14-02-2021||India||Union minister cautions Odisha over AP holding rural polls in state territory||A day after neighbouring Andhra Pradesh conducted rural polls in some villages under Odisha territory, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan Sunday expressed concern over the matter and cautioned the state government that situation may aggravate if required pre-emptive measures were not taken to resolve the inter-state dispute. Pradhan in a statement said that though the Odisha government has taken legal recourse to resolve the border discord, it should be taken to a conclusive end. "We may encounter more worse situations if timely measures are not taken at proper time," he said, adding the AP holding panchayat polls in the border villages by including people of Koraput, Ganjam and Gajapati, has certainly created bitterness between the two states. Ignoring opposition from Odisha government, Andhra Pradesh on Saturday conducted gram panchayat polls in Kotia area of Koraput district, the region on which both the states have been staking their claim. Even though district magistrate of Koraput Abdaal Akhtar had written a letter to his Vizianagaram counterpart requesting not to hold elections in the disputed Kotia region as the matter is sub-judice in the Supreme Court, the Andhra government set up polling booth at Potu Senari and voting was held under a thick security cover. The Odisha government had approached the Supreme Court against Andhra Pradesh for holding panchayat polls in Kotia and the Apex Court had on Friday served notice to the Andhra government and posted the case for February 19. Pradhan, who hails from Odisha, said the state government should give utmost priority to the border villages by implementing welfare schemes. "It is our responsibility to protect the boundary of our state and ensure that our brothers and sisters living in the border villages avail all the benefits of the welfare schemes of the state government," Pradhan said. He also urged Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik to seriously take up the matter and do the needful at the earliest before it is too late. The Union Petroleum minister pointed out that the border disputes with Andhra Pradesh or any other state, many times generate hostilities which should not happen at all. He said all political parties, social organisations and individuals should put their best efforts to keep Odishas boundary intact. "A collective effort is required for maintaining the states territory and resolves the border disputes with other states," Pradhan said. The issue has sparked a political row in the eastern state with opposition BJP and Congress accusing the BJD government of failing to protect the states territory. Congress had on Saturday criticised the states BJD government, saying the chief ministers incompetence led to Andhra Pradesh holding polls in the Odisha territory. The state BJP president Samir Mohanty also came down heavily on the state BJD government, accusing it of not being able to protect the state's territory. He said BJP will soon set up a border security cell to look after the grievances of the people living in the bordering areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-cautions-odisha-over-ap-holding-rural-polls-in-state-territory-101613295608299.html
14-02-2021||India||Over 2,300 people died of drug overdose from 2017-19; highest fatalities in 30-45 year age group: Data||Over 2,300 people died due to drug overdose from 2017-19 in India with the highest number of such fatalities recorded in the age group of 30-45 years, according to the data by the National Crime Records Bureau.A total of 745 deaths due to drug overdose were recorded in 2017, 875 deaths in 2018 and 704 deaths in 2019, it stated.The highest number of deaths was reported in Rajasthan at 338, followed by Karnataka at 239 and Uttar Pradesh at 236, as per the data.The highest number of deaths from 2017-19 was recorded in the age group of 30-45 years at 784, it said.Below the age of 14 years, as many as 55 children died due to drug overdose. Seventy children died in the age group of 14-18 years.A total of 624 people died in the age bracket of 18-30 years and 550 people died in the age group of 45-60 years due to drug overdose, the data said.In the age group of 60 and above, 241 people died, it added.To tackle substance abuse, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment recently launched the ‘Nasha Mukht Bharat Abhiyan’ (NMBA) for 272 most-affected districts. The scheme employs a three-pronged approach -- combining efforts of the narcotics bureau, outreach and awareness by social justice and treatment through health department.A senior official said the NMBA will be further strengthened and continued under the National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction (NAPDDR), under which 13,000 youth volunteers in 272 districts will be trained as community mobilisers against drug abuse.He said around 11.80 lakh people would be benefited under the NAPDDR in the financial year 2021-22.Experts say to tackle the issue of substance abuse the government should be looking into long-term intensive treatment and rehabilitation.Loon Gangte, regional coordinator for South Asia at the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, said employment opportunities must be provided after rehabilitation."It needs to be ensured what happens after rehab rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is the easy path. After rehabilitation, about 80-90 per cent fall back into addiction so there needs to be a plan for it. The government should think beyond rehabilitation. Affected people must be provided employment too which will help in keeping them occupied," Gangte said.Akhila Sivadas, executive director at the Centre for Advocacy and Research, a non-profit organisation, said to prevent deaths caused by drug overdose, there must intensive treatment including long-term treatment using state of art regimens and methods for those who are into substance usage."This issue requires both investment and political will," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2-300-people-died-of-drug-overdose-from-2017-19-highest-fatalities-in-30-45-year-age-group-data-101613294108240.html
14-02-2021||India||Surrender to China: Antony on disengagement in areas of eastern Ladakh||Senior Congress leader AK Antony said on Sunday accused the Centre of not giving priority to national security at a time when the country is facing a two-front war from Pakistan and China. Antony, a former defence minister, also said the increase in the allocation to the defence sector is meagre and a “betrayal of the country” even as India is facing multiple challenges at borders."For the first time, India is facing two front war-like situation- one from Pakistan and now China becoming more belligerent by building infrastructure and military mobilisation across India-China border mainly from eastern Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The Narendra Modi government is not giving proper priority to national security,” Antony said during a press briefing.Also watch: Ex-defence minister slams troops disengagement in Ladakh﻿﻿The Congress leader’s comments come days after defence minister Rajnath Singh announced the disengagement agreement on the north and west bank of Pangong Lake in Ladakh with China. "The agreement that we have been able to reach with the Chinese side for disengagement in the Pangong lake area envisages that both sides will cease their forward deployments in a phased, coordinated and verified manner. The Chinese side will keep its troop presence in the North Bank area to the east of Finger 8. Reciprocally, the Indian troops will be based at their permanent base at Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3," the defence minister had said in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.Also read | Disengagement to be completed by next Fri; PLA forces move beyond Finger 8Antony said that this disengagement at Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and buffer zone creation is a surrender and added that the government must support our armed forces at a time when India is facing two-front war-like situation at borders. "The entire India-China border needs 24 hours attention. Our armed forces are ready, but they need the support of the nation and the government. Chinese are modernising the army, building the infrastructure and consolidating their positions. We also need matching support to the armed forces,” he said.The former defence minister said that disengagement was good as it reduced tension but it should not be done at the cost of national security. “Both disengagements in Galwan and Pangong Tso are a surrender. We are surrendering our rights," he alleged, adding that it amounted to surrendering of areas traditionally controlled by India and added that Galwan Valley was never a disputed land even in 1962.Also read | China’s actions along LAC led to distrust, confrontation: Army chiefAntony also slammed the Union Budget, under which finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman envisaged an outlay of ₹30,42,230 crore, out of which ₹3,37,553 crore was allocated for the defence, excluding pension. "When India is facing a war-like situation, when Chinese are everywhere at the border, everyone expected a substantial increase in the defence budget. Our armed forces demanded an increase both in the capital and revenue expenditure. The government is showing so much bravado, but practically, there is a 1.48 per cent increase, compared to the revised budget last year,” he pointed out.The Congress leader also warned that China can “play mischief” anytime by helping Pakistan in the Siachen area. “We want to know from this government when there will be status quo ante as on mid-April 2020 in the entire India-China border," he said.Antony also said that the government must take the country and the people into confidence on the restoration of status quo ante at the borders. He said the government always consulted leaders of all political parties before taking such a decision and must keep national security in mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surrender-to-china-antony-on-disengagement-in-areas-of-eastern-ladakh-101613293903074.html

The 18-year-old Thunberg, however, later deleted the original tweet.The special cell will now make further inquiries after Disha's remand.More arrests in this case have not been ruled out, news agency ANI said quoting unnamed police officials.Last week, the Delhi Police had sent a communication to Google seeking registration details and activity log of the account through which the "toolkit" related to the farmers' protest was created and uploaded on the social media platform.The arrest by Delhi Police comes as the ongoing stir by farmers on the borders of the national capital enters the 81st day. Seeking repeal of the three contentious farm laws, the protesters have been camping on Delhi's borders since late November last year and have also engaged with the government in 11 rounds of talks to end the continuing standoff with little progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-activist-disha-ravi-remanded-to-5-day-delhi-police-special-cell-custody-101613292598663.html

14-02-2021||India||Congress fights polls to help BJP win, alleges AAP's Manish Sisodia||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday alleged the Congress fights elections to help the BJP win, and asserted the main contest in the upcoming local body polls in Gujarat is between the ruling BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party.Talking to reporters ahead of his roadshow in Surat, Sisodia claimed the people of Gujarat are looking at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a "strong political alternative" and with a hope to defeat the BJP, which has ruled various local bodies in the state for more than two decades.Elections to six municipal corporations - Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar - will be held on February 21.Besides, polls to various other municipalities, district panchayats and taluka panchayats in Gujarat will be held on February 28.The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP has for the first time fielded candidates across various local bodies in Gujarat, and Surat is the third city in the state where Sisodia held a roadshow after Ahmedabad and Rajkot."I am happy to see the contest in the local body polls in Gujarat is between the BJP and AAP. People want to give a chance to Kejriwal's politics after looking at his governance in Delhi," Sisodia said.The AAP leader further said he visited Ahmedabad, Rajkot, and now Surat, where people told him how they are "fed up with the BJP and want it to be defeated".He claimed people told him that they earlier wanted to defeat the BJP, but the Congress was their only alternative."The Congress contests elections to help the BJP win. Its strategy is to help the BJP win," Sisodia alleged.Today, people have got an alternative. They are not just looking at the AAP as an alternative, but also as a hope, he said.Sisodia further claimed people understand it is the AAP, and "not the Congress", which can defeat the BJP."We will get full majority. Our target is to defeat the BJP," he said.Sisodia said people of Gujarat are comparing the 25- year-old rule of the BJP in the state's local bodies to the five-year rule of the AAP in Delhi and they can "clearly see a difference".He said people can see how in just a short period of five years, Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal ensured government schools are developed in a such a way that they can compete with private schools.On the other hand, in Gujarat, government schools are being shut down, he claimed."If private schools in Delhi can be stopped from raising fees in an arbitrary manner, then why can't the BJP do the same in Gujarat?" he sought to know."If in just five years, government hospitals in Delhi can be turned fabulous, then why are hospitals in Surat, Ahmedabad, Rajkot in shambles?" he further asked.Sisodia said if the Kejriwal government in Delhi can ensure free electricity to 70 per cent citizens and free drinking water to them, then why can't the same be done in Gujarat."We hope that very soon, the BJP will start getting defeated," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-fights-polls-to-help-bjp-win-alleges-aap-s-manish-sisodia-101613290402346.html

The state police, which are yet to establish the veracity of the threat, have cited it as another evidence of Maoists growing ‘frustration’ in the region.The threat, issued on February 9, went viral on social media on Saturday.The press note, titled “Patrkaar Evam Samaj Sevak Ke Aad Mein Corporate Gharano Kee Seva Mein Lage Farukh Ali Dalali Harqaton kee Ninda Karo...”, called for condemnation of ‘persons like Farukh Ali’ who, the press note alleged, were ‘serving the corporate families in the name of journalism and activism.’“The corrupt and agents of corporate will surely be punished in the janadalat ( kangaroo court)..,” claimed the press statement, purportedly issued by the southern sub-zonal bureau of outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist).The note named former BBC journalist Shubhranshu Choudhary, journalists Ganesh Mishra and Leeladhar Rathi, anti-Maoists campaigners Farukh Ali and P Vijay as ‘corporate and government agents’.“I have been continuously speaking against the violence by the Maoists in the Bastar region and their threats are not surprising to me. I condemn the allegations made against me and other journalists,” said Ali.Meanwhile, inspector general of police (Bastar) Sundarraj P said that police are still confirming the authenticity of the press statement.“We are yet to ascertain the authenticity of the press statement issued by the Maoists. If it is true, then it reflects the growing frustration and madness in the Maoist ranks,” said the IG.Sunderaj further claimed that Maoists were rattled after losing ground, drying up recruits and disaffection in the public in recent times and were thoroughly confused.“The Maoists have fallen prey to the typical ‘if you are not my friend then you are my enemy’ syndrome. This thought and behaviour of the Maoist leadership would prove to be the final nail in their coffin,” said the IG.Ganesh Mishra, a journalist based in Bijapur said that he was hurt after being accused of supporting big businesses and the government.“I have always worked for the people of Bastar. I don’t know why Maoists have accused me of supporting corporate firms, but I am deeply hurt,” said Mishra.“I think this is the sixth press note threatening me in the last few years. I will request them (Maoists) to ponder on the mess they have created in an effort to create a better world and think how we can work together to solve some of the problems they correctly raise in each press note,” said Chaudhary.In December 2020, Maoists had purportedly issued threats to woman journalist Pushpa Rokde accusing her of being a police informer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-maoists-threaten-scribes-activists-for-alleged-corporate-links-101613287851136.html

This year orders to make only 90 idols have been received. This has been due to the ongoing corona pandemic.""Presumably this year Saraswati Puja will be celebrated online in most of the educational institutions in view of the Corona infection," he added.With public events banned due to coronavirus pandemic, idol makers, sculptors and craftsmen were among the worst-hit groups.Uttam Paul another sculptor said that the government provided no assistance to the sculptors during the lock-down period. He also said the orders for idols are less this year."Every year Saraswati Puja was widely performed in educational institutions and neighbourhoods. But in the wake of the coronavirus infection, the festivities have been curtailed," he added.Saraswati Puja is a prominent Hindu festival that marks the arrival of the spring season as per the Hindu calendar. The day is celebrated every year on the fifth day of the month of Magh as per the lunar calendar.There is a tradition of worshipping Goddess Saraswati, who is considered as the deity of wisdom, intellect and learning. It is also a day when many toddlers step into the world of formal education. Many parents enrol their students to school on the day, where they seek Goddess Saraswati's blessings in their pursuit of knowledge, art, music and culture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-artisans-hope-for-better-business-in-saraswati-puja-amid-ongoing-pandemic-101613281819162.html

They have died in the same ratio. Out of one to two lakh, do 200 people not die in six months? Someone is dying of a heart attack and someone after falling ill."When asked why no condolences have been offered to those who died during the agitation while the Prime Minister expresses grief when people are killed in accidents, Dalal said, "but they didn't die in accidents. They died by choice... Anyway, I offer my deepest condolences to all those who died."The Haryana minister said, “The common farmer is naive, some joined (the protests) due to sympathy, some due to community or for some other reason.”आंदोलन में संघर्षरत अन्नदाताओं के लिए इन शब्दों का प्रयोग एक संवेदनहीन और संस्कारहीन व्यक्ति ही कर सकता है।शर्म, मगर इनको आती नहीं।पहले किसानों को पाकिस्तान व चीन समर्थक बताने वाले हरियाणा के कृषि मंत्री जेपी दलाल को कैबिनेट से बर्खास्त किया जाना चाहिए।#Farmers_Lives_Matter pic.twitter.com/la71GiA7ivAs the video went viral, Congress national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also took to Twitter to slam the minister. “These words can only be used by an insensitive and riteless person for the struggling contributors in the movement. Shame, but they don't know Haryana Agriculture Minister JP Dalal, who first described farmers as pro-Pakistan and China, should be dismissed from the cabinet,” he wrote on Twitter in Hindi.Dalal later apologised for his comments and alleged that they were "twisted" and a "wrong meaning" was given to his statement. "During the press conference, I condoled the demise of farmers who died during the protest. Even if a person dies unnaturally, it is painful. As far as the matter of giving the status of martyred is considered, the Jawans are given this status as the government has made policy for it," the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI."My statement was twisted and the wrong meaning was given to it. I saw the video on social media. I tender my apologies if somebody was hurt by my statement. As Haryana's Agriculture Minister, I am working for the welfare of the farmers," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wouldve-died-at-home-too-haryana-minister-on-farmers-deaths-during-protests-101613280935872.html

14-02-2021||India||2 years after Pulwama terror attack, safer convoy movements now||Two years since a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar rammed his explosive-laden car in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy on the national highway in Pulwama killing 40 troopers, a lot has changed in terms of convoy movement and the way troops secure their camps in the Kashmir valley.Immediately after the deadly attack on that fateful day that pushed India and Pakistan to the brink of war, the CRPF decided to completely overhaul its SOP (standard operating procedure) for moving convoys on the highways. Instead of moving in large convoys, like the one on February 14, 2019 with 78 vehicles, it was decided that personnel will move in smaller contingents with a maximum of 40 vehicles.A Superintendent of Police rank officer started commandeering the convoys and troops were ordered to strictly adhere to the ‘passenger manifest discipline’ for each vehicle in the convoy.Since the attack, the majority of vehicles used for convoy movements have been upgraded to withstand bullet and low intensity Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosions.The ROPs (road opening parties), which are placed before the convoy moves on the highway, have been strengthened and trained for early warning mechanisms in identifying suspects who could attack the moving vehicles. Subsequently, there is better coordination between central intelligence agencies, Jammu and Kashmir police and army on possible terror threats, people familiar with the developments said.A major decision taken after the Pulwama attack was to restrict the movement of civilian vehicles on the highway when the convoys of security forces are on the move.The government has also allowed all personnel to take a flight to Srinagar from either Jammu or Delhi and air courier service for the central paramilitary forces has been increased by adding flights from Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu and back.A senior CRPF official, requesting anonymity, said “We keep changing our strategy depending on the ground situation. The convoys are safe now. Also, large numbers of terrorists have been neutralized and there is constant watch on terror groups”.Similarly, the security of camps has been increased in Jammu and Kashmir by all forces in the last two-three years. People familiar with the developments said that since the 2016 Uri attack and then Pulwama attack (2019), the perimeter or outer cordon security at most camps in Kashmir has been doubled and most personnel have been equipped with latest arms and ammunitions and night vision devices. The vehicles are now not allowed to park outside security forces’ camps and there is regular audit of personnel, vehicles, arms and ammunition and intelligence is shared in real time with all camps/headquarters offices.To mark the second anniversary of Pulwama attack, the CRPF will organize a wreath laying ceremony at its Lethpora camp in Pulwama to pay tributes to 40 jawans. The event will be watched by all CRPF formations across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-years-after-pulwama-terror-attack-safer-convoy-movements-now-101613279440354.html

Hence, I could not start the 'One-Rupee' clinic. But I was promoted as assistant professor recently and as an assistant professor, I am allowed to do private practice after my duty hours and hence, I have started the clinic in a rented house now", said the 38-year-old doctor.Asked why he charges one Rupee, Ramchandani said "I charge one Rupee from the poor and underprivileged people as I don't want them to feel that they are availing the service free of cost. They should also think that they have paid some money for their treatment."The clinic, which has been set up at the Kachha Market area in Burla town remain open from 7 AM to 8 AM in the morning and 6 PM to 7 PM in the evening. The 'One-Rupee' clinic has provided him with an opportunity to serve the poor, destitute, unprivileged, elderly persons, physically challenged people and the people who do not have access to proper medical care."I am a doctor of the masses and not the classes", he said.Also read| Over 8 mn health, frontline workers vaccinated against Covid-19 in India: GovtRamchandani said hundreds of people regularly come to the OPD of VIMSAR and one can find a long queue of patients to consult doctors. "I have seen elderly people and people with disabilities waiting for hours for consultation with doctors in OPD. They dont need to wait for hours and suffer at the hospital. They can come to my clinic and get consultation at Rupee 1 only," he added.Ramchandani's wife, Sikha Ramchandani, a dental surgeon, is also helping him. The clinic was inaugurated on Friday and 33 patients came to the clinic on the first day, he said.Ramchandani, who had also hit the headlines when he took a leprosy patient carrying hin his arms and dropped him in his house in 2019, said, "my late father, Brahmanand Ramchandani had told me to set up a nursing home. But a nursing home requires huge investment and it is not possible to provide treatment to poor people at Rupee 1 in a nursing home. Hence, I decided to open this 'One-Rupee' clinic."Ramchandani had also drawn the attention of all and received widespread appreciation when he attended a Covid-19 patient beyond his duty hour and also carried the patient to VIMSAR in his car amid the scourge of novel coronavirus in October last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramchandanis-one-rupee-clinic-to-treat-the-poor-in-odisha-s-sambalpur-101613276968516.html

The Indian envoys in Ottawa and Vancouver were threatened by so-called Khalistan separatists under the garb of protests against the three farm laws. However, action against identified culprits by Indian High Commission is still to be taken even as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is investigating the issue.Closer to home, the Ministry of External Affairs on Saturday approved supply of Covid vaccine to armies of friendly countries with Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal top on the priority list. It was decided that the supplies to armed forces of friendly countries will be dealt by Indian armed forces as a sign of deepening defence cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-supply-5-lakh-doses-of-covid-vaccine-to-canada-after-trudeau-call-to-pm-modi-101613279340845.html

14-02-2021||India||Cong MP Reddy says BJP implementing East India Company model, says rules empower corporates||Slamming the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Telangana Congress working president Revanth Reddy has compared the Centre with the East India Company, alleging that the ruling party is adopting the model of the former coloniser by bringing corporates into every sector, including agriculture.This comment came as Telangana Congress working president's padyatra (foot march), in support of farmers protest, entered Hyderabad on Saturday.The Member of Parliament from Malkajgiri is holding a 10-day-long padayatra which started from Achampeta in Nagarkurnool district and will culminate at Raviryal in Rangareddy district on February 16.Revanth Reddy told ANI, "After trying a lot to convince the Central government to take back the three farm laws that harm the farming community, Centre has not responded to it in a proper way. So, now we from Congress have decided to go on 'padayatra' (march) to support the protest farmers against the farm laws that have been passed by Union Government."Drawing parallels between the Central government and East India Company, Reddy said," This is what happened when East India Company came to the Indian subcontinent. They came for trade and then gradually took control over several kingdoms and rules for several hundred years. BJP is trying to bring the corporates into every sector of work. They are trying to bring in the East India Company Model."On Centre's stand on the farm laws, the Congress leader alleged, "The BJP is bluffing the people and especially the farmers, by making promises about MSP and other promises by word of mouth. There is no guarantee on minimum support price (MSP), there is no provision in the bill that a farmer can approach the courts when they have a problem with the corporates."Further slamming the BJP, Reddy said," The BJP is trying to divert the people of this nation and the farmers of this nation by saying that Congress party is trying to mislead the farmers."He also targeted the Telangana government and alleged that it was walking hand in hand with the Centre. "TRS has shown it support to BJP since the beginning. KCR and Modi are the two sides of the same coin," he alleged.The Central government has offered to put the farm laws "on hold" for 12-18 months, an offer rejected by the farmers' unions protesting against the laws. Several rounds of talks have been held with farmers over their demand for the repeal of three new laws.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws.

14-02-2021||India||Russians set for candle-lit Valentine's Day protests after Navalny jailing||Supporters of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny plan to hold candle-lit gatherings in residential courtyards across Russia on Sunday despite warnings that they could be arrested.Navalny's allies have declared a moratorium on street rallies until the spring after police detained thousands of people at protests in the past few weeks against the opposition politician's arrest and imprisonment.But they want Russians to show solidarity with Navalny by gathering outside their homes for 15 minutes on Valentine's Day evening, shining their mobile phone torches and arranging candles in the shape of a heart."(President Vladimir) Putin is fear. Navalny is love. That's why we will win," Leonid Volkov, one of Navalny's close allies, wrote on Twitter when calling on people to gather.Navalny was arrested last month on his return from Germany following treatment for poisoning, in Siberia, with what many Western countries say was a nerve agent. He was jailed on Feb. 2 for violating parole on what he said were trumped-up charges.He blames Putin for the poisoning, and Western countries are considering new sanctions against Russia. The Kremlin denies any involvement and questions whether Navalny was poisoned.Volkov, who is based in Lithuania, is one of several Navalny allies now abroad or under house arrest in Russia.He urged people to flood social media with pictures of Sunday's gatherings - a new venture for the opposition that resembles political actions in neighbouring Belarus - using the hashtag #loveisstrongerthanfear in Russian.Another activist has called on women to form a human chain on a pedestrian street in Moscow on Sunday afternoon in support of Navalny's wife Yulia, who according to media reports flew to Germany this week, and other women affected by the police crackdown against protesters.Russian law enforcement agencies said on Thursday that people taking part in unsanctioned rallies could face criminal charges.Some rights groups accuse police of using disproportionate force against protesters in recent weeks. The Kremlin has denied repression by police and says the protests were illegal as they were not approved and risk spreading Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russians-set-for-candle-lit-valentine-s-day-protests-after-navalny-jailing-101613277273912.html

The total death toll in the disaster has now reached 41 with about 163 still missing."Their bodies were recovered by the team of rescue workers from SDRF and NDRF while clearing the slush from the tunnel, where about 35 workers were originally feared to be trapped," said state director general of police, Ashok Kumar.The rescue workers recovered another body on Sunday noon from the Reni village near Rishi Ganga hydel power project from the muck.Earlier on Saturday, the rescue workers finished drilling vertically in the main tunnel to reach a small underground tunnel beneath it at a depth of 12.7 metres. They however, hit slush after drilling the required depth. The slush is being pumped out to gain access to the tunnel for the search of about 30 remaining workers, feared trapped.Also Read: Uttarakhand farmers destroy crops after failing to get buyers, proper ratesTragedy struck last Sunday morning, when a glacier breach sent a torrent of water and sludge hurtling down a valley into the Rishiganga river--it becomes Alaknanda in Chamoli city. The subsequent flooding that hit villages on the way, also damaged two power plants--the Tapovan project and the Rishiganga hydel project-- and prompted a section of experts to link the event to climate change.It was feared that a glacial lake, formed by the debris following the glacier burst blocking a Himalayan stream about 8-kms above the Reni village, may trigger fresh flash floods, however, a eight-member SDRF team, which trekked for about 14 hours on foot to reach the 350 metre-wide lake said it currently posed no threat since enough water was continuously draining out in the form of a stream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-bodies-found-in-tapovan-tunnel-164-missing-amid-good-news-on-glacial-lake-101613276554627.html

The PLA is moving very quickly as per the agreed schedule,” said a senior official.Also Read | Security forces thwart drug smuggling attempt at international borderAs per the Pangong Tso disengagement, the PLA will move east of Finger 8 on the Srijap plain and the Indian Army will move back to the Dhan Singh Thapa post on the Finger 3 spur. The entire area between Finger 4 and 8 will be demilitarised with patrolling schedules decided through consultations between commanders at a later stage.There is evidence of the pullback by Chinese main battle tanks from the southern banks of Pangong Tso, matched by the withdrawal of the Indian armour and artillery guns. However, there has been no evidence of any withdrawal of PLA forces or equipment from depth areas or from central or eastern sectors.According to the ministry of defence, the two sides will discuss the disengagement in the Gogra-Hot Springs area and the Depsang bulge after the Pangong Tso withdrawal is completed to ensure peace and tranquillity along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control in the Ladakh sector.Also Read | ‘Recced his office’: Jaish terrorist reveals Pak’s plan to target NSA Ajit DovalWhile Indian security planners are satisfied with the disengagement after nearly 10 months of eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation, they are aware that the disengagement does not mean peace on its own. According to them, both sides will have to go back to their bases prior to April 2020 all along the 3,488km LAC to ensure that there is no further military confrontation. “Disengagement is only step one to the entire process, with peace and tranquillity a long way off,” said a senior military commander.Although the disengagement is being verified through satellite imagery each day, the bigger worry for the Indian Army is the attitude of the PLA western theatre commander when summer military exercises are held in Tibet and Xinjiang region between March and June.Also Read | China surprises India with its speed, moves out 200+ tanks from Pangong TsoThe PLA deployment across the Karakoram pass in Xiadullah has not changed and the same stands for deployment across the Daulet Beg Oldi sector.

14-02-2021||India||Delhi-Mumbai expressway will ease traffic load: Nitin Gadkari||Once completed, the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will ease the current traffic load on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday after reviewing various road projects in Pune and western Maharashtra.Addressing a press conference after inspecting the under-construction multi-level flyover project at Chandni Chowk in Pune, Gadkari said he had instructed officials concerned, contractors and local civic bodies to prepare a plan to ensure that the work gets completed during the next one year.The BJP MP also reiterated that motorists would have to pay road tax if they need "good services"."The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway work is going on. (Once completed), it will ease the traffic load on Pune-Mumbai Expressway as a bulk of traffic between northern and southern states currently pass through the Mumbai-Pune expressway," he told reporters.The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is a proposed 1,250-km long controlled-access highway connecting the national capital with the commercial capital of the country.Gadkari said the main reason behind heavy traffic on the Pune-Mumbai expressway is that vehicles coming from northern states pass through this highway to travel further towards southern states."But the proposed 12-lane Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will ease the traffic congestion on Mumbai-Pune expressway and other westerly highways," he said.Gadkari said once the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway reaches Surat in Gujarat, the south-bound traffic can be diverted using a new alignment (Surat - Nashik - Ahmednagar- Solapur)."This will ease the traffic load on Pune-Mumbai Expressway and other highways, and also bring down vehicular pollution," he added.Talking about the development and four-laning of the route from Pune that is used for walking palkhis or palaquins of Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram by devotees of Lord Vitthal, Gadkari said the work was going on at high speed."Since the project is close to my heart, I think that beautification of the route should be done with the help of putting the couplets from 'abhangs' and songs devoted to Lord Vitthal along this route," he said.He said devotees can also suggest some ideas which can be implemented for beautifying the palkhi road.After inspecting the work of the multi-level flyover project at Chandni Chowk, Gadkari said, "I was told that the deadline to complete this project is 2023, but looking at the hardships and inconvenience caused to the public due to the ongoing work, it is not feasible to wait till 2023"."I have asked all officials concerned and contractors to prepare a plan to complete the project in the next one year," he added.He said the modalities regarding the acquisition of land for the flyover project stood completed and efforts will be made to complete the project at the earliest.Gadkari said Axis Bank, which was the financier for the project, has violated norms."What this bank used to do is that it used to get the money collected in the form of toll (and) deposited it in its own account. Due to this, the concerned contractor did not get funds to finish the work. I requested the bank to hand over the funds to the contractors but it did not relent. The bank actually betrayed.... It violated the norms for the (flyover) project."It is because of the actions of Axis Bank, that the common people got inconvenienced as the contractor could not complete the work," said Gadkari.He said he had written to Pune rural police and Pune collector that because of the bank's action, the contractor is not getting money and the work is getting delayed.The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is now giving money to contractors to complete the flyover work, he said.When asked about the people's reluctance to pay the toll in cases where road works are pending completion, Gadkari said the road tax has to be paid if people want good services."The way Chandrakant Patil (when he was PWD minister in the previous BJP-led government in Maharashtra) waived the toll, we won't do it," he quipped.Patil was also present when Gadkari referred to him.Gadkari said the work of Katraj flyover near Pune will be started in the next one month.He said works on road projects for Talegaon-Chakan- Shikrapur and Pune-Shirur-Ahmednagar will start soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhimumbai-expressway-will-ease-traffic-load-nitin-gadkari-101613266390525.html

14-02-2021||India||Soon, protesters will pay for damage: Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said his government is planning to bring a law under which protesters will have to pay for the damage to public properties during any protest.Khattar made the statement on the sidelines of his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah. “We talked about party matters. We also talked about the farmers’ protest and I gave the Home Minister all the information that I had about dharnas and Kisan mahapanchayats in the state,” he said.Asked about his government’s proposed law against protestors, Haryana CM said, “No, we have not talked about the laws. We have been planning to bring this law even before the farmers’ movement started. Once Supreme Court in its decision had said that nobody had the right to vandalise public property, and we are bringing a law under which people have to pay for damage to public property.”The statement comes amid farmers’ protests across Delhi borders for nearly 3 months over the three new laws, which they say favour big corporations. The Centre has refuted the concerns, and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but talks are currently locked in a stalemate.Reiterating the Centre’s stand, Khattar said the three laws are for the benefit of farmers and will give a boost to the agricultural sector. Some people are protesting just for the “sake of protest” and it shows their “vested political intent”, the CM said according to the statement.Farmers would have died even at home: MinisterHaryana agriculture minister JP Dalal on Saturday said farmers would have died even if they had stayed back home. Responding to a query over the “death of 200 farmers” in the ongoing protests, Dalal said: “Had they been at their homes, they would have died there also.” “Listen to me, out of one to two lakh, do 200 people not die in six months?” he asked in response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-protesters-will-pay-for-damage-haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar-101613251968093.html

They are presently in the custody of the SIT of the crime branch, which is probing their alleged role in the Red Fort violence on Republic Day. Police have alleged that the two were “prominent players” behind the violence and “instigated the mob” by delivering “provocative speeches”.During the recreation of the crime scene, SIT members asked Sidhu and Iqbal to describe their movements and activities at the Red Fort on January 26, a police officer who did not want to be identified said. They were asked about the passage through which they entered the iconic structure and exited it after religious and farm union flags were hoisted by some protesters.The investigating team inspected the entire scene of violence at the fort to corroborate their claims and to ascertain how things unfolded at the monument, the officer said.The Delhi Police have registered at least 44 cases in connection with the January 26 violence and the incident of January 29, when a group of people, claiming to be locals, entered a farmers’ protest site at the Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police.Three more arrested in Burari violence casePolice on Saturday said they arrested three more persons for the violence near Burari on Republic Day.

14-02-2021||India||J&K to get statehood at appropriate time: Amit Shah||The Centre will grant full statehood to the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) at an “appropriate time”, home minister Amit Shah said in the Lok Sabha on Saturday, stressing that this government had done more for the region since the nullification of its special status in August 2019 than those who ruled it for decades.J&K has been a top priority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government since it came to power at the Centre in 2014, Shah said. He added that devolution of power took place there after the government nullified Article 370, which granted special privileges to the erstwhile state, and said the move will hurt dynastic politics.“We should not do politics on Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. There are several issues over which politics can be done. These are sensitive places and people have suffered a lot. We need to assuage their feelings,” he said, replying to a discussion on the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill.He also rejected the Opposition’s charge that the proposed law negates the hopes of the region getting back statehood.The bill to merge the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) cadre of all-India services officers with the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre was later passed by the Lok Sabha by a voice vote. The bill has already been green-lighted by the Rajya Sabha. It replaces an ordinance issued last month.“I am piloting the bill. I have introduced it...Don’t impose your apprehensions on the people of J&K…This bill has nothing to do with J&K statehood. The region will be granted statehood at an appropriate time,” Shah told the Opposition that has spoken out against the move to nullify Article 370.Targeting opposition parties, especially the Congress, he said Article 370 was a temporary provision but they continued with it for 70 years for the sake of “vote bank politics” before the Modi government nullified it on August 5, 2019, and bifurcated J&K into two Union Territories – J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one.“Who pressured you to continue with it for years?...This government does not believe in vote bank politics. This government takes decisions that will benefit the nation,” Shah said. He wondered what the ruling NDA’s predecessors, who were now asking questions about development in the region, had done for J&K since Independence.Shah also stressed that the panchayati raj system was in place in J&K after the Article 370 move and cited the successful conduct of local polls. “Even our rivals could not allege any wrongdoing in these polls, which were conducted fairly and peacefully,” he said.“Now people chosen by the masses will rule Jammu and Kashmir, not those born to kings and queens,” Shah added, launching a scathing criticism of “three families” that dominated politics in J&K for long. He did not name any party in this context, but was apparently referring to the Congress, the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Shah’s address and also praised finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s “comprehensive” reply in the Lok Sabha to a discussion on the Union Budget. “A wonderful speech by Home Minister Shri Amit Shah in the Lok Sabha. Extensive in detail and rich in content, it highlights our efforts for Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh,” he tweeted.Also Read | What Amit Shah said on Jammu and Kashmir in Parliament: 10 pointsIn Kashmir, Shah’s remarks drew sharp reactions. “HM’s allegations that J&K was run by three families pales in comparison to the country being run by ‘hum do humaray do’,” former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said on Twitter, referring to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s charge that the country was being run by and for four people.NC spokesperson Imran Dar said the government gave no reason behind downgrading the erstwhile state to a UT. “Even now they gave no justification as to why they are delaying the return to statehood. At the same time, the disempowerment of J&K continues…They are bringing legislation after legislation to disempower the state,” he said of the move to merge the J&K cadre with the AGMUT cadre.J&K Congress vice-president Ghulam Nabi Monga said the government never consulted people before doing away with the statehood. “It had never happened in the history that a state was downgraded. The decision was against the will of people of J&K…The home minister should now fix a time line for the restoration of statehood,” Monga said.Back in the Lok Sabha, Shah said work on two All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the region had begun, and the Kashmir Valley will be connected to the railways by 2022. He said the government expected that around 25,000 government jobs will be created in J&K by next year.The home minister also gave the assurance to the people of J&K that “no one will lose their land” and that the government had sufficient land for development works.Replying to All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi, Shah said the decision to restore 4G services in the region last week after 18 months was not taken under pressure of any foreign government.“…The (Congress-led) United Progressive Alliance government is gone. This is Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party government. The nation makes it decisions. Parliament makes its decisions. No one can pressure us,” he said.Authorities restricted the 4G services to buy some time and make sure rumours were not being spread (after the Article 370 move), Shah added.Criticising Owaisi, he said the AIMIM leader was creating a divide between Hindu and Muslim officers. Participating in the discussion earlier, Owaisi said the bill will further alienate Muslims and Kashmir. He also sought to know about the number of youngsters from the Valley arrested under the Public Security Act (PSA).Congress floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said local officers should be posted in J&K and accused the Centre of nullifying Article 370 “without preparation”. “This government is facing a trust deficit there. There is a lot of trust deficit and I suggest that posting local officers to the largest extent will be good for Jammu and Kashmir administration,” he said.Shah later explained that states such as Mizoram, Goa and Arunachal Pradesh are part of the AGMUT cadre and the Opposition’s concerns on the bill were unfounded.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-to-get-statehood-at-appropriate-time-amit-shah-101613248006225.html
14-02-2021||India||2 years after Pulwama, Interpol issues notices||Two years after a terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama killed 40 security personnel, Interpol has issued red notices against Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar and three of his relatives in connection with the brazen strike that brought the already fraught ties between India and Pakistan to a new low, people familiar with the development said on Saturday.The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the case, hopes that authorities in Pakistan, where Azhar and his aides are believed to be hiding, will honour the red notices and take action against the terror masterminds.Apart from Azhar, red notices, or global arrest warrants, have been issued against his brothers Abdul Rauf Asghar and Ibrahim Athar, and his cousin Ammar Alvi.Also Read | Two years of Pulwama: Terror attack that killed 40 CRPF men explainedThe development comes at a time when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has begun a series of online meetings that will review Pakistan’s actions to counter terror financing amid signs that Islamabad is yet to completely implement the multilateral watchdog’s action plan. The crucial plenary meeting during February 22-25 will take a final call on Pakistan, which is in FATF’s “grey list”.The fresh Interpol notices against Azhar and Rauf are in addition to the red notices issued against them previously — for their role in the attack on Indian Parliament in 2001 as well as the deadly attack on the Pathankot air base in 2016. Rauf has another Interpol red notice against him for hijacking Indian Airlines’s Flight IC-814 in 1999, which forced the government to release Azhar and two other terrorists (Mushtaq Zargar and Omar Sheikh) in exchange of about 150 passengers on board.“Azhar and his brother live freely in Pakistan despite killing hundreds of innocent people…they are globally designated wanted terrorists and have three to four Interpol red notices pending against them. Pakistan must arrest them and hand them over to India,” said a counterterrorism official, requesting anonymity.Under FATF pressure, Pakistan issued an arrest warrant against Azhar last month, acknowledging officially for the first time his presence in its territory. But Indian counterterrorism officials call it “total eyewash”.“The JeM chief has not even been charged under terror laws in Pakistan despite India sharing massive evidence in all these attacks. The court warrant is to show before the FATF plenary that some action is happening,” the official quoted above said.FATF president Marcus Pleyer last year cautioned Pakistan that it would not be given a chance “forever” to address outstanding issues and that repeated failure to deliver on the action plan would result in a country being put in the “black list”. Pleyer also said Pakistan had fully complied with 21 of 27 points in the action plan.As reported by HT on December 12, India has also prepared a formal judicial request, or Letter Rogatory, seeking information on Azhar, Rauf, Athar and Alvi, and three Pakistani nationals who came to India to execute the Pulwama attack. Athar’s son Umar Farooq and JeM commander Kamran (both killed in encounters with security forces) and one Ismail, alias Saifullah, are the three others on whom information will be sought.The Letter Rogatory request has been approved by the ministry of home affairs and will be sent to Islamabad in next two weeks, said a second official.In a 13,500-page charge sheet filed in August 2020, NIA said Azhar’s nephew Farooq, a highly skilled Afghanistan-trained improvised explosive device (IED) maker, executed the suicide bombing on the morning of February 14, 2019, when a CRPF convoy was moving on national highway in Pulwama.“Since the Pulwama attack, many of these high-profile terrorist commanders have gone under the radar in Pakistan and haven’t been seen publicly as part of Pakistan’s strategy to show to the international community that the terrorists aren’t active in its jurisdiction. As soon as the global scrutiny subsides, these terrorist commanders will be back, operating openly,” Sameer Patil , fellow at the International Security Studies Programme at Gateway House, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-years-after-pulwama-interpol-issues-notices-101613247601515.html
14-02-2021||India||Manipur's first comic book on folktales of 3 tribes released||The first comic book based on folktales of three major tribes -Mao, Maram and Poumai - inhabiting in Manipur's Senapati district was formally released during a function in Imphal on Saturday.The 135-paged colour comic book called ‘Folktales of Mao, Maram and Poumai’ is written by Th Kirankumar, the current deputy commissioner of Senapati district, with inputs provided by literature societies of the three major tribes.The book is a collection of 15 short stories consisting of seven folktales of Poumai, five of Maram and three of Mao. It was formally released by Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh in the presence of vice-chancellor P Gunindro Singh of Manipur University of Culture at a hotel in Imphal.Speaking on the occasion, chief minister N Biren Singh appreciated the writers and contributors of the book for bringing up such a comic book of folktales which would have high importance in bringing back the age-old bonding among different communities of the state.Expressing that many historical facts could be gathered from folksong and folktales, Biren Singh said that many valuable facts are yet to be explored and so there is a need for frequent interaction among different communities.Highlighting that folksongs and folktales have valuable facts on how different communities lived together and maintained good relations during the olden days, he also stressed the need to collect more historical facts by interacting with elders residing in the interior parts of the state and come up with more such storybooks.Reading such kind of comic books would make the younger generation aware of the age-old relations that had existed among different communities, he added and recalled a memorable folk song sung by elders which he had heard during a visit to a Paomai village when he became the chief minister of the state.Later in a tweet, the CM wrote, “It's my pleasure to have attended the launching of Comic Book titled "Folktales of Mao, Maram and Poumai" at Hotel Classic Grande today. Children and students will learn faster through vivid images of historical facts and folktales depicted in such comic books.”Commenting on the objective of bringing out the folktales into the comic format, writer Th Kirankumar said that the idea is to take such stories to the masses besides preserving the folktales of the communities.“Textbooks are also sometimes boring for students. But children love stories and folktales, they are crazy about it. Even outside the classroom, children continue to learn,” Kirankumar added. “So the basic objective is to introduce our own comic book to our children so that they can digest it easily and it will also help in preserving the lifestyle, traditions and culture as well."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipurs-first-comic-book-on-folktales-of-3-tribes-released-101613245523892.html
14-02-2021||India||Delhi Police framing innocents: Farm union||Accusing the Delhi Police of framing and arresting “innocent” farmers, the legal team of Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Saturday urged farmers receiving notice from the police to seek their help before making an appearance.The legal team of SKM, the umbrella body of 40 farmer groups protesting against three contentious farm laws, also accused the police of booking farmers under sections of dacoity and attempt to murder with the aim to “implicate” them in “fake cases” and to ensure they don’t receive bail.The legal team also demanded that the cases against farmers be taken back and the Republic Day violence be investigated by a “high-level judicial” team comprising a high court judge and a retired Supreme Court judge.Also Read | Uttarakhand farmers destroy crops after failing to get buyers, proper rates“Since the police are arresting farmers by calling them by issuing notice, we urge all such farmers to first approach our legal team who will assist them at every step. The farmers receiving these summons should not visit the police without our lawyers,” Prem Singh Bhangu, convener of SKM’s legal team, said at a news briefing at Singhu Border. “All arrested farmers are sons of the SKM. We’ll fight your battle,” Bhangu added.So far, the police have arrested 122 people for their alleged involvement in violence and vandalism during a tractor rally on Republic Day. These arrests were followed by the registration of 44 FIRs related to the violence.Bhangu said that since these arrests were based on only a few of the FIRs, more arrests on the pretext of appearance in response to police notices were expected in the near future.“The police booked farmers under sections of dacoity and attempt to murder. We are agitators, not criminals. Did the police receive even a single complaint from any shopkeeper on Republic Day of theft of even peanuts that they registered cases of dacoity?” Bhangu said.On Friday, members of the legal team visited farmers lodged in Tihar Jail and informed them that a team of around 150 lawyers was working to seek bail for them. “We will also be sending monetary help to the jailed farmers by Monday,” said Bhangu.Bhangu also promised help from Monday in recovering farmers’ tractors and other vehicles that are currently in police custody.Members of the legal team also said that of the 38 farmers reported missing after the Republic Day incident, most have been traced and only 16 remain to be found. They said that while some of the missing men were traced to jail, others reached their homes.“Investigation is going on and whoever is served the notice has to join the investigation,” said Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson for the Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-framing-innocents-farm-union-101613244573983.html

Twelve people have been arrested in the matter while a thirteenth, who is a minor and part of the racket, has been booked.Two victims who were held in their custody at a bungalow in Porvorim in North Goa have been freed, police said.The fiancée of the main victim complained to the Goa Police that her fiancé, one Shapoor Zarifi, an Afghan national, was kidnapped and held against his will when he travelled to Goa on February 7.Zarifi travelled to Goa to meet the ‘agents’ who had promised him to process his papers for his employment and travel to Canada. However, upon arrival, he was abducted and forced to call his friends telling them he had reached Canada and that his agents back in Goa should be paid $20,000.In her complaint, she alleged that Zarifi was communicating with her through WhatsApp voice notes that were dictated to him. Zarifi was made to claim that he had already reached Canada. However, she was able to sense that he was still in Goa and being held against his will.“The victim was traced to a house in Porvorim where he was held captive by the accused. A total of 12 people involved in the kidnapping were arrested after the search and rescue operation and a minor, who was also a member of the gang, has been apprehended and lodged in protective custody. Additionally, one more person from Punjab, who was held in captivity, was also rescued during the search and rescue operation,” South Goa Superintendent of Police (SP) Pankaj Kumar Singh said.According to the police, the main accused, identified as Sushil Singh a.k.a. Rishab, 36, a native of Haryana, had organised his gang members in Goa who took a bungalow on rent in Porvorim while their agents in Delhi lured innocent people who wanted to travel to Canada for employment.“Zarifi was called by the main accused Rishab to Goa on February 2, informing him that his travel documents are ready. The accused obtained ₹2 lakh from him as an advance payment for tickets and visa purposes but he was held captive at the bungalow in Porvorim and was made to call his friends to make arrangements for $20,000 as the payment for his travel to Canada,” Pankaj Singh said.Zarifi was told to tell his friends that if the money was not paid, he would be harmed.“The gang would lure gullible travellers intending to visit Canada and call them to Goa where advance payment would be taken from them after which they would be held captive at the rented bungalow. A fake boarding pass and passport would be sent to the family members to make them believe that the victim had indeed travelled to Canada or their desired destination. WhatsApp voice messages were then sent from the victims mobile number using a VPN connection reflecting their IP locations in Canada. Later, the victims were made to call their family and friends asking for the final payment to be made,” Pankaj Kumar Singh said.The others arrested accused include Ashish Tripathi, 30, from Gorakhpur; Rajat Kalyan, 23; Saahil Kalyan, 24; Pradeep Kumar, 32; Sanju Singh, 28; Vijay, 26; Anil Kumar, 36; Anurag Kumar, 18; Vishal Goswami, 20 - all natives of Haryana. Alex D’Souza, 29, and Robinson D’Souza, 23, both residents of Pernem in Goa were also among the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kidnapping-and-extortion-racket-busted-in-goa-12-arrested-101613242099065.html
14-02-2021||India||Engineers work on Polavaram dam on Godavari for smooth passage of Pulasa fish||Engineers working on the Polavaram major irrigation project, being constructed on Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district, are making a special arrangement in the massive spillway of the dam for the smooth passage of a peculiar variety of fish found in the river.Popularly known as “Pulasa Chepa” (Hilsa fish, scientific name: Tenualosa ilisha), it is actually a marine fish variety, but enters the Godavari river during the months of July and August for breeding. From Antarvedi in East Godavari district, where the river joins Bay of Bengal, the fish swims upstream of the river for more than 200 miles for breeding and returns to the sea by October-November.Due to its taste and availability only for a limited period in the Godavari river, Pulasa fish is in high demand not only in coastal Andhra, but also across the state and it fetches around ₹4,000 per kg for fishermen during the peak season.However, the construction of the Polavaram dam across the river has posed a big threat to the Pulasa fish, as its movement to the upstream of the river would be curtailed. “This was one of the issues raised by the Union ministry of environment and forests before considering granting environmental clearance for the Polavaram project. It asked the state water resources department to work out a mechanism for the passage of Pulasa fish,” Polavaram project chief engineer B Sudhakar Babu said.Subsequently, the state government consulted the Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI), Kolkata, to study on what kind of changes could be made in the design of the gates for the passage of Pulasa fish upstream and downstream of the river.“It is perhaps the first time that the CIFRI studied the physiology and behaviour of Pulasa fish in choosing its path in the river and designed a specialised Fish Ladder Gate to be erected on one of the piers of the spillway to enable the unhindered passage of fish during the season,” the chief engineer said.According to Satish Babu Angara, general manager of Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited which is executing the project, the fish ladder gate is about 252 metres in length and has three vents at various levels of the spillway so that the fish could move freely even if water levels keep changing.“We have made this arrangement in the second pier of the dam, keeping in view the path of the Pulasa fish. The fish ladder gate can be adjusted according to the water level,” Satish said.Each vent of the fish ladder gate will be of six feet height and four feet in width, which will provide enough space for the fish to pass through during the season, the chief engineer said.The project works are moving at a fast pace now. The erection of 52 spillway pillars, each measuring a height of 52 metres, of the dam was completed on Thursday. “We shall complete the erection of gates shortly, apart from bridge and slab works on the spillway by June,” Satish said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/engineers-work-on-polavaram-dam-on-godavari-for-smooth-passage-of-pulasa-fish-101613240941824.html

14-02-2021||India||Cops rule out rape, abduction bid on Hyderabad medical student||The police on Saturday ruled out abduction and rape attempt on a medical student three days ago on the outskirts of Hyderabad, adding that the 19-year-old woman fabricated the story because she wanted to “mislead” her parents and “leave their house”.On Thursday, police officials said the woman’s mother reached out to the police and said that she received a call from her daughter saying she was being abducted. A police team began searching for the woman and eventually found her in a state of semi-consciousness in a bush in Annojiguda, about20 km from the state capital. At that time, police said that an autorickshaw driver and his three accomplices allegedly attempted to abduct, gang rape and murder the 19-year-old but failed after she resisted her attackers and alerted the authorities.“She was not abducted. We found that it was a false case after a thorough investigation and gathering of evidence,” Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat said.Also Read | Hyderabad pharmacy student abduction and rape case was a hoax, say policeIn her statement to the police, the woman said that she left college at 6:30pm and boarded an auto to reach her home, roughly 4km away. She said that two other men boarded the auto, which she said did not stop at RLR Nagar, where she was supposed to get down. According to the woman, the auto finally stopped at Yamnampet village, roughly 6km from where she had started. There, another man with a van was already waiting, she told police. The four men allegedly bundled her into the van and started for Ghatkesar, another 2km away, the police said on Thursday.However, during investigation police found that the woman’s statement was in contradiction to the evidence they found, the police commissioner said.“We examined the video footage obtained from CCTV cameras whichshowed that the woman got down at the next stop from her actual destination, walked for about four kilometres towards Yamnampet and then boarded another auto to reach Annojiguda, from where she called her mother stating that she was kidnapped,” Bhagawat said.After corroborating all the evidences, the police questioned the student and she confessed that she had lied to the police, Bhagwat said.“She confessed that due to family issues she wanted to leave her house. Later, due to police involvement, she panicked and out of fear weaved a false story,” the police said in an official statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-rule-out-rape-abduction-bid-on-hyd-medical-student-101613240073407.html
14-02-2021||India||1 held in Capital for shooting 5 dead in Haryana wrestling arena||A day after five persons were shot dead and two others, including a three-year-old child, were grievously injured in a firing incident in the wrestling arena of Rohtak’s Jat College, a joint team of Delhi and Rohtak police arrested the accused, Sukhvinder Singh, from Samaypur Badli in the Capital.Police had announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for information on the accused, a resident of Baroda village in Sonepat and a certified coach from Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports (NIS), Patiala.Rohtak superintendent of police (SP) Rahul Sharma said, “He was caught from Samaypur Badli area in Delhi in a joint operation by Rohtak and Delhi police. We will bring him to Rohtak on a production warrant and seek his remand.”“Prima facie it appears that the incident took place due to a rivalry between the accused and head coach Manoj Kumar. We are collecting CCTV footage from Jat College and nearby areas. The victims’ bodies have been handed over to their family members,” the SP added.On Friday evening, coach Manoj Kumar of Sonepat, his wife Sakshi, two NIS-certified coaches Satish Dalal of Sonepat and Pardeep Malik of Rohtak, were shot dead along with national-level wrestler Pooja on the campus.Manoj’s three-year-old son Sartaj is in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, while the other injured, coach Amarjeet Singh, is undergoing treatment at Medanta hospital in Gurugram.Manoj Kumar’s younger brother Parmoj Kumar, a Commonwealth Games medallist in boxing, told HT that his brother, Manoj, and sister-in-law, Sakshi, were national-level players. He added that their family had cordial relations with the accused.“Sukhvinder was working as a wrestling coach at Jat College’s akhara. My brother, who was the head of the akhara, had asked Sukhvinder to leave the college after Pooja filed a complaint against him,” said Parmoj.Pooja’s father, Ram Gopal, said his daughter had become a victim of rivalry between coaches. “My daughter was to return home to Mathura on Saturday. She had won two medals at national-level events. She had moved to Rohtak with an aim of becoming an international-level player. Despite financial constraints at home, I had ensured that my daughter’s practice never suffered. Unfortunately, she was caught in the rivalry between two coaches,” said Gopal.The incident shocked the wrestling fraternity nationwide. “What has happened is extremely sad. I am here at the national camp in Lucknow and it has affected all of us that how can such an incident happen in an akhada. I did not know them personally and I never visited that centre but when you hear such things it jolts you,” said Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik, who has trained at the Chhotu Ram wrestling centre in Rohtak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-held-in-capital-for-shooting-5-dead-in-haryana-wrestling-arena-101613240013289.html
14-02-2021||India||'Jai Shri Ram' has become the slogan of election in Bengal, says BJP's Gajendra Shekhawat||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who is in charge of five Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal, says the Trinamool Congress’s electoral ship is about to sink. In an interview with Smriti Kak Ramachandran ahead of the upcoming assembly polls, he also accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s government of corruption, and said “Jai Shri Ram” has become Bengal’s election slogan. Edited excerpts:The BJP won 18 seats in the Lok Sabha elections. How confident is the party of translating the gains in the upcoming assembly polls? People in Bengal are fed up with the TMC government; they are unhappy with corruption, the red tape and politics of vendetta. However, until they believe that the BJP can turn the tables, they won’t be able to escape this. If you look back in time, it took Mamata Banerjee 15 years to make people believe that she can change things.Till the last assembly election (when the BJP won 3 seats), people did not believe that the BJP can be an alternative. Now, people are convinced that change can happen only when the BJP comes to power.What gives the BJP an edge over the TMC? Development that took place since the Narendra Modi government was formed (at the Centre)…the changes in the lives of ordinary people have sent out a message to the poor and the masses that development can only happen if the BJP government is there. People are aware of how the implementation of central schemes is not happening in West Bengal.How will the BJP counter the “Bahari (outsider)” vs Bengali narrative? The TMC also accuses you of communalising politics. In the last 10 years, her (Banerjee’s) slogan has been “Ma, Mati, Manush (mother, soil and people)”. Today, the people of Bengal are compelled to acknowledge that they (the state government) have not done justice to any of the sections.The state ranks very high in crimes against women. When I went to the state for the first time, I saw posters of missing girls on the walls with numbers scribbled at the bottom. I was told that there is a problem of girls going missing and the police not taking action. So, NGOs have come forward to help those families whose girls had gone missing...Drinking water is another issue that directly affects women. If water connections can be supplied in other parts of the country, why not in Bengal?The general image of Bengali people was that of bhadralok (gentleman). People of Bengal would react to any injustice or a problem in any part of the world. But now there is such an atmosphere of fear that people do not raise their voice against injustice in neighbour’s home.The BJP has managed to get some TMC leaders with political heft on board. The Opposition says it has become a trend to poach leaders ahead of elections. Why has the party not been able to groom its own leaders? It is natural that when a ship is sinking many people want to opt out. Mamata Banerjee’s ship is about to sink. Even in Uttar Pradesh, when we were contesting elections, there were many people from various political parties who joined the BJP. We are a party based on ideology. We welcome those who want to align with our ideology. Today, the BJP is the largest party in the country and many people who were with other parties have chosen our path.Is it ideology or political expedience? In our sphere of work we have to consider all possibilities. We go with a belief that those who believe in our ideology will continue to work with us and those who don’t may even quit.The BJP accuses the TMC of appeasement for votes. Now, Furfura Sharif cleric Abbas Siddiqui has floated his political party. AIMIM is also throwing its hat in the ring. Will the BJP benefit from the divisions in the Muslim vote? This is the first time that elections will be contested in West Bengal on the basis of development…the face of development in India is Prime Minister Modi. If there is a Modi versus Mamata comparison on the issue of development, then people have no doubts about who to pick...The policy of appeasement that has been followed has in some way compelled the majority community to think that despite their support, the government, for its own vote bank politics, has been indulging in appeasement.How do you read Banerjee’s decision of contesting from Nandigram? She’s running away to Nandigram because she is scared. She is aware and she’s been told by her intelligence network that this time she cannot win the election in Bhawanipore (in south Kolkata).What is your comment about the acrimony between the parties over chanting “Jai Shri Ram”? Looking at her response to the chant, people across ideologies are questioning why she gets irritated by it. Jai Shri Ram has now certainty become the slogan of the election in Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jai-shri-ram-has-become-the-slogan-of-election-in-bengal-shekhawat-101613239953332.html
14-02-2021||India||FM Sitharaman poses 10 questions to counter Congress attack on Budget||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday that Rahul Gandhi was becoming a “doomsday man” for India by creating fake narratives on various issues, as she hit back at the Congress leader’s “hum do, humare do” jibe that questioned the government’s intent behind three farm laws, and posed a 10-point questionnaire-cum-rebuttal on farmer’s welfare.After responding to various issues raised by members of Parliament in the Lok Sabha during a debate on the Union Budget over two days, Sitharaman asked Gandhi why the Congress took a U-turn on farm reforms after it proposed a similar move during the 2019 general elections.“Shri Rahul Gandhi, when he stood up [in Lok Sabha on Thursday]... when the foundation was being laid [by him] for the [reply to the] Budget speech, which never happened... I want to ask, and I also share my expectations... Why the Congress party had taken a U-turn in its position [on farm reforms]... [mentioned in its] 2019 election manifesto…,” the finance minister said.“We need to recognise these two tendencies of the Congress party. One is creating fake narratives and second, lack of belief in a democratically elected Parliamentary system,” she said.Also Read | Cong MP moves motion against FM for calling Rahul Gandhi 'doomsday man of India'Gandhi said on Thursday that the three new farm laws would allow corporates to buy unlimited quantity of food grains for profiteering, kill the ‘mandi’ system, remove the Essential Commodity Act (ECA) leading to hoarding, and deny judicial remedies to farmers against corporate buyers of their farm produce. “These laws will destroy India’s food security system and will hurt rural economy,” he said.The “hum do, humare do” expression was used by Gandhi to say that only four people were ruling this country including two business houses.Speaking in the House, Sitharaman said she was posing 10 questions to the Congress, which the party would have to answer in the due course. She sought an answer from the opposition party over its “U-turn” on the farm legislation, which she said it supported earlier.Her second question was related to the Congress’s electoral promise of farm loan waivers in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. “Karza maafi Rajasthan men nahi hua, Madhya Pradesh men nahi hua... Chhattisgarh men bhi wo karza maafi nahi hua,” she said.Sitharaman’s third point was an expectation from Gandhi that he would “order” the Punjab chief minister not to implement the “kala kaanun” [the three farm laws]. “I thought, he would reveal this in the House,” she said.“When Rahul Gandhiji was talking about the farm laws at that time I expected that he would say that farmers have problems related to ‘parali’ [stubble] and the Congress government in Punjab will give some relief to them. But, that didn’t happen,” she said.She asked Gandhi for at least one clause of the three farm laws that would demonstrate that farmers’ interest would be hurt. “[Congress] participated in the voting [of the Bills in the Parliament], gave [its] support, and then changed its mind...,” she added.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s speech that enumerated several measures for small farmers, Sitharaman said: “I thought he would stand and say, ‘Pradhan Mantriji’ you have spoken several good things about small farmers, I will ask my friends to return lands to the farmer... because we took land cheap from them... We are in politics, therefore, my family and I have to take a stand on this matter and return the land.”“He could have said here, ‘hum do, humare do’ mein main damaad [son-in-law] ko aadesh karke aaya hun ki zamin waapas karo... But that did not happen,” she said.She also referred to PM Modi’s reply to the President’s address, wherein he quoted former PM Manmohan Singh that he also supported such farm reforms. “I thought, he [Gandhi] would say [something about]... forgetting the statement of Dr Manmohan Singh.... I thought he would say we will not dishonour Dr Manmohan Singh,” she said.“While debating on Budget... several members raised the question whether any APMC [Agricultural Produce Market Committee] has been closed after the three [farm] laws were enacted? They are not closed anywhere... Prove even if one APMC mandi is shut?”“Why does he choose to insult constitutional authorities?” the finance minister said.Sitharaman also alleged that the Congress was creating “continuously fake narratives” even as the country was fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, while speaking in the Rajya Sabha, she attacked former finance minister P Chidambaram on the same issue. “False narratives were created... There is a lot of grudge in the speech of the former finance minister [referring to Congress leader P Chidambaram]... not to recognise how honourable Prime Minister handled the Corona crisis,” she said in the House on Friday.Without giving any specific instance, Sitharaman alleged that Gandhi never believed in the Indian government but preferred to rely on outsiders, did “politics with a fringe group” and indulged in “bhayankar [frightful] abuse... total unacceptable terminology for constitutionally elected heads.”She said Gandhi indulge in “destructive” politics. “I’m very scared... probably he is becoming a ‘doomsday man’ for India,” she said.Congress MP TN Prathapan later moved a notice for privilege motion against Sitharaman on her “doomsday man” remark. “Minister of Finance Nirmala Sitaraman abused Rahul Gandhi as ‘Doomsday man of India’, accused that Rahul Gandhi, an elected member in the house, has joined with fringe element groups and that he is demeaning the country. This is an utter breach of privilege,” the notice said.Speaking about Budget 2021-22 earlier on Saturday, Sitharaman said the focus of the exercise was “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (a self-reliant India) and it was in sync with several stimulus packages and reforms announced during the lockdown period to revive the economy. On February 1, she presented Budget 2021-22 that focused on capital investments in areas such as health care, agriculture, defence, water and sanitation.The finance minister said the government was committed to providing full monetary support to the rural jobs guarantee scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2021-22. The Union Budget has estimated about a ₹73,000-crore fund for the scheme, but like previous years, more funds will be made available to the scheme as many migrant workers who returned home because of the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to stay back in their villages.Nilaya Varma, CEO and co-founder of consultancy firm Primus Partners, said: “The Union Budget 2021 does both, as it focuses on increased capital expenditure and provides ample opportunity for private sector participation. Developing robust infrastructure across segments including health care, agriculture, logistics, oil and gas will have a much-needed multiplier effect on the economy. Additionally, infrastructure development and manufacturing focus will drive sector-specific capacity building initiatives to employ the country’s youth gainfully.”Reacting on Nirmala Sitharaman’s speech, Adhir Chowdhury, Leader of Congress Party in Lok Sabha, said: “How does she explain that the lockdown made India’s billionaires 35% richer, while 84% of households support income suffered loss and 1.7 lakh people lost their jobs every hour in April, 2020 alone.”“How does she explain that income increase for India’s top 100 billionaires since March 2020? Finance Minister’s misplaced priorities include tax concession for corporates in financial year 2019-20 that amounted over ₹1.4 lakh crores. Instead of creating jobs, they used money for trimming up their balance sheets.”On a question about the comment made by Sitharaman on Gandhi’s ‘hum do, humare do’ slogan, Chowdhury said: “Immediately we stood up there and objected to the comments of the Finance Minister and even exhorted her that being a Finance Minister of India, she should not indulge in a such kind of unparliamentary activities inside the house.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fm-poses-10-questions-to-counter-cong-attack-on-budget-101613239953908.html
14-02-2021||India||Only 4% beneficiaries turn up for second vaccine shot: Centre||The roll-out of the second dose of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was off to a slow start on Saturday, with just 7,668 beneficiaries receiving the second jab, according to the provisional data released by the Union health ministry.This accounted for just about 4% of the over 191,000 health care workers who received their first dose on January 16, the day the nationwide roll-out of the vaccination drive took place.The government has set a deadline of March 1 to complete the vaccination of the frontline workers across the country, with a five-day period for “mop up” activity to vaccinate those who might have been missed out, said joint secretary of the Union health ministry, Mandeep Bhandari. For health care workers, the deadline is February 20.The two vaccines that have been cleared for used in India – Covishield and Covaxin – require that two doses be given 28 days apart. However, as per the recommendation of the apex drug regulator, the doses can be taken within a window of four to six weeks.“The second dose can be given any time between four and six weeks. That’s the window period that we have,” Dr VK Paul, member (health) of Niti Aayog previously told HT. He was one of those who received the vaccine on the day of the roll-out. He said he would take the second dose on Monday.Also Read | Registered beneficiaries not willing to be vaccinated: PCMC health chiefThe weekend, half-day working at hospitals, could have been the reason for the low turnout. Dr NK Arora, National Task Force member on Covid-19 vaccines, said this was likely. “The numbers will probably pick up Monday onwards,” he said.With 84,807 people receiving the shot on Saturday, as per provisional data, India crossed the 8 million mark of the number of people vaccinated.The administration of the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines started on Saturday, 28 days after the first dose was given on January 16, in several states across India, even though the attendance of health care workers remained low, according to officials in multiple states.Among the states that started the second dose of Covid-19 vaccination were Tamil Nadu, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand, an official said.No second dose of the Covid-19 vaccines was given in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. The process to give the second dose will begin in these states from Monday or early next week, another official said on condition of anonymity. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have not announced the days for the second dose of the vaccination.Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’ Covishield vaccines require a two-dose schedule to be administered through the intramuscular route.Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishnan, who inspected the administration of the second dose to health care workers at the Government Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said the vaccination drive would soon be extended to the public.Only 1,154 healthcare workers took the second dose in Tamil Nadu on Saturday, as opposed to the 3,027 beneficiaries for the first dose. “It isn’t compulsory to take the second dose exactly on the 28th day after the first dose. It can be taken soon after 28 days and also because it’s a weekend the numbers are low,” says Dr K Vinay, joint director, immunisation, directorate of public health and preventive medicine.Also Read | India vaccinates close to 8 million beneficiaries against Covid-19 in 28 daysIn Chandigarh, only 325 people were administered the second dose as compared to 5,907 on January 16 when the first dose was administered. State Immunization Officer, Dr Virendra Ahlawat said they will conduct more vaccination sessions Monday onwards and make up for the shortfall.“One need not have any apprehensions over the vaccine being administered. We have given time till February 17 for the frontline workers to register. Soon, the vaccination drive will be extended to other sections of people,” Radhakrishnan said.The Goa government, too, on Saturday started administering the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines to health care workers, said state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar. Ranganath Bhojje, a health care worker from the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), was the first person to get the vaccine shot on January 16, when the nationwide vaccination programme had started. He was again the first person to get the second dose of the vaccine, the official said.Those who received the second dose of the vaccine will develop immunity against the infection after 14 days, Borkar said. Out of the total number of 19,952 health care workers in the state, 10,341 have received their first dose so far, while the remaining will receive it by February 20, Dr Borkar said, adding that the state has covered 52% of the health care workers in the vaccination drive so far, Dr Borkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-4-beneficiaries-turn-up-for-second-vaccine-shot-centre-101613239833404.html

14-02-2021||Today's||Culture needs more government support||Culture occupies prime space in our political imagination and enriches our daily lives in myriad ways. But how much of this sentiment has got translated into government support for culture? The budget offers a window into State priorities. Allocations for the ministry of culture (MoC) announced in this year stand at ₹2,688 crore, ₹461 crore less than last year. This 15% reduction comes on top of a 30% mid-year downward revision of the culture budget for last year due to the lockdown. This apathy towards culture, reflected in low levels of public spending, is not surprising. Over the years, regardless of the ruling dispensation, the will to support the sector has been declining. Actual expenditure by MoC, as a percentage of GDP, has reduced from a mere 0.017% in 2010-11 to 0.012% in 2019-20. This alarming trend was flagged by the Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) on Culture in 2020, when it noted that with inflation factored in, there is nil growth in allocations made to MoC in the last five years.Tracing just one of the mandates of MoC — promotion of arts through fellowships and various akademies — demonstrates the dismal status of spending. The Kala Sanskriti Vikas Yojana, an umbrella scheme for scholarships and pensions, has been cut to half, from ₹310 crore in 2018–19 to ₹168 crore in 2021–22. Of the ₹310 crore allocated, only ₹202 crore was spent. Further, the number of beneficiaries is minuscule. In 2016–17, 283 scholars were selected for the Award of Young Artistes and only ₹4,000 per month pension was provided to 3,133 artistes. The 2018 PSC report found these numbers disappointing, given the country’s vast artistic community and recommended increasing coverage, but MoC remained non-committal.Similarly, allocations to academies have been stagnant around ₹350 crore, and fell this year to ₹341 crore. They are also ridden with vacancies — out of 878 posts, 262 were vacant as on March 31, 2020. Besides poor resource provisions, the functioning of these akademies has invited the ire of various committees. The PSC in in 2013 and a high-powered committee in 2014 noted multiple points that needed resolution — lack of synergy between institutions; need for a grievance redressal body to tackle institutional complaints; and delays in disbursing scholarships. Most of these recommendations were either ignored or shot down by MoC, with insufficient explanations.One of the reasons for policy gaps has been attributed to the absence of a comprehensive cultural directory — if we do not know who we are spending for, how will we know how much to spend. To this end, an ambitious cultural mapping mission was launched in 2015 with an outlay of ₹3,000 crore. Six years later, the exercise has failed to take off — out of ₹43 crore allocated, only ₹1 crore has been utilised. Efforts to identify artistes across the country were supposedly abandoned due to lack of IT and administrative support.The government, beyond its own budgetary allocations, also has the reach to create fund-attracting conditions for the sector. MoC, in the ongoing budget session, reported that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spend dropped from ₹306 crore in 2016–17 to ₹48 crore in 2019–20. Further, the National Culture Fund (NCF), set up to enable private participation in cultural preservation, has been dormant. This makes one wonder as to what prevents the government from encouraging spending on culture through CSR, NCF and other measures.As in other sectors, the pandemic has adversely impacted art and culture, but only more severely. Many art forms and practices are on the verge of extinction or decay as they have been languishing over decades for want of resources. The immediate need is for the artistic community to unequivocally pursue its right to public spending on culture and cultivate the political and administrative will for the same. For, it is the government that has to be the primary enabler and patron of the arts — no culture has survived without it.Padmapriya Janakiraman leads Sahapedia’s cultural mapping project.

14-02-2021||Today's||Narendra Modi’s new political narrative||Over the past week, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi spoke in Parliament thrice — while responding to the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President’s address in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and bidding farewell to retiring Rajya Sabha members, particularly Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House, Ghulam Nabi Azad. The speeches throw up a broad outline of PM Modi’s new political narrative, the areas of focus for the government, and the possible political faultlines ahead.There is no doubt that PM Modi is an effective communicator — not just in mass meetings and election rallies, but in the House too, which requires a more calibrated approach and a mix of asserting one’s position, engaging with the Opposition in a more conversational tone, and lacing one’s speech with wit and one-liners. Given his natural oratory skills, the PM should speak in Parliament more often, for it will provide the nation a sense of his line of thinking, rationale for controversial policies, and encourage more reasoned deliberation.The key was not the manner in which he articulated his points, but the content of his speeches. A new political narrative is taking shape — which may well last till the 2024 elections — and this revolves around three pillars.The first is political ownership of economic reforms, and embracing the task of communicating the efficacy of these reforms. Over the past four decades, India has seen a range of economic reforms — the process started with Indira Gandhi’s return to power in 1980, continued under Rajiv Gandhi, witnessed preparatory work under the VP Singh and Chandrashekhar governments, and then got a boost under the PV Narasimha Rao-Manmohan Singh duo in 1991.But no political leader till then was willing to own the reforms — even Rao had to frame it as a continuation of Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy to neutralise the opposition within his party. And that is why while India has proceeded, in terms of policy, with enabling the rise of the private sector and cutting back, partly, on the role of the State in enterprises where it doesn’t have a role, at the ideological level, there remains a distrust of capital and big business. Indeed, it was this political fear of being seen as close to capital that led to PM Modi retracting from his reform trajectory after Rahul Gandhi’s “suit-boot ki sarkar” jibe in his first term and adopting a strong welfarist avatar.But at a time when the country is seeing the biggest mass movement in recent history, and the Opposition has centred its attacks on crony capitalism, the PM has doubled down. He lauded the role of the private sector as wealth creators, linked the process of wealth creation with employment generation and wealth distribution, openly took on the bureaucratic stranglehold over public sector enterprises and the power of the Indian Administrative Service officers, and provided a robust defence of farm laws — on the grounds that agriculture needed investment and modernisation, that land fragmentation was making livelihoods increasingly untenable for farmers, and laws expanded economic freedom even while the old State-supported structure of mandis and minimum support prices would remain.This political message is also significant for the budget has laid out an ambitious privatisation agenda — including of public sector banks — which is bound to provoke resistance from unions and the Opposition. But PM Modi has clearly decided that the next generation reforms cannot be held back anymore — and that he will politically own it and attempt to convert it into an asset rather than fear the political costs associated with it. There remain legitimate concerns that Aatmanirbhar Bharat could lead to a return to insular policies and, even if partly, delink India from global trading networks. But the PM’s speeches indicate that even if this happens, on the domestic front, there will be no return to the past — and instead, a liberal economic agenda, focused on boosting competitiveness and private sector, will stay.How this plays out is to be seen, for there will remain strong opposition to these initiatives, including from within the Sangh Parivar. The message will also have much greater traction if support for business is not seen as support for a certain set of “national champions”, the private sector at large is seen to grow, and growth does not lead to inequality, but is accompanied with equity. The need to sustain a multi-class compact is clearly recognised, for in all government speeches through the week, the focus on welfare schemes and pro-poor initiatives also remained a part of the narrative.The second, related, pillar of the PM’s speech is nationalism. But this nationalism now has both an economic subtext in the form of a self-reliant India — playing on Indian pride about becoming more autonomous across sectors or encouraging domestic alternatives to foreign platforms — and an emotive appeal in the form of rhetoric against critical foreign interventions.The fact that the ministry of external affairs chose to issue a statement in response to global celebrities tweeting in solidarity with the farm protests, and the PM warned against the perils of a “foreign destructive ideology”, indicates that the nationalist discourse will continue to be a part of the political toolkit. In the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological lexicon, nationalism has often been, externally, directed against Pakistan and, internally, assumed a majoritarian colour. This will stay. But, in addition, be prepared for stronger rhetoric against the West, especially if there is a pushback by human rights, Left and liberal groups against what is perceived as India’s democratic backsliding. The PM knows well the need to remain engaged with the developed democracies in the West, but the idea of a “foreign hand” destabilising or weakening India will be constantly articulated too to rally the domestic base.And finally, the PM appears to have decided that he will adopt both a conciliatory and confrontational approach with those opposing him. His emphasis on the purity of the farm movement was an attempt to directly reach out to farmers; his focus on small farmers was an attempt to showcase the diversity within farming communities and woo the weaker segments.The recognition of Punjab’s sensitivity and Sikh contribution to nation-building stems from the awareness that India cannot afford to alienate a large minority in a border state. The effort to reach out to Opposition leaders — be it Sharad Pawar or Azad — and the emphasis on how the government is flexibile and there is room to improve laws was an effort to challenge the image of being undemocratic and show that the PM is willing to listen to diverse views. At the same time, the clear attack on the Congress for its alleged inconsistency, and the coinage of the term “andolanjeevis”, indicates that the PM will fight and fight hard against both the principal Opposition and segments of civil society.How the Opposition responds to this new Modi narrative — based on reforms, welfare, nationalism, with a mix of flexibility and aggression — will determine India’s future political trajectory.letters@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/narendra-modi-s-new-political-narrative-101613226216976.html
14-02-2021||Today's||How Hamid Ansari views India today||In a country where politicians rarely write memoirs — either to recall the details of their life or comment on the politics they were a part of — an autobiography by a recent vice-president (V-P) is a very welcome development. However, what makes Hamid Ansari’s book truly special is the candour and, at times, outspokenness with which he has written of the prevailing state of affairs. He was V-P for the first three years of the present prime minister’s tenure, and it’s only three more since his term ended.Consequently, his book is not just relevant but also topical. Additionally, By Many A Happy Accident touches on many troubling aspects of Narendra Modi’s India that others have been reluctant to write about. So it’s unlikely to be universally applauded.Let’s start with Ansari’s view of the 2019 election which, I believe, he sees as the real turning point and not 2014. He says it represents the “success of populism … assisted by authoritarianism, nationalism and majoritarianism”. This is both bold and unvarnished but, in fact, he is a lot more explicit when he analyses the outcome.Today we have “a version of nationalism that places cultural commitments at its core and promotes intolerance and arrogant patriotism”. It has “take(n) over the political and cultural landscape”. It’s left the country with “an increasingly fragile national ego that threatens to rule out any dissent however innocent”. The term Ansari uses to sum this up is particularly telling — “hyper-nationalism”.If you read his book carefully, you will discover he also identifies the deeper consequences of such hyper-nationalism. First, it’s created “a subversion of core values”. The most worrying, perhaps, is that “the term secularism itself has almost disappeared from the government’s official vocabulary”. In its place, he says, “the politico-ideological effort now (is) to superimpose … the primacy of a religious majority.”Ansari’s language is always careful and correct. He is not given to colourful adjectives or exaggerated suggestions. Yet it’s not difficult to tease out his real meaning, even if he hasn’t expressed it in so many words. From a secular country, we’re increasingly becoming a Hindu country.There are two other consequences that Ansari identifies. “Our commitment to the Rule of Law seems to be under serious threat, arising out of the noticeable decline in the efficacy of the institutions of state.” Instead, we have lapsed into “arbitrary decision-making and even …. mob rule.” And he doesn’t shy away from blaming the judiciary, although he does so delicately. “The approach of the superior judiciary … does little credit to an iconic institution and damages public confidence”.The second consequence is more worrying. Ansari writes: “The fault lines in our society are visible.” He says “enforced homogenisation” and “a simplistic or motivated reading of our history” is “being attempted in a social milieu traditionally enriched by its diversity between communities and within them”. It seems he’s suggesting cultural nationalism could end up making India fragile. Unfortunately, he doesn’t say more. But did he need to? Surely, as a warning, this is enough.So, is Ansari apprehensive about the future of India? He doesn’t answer the question directly but the reasons why he might be have been clearly expressed. And yet there is a sentence in his last chapter — in fact, on the penultimate page — that suggests the light at the end of the tunnel is still glowing and could prove difficult to dim. “Strident nationalism and its illusory gains premised on falsehoods can also not be long-lasting”. As I read those words I thought I could also hear his voice, gently but reassuringly, say: “This too will pass.”But when? Will it be in my lifetime? Or is salvation a fruit that will only ripen for later generations to enjoy? And by then how much damage will have been done? I draw comfort from the fact the India I love will rise again, but I’m saddened by the thought I might not be part of it.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold Story The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-hamid-ansari-views-india-today-101613225433061.html
14-02-2021||Today's||From the Himalayas, a warning for us||The Himalayas are known as The Home of the Gods — yet, we mortals have shown scant respect for the sacred mountains. Last week’s tragedy in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand is the latest example of the outcome of our hubris in disregarding the nature of the Himalayas.We know, fully well, that the Himalayas are young, fragile, and unstable mountains; yet, we have constructed or are constructing more than 50 hydroelectric projects in the basins of the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers. The horrendous Kedarnath floods of 2013 claimed 5,700 lives. Instead of stopping to think about the implications of that disaster, the government, merely three years later, launched a massive scheme — the Char Dham road project, aimed at constructing no less than 900 kilometres of highways, linking Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri.Apart from the damage to the mountains caused during the construction of the roads, this will lead to an exponential increase in tourism. One of the causes of the Kedarnath disaster was the uncontrolled development of hotels, shops, and other tourist facilities, violating all building regulations, and the absence of any system of disposing waste except dumping it in the open, which often meant on the banks of rivers or on the beds of streams.The scientific community is still carefully studying whether the Chamoli disaster was caused by an avalanche of snow, a landslide, or a glacier lake, which burst its banks. But what is certain is that it is further evidence that we are not taking into account the possible impact on nature when we draw up plans for economic development.The 2021-22 Union Budget will increase the pressure on the government to ignore the concerns of nature. It is heavily focused on investments in infrastructure, especially roads and railways, which the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, hopes will revive Gross Domestic Product growth. This may be true. But these projects will, also, inevitably give rise to concerns about their environmental impact.On the revenue side of the budget, the plan is to raise the money for infrastructure development from privatisation and the monetisation of government assets such as land. If investors don’t like the country’s environmental regulations, they won’t come forward to buy government companies, businesses, or property.Just as we have received a warning from the Himalayas about the need to be more respectful of them, the British government has published an eagerly awaited, independent, comprehensive review of The Economics of Biodiversity led by Cambridge economics professor, Sir Partha Dasgupta. He was born in Dhaka and obtained his first degree from Delhi University.The review has been described by the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, as “a landmark contribution to our understanding of the relation between nature and our economy”, and by the renowned environmentalist David Attenborough as “comprehensive and immensely important”.It is bound to be the basis of much discussion if world leaders are able to meet for their crucial climate summit in Glasgow in September. Significantly, in view of the budget’s emphasis on reviving GDP growth, the review looks beyond that as a measure of economic growth, and suggests new tools for measuring biodiversity and conservation efforts. It calls for “rebalancing our demand of nature’s goods and services and its capacity to supply them”.While the Himalayas may be the abode of the Gods, the review points out that nature is our home and tells us “good economics demands that we manage it better”. The Himalayas have reminded us how urgently India needs to improve its housekeeping.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/from-the-himalayas-a-warning-for-us-101613225330288.html
