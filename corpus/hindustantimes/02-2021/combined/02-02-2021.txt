At a press conference on Tuesday, they said during the meeting they also demanded that all “humanitarian facilities” be given to the 115 agitators currently lodged in jail. They added that a medical board should be set up to investigate the injuries to the farmers during clashes with the police. Thousands of farmers broke police barriers and entered Delhi on Republic Day during a tractor rally and clashed with the police at several locations before several groups barged into the Red Fort. The SKM delegation comprising of Prem Singh Bhangu, Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala, Inderjit Singh and Harpal Singh Mundal also demanded a judicial inquiry into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-leaders-meet-kejriwal-submit-list-of-protesters-gone-missing-since-tractor-rally-101612289686130.html
02-02-2021||Noida||Will ensure Dhanauri and Jewar conservation, says state environment minister||Noida: With the Gautam Budh Nagar district’s wetlands in shambles, Uttar Pradesh minister of forest and environment Dara Singh Chauhan on Tuesday said that he will ensure the speedy and proper conservation of key habitats -- Dhanauri and Jewar. The minister said this on the sidelines of the bird festival held at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, where the district forest department dedicated a control room and some new facilities to visitors, including a 360-degree high resolution camera to monitor its avifauna. The bird festival was held to mark the International Wetlands Day. The state environment ministry will ensure that eco-tourism gets boost through recreational activities in sanctuaries and national parks as allowed under the Forest Conservation Act, Chauhan asserted. “We will ensure that the state’s wetlands and natural habitats are saved. For Dhanauri wetland and the natural habitat around upcoming Jewar airport, we will ensure its conservation and protection. I will hold a meeting with the officials concerned and speed up the conservation process,” said the minister. Yet to be recognised and protected by the forest department as the land is largely privately owned, the 101-hectare Dhanauri wetland is currently in poor shape, revealed a recent census. According to the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) - 2021 held by Wetlands International South Asia and the district forest department in January this year, only 1,344 waterbirds of 48 species were spotted against 6,227 waterbirds belonging to 59 species last year. “It’s high time that we need proper conservation management plan for Dhanauri wetland or else it will be lost in a few months, especially with upcoming dry season,” said TK Roy, conservationist and ecologist at Wetlands International.Meanwhile, a conservation plan by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) is pending on individual species — mainly on sarus crane, blackbucks and nilgai, due to their abundance — that exist in and around the proposed 5,000 acres site for the upcoming Noida International Airport. These species rely on a number of wetlands around the proposed site for food and water for their survival and the plan will aim at mitigating the impact, WII scientists had stated. While the clearance for the airport project has already been granted, WII has been tasked to chalk out a mitigation plan to reduce impact on wildlife and the ecology, especially in a 10-km radius or the area of influence of the project site. Meanwhile, the Okhla Bird Sanctuary received some major infrastructure boost, with the minister inaugurating a board room, cafeteria, camp office, high-resolution camera feed and cart service. “The high resolution camera feed was being tested and finally inaugurated by the minster today. It will enhance the vigilance and active monitoring, and will also be used for educational and awareness purpose. The live feed covers over 25% of the lake area where the bird concentration is generally high and is slightly less accessible. We will also soon get the live feed on the internet as well,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar. He added that one golf cart had also been bought in the sanctuary while five more will arrive within a week. The bird festival was attended by a number of birders, conservationists, and students, along with several wildlife organisations displaying their work in small stalls. “Such event should happen more often to boost the local birding community. It was hearty to see such encouragement from the forest department,” said Narendra Kohli, a city-based birder and photographer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/will-ensure-dhanauri-and-jewar-conservation-says-state-environment-minister-101612289565605.html
02-02-2021||Noida||Builder directed to refund ₹5.54 lakh to Greater Noida resident for delay in delivery of flat||GREATER NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed a builder to refund the deposited amount of ₹5.54 lakh to the buyer for delay in giving possession of a flat. The complainant had booked a flat in 2013 and till date he was not given its possession.According to the consumer forum’s order, Lt Colonel Pushpdharan, a resident of Greater Noida, had invested in a residential project and booked a two-bedroom flat having an area of 1,050 square feet. On April 4, 2013, he had paid first instalment of ₹2.77 lakh through cheque for the flat for which he got a receipt on April 26. The complainant paid second instalment of ₹2.77 lakh on July 11, 2013 and got receipt on August 6,2013. An allotment letter cum buyers agreement was executed on January 6, 2014, and as per agreement, the builder was to give possession in 30 months, with a delay of six months. As the developer could not give possession of the flat and neither refunded the amount, Pushpdharan had lodged a complaint with the district consumer forum on May 30, 2019. He stated he had invested in the flat for marriage of his daughter. The district consumer court had given notices and sent reminders to the builder, but the builder neither submitted a written reply nor sent his representative to appear .“The district consumer commission headed by president Anil Kumar Pundir and member Daya Shankar Pandey has decided the complaint ex-parte and directed the builder to refund the deposited amount of ₹5.54 lakh, along with 9% interest.

02-02-2021||Delhi||Haryana, UP, Rajasthan to submit report on action taken against polluting vehicles every two months, Centre tells SC||To curb air pollution in Delhi, even the state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana will have to submit reports on action taken against polluting diesel vehicles that are over 10 years old and petrol vehicles that are over 15 years old. The reports should be submitted once every two months to the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas, the body set up by the Union government to curb pollution.This was stated by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) in an affidavit submitted before the Supreme Court, which was hearing a clutch of petitions about the air pollution in Delhi.The affidavit highlighted steps taken by the Commission having representatives from states adjoining Delhi, as well as representatives from central ministries, and representatives of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state pollution control authorities.The Commission, which was appointed in November 2020, has identified five focus areas to tackle pollution in Delhi-NCR. These are: industrial pollution, agricultural stubble burning, municipal solid waste management and biomass burning, construction and demolition activities, and vehicular pollution.During Interactions with representatives from Delhi and neighbouring states, the Commission noticed a lack of enforcement against old polluting vehicles not just in Delhi but in cities adjoining the capital as well. The neighbouring states also did not have a traffic management plan in place to tackle vehicular pollution.The affidavit said, “It was strongly reiterated that such overaged petrol/diesel vehicles more than 15/10 years of age, must not be allowed to ply in NCR at any cost and if found doing so, shall be taken off the roads immediately.”Accordingly, the subcommittee on “safeguarding and enforcement”, under the Commission, this January 8 prepared a reporting format to be submitted by Delhi and adjoining states every two months. This format has details about over-aged vehicles impounded, traffic congestion spots identified and resolved, new pollution under control (PUC) centres added, existing and proposed parking facilities, and additional CNG fuelling stations.On industrial polluting units, the Commission examined nearly 6,042 units in Delhi-NCR and 3,138 were found to be using clean fuel (CNG/PNG). The Commission set a deadline of January 31 for the remaining 2,904 units (2220 in Haryana, 420 in UP, and 151 in Rajasthan) to convert to clean fuel.On stubble burning, the affidavit said the Commission’s focus was on crop residue management -- the paddy straw that is burnt could be cut and used by other industries as a source of fuel. The affidavit said, “Stubble burning and pollution arising therefrom is a major area of concern, particularly during the months of October-November…The Commission identified Crop Residue Management as one of the priority areas.”To facilitate this, the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmer Welfare under the Central government has developed an app-based aggregator platform for hiring and renting of farm machinery required for stubble cutting. The app called FARMS (Farm Machinery Solutions) has nearly 1.47 lakh individual farmers and over 22,000 custom hiring centres (CHC) across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Nearly 1.58 lakh machines have been supplied to individual farmers and CHCs through the app and other financial incentive schemes, the affidavit stated.The top court had expressed concerns over stubble burning after a public interest litigation (PIL) filed before the court pointed out that the pollution caused by stubble burning can impact even the Covid-19 mortality rate.In 2020, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh reported a decline in stubble burning incidents but Punjab reported a 15% increase. In Haryana, last year 5,000 farm fires were reported as compared to 6,652 in 2019. Punjab reported 76,590 farm fires as against 52,991 in 2019.On Tuesday, the court took up the PILs on stubble burning and air pollution in Delhi but adjourned the matter for two weeks. The Centre’s affidavit will be examined by the court on the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/haryana-up-rajasthan-to-submit-report-on-action-taken-against-polluting-vehicles-every-two-months-centre-tells-sc-101612289446324.html
02-02-2021||Noida||UP Gate: Tikait’s grief changed equation on the ground||In the three months since the protest against the Centre’s farm laws began at UP Gate, there has been a marked transformation in the participation. From November to January 26, the site had mostly farmers from Punjab and Uttarakhand and some from western Uttar Pradesh.Soon after the violence on Republic Day, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait’s tears that went viral two days later changed all that.Now, the farmers are mostly from western Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan,Karnataka, Haryana, Punjab and Maharasthra as well. What is more, it has revived a protest that seemed to have lost some steam following the violence. From several thousands, the UP Gate site gathering came down to about 800-1000 farmers, encouraging the Ghaziabad district to issue an ultimatum to the protesters to clear the site or be evicted. That was when the video did the trick.“Before Republic Day, there were thousands of farmers here and they marched to Delhi too. After the violence, however, many were on their way back. After the video went viral, more people have started coming in from western UP and other states and still coming in with food supplies and material,” Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of UP Gate farmers’ committee. “It is not so that farmers from Uttarakhand, Punjab and terai region have gone back permanently. They are on standby and will come within hours if need arises. We are still not calling them as here we can cater to a gathering of about 25000-30000 per day otherwise it becomes difficult to carry out crowd management.”The farmer leaders have also decided to change strategy to keep the momentum of the long drawn out protest going. “Under the new strategy, a group of 10 people from a village will take the place of a group from their village who can go and attend work at home and in fields. Then, they can come back and others from the site can go,” said Tejinder Singh Virk, a farmer leader from the terai region. “Seeing Rakesh Tikait in tears got people emotionally connected to the protest and now this agitation has also become a fight for honour. The pagri (a headgear) is a considered a mark of honour among villagers and also for members of the Sikh community. People from villages honour Tikait with a pagri almost every day now,” sad Rajbir Singh, BKU’s UP state vice-president. “Even the panchayats in western UP areas have galvanised people in support of farmers.”“People are coming and even offering their pagris to me but I politely decline. It is their mark of honour and no one can take their pagri. With support flowing in, our fight is gaining strength. We will not allow our ‘morcha’ (protest site) to break down. People who are coming are common man and villagers,” Tikait, said. On Tuesday morning Tikat sat alone on the footpath close to the Delhi Police’s heavy barricading and had lunch. The farmers say that such a gesture will connect more with the common man.“The agitation has now transformed into jan andolan (fight of the common man),” he said. Tractor-trolleys from UP bring groundnuts, laddus, fruit, kheer and also fresh supplies of vegetables to the protest site. Social activist Medha Patkar, who has been a regular visitor to the UP Gate site, said that the movement has transformed beyond the communities. “This protest has also removed the gender bias as many women are also coming forward and participating actively in protests. This has now transformed into a ‘jan andolan’ and it is an answer to the government that this country cannot be run by corporate,” Patkar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-gate-tikait-s-grief-changed-equation-on-the-ground-101612289324462.html

The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is indicative of the city’s temperature, recorded a maximum temperature of 36.3 degrees Celsius, which was 4.9 degrees above normal.While this was lower than the 36.4 degrees Celsius recorded on December 10, 2020, it was still the highest recorded temperature of the winter season. Prior to this, Santacruz had recorded a maximum temperature of 35.3 degrees Celsius on January 12.“Since the IMD considers January and February as the winter months, this is the highest temperature recorded in the ongoing winter season. November and December are months when the transition in temperatures happens,” said an official from IMD.At Colaba, too, the maximum temperature on Tuesday was high at 33.8 degrees Celsius, which was 3.5 degrees above normal. Minimum temperatures, too, were higher than normal.At Santacruz, the minimum temperature was 19.2 degrees Celsius, which was 1.6 degrees above normal. At Colaba, the minimum temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, which was 2.4 degrees above normal. The rise in temperatures comes after a week-long spell of cold conditions last week and is in line with the forecast by the IMD.Also read: No intention to bring central anti-conversion law - MHA tells Parliament“The delayed setting in of sea breeze led to higher temperatures in Mumbai and around.

It has been shared with the health department and we have informed our force to get vaccinated as per their turn,” he said. The vaccination sites include the commissioner’s office, traffic tower, police lines, Manesar police station, and City Sohna police station. Rao said the personnel will not have to travel far on the day of vaccination. “We have kept points at such locations that no one will have to travel for more than five kilometres to get vaccinated. It is mandatory for all personnel to get inoculated to win the war against Covid-19,” he said. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO) of Gurugram, Civil Hospital, said that the health department has received a list of 5,500 police personnel, 900 home guards, 1,200 special police officers (SPOs), 6,500 Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) front-line workers, 2,000 workers from Panchayati Raj and 500 from the revenue department of the district administration.

The targeted coverage for the vaccine is 500 healthcare workers, which is the lowest planned in a single day since the drive began on January 16. Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, also confirmed that front-line workers from other departments, such as the municipal corporation and the police, will start receiving doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from February 4, but said that specific details about targeted coverage, and beneficiaries were still being worked out. “We are still planning it out,” he said. As of February 2, a total of 22,372 healthcare workers have been inoculated against Covid-19 — as against a target of over 36,000 in the first phase of the roll-out. The health department has also acquired the details of more than 1,500 police personnel, about 6,500 front-line workers with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, and another 2,500 odd beneficiaries from the Panchayati Raj and revenue departments. Vaccination in HaryanaMeanwhile in Haryana, 1,16,481 doses have been administered till January 29 against the actual dose consumption of 1,28,660. This also meant that more than 90% of the doses have been successfully utilised for inoculation, thereby recording an average vaccine wastage of 9.43% as opposed to the programmatic wastage of 10% allowed by the Union ministry of health. Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said that better vaccination session planning which led to inoculation of more health care workers was a major reason the wastage was within the permissible limits. Out of about 1.9 lakh healthcare workers registered on the CoWin software for prioritizing beneficiaries of vaccination, about 1.28 lakh, about 67% were inoculated by Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccination-to-resume-in-city-101612289144388.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||Developers welcome Budget announcements on affordable housing||The affordable housing segment, which has witnessed robust sales during the last two years, is likely to get a further boost in the city due to the announcements made in the Union Budget 2021-22 regarding the extension of tax holiday for affordable housing and relief on home loans for buyers, said city-based developers. The state government has already increased the area available for development of affordable housing in residential sectors and to make it more feasible. The area norms for projects have also been tweaked. There are around 80 affordable housing projects on the ground in city alone, which account for around 40,000 apartments in various stages of construction. The finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, on Monday extended the period for extra deduction of ₹1.5 lakh available for loans up to March 31, 2022. The government has also extended the time limit for availing tax holiday on affordable projects up to March 31, 2022. She has also announced tax holiday for affordable rental housing projects. Santosh Agarwal, executive director, AlphaCorp, said that the measures announced by government will provide impetus to housing demand and encourage buyers to invest in real estate. “Emphasis on infrastructure is good but the long-standing demand for a single-window clearance and industry status are still to see the light of the day,” he said.Realty experts said that almost half of the property bookings witnessed in the city were of affordable housing projects and plots sales under Deen Dayal Antodaya Yojana(DDAY) scheme. “The government by announcing tax sops has made its intentions clear that it wants to push affordable housing further. The state government has also eased norms and this will help in boosting demand,” said Pankaj Singh, a real estate dealer. Pradeep Aggarwal, chairman, Signature Global, a city-based affordable housing developer, expects the demand to increase in the city in the coming months. “The response to affordable projects was good even after the lockdown. The sops announced by government will help all the stakeholders,” he said. While developers and dealers were upbeat about future prospects, the buyers want the builders to stick to the timelines for completing projects. “ I have bought a property in Sector 70 and the builder has completed only 10 percent work despite repeated directions from authorities. This should not happen,” said a buyer, who wished anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/developers-welcome-budget-announcements-on-affordable-housing-101612289145256.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||Court dismisses plea to make graft accused undergo lie detector test||A local court on Tuesday dismissed a plea to conduct a lie detector test on suspended police officer Vishal Kumar, who is accused in a ₹57-lakh graft case and for illegally detaining a call centre owner. A polygraph test — popularly referred to as a lie-detector test — measures and records several physiological indices such as pulse, respiration, blood pressure and skin conductivity while the subject is asked to answer a series of questions. The State Vigilance Bureau had sought the court’s permission on January 25 to conduct a lie detector test on Kumar and narco analysis of suspended head constable Amit Kumar. The officials had also asked for the permission to take the voice samples of Kumar and one of their aides, a farm house owner that has been granted on Tuesday. SS Chauhan, counsel for Vishal Kumar, said the application for permission for polygraph test was dismissed by the court as Kumar did not give his consent and it is mandatory to take the consent from a victim or an accused in the court. “Vishal denied undergoing the lie-detector test. He has been booked solely on the basis of the statement by the call centre owner and there is no circumstantial evidence against him. Kumar has consistently denied any role in the kidnapping and bribery case. Hence, the probe agency wants to use the lie detector test to verify his claims. This, the agency hopes, will give direction to the ongoing probe,” he said. The case will come up in court on February 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/court-dismisses-plea-to-make-graft-accused-undergo-lie-detector-test-101612289086702.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||DTCP carries out demolition drive in Dhumaspur||The enforcement wing of department of town and country (DTCP) on Tuesday carried out a demolition drive in village Dhumaspur, around 12km from Gurugram, in which 15 under-construction houses, several plinths, boundary walls and a road network spread over 40 acres were demolished. Earlier on Monday, the department removed encroachments from Arcadia Market in DLF where kiosks, vends and illegal eateries were removed. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that an illegal colony being developed in Dhumaspur, on around 40 acres, was demolished during the drive with the support from a team of Gurugram Police. “There was initial resistance from the plot owners but it was made clear to them that the unauthorised construction was illegal. Around 100 plinths, boundary walls and a road network over 40 acres were demolished along with 15 under-construction houses,” said Bhath. A team of around eight DTCP officials and over 100 police personnel carried out the demolition. Earlier on Monday, the enforcement team of DTCP carried out a similar demolition drive in Arcadia Market. Bhath said that after clearing the market of the encroachments, the team removed unauthorised structures from residential plots such as mechanic shops, fruit vends, grocer shops and dhabas, which were operating without permission. The enforcement team also demolished rooms and similar other structures, which have been constructed in stilt parkings, in violation of building plans. “Action was also taken at around 10 plots, where violations were carried out after obtaining occupation certificates,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner. Markets in and around private colonies like Palam Vihar, Nirvana Country, Suncity, Sushant Lok, Uppal Southend, Malibu Towne and other areas are also on the radar of the DTCP as a number of complaints have been received from residents in these areas regarding encroachments and illegal occupation of corridors. Officials said that they would coordinate with other civic agencies such as Municipal Corporation of Gurugram(MCG) and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to check these issues in the markets that fall under their jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-carries-out-demolition-drive-in-dhumaspur-101612289086091.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||State to seek Ramsar certification for Sultanpur National Park||The state forest department plans to recommend the Sultanpur National Park in Gurugram and the Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary in Jhajjar district for declaration as Ramsar sites. Both are popular birding destinations, providing habitat for a large variety of resident and migratory species, and happen to be the only two such water bodies in Haryana with legal protection under the MoEFCC’s Wetland Rules (2017). Department officials confirmed that two separate proposals have been drawn up in the format required by the Ramsar Convention, and will be sent by the state government to the Centre for further consideration. Ramsar sites — as per UNESCO’s 1971 Convention on Wetlands held in Ramsar, Iran — are wetlands of international significance. Experts and officials explained that having a Ramsar certification brings international visibility to ecologically sensitive wetlands and provides an impetus for their conservation. Officials said on Tuesday that this proposal was first floated in 2015. “It did not go through at the time, for some reason. In 2019, we revisited the proposal, but again, it fell through. We were told last year told to start work on the proposal again. District-level teams finished their fieldwork and submitted the information to us a few months ago. Our final proposal is presently with the state government and we expect it to reach the Centre next week. From there, it will be sent to the Convention,” said ML Rajvanshi, chief conservator of forests, Haryana, on Tuesday, which was also the World Wetlands Day. Experts lauded this as a positive step in protecting important birding areas in Sultanpur and Bhindawas, but also viewed the development with caution. “Getting a Ramsar tag is very good optically, and it does create accountability for governments to protect the wetland. But the challenge will be to maintain the area up to the required standard. This may not be very easy in Sultanpur, for example, from where we keep hearing reports of encroachments and such. It’s a good step that Haryana is taking, but we will have to see if the Ramsar Convention honours the proposal. The rules are quite strict,” said Bikram Grewal, a veteran ornithologist and a Delhi-based author. This view was echoed by other experts, including TK Roy, state co-ordinator for Netherlands-based Wetlands International (one of the six international organisation partners that work with the Convention). “The quality of the habitat in both Bhindawas and Sultanpur has been declining, as have the number of birds that visit there every year. While it is fine to seek Ramsar certification, what is really needed in Haryana is to notify newer birding destinations, like Basai and Najafgarh, as wetlands. But the merits of doing that are still being debated in courts, while existing wetlands are in poor shape.” Roy also referenced the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s zonal master plan for Sultanpur National Park, drafted in 2019 and cleared in October 2020, in which the buffer around the park has been kept at three kilometres, despite the National Green Tribunal instating an area of five kilometres as a no-construction zone. “The anthropogenic stress on Sultanpur is significant, and it would certainly be considered by the Convention. It is common knowledge that the catchment area has seen rampant unauthorised construction,” Roy said. Similarly in Jhajjar, experts called attention to the Mandothi wetland, located about 40 kilometres from Bhindawas, which has emerged as a popular birding destination in recent years. “Despite being an incredible wetland, Mandothi does not have the same protection as Bhindawas. Even the Dighal wetland in Jhajjar is a similar example,” said Pankaj Gupta of the Delhi Bird Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/state-to-seek-ramsar-certification-for-sultanpur-national-park-101612289085557.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||Case against Amazon for selling counterfeit goods||The police on Monday filed a case against e-commerce seller Amazon for allegedly allowing the sale of counterfeit products on its website.A private company based in Udyog Vihar has alleged that counterfeit versions of their ayurvedic products were being sold on the portal and despite repeated requests, the product continued to remain on the website. A case under Section 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code and Section 63 of Copyright Act was registered against the company at the Udyog Vihar police station on Monday, said police.Police commissioner KK Rao said that the complainant, Devender Singh, had ordered two ayurvedic products made by his company from Amazon on November 13, 2020. When he received the order five days later, he found that both the products were duplicate. “The products were a copy of his registered products and were sold openly on the Amazon site. The complainant has given us a copy of emails written to Amazon. But even after repeated reminders, neither did they remove the products nor assured him of the needful,” he said.A spokesperson for Amazon India said, “Our customers expect that when they make a purchase through Amazon’s marketplace they will receive authentic products. Amazon strictly prohibits the sale of counterfeit products and we invest heavily in both funds and company energy to ensure our policy is followed by third party sellers selling on Amazon.in. We investigate any claim of counterfeit thoroughly, including removing the item, permanently removing the bad actor, pursuing legal action as appropriate.”Singh said that his company sells at least 5,000 units of the two products in question — a de-addiction remedy and a balm — online every month. “I was surfing the internet in November when I found that our registered products were being sold with the same name by another company,” he said.The police said the complainant tried to contact the toll-free number provided by the company and when he could not get through, he emailed the seller asking for a copy of the invoice, but did not get one.“When I approached Amazon in January, on its toll-free number to seek clarification, instead of receiving a resolution, the customer care representative abused me. So I reported the matter to the police,” said Singh.Rao said they have identified the alleged counterfeiter of the products as a resident of Bhopal. A team from Udyog Vihar police station had raided the office in Bhopal on Monday, but could not find the suspect.A notice has been issued to the suspect to join the investigation, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/case-against-amazon-for-selling-counterfeit-goods-101612289085037.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||HSVP to take action against institutional plot owners for violating norms||Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has decided to take action against institutional plot holders for violating regulations. As per HSVP officials, these plot holders have either not made payments for allotment of plots, or have delayed construction or failed to adhere to the required timeline. The authority has sought a detailed list of such allottees from zonal administrators.In a letter issued on January 25, the chief administrator, HSVP, asked the zonal administrators of Gurugram, Faridabad, Hisar, Panchkula and Rohtak to identify institutional plot holders who have not deposited the 15 percent margin money, those who have deposited only 15 percent margin money and not the rest, and those who have only made a partial payment. The letter further stated that the timeline for the construction of plots was between two and five years. Although this was later extended up to eight years but several plot holders have failed to adhere even to the extended timeline. “It has been observed that there are several such allottees who have not made complete payment for plots. There are also others who have not carried out construction as per the norms but no action has been taken against them,” stated the letter, adding that a complete list of such plots should be prepared and submitted to the headquarters by February 8. The institutional plots are allotted to different categories of institutions, including social, charitable, religious and philanthropic ones. These are also allotted to educational institutions, businesses and government organisations. In Gurugram, the authority has developed sectors 18, 32 and 44 for institutional allotment, said officials. Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, said that they will prepare a detailed list of such plots and also ask the allottees to make payments and meet all other requirements for the allotment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-to-take-action-against-institutional-plot-owners-for-violating-norms-101612289084388.html
02-02-2021||Noida||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut extends support to farmers at UP Gate||Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut on Tuesday was the latest politician to criticise the heavy barricading at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border at UP Gate to prevent entry of large numbers of farmers protesting the Centre’s farm laws into the national capital.Raut, who visited the UP Gate protest site on the day, said that the government should speak to farmers and resolve the issue. “After January 26 (referring to the Republic Day clash between farmers and police in Delhi) an attempt was made to crush the protest. We thought that the people of Maharasthra should stand by them (farmers). I am not here for a political visit, but I have come here to lend support to Tikait ji (Bharatiya Kisan Union [BKU] leader Rakesh Tikait)... If such heavy roadblocks had been put at the China border, then they would not have been able to make inroads into Ladakh referring to the ongoing standoff against China that started after 20 Indian soldiers were killed at the border),” Raut told reporters. He said that his party opposed the new farm laws. “We have opposed the new farm laws from day one. We extended support to farmers of the entire country and Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief, Uddhav Thackeray, has especially sent me here to meet Tikait ji and to say to him that we stand with him strongly. It is likely that the Uddhav sahab will also talk to him in a day or two. Ye rajnitik andolan nahi hai, ye andolan sadak ka hai aur sadak pe rahega (This is not a political agitation. It is a protest on road and will stay on roads),” he said.Tikait was shot into limelight soon after the January 26 clashes when a video of him in tears and saying that he would rather kill himself than give up on the movement went viral. Tikait is the son of late farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait who had famously rought Delhi to a standstill in 1988. The moment reinvigorated the farmers’ protest that had shown signs of losing some steam in the wake of the clashes. Soon, thousands of protesters arrived at the Ghaziabad border necessitating the move by the Delhi Police to barricade the border with concertina wires, concrete blocks and iron nails to puncture tractor tyres.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi while tweeting the pictures said, “Build bridges, not walls!” Even the farmers protesting on the Ghaziabad side of the border seemed infuriated with the heavy barricading. “It seems that we are standing in a different country. Generally, we see such arrangements at India-Pakistan border but this one here is unprecedented,” said Khan Chand Yadav, a farmer who had come from Dariyapur in Bulandshahr district. “If police thinks that they can control us, they are wrong. If our leaders direct us, we will demolish such barricading within minutes. But we are carrying on peaceful protest,” said Yoginder Singh, a farmer who arrived from Chapprauli in Baghpat district. “More so, we are now protesting to remove the ‘Kalank’ (blot) when some unruly elements put up a flag at the Red Fort on the Republic Day. Our protest is also to demand an inquiry and action against the culprits. Otherwise, our families have told us that we come home only when we get the blot completely removed,” he, added. Meanwhile, the Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava on Tuesday dismissed criticism on the multi-level barricading at various borders. “I am surprised when tractors were used on January 26 and police were attacked and barricading was broken, no on raised questions. What we did? We have just strengthened the barricades so that they should not be broken time and again,” Srivastava told reporters in Delhi. Further, with many opposition leaders visiting UP Gate and meeting Tikait after events unfolded on January 28, Rakesh Tikait has maintained that visit by politicians from opposition parties is not “political.” “They are our guest, and we welcome any guest who comes here. We are not allowing any political persons to share dais at our protest site,” he added. After the developments on January 28, many politicians have visited UP Gate site. Prominent among those were Delhi’s deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, UP Congress committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda, while many others have already spoken to Tikait over the phone and extended help and support. The site also saw visits by Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Singh Chautala and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/shiv-sena-leader-sanjay-raut-extends-support-to-farmers-at-up-gate-101612289026688.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram school murder: CBI court raps govt, police over delay in prosecuting four cops||Rapping the state government and the state police, the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court of Haryana on Tuesday said “they are sleeping like a Khumbhakarna” instead of discharging their statutory duties, over the delay in granting prosecution sanction for four Gurugram police personnel in the school murder case. The court directed that the requisite action be taken within 10 days. Aman Inder Singh, special judicial magistrate of the CBI court in Panchkula on Tuesday, observed, “What makes the situation more pathetic is the fact of sleeping over the request of CBI like a Kumbhakarna instead of discharging its statutory duties without delay.” The court observed that the authorities are not taking action to protect their colleagues and at the same time, they are not rejecting the request for sanction, fearing judicial scrutiny. The CBI had written to the home principal secretary of the Haryana government, seeking a request sanction to prosecute assistant commissioner of police, Birem Singh, on August 19, 2020. On September 30, the CBI had written to the director general of Haryana Police for obtaining requisite sanction to prosecute inspector Narender Singh Khatana and sub-inspector Subhash Chand, but the permission is still pending. On January 6, the CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet against four Gurugram police officers for falsely implicating a school bus conductor and for fabricating documents against him in the 2017 school murder case. The probe agency, which had named a juvenile as the main accused and filed a chargesheet in February 2018, said in the supplementary chargesheet that “there is sufficient evidence for prosecution” against four police officials who allegedly implicated the bus conductor and accused him of murder and sexual assault. Birem Singh, then ACP, Narender Khatana, then station house officer of Bhondsi police station, Shamsher Singh, sub-inspector and the investigating officer for two days, and Subhash Chand, ASI, are the four officials named. “The accused four police officials virtually made life hell for Ashok Kumar and put his entire family on the brink of starvation. The incident gave a bad name to him in society and put a blot on his career, which will take time to vanish. The best solace for this person in the scenario will be that accused person who were responsible for his plight should face prosecution and the law should take its course, but to my utter surprise, the concerned sanctioning authorities are sitting upon the request of sanction,” the court observed in its order. “More than five months have elapsed and the sanctioning authority is yet to wake up from its deep slumber,” the court observed. Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the victim, said, “The government is obliged to provide sanction to the suspects. The law has to take its own course. The constitutional duty conferred on the state warrants that the accused not be spared and be brought to the subject of law. The delay in providing sanction is akin to denying justice.”The case is now listed for February 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-school-murder-cbi-court-raps-govt-police-over-delay-in-prosecuting-four-cops-101612289026157.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG to take over Maruti Vihar within two weeks||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is set to take over Maruti Vihar, a gated colony on the Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road, within the next two weeks. An internal order in this regard was issued last week by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, directing the agency’s engineering wing to assess civic deficiencies in the colony, and accordingly, issue tenders to rectify or build new infrastructure. Singh further directed the officials to complete the tendering process within two weeks and take over the colony immediately. “The assessment will help the MCG identify areas where civic upgrades are required on priority. Directions have been issued to the officials concerned to take over the colony at the earliest and a maximum deadline of two weeks has been set, so that the MCG can start providing optimum civic services to residents of Maruti Vihar on an immediate basis,” said Singh.Spread across 23 acres, Maruti Vihar is sandwiched between DLF Phase-4 and MG Road, due to which the colony has a high real estate value. It was set up in 1988, when the Haryana Housing Board had allotted developed land to the Maruti Employees Cooperative Housing Building Society for setting up a colony. Allotment of properties commenced in 1991. Over time, the original owners have moved out of the colony, which currently houses residents from varying backgrounds. As per the Maruti Vihar residents’ welfare association (RWA), there are 1,118 houses in the colony that house at least 6,000 people.Last year, the RWA of the colony had approached RS Rathee, the MCG councillor of Ward 34, requesting that the MCG take over the colony due to insufficient funds for upkeep, leading to degradation of civic infrastructure.“Over the past decade, the MCG has been assisting us by providing several civic facilities within the colony. They have provided us with water supply, looked after the parks, and also constructed tube wells at their own cost. We realised that the resources of the MCG have been heavily beneficial for the society, which the RWA couldn’t have been able to provide. Hence, we wanted MCG to take over all the services,” said JK Sharma, president, Maruti Vihar RWA. Sharma cited several civic deficiencies in the colony, with streetlights being the worst affected. “The RWA is spending around ₹3 lakh per month for running existing streetlights. It is already proving to be expensive for us, and we are in not in a financial position to add new streetlights. Thus, there is a great need among residents for MCG to take over the colony and fix such issues,” said Sharma.According to RS Rathee, the entire takeover process took just six months. “Unlike other colonies taken over by the MCG, Maruti Vihar was not set up by a private developer. So, when I took up the matter, only public departments such as the MCG, Haryana Housing Board and the Department of Town and Country Planning were involved. Since all the requisite formalities were done at an internal government level, the entire process was completed in quick time,” said Rathee.Maruti Vihar is located next to Saraswati Vihar, which was also developed by the Haryana Housing Board on 61 acres in the late 1980s and taken over by the MCG in early 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-take-over-maruti-vihar-within-two-weeks-101612289025556.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||Decomposed carcasses of leopard, hyenas found in Sohna||The district forest department on Tuesday recovered decomposed carcasses of one adult leopard and two adult hyenas from the forest area near the Aravalli village of Saanp ki Nangli in Sohna tehsil. Officials said that a post-mortem examination conducted during the afternoon was inconclusive at determining the cause of death, and that viscera samples from all three animals have been dispatched to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, to be tested for poisoning. However, it has been confirmed that the leopard is not the same animal which was spotted last week in south-west Delhi’s Ghumanhera neighbourhood. “They cannot be the same animal because the carcasses we found were extremely decomposed. The deaths occurred at least a week ago. In any case, it would have been extremely hard for a leopard to make its way from Najafgarh to Sohna in just a few days without being noticed,” said Rajesh Chahal, district wildlife inspector. The carcasses were reported to the police by villagers from Saanp ki Nangli early on Tuesday, who then informed the wildlife department. Officials said they are not yet able to confidently attribute the deaths of the three animals. The hyenas were both males, and around 10 years old. They would have been approaching the end of their life, making them easy targets for leopards on the hunt. Officials said that the leopard, meanwhile, was a female of around two to three years old. According to the post-mortem examination, the animal was not pregnant. “We have not really seen such a situation before. The carcasses were all found in the same spot, barely 200 or 300 metres apart from one another. They did not show any signs of grievous injury. If the animals were poisoned, either purposely or inadvertently, we will know only once the reports come later in the week. But this does not seem like the work of poachers at all. If that was the case, the bodies would not have been left in the forest like that,” said MS Malik, chief conservator of forests, south Haryana. In another incident, the wildlife department on Tuesday was unable to find any presence of a leopard in villages lying upstream of the Najafgarh basin in south-west Delhi. A leopard had been spotted in the area multiple times late last week, with officials speculating on Sunday that it may have crossed over into Haryana, upstream of the Najafgarh drain, toward the Aravalli mountain ridge between Manesar and Tauru. Officials also confirmed that they will no longer be actively surveying the area, starting Wednesday. “We sent out teams yesterday and today, but there were no pug marks, droppings or any signs of hunting in the area. Locals have not seen anything either,” said Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/decomposed-carcasses-of-leopard-hyenas-found-in-sohna-101612289024988.html
02-02-2021||Gurugram||MCG to start civic services in DLF 1, 2 and 3 next month||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will start providing some civic amenities to DLF Phases 1, 2, and 3 from next month, ahead of an impending total takeover, officials said on Tuesday. These services would include cleaning of roads and drains, pruning of trees, installing of sewage treatment plant (STP), open-air gyms and compost plants, and laying pavement tiles. A decision in this regard was taken in a review meeting between the officials of MCG and DLF last month. The approved proceedings of this meeting were documented on Saturday, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times. During the meeting, MCG officials decided that the civic body will start with the services for which there are no deficiencies or pending infrastructure, as per the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the three colonies. MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh directed the civic body’s engineering wing to prepare estimates for such services, float tenders and start work on the ground. “We realised that instead of waiting for the handover process to be completed, there are certain civic amenities that the MCG can start providing on an immediate basis, and subsequently, take charge of other amenities, such as roads, drains and streetlights, when the colony is taken over. Directions have been issued to the engineering wing officials to provide such amenities within a short time,” said Singh. In 2017, the MCG had carried out a civic infrastructure survey of the three colonies to determine the estimated cost of repairs and new infrastructure in the three DLF Phases. The assessment, done as per the building plans for the three colonies approved by the directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) in the 1980s, pegged the cost at ₹192.91 crore in the three colonies. This was revised to ₹35.44 crore after the developer raised issues regarding the estimate. It is only after the developer, DLF, completes the works — road repairs, water supply, sewerage, parks, open spaces and streetlights — that the colonies be taken over by the MCG. “We will complete all the civic works mentioned in the DPR at the earliest timeline. In the interim, any additional development works in the three colonies can be carried out by the MCG. We have also requested the DTCP to provide the completion certificate for the three colonies,” said David Amalraj, senior vice president, DLF Limited. In the meeting, the MCG directed DLF to give them the “shortest possible” deadline by when they can hand over the three colonies. “The speed of work got slowed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and DLF Ltd is committed to completing the balance work at the earliest possible,” a representative of DLF Ltd had stated in the meeting. In February 2016, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed the MCG to take over the three colonies. The approved proceedings of the meeting further mention that a review meeting regarding the takeover of DLF Phases 1, 2 and 3 will be held on February 10. “Another key decision taken during the meeting was that the MCG’s engineering wing and the ward councillors will together survey the three colonies for civic infrastructure augmentation. Once the survey is over, tenders would be floated for carrying out the work,” said RS Rathee, MCG councillor of Ward 34. “We have been eagerly waiting for the takeover for the past five years. The fact that the MCG has decided to provide us with some share of civic services is extremely important as we view it as a precursor to the final handing over of the colonies. We now can approach the MCG for such services,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-start-civic-services-in-dlf-1-2-and-3-next-month-101612289024348.html
02-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra expects phase 2 to boost Covid-19 vaccination turnout||After a two-day delay owing to technical glitches in CoWIN app, the second phase of inoculation, including frontline workers, will begin at some centres in Maharashtra from Wednesday. Acting on the Centre’s instructions, phase 2 covering frontline workers has begun, even as the first phase for healthcare workers (HCW) is still on. The state authorities have inoculated 309,446 healthcare workers in 10 sessions from January 16 till Monday. Along with about 786,000 HCWs, the state has enrolled more than 600,000 frontline workers. “We have completed dry and trial runs to begin inoculation at some centres from Wednesday. The app went live for frontline workers from Tuesday morning after the initial glitches,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, state health services. The technical glitches in the centralised CoWIN app delayed the rollout of the second phase, scheduled on February 1. The authorities were facing difficulties sending out messages to the beneficiaries and also in transfer of data from the state to districts. The state authorities expect the percentage of vaccination to improve after the frontline workers are added to the daily sessions. “Against say a target of 100 people per centre, we have been able to inoculate 75-80 HCWs daily. With the addition of frontline workers, the percentage is expected to improve further. The centres have been flexible in admitting beneficiaries,” said an official from the health department. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the pace of vaccination will pick up. “After initial technical issues, the vaccination percentage has improved and more beneficiaries are turning up. There would not be any issue during the second phase of the vaccination,” he said. Although it was a break for the inoculation drive in rest of the state, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) vaccinated 6,387 healthcare workers, out of the 8,000 expected beneficiaries, with a turnout of 80% on Tuesday. Of these, eight people reported minor side effects of dizziness, called Adverse Event following immunization (AEFI), and were kept under observation for 30 minutes and discharged. So far, BMC has vaccinated 53,784 healthcare workers. It presently has 12 vaccination centres in the city, at four major hospitals – King Edward Memorial, BYL Nair, Cooper and Sion Hospitals; four peripheral hospitals – Bhabha at Bandra, VN Desai at Santacruz, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital, Kandivli; the Covid facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex; and the state-run JJ Hospital in south Mumbai, NESCO in Goregaon, and SevenHills hospital. Another health department officer said they have started sending out messages to the frontline workers who are expected to turn up from Wednesday. “The centres are expected to inoculate more and also save the wastage of doses,” the official said. Meanwhile, the state reported 1,927 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, taking the tally to 2,030,274 and toll to 51,139. Mumbai’s tally touched 309,637 and toll 11,368, after the addition of 334 fresh cases and 7 deaths. The state’s case fatality rate stands at 2.52%. Pune and Nagpur clocked 188 and 161 cases, respectively. After 4,011 patients recovered on Tuesday, the recovery rate of the state was 95.37%. Maharashtra has 41,586 active patients, the highest (13,487) in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-expects-phase-2-to-boost-covid-19-vaccination-turnout-101612288485176.html

02-02-2021||Chandigarh||Get high-security number plates or pay ₹5,000 fine in Chandigarh||The Registration and Licensing Authority, Chandigarh, is going for stricter implementation of mandatory high security registration plate (HSRPs) and third registration mark (colour-coded sticker) on all old and new vehicles registered in the city.From March, the RLA will ask police to impose a fine of ₹3,000 and ₹5,000 on two- and four-wheelers, respectively, found in violation. As of now, the deadline of February 28 has been set only for CH01BK and BL series. To prevent any rush, staggered enforcement will be followed for other series.“For vehicles registered after the introduction of dealer-point vehicle registration in 2019, the RC was not issued without an HSRP. But, for vehicles registered earlier, there was a lack of uniformity in number plates. To ensure uniformity, as per the latest directions of the ministry of road transport and highways, all Chandigarh-registered vehicles must have only the stipulated HSRP and third registration mark plates. Failure to comply can invite challan,” said Virat, RLA. Owners of vehicles with numbers in CH01BK and CH01BL series can apply for affixing HSRP and third registration mark at the RLA office in Sector 17 by February 28 as per the procedure available on the website chdtransport.gov.in, said Virat.For vehicles in CH01BM to BT series, too, owners can apply at the RLA office, though no deadline has been set. Similarly, owners of vehicles in other old or existing series can apply at the RLA office or the SDM (south) office at the Sports Complex in Sector 42 or the SDM (east) office at the CTU Workshop in Industrial Area, Phase 1.The transport department has also authorised dealers of the original equipment manufacturers to affix colour coded stickers and HSRPs on old and new vehicles. The replacement of an existing registration plate can be done only after ensuring that the old plate has been surrendered and destroyed on the office premises.The vehicles owners who fail to get the number plates affixed are liable for prosecution under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, and Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/get-high-security-number-plates-or-pay-5-000-fine-in-chandigarh-101612288365072.html
02-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3 pose as NIA officers to extort ₹2 crore from businessman, arrested||The Kalachowki police have arrested three persons for allegedly trying to extort ₹2 crore from a Lower Parel-based bullion merchant by posing as National Investigation Agency (NIA) officers. Police said one of them posed as deputy commissioner of police (DCP), posted with NIA. The accused managed to extort the amount of ₹25 lakh from the trader by threatening to book him in a false case.The arrested accused have been identified as Rajesh Bansi Pawar, Vijay Singh alias Mahesh Panchvaktra and Iqbal Khan. According to police, the complainant is a bullion merchant from Lower Parel, and has a wholesale and retail gold business and is a resident of Central Mumbai.A police officer said in November 2020, the complainant’s car was intercepted by three people at Bharatmata junction near Lalbaug. One of accused identified himself as DCP, NIA, whereas the two others posed as his subordinates. They took his car keys and showed their (fake) identity cards to the trader.“The trio told the businessman that they had received a criminal complaint against him, they would register an offence and raid his house and office if he failed to pay them ₹2 crore. The businessman then bargained with the three and paid them ₹25 lakh,” said a police officer from the Kalachowki police station. The complainant later enquired about the “NIA officials” and found that no such officers were working with the anti-terrorism agency. Later, the complainant also learnt that the trio who extorted money from him was arrested by the Kalachowki police red-handed while accepting ₹16 lakh extorted in a similar manner from another businessman in December 2020. After waiting for a month, the businessman lodged a complaint and a case was registered against the fake NIA officers. “We took custody of the three accused from jail and after their role was found in the case they were placed under arrest. They have been remanded to police custody up to February 6,” said Vijay Patil, DCP zone-4.During the investigation, the accused revealed that they had seen the news on TV channels about NIA cracking down on gold merchants in smuggling cases. They got an idea of extorting money from bullion merchants by posing as NIA officials, DCP Patil added.Police sources said that the accused Panchavaktra is a key member of the group who had his own business but had to shut down after income tax raids. Thereafter he ventured into cheating businessmen, said the officer.The three have been booked for impersonating a public servant, cheating, extortion, forgery, robbery and criminal conspiracy under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-3-pose-as-nia-officers-to-extort-2-crore-from-businessman-arrested-101612288304945.html
02-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh records 50% decline in Covid cases in January||The Covid-19 trajectory is showing a downward trend with the number of fresh cases in January seeing 50% decline as compared to December while the fatalities also dropping by nearly 60%. Chandigarh has reported 1,177 cases and 17 deaths in January, lowest since August when the virus started spreading rapidly with easing of lockdown restrictions. The trend is similar to that seen in the neighbouring districts of Mohali and Panchkula.However, experts caution that we should not lower our guard, and testing and precautions should continue as usual.“In the West, the pandemic has broken previous records with new waves, after a significant drop. Thus, the strategy of testing, isolation, and treatment should continue, and should remain a priority. Lowering our guard can be harmful,” said Dr KK Talwar, an adviser to the Punjab government and former director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.With the dip in cases, the pressure on healthcare facilities has also started to ease, said Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director-cum-principal, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, while adding that testing and treatment of patients remains a priority. “Preventive measures have to be taken even if the cases are dropping and there should be no complacency. As the vaccination drive has started, it instils a sense of confidence among workers for providing services related to Covid-19,” she said.Dr Yogesh Chawla, former PGIMER director, said vaccination of other groups should also begin at the earliest. “It will bring confidence among the population to avail themselves of healthcare services and bring the pandemic under control,” he said. Given the drop in numbers, the facilities and workers earmarked for Covid-19 should be substantially decreased and non-Covid services should be put back on track, said Dr RS Bedi, former president, Indian Medical Association, Chandigarh Chapter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-records-50-decline-in-covid-cases-in-january-101612288245428.html
02-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC nod to resolve standoff between Maharashtra government, private hospitals||The Bombay high court (HC) has agreed to resolve the standoff between the state government and private hospitals regarding reserving beds for Covid patients in private hospitals.The private hospitals and doctors approached the HC objecting to high-handedness of the government while fixing the charges the hospitals could recover from Covid patients and refusal to give compensation to private doctors who succumbed to Covid while treating patients privately.The court was informed that the state had proposed to de-notify private hospitals or reduce the bed reservation to 50% and the grievance of the private hospitals could be resolved amicably, hence the court should allow the resolution to happen before it. The court accepted the same, and allowed two state government officials and two representatives of the petitioners to be present for the resolution process and posted it for Wednesday. A division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and Vinay Joshi, while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by private hospitals and privately practising doctors, who were represented by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), was informed by advocate SU Kamdar for IMA that private hospitals should be allowed to recover charges from Covid patients admitted to the beds that did not fall under the government reservation beds and the government should have no say in the same. However, additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan for the state informed the bench, that on January 29 a meeting was held by the officials of the state health ministry, wherein, it was proposed that in light of the number of Covid cases going down and beds in government hospitals in every district sufficient to take care of Covid patients, it would be left to the district collectors and municipal commissioners to decide on whether to denotify private hospitals requisitioned for treating Covid patients during the height of the pandemic. The minutes of the meeting, however, stated that as there was a shortage of intensive care units (ICU) in government hospitals, it would be better to reduce the reservation of beds in private hospitals to 50%.However, Kamdar objected saying that there was no clarity on how to segregate patients between private and reserved beds and also the charges that could be recovered from the patients.Chavan assured the court that the health department did not intend to fight with the private hospitals or private doctors and hence wanted to resolve the issue by clarifying all doubts, hence requested the court to hold a hearing between the officials and IMA representatives in the chamber. The court accepted the same and posted the hearing in the chamber on Wednesday at 5pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-nod-to-resolve-standoff-between-maharashtra-government-private-hospitals-101612288185052.html

02-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders action against hostile witnesses in all appropriate cases||Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has recently directed all sessions courts across Maharashtra to initiate action against hostile witnesses in all appropriate cases, observing that respect for law cannot be ensured by threat of legal action, but time has come to send out a loud and clear message that witnesses turning hostile cannot be ignored or pardoned anymore.“We cannot turn a blind eye to the menace of hostile witnesses, and we cannot find ourselves helpless as against the conduct of the hostile witnesses,” said the bench of justice Ravindra Gauge and justice BU Debadwar after noticing that five of seven important witnesses in a murder case before it had turned hostile.The judges said they were finding hostile witnesses in every other case and it was a matter of serious concern if it was happening for extraneous considerations. “This would not only be a serious ailment/disease to the justice dispensation system but could as well be cancerous to the rule of law,” said the bench while reversing the conviction of Saraswati Landge, a resident of Ambejogai in Beed district.An additional sessions judge at Ambejogai had on September 14, 2014, convicted the 73-year-old for murdering her husband, Ganpat. She was held guilty for having crushed his head by a heavy stone when he was fast asleep and also forcefully twisting his genitals, causing considerable damage to his private parts in October 2013.The woman had moved in an appeal against her conviction and life imprisonment handed down to her by the trial court on several grounds. HC found force in the argument advanced by advocate Aniket Vagal on her behalf that five important witnesses had not supported the prosecution case, apart from the fact that there were several discrepancies in the evidence, creating severe doubt about the prosecution case. “We have serious doubts as to whether a 65-years-old lady could have picked up a large stone weighing about 8 kg, carried it to his room and dropped on the face of the sleeping deceased. We also doubt whether this lady could have caused all the injuries to the genitals of the deceased,” said the bench giving her benefit of the doubt.While reversing the conviction of the elderly woman, HC also directed the trial court to initiate the action against all hostile witnesses in this case.Taking serious note of the issue, HC also issued directions to all principal district and sessions judges to circulate the order to all additional district and sessions judges and other judicial officers “to apprise them as regards action to be initiated against hostile witnesses in appropriate cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-action-against-hostile-witnesses-in-all-appropriate-cases-101612287885055.html

02-02-2021||Mumbai||No multi-speciality infectious hospital in Mumbai, focus on peripheral hospital: BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has shelved its decision to construct a 5,000-bed multi-speciality hospital for infectious diseases in Mumbai. Instead, the civic body has decided to turn its focus on developing infrastructure at peripheral hospitals.At present, civic-run Kasturba Hospital has 125 beds dedicated for treatment of infectious diseases. Following the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, BMC in July last year had taken a decision to develop a hospital on a 22-acre plot in either Mulund (East) or Dahisar, so as to make it accessible for patients from Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).Six months on, the civic body has decided to concentrate on developing 16 peripheral hospitals, and add 100 dedicated infectious beds at Kasturba Hospital, for which financial allocation will be set aside in the budget.“Huge amount of funds are needed to establish such a (multi-speciality) hospital. At present, due to the pandemic, we are already facing a fund crunch. Therefore, we have decided to develop and better existing infrastructure at peripheral hospitals,” said a senior officer from BMC.Additional municipal commissioner, P Velrasu said, “There hasn’t been any development in acquiring land for the hospital.”The decision to develop a multi-speciality hospital was taken as a preparatory measure if the city faces another outbreak of a Covid-19 like pandemic in the future.During the initial months following the outbreak of the pandemic in March, Mumbai had faced severe shortages of beds for treatment of infected patients.Health activists have suggested the civic body allocate more money in the health sector. “Mumbai has a population of around 2 crore. The civic body should take a lesson from this pandemic and be ready to handle similar health emergencies in the future. Peripheral hospitals constitute the most essential point of health service. These hospitals should have their own units for infectious diseases,” said Dr Abhijit More, a health activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-multi-speciality-infectious-hospital-in-mumbai-focus-on-peripheral-hospital-bmc-101612287764995.html

Last week, they had approached Noida Authority with their grievance.While the resolution professional denied any wrongdoing, the authority said they would look into the matter.Granite Gate Properties Limited had launched the project in 2010 along with another project, Lotus Boulevard in the sector 100. While Panache was planned to have 30 residential towers with around 3,000 total flats, Boulevard was supposed to have 29 towers with around 3,100 total flats. The builders had promised delivery by 2014 but till date on nine towers in Panache and 26 towers in Boulevard were delivered.In 2019, the homebuyers filed a case with the national company law tribunal after the company failed to deliver. The tribunal appointed a resolution professional to take control of the housing project, and proceeded with corporate insolvency proceedings as per the Indian bankruptcy code-2016 (IBC).“As per the IBC, no new developer could take over the projects. The resolution professional is misusing the funds collected from us and not delivering the units. He using funds to finish units of buyers who are yet to pay total dues. Those who paid 95% of the cost are still waiting for work to start,” said Sanjay Kumar who had booked a 3BHK flat in the project in 2013 for ₹95 lakh. “There has no justice from the NCLT. Therefore, we requested the Noida Authority to step in.”“If the Noida Authority fails to get us a solution, then we will approach the Allahabad high court,” said Satish Verma, another buyer.The resolution professional Chandra Prakash denied any wrongdoing and said that they require homebuyers’ funds and consent to complete the projects.“We working to complete seven towers in Panache where 70% homebuyers had given their consent. We are using the funds democratically and doing our job. At least 100 units (of Panache) will be delivered by February-end and the remaining units in seven towers will be delivered as per schedule and availability of funds. In Boulevard only a few flats are to be finished,” said Prakash.Noida authority officer on special duty Rajesh Kumar said, “We will not let the registry to be executed in these two projects until the matter is settled by the NCLT. The authority will look into the matter as per the rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nclt-appointee-misusing-funds-allege-lotus-panache-buyers-101612287404246.html
02-02-2021||Mumbai||Irregularities at Khar home: Interim relief to Kangana Ranaut against coercive action extended||In a relief for actor Kangana Ranaut, the Bombay high court (HC) has extended the interim protection against coercive steps by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) pertaining to the alleged irregularities at her residence in Khar till February 5. The actor had approached HC after the Dindoshi civil court dismissed her plea against a 2018 BMC notice, which asked her to apply for regularising the irregularities or face demolition proceedings. On Tuesday, the actor’s counsel sought time to seek instructions from the actor as to whether she wanted to apply for regularisation of the structure individually.A bench of justice Prithviraj Chavan, while hearing the interim application filed by Ranaut, in the appeal filed by her against the Dindoshi court order, was informed by senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf that the act of the BMC was a vendetta against the actor, and even if she wanted to apply for regularisation she would need the consent of all other members of the building.Ranaut had been issued a notice by the BMC in 2018, asking her to demolish the illegal alterations she had made in the three flats she owned in the building on the junction of 16th and 18th road at Khar (West). The actor had allegedly altered the flats to make them into one unit which was not as per the sanctioned plans with the civic corporation.Ranaut had moved the Dindoshi court in January 2019, challenging the notice wherein the court had asked both the actor and the BMC to maintain a status quo. In December 2020, the civil court had dismissed the plea but allowed the actor six weeks to approach the HC and also granted her interim protection against coercive action till she applied in the HC.When the plea came up for hearing on Tuesday, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy for BMC submitted that Ranaut had approached the court three years after being issued the demolition notice and only if the court condoned the delay her application could be heard. He further opposed the time being sought by Ranaut to apply for regularisation in the current application stating that the plea was only seeking a restraint on the BMC from taking coercive action pursuant to the notice.After hearing the submissions the bench said, “In the interest of justice, liberty granted to Saraf to seek instructions from Ranaut as to whether a single applicant will apply for regularisation of the structure” and continued the operation of the civil court order till February 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/irregularities-at-khar-home-interim-relief-to-kangana-ranaut-against-coercive-action-extended-101612287164845.html

For the time being proceedings against rent defaulters were kept on hold, but in case of any further delay, the cancellation proceedings will be initiated,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB.The flats in question were allotted under the slum rehabilitation scheme in different parts of the city. Allottees of the one-room EWS flats are charged ₹800 to ₹1,000 per month as ground rent, which is increased by 20% after five years of allotment.Under the Chandigarh Small Flat (Amendment) Scheme 2020, if allottees do not pay the rent, they are liable to pay a penalty of 12% per annum.

But they did nothing. Many tea estates are lying closed. Before the Lok Sabha polls, they promised to reopen a few of them. Did they do anything? We have reopened nine tea gardens. We would try to reopen more,” Banerjee said.This comes a day after the Centre, in its Union budget, announced a package of ₹1,000 crore for the welfare of tea garden workers in West Bengal and Assam.“Every time an election approaches, Delhi (the Union government) will promise to reopen closed tea gardens. Once the elections are over, they would flee. They would forget the tea gardens. Sometimes they talk and don’t do any work,” she said.Also read: Personal jibes get sharper at BJP, TMC rallies; ex-ministers shown black flagThe BJP had made an impressive gain in north Bengal, winning seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019. The party now poses a major challenge to the ruling party. In terms of the 56 assembly segments in the eight Lok Sabha seats in north Bengal, the BJP was ahead of the TMC in 35."If the Mamata Banerjee administration was sincere about the tea garden workers she should have met their demand of giving land rights. The workers never demanded houses because they would have got houses anyway under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna. The old discriminatory Plantation Labour Act has been scrapped after we pushed it. New labour laws have been passed by the Centre and this would ensure minimum wages for the workers which was their primary demand," said Raju Bista, BJP MP from Darjeeling and a BJP spokesperson.The TMC supremo was seen dancing with tribals at a mass wedding ceremony in Alipurduar district of the state. The mass wedding ceremony was organised by the state police. At least 450 tribal couples got married.Banerjee also went on a public relations overdrive, paying a surprise visit at a local wedding.

This shows that money from coal smuggling was deposited in a bank account in Bangkok. The money went to a person named Madam Narula. Who is Madam Narula? It is the same person who was once caught at the Kolkata airport with a lot of gold. The truth will be out when Lala, the man who ran the coal smuggling operation, is nabbed.”Incidentally, the family of Abhishek Banerjee’s wife live in Thailand.Adhikari neither named the chief minister nor Abhishek Banerjee and referred to the latter as “tolabaaj bhaipo” (extortionist nephew). Former minister Rajib Banerjee also addressed the rally. TMC workers waved black flags at the two leaders when they were on their way to the rally. BJP flags were removed in many areas and discarded shoes hung on posters that had photographs of the two former ministers.Also read: No intention to bring central anti-conversion law - MHA tells ParliamentAt the rally, Adhikari also accused the TMC of indulging in rampant corruption during the distribution of relief for victims of cyclone Amphan in 2020 and stealing ration meant for the poor during the Covid-19 pandemic.“Now they are stealing vaccines sent for health workers,” said Adhikari who claimed that the BJP will do its best in South 24 Parganas by winning all 31 assembly seats in the district.“A large number of Muslims live in Bhangar, Sonarpur and other areas. Do you think all Muslims will vote for the TMC? Didn’t our Muslim brothers receive free ration and cooking gas sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi? You, (the chief minister) on the other hand, branded the trains carrying migrant workers as ‘corona express.’ People have not forgotten that,” Adhikari said.Reacting to Adhikari’s allegation at Abhishek Banerjee, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, “If he has any proof he should give it to the Central Bureau of Investigation instead of making speeches. Abhishek will give his reply. And, Adhikari should talk about his own involvement in the Saradha chit fund scam in which he is an accused.”Sovan Chatterjee, who is now the BJP’s election observer for the Kolkata zone, came under sharp attack from his estranged wife Ratna Chatterjee for leading a roadshow with Baisakhi Banerjee, his friend and BJP leader, at Behala in the southern fringe of Kolkata where he earlier lived with his family. This was the first time the former mayor entered Behala after his family dispute prompted him to shift to Golpark in the heart of south Kolkata.“The more rallies the two lead, the better it is for the TMC. Bengal’s culture has no place for a man who leaves his wife and child and lives with another woman,” said Ratna Chatterjee who attended a TMC roadshow that education minister Partha Chatterjee led in another part of Behala.BJP leaders did not want to comment on her statement. However, Chatterjee reacted to his estranged wife's statement and told the media during the roadshow that his marriage ran into rough weather."My marriage ran into rough weather. I was betrayed and wounded. Baisakhi Banerjee saved me from the crisis," he said.At the Baruipur rally, Rajib Banerjee sharpened his attack on the chief minister without naming her and focused on unemployment in Bengal. “If the BJP comes to power, our effort will be to provide permanent jobs. It is impossible without industries. Union home minister Amit Shah has promised me that a special package will be offered to Bengal. This government started projects without planning. Being a topper in providing 100 day’s work (under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or MGNREGA) is a proof of the state’s failure in generating real jobs,” said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/personal-jibes-get-sharper-at-bjp-tmc-rallies-ex-ministers-shown-black-flag-101612280325359.html
02-02-2021||City||Woman elected head of tribal clan in Nagaland is creating ripples||In a landmark move, the district unit of a Naga tribal clan elected a female member as its president on January 29.The traditional Naga society is largely patriarchal and a traditional civil society in Nagaland headed by a woman is highly exceptional. Hence, the ‘Metha Thinuo Krotho, Dimapur’, a traditional body of the Metha clan in the commercial district of the state, electing its first female president is sending out a strong message on the cultural thought process in a male-dominated society.The newly elected head of the clan unit, Khrienuo Metha, in her own right, is no stranger to leadership - she is a retired bureaucrat who headed various departments in Nagaland in the past. But the fact that a tribal clan decided to make a woman their leader is the real deal in a society that still believes such positions belong to men.“It’s really a big deal and it sends out such a strong message. We cannot undermine the fact that this decision directly challenges traditional attitudes. But if we are to progress, it is stories like these that need to challenge and change our thought process and archival attitudes,” said fellow clansman Abu Metha, who is also the advisor to Nagaland chief minister.Also read: No intention to bring central anti-conversion law - MHA tells ParliamentHe feels that people must accept the fact that change is universal. “While preserving the positive aspects of our rich culture and heritage is crucial, we must also take progressive steps to do away with the negative aspects of the tradition that are perhaps irrelevant to present realities. We must embrace positive change,” he added.Dr Rosemary Dzüvichü, advisor of Naga Mothers Association and head of women studies in Nagaland University, also voiced similar sentiments.“The Metha clan indeed is progressive. Khrienuo has proved herself as a successful bureaucrat and a leader. We wish her all the best. She will be the best among equals,” she stated.When contacted, Khrienuo said she was grateful to her clansmen who took such a magnanimous and broadminded decision to hand over the position to a woman. She candidly admitted that she is still in the process of grasping the importance of her new position.Besides the traditional aspect, this development also reminds one of the stark realities - Nagaland is yet to elect a woman representative in its 56-years-old Legislative Assembly. The only time the state saw an elected woman representative was in 1977 when Rano M Shaiza was elected to become a Member of Parliament to the Lok Sabha.The state had also witnessed a dark phase in 2017 when a strong opposition against reservation of 33 per cent seats in urban local bodies took a violent turn, leaving the state capital Kohima burning for days. Two people were killed then while several were injured, shops and office buildings were gutted by the protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-elected-head-of-tribal-clan-is-creating-ripples-in-nagaland-101612279917780.html

Manishi Chandra, deputy commissioner of police (special cell), said Ashok Pradhan, 36, was looking for an opportunity to kill his rivals, jailed gangsters Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali. “He wanted to kill Bawana and Bali during their court appearances, but his plan was delayed due to the Covid-19 protocols prohibiting the physical appearances of accused men in court,” said Chandra. The DCP said Pradhan was arrested along with his associate, Arun Baba. The duo was arrested from near Millennium Park on the Outer Ring Road on Sunday night after the police received a tip-off. “The car they were driving was robbed from someone and they were carrying two guns,” the officer said. The police said Pradhan, who belongs to Jhajjar in Haryana, was an associate of another gangster Neetu Dabodia, but took over the gang after Dabodia was killed in a police encounter in October 2013. “In the last 10 years, Pradhan and his men have been involved in gang wars in which at least 12 people have been killed,” the DCP said. Pradhan began as an associate of Dabodia in 2001 and quickly rose in the ranks of the gang by killing a village chief and a doctor in Bahadurgarh, the DCP said. Police said that he was convicted in a murder case and jailed for life. But once he received parole in 2014, he didn’t return to jail and ran his own gang that was notorious as the ‘Pradhan gang’, the officer said. Pradhan carried a reward of ₹5 lakh on his arrest announced by the the Haryana Police and R25,000 by the Delhi Police. “His was the mastermind behind the murders of a man last October and December, both in Bawana,” the officer said. His associate, Baba, worked as a shooter for him, the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fugitive-gangster-arrested-from-near-park-on-outer-ring-road-101612279903560.html

02-02-2021||Dehradun||Amid Covid-19, Uttarakhand mulling to notify Mahakumbh dates from April 10-27||To comply with the standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the Centre for the upcoming Haridwar Mahakumbh, the state government is mulling to notify the Mahakumbh period from April 10-27.The proposal was discussed during the state cabinet meeting led by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Tuesday in Dehradun. If approved, the Mahakumbh Mela would be officially organised for only 18 days against the present proposed period of about two months from February 27-April 30 comprising six Shahi Snaans or auspicious baths during the mega-event. The government is expecting about eight lakh people on normal days while ten lakh on the auspicious baths.The move has come after the Centre's SOP on the Mahakumbh few weeks ago in which it urged the state to shorten its period citing the ongoing pandemic.A senior government official privy to the matter, on condition of anonymity, said, "The government is serious on the proposal as it has to adhere to the Centre's SOP which includes measures like carrying mandatory negative Covid-19 RT-PCR test report with a validity of 72 hours along with a medical certificate from a competent health authority for all the devotees coming to attend the event."Also read: Delhi’s 5th sero survey - Over 56% people have antibodies against Covid-19"However, if implemented, officially the Mahakumbh would be from April 10-27, but nobody would be stopped from coming to the Mahakumbh from February 27 from which it would start based on the religious calendar, but in adherence to all the Covid-19 precautions," said the officer.He also informed that there were several important measures discussed under the proposal to ensure the health safety of the devotees in the Mahakumbh."Under that, the state chief secretary (CS) had written to the Railway Board in Delhi a few days ago, requesting it not to run any special trains for Haridwar on the two Shahi Snaans on April 13 and 14 and also one day before them. However, the request was made to run enough outbound trains on those dates for easy exit of devotees. This is to curb a large number of people coming to the event on those two occasions," he said."Apart from this, the CS had also written to the other states to not run special buses to carry devotees from their states to Haridwar during Mahakumbh while ensuring that they carry the mandatory negative Covid-19 RT-PCR test report and medical certificate for attending Mahakumbh," he said.State urban development minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik, however, didn't reveal many details about the discussion on the SOP for the Mahakumbh but said, "The cabinet discussed many significant proposed measures to ensure that it's organised in compliance to the Centre's SOP to ensure health safety of all amid pandemic.""The state government would finalise the SOP for Haridwar Mahakumbh after the CM speaks to the Akhada Parishad on the measures being discussed. As the authorised person from the government for it, the SOP will be then issued by him after the talks," said Kaushik.The Centre had issued the SOP few weeks ago after the state government approached it for the same on the order of Uttarakhand High Court while hearing a PIL on conducting Mahakumbh amid Covid-19 pandemic.Under the SOP, the Centre had asked the state government to make it mandatory for all the devotees to carry an RT-PCR negative test report of Covid-19 with a 72 hours validity. It also asked all the devotees to get a medical report from a competent medical authority near their house on the lines of Amaranth Yatra before coming to attend the mega-event in Haridwar. It has asked the state government to ensure that the aforementioned reports are checked by the Mela authorities and not allow anyone to attend the event without them.Similarly, it had also asked the state government to discourage devotees aged above 65 years, pregnant women and children less than 10 years from attending the event. To ensure safety of the health and frontline workers to be deployed in the Mahakumbh, it asked the state to deploy only the vaccinated ones.Budget session to be held from March 1-10 in GairsainEarlier while addressing the media persons on the other decisions taken in the cabinet meeting, Kaushik informed that the upcoming budget session of state assembly would be held from March 1-10 in the state summer capital of Gairsain in Chamoli district."The budget would be tabled in the House on March 4 followed by a debate on it on March 5. There would be no House proceedings on March 6 and 7 after which it would resume from March 8," said Kaushik.Among the other decisions taken he informed that "the cabinet while approving the structure for Jal Jivan Mission to provide piped water connection to households, 97 positions have been approved by the government."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/amid-covid-19-uttarakhand-mulling-to-notify-mahakumbh-dates-from-april-1027-101612272760034.html

02-02-2021||Delhi||A look at serological surveys conducted in Delhi||The fifth serological survey has found as many as 56.13 per cent of the 28,000 people sampled in Delhi developed antibodies against coronavirus and indicated that the national capital, which has a population of 20 million, is fast moving towards herd immunity. "In the fifth sero survey done in the national Capital, antibodies have been detected in 56.13% of the population. This was the largest survey conducted by the Delhi government so far. Delhi has largely won over Covid-19, but we should continue to practise Covid-19 appropriate behaviour," Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said after the report was published.Delhi’s first serological survey was done in the city in June-July and it had shown that 23.4% of people surveyed had developed antibodies against the virus. Similar surveys in August showed that 29.1% of people had antibodies and 25.1% in September.What did the fifth serological survey find?The survey was conducted between January 15 and January 23 and at least 100 samples were collected from each of the 272 municipal wards of Delhi. CLIA technology was used for the survey and all the samples were tested at the ILBS hospital to ensure uniformity. The highest seroprevalence was recorded in the southeast district with 62.18% of the sampled people having antibodies against the virus. Data showed that except the north district, all the other 10 districts in Delhi had a seroprevalence of more than 50%. Of these 10, six had a seroprevalence of more than 55%.What did the fourth serological survey say?The fourth survey showed that around one in four of the 15,000 people had acquired antibodies against coronavirus. The report also showed that a large proportion (43.5%) of people who had previously been diagnosed with Covid-19 did not have antibodies. Authors of the report, however, said that this was because antibodies take time to develop after contracting the infection.Delhi on Monday recorded 3 deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the national capital's lowest fatality count in 10 months. The positivity rate in the city stood at 0.28 per cent. Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in Delhi stood at 121 on Monday, according to health bulletin released by the authorities. With this, the national capital's tally reached 6,35,217, the health department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-look-at-serological-surveys-conducted-in-delhi-101612270983224.html

02-02-2021||Chandigarh||Will bring Bills in Punjab assembly to negate farm laws again: CM||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said his government will bring the amendment Bills to negate the Centre’s three farm laws again in the Vidhan Sabha since the governor failed to send the earlier Bills to President Ram Nath Kovind. “We will bring the Bills again as the Constitution provides that if Bills are passed twice by the Vidhan Sabha they have to be sent by the governor to the President,” he said at an all-party meeting here, adding that the governor should not have sat over the Bills. He said the state was empowered to amend the laws under Article 254 (ii) of the Constitution. Pointing out that the President had refused to meet Punjab leaders following the passage of the Bills in the Vidhan Sabha on the ground that he had not received the Bills, Amarinder said that he will seek time again from the President. He said he was in touch with Union home minister Amit Shah on the issue of the farm laws and the farmer protests, as suggested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Says threat from Pakistan can’t be undermined Underlining the need for early resolution of the crisis, the chief minister said the threat from Pakistan could not be undermined. “We have to work to resolve this issue before things go out of hand,” he said. Recalling how, soon after the prolonged two-month negotiations on an earlier Punjab crisis, relating to a list of 42 demands, Operation Bluestar happened, the chief minister warned, “If anger builds here, it will be exploited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-bring-bills-in-punjab-assembly-to-negate-farm-laws-again-cm-101612265915347.html

02-02-2021||Chandigarh||‘Join them in their camps’: AAP’s Bhagwant Mann lashes out at Punjab CM over farm laws protests||The Aam Aadmi Party’s Bhagwant Mann has alleged that Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s response to the plight of the protesting farmers at Delhi borders has been tepid and demanded that he should act as a negotiator between the Centre and the farmers’ unions representatives over the issue.Mann, the AAP's Lok Sabha leader, said that the chief minister is obligated to join the farmers at Delhi’s borders and should set up a helpdesk for them. He also attacked the Delhi Police over the construction of heavy barriers at Tikri border, one of the protest sites on the outskirts of Delhi, and said the preparations were akin to how one would prepare while facing a rival army.“Police have put nail barricades as if it was some rival army that they have to stop. Captain Amarinder Singh, you are the chief minister, you should be at Delhi borders with the farmers. Why don't you arrange a helpdesk for them and join them at the camps?” Mann was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Mann also hinted that the Punjab chief minister has been silent over the newly passed farm laws and the subsequent protests. He said, “When your family is in trouble, you write to the Home Minister. Why don't you meet him now? When will you fulfil your promise of meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi? Why don't you act as a negotiator? All of us should rise above politics and support the farmers.”Singh had met Union home minister Amit Shah in December last year to apprise him regarding the issues which could arise if the agitation staged by farmers’ unions' representatives carried on for a longer period of time. He had also intimated Shah that there was a slight possibility of anti-national elements hijacking the farmers’ protests against the three farm laws.Soon after the meeting concluded, AAP leader Raghav Chadha had alleged that the chief minister of Punjab had abandoned the farmers’ of the state and accused Singh of being an ‘agent of the BJP.’ Chadha said that the chief minister was in cahoots with the BJP against the agitation against the farm laws.“Captain Amarinder Singh is working as an agent of the BJP and trying to finish this agitation while trying to save his family from ED. In 2019, Captain Amrinder Singh gave his consent on these three laws and he is asking time from the President to withdraw these black laws but did not ask his friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Chadha was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“Captain has not left his fort to stand with the farmers, earlier he met with Amit Shah but he never met with Congress president or farmers,” he further added.Mann, Chadha and Saurabh Chaudhary have earlier alleged that Singh is trying to save his family from the Enforcement Directorate after the Punjab chief minister’s son, Raninder Singh, was summoned by the central agency for alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) earlier in November. A case was filed against Raninder Singh after the income tax department received information that he was allegedly holding an offshore account in the Alpine nations, news agency ANI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/join-them-in-their-camps-aap-s-bhagwant-mann-lashes-out-at-punjab-cm-101612264545407.html

02-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s 5th sero survey: Over 56% people have antibodies against Covid-19||As many as 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled during Delhi’s fifth serological survey were found to have developed antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus, state health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday. Addressing a press briefing, Jain said of the 11 districts in Delhi, the lowest sero prevalence was found in the north district where an average of 40.09% of the people sampled were found to have been exposed to Covid-19 so far. The highest sero prevalence was recorded in the southeast district with 62.18% of the sampled people having antibodies against the virus. Delhi’s southeast district was also one of the first districts which turned into a Covid-19 hot spot as early as March last year with several people who visited the Nizamuddin Markaz testing positive for the virus. Data shared by the Delhi government showed that except the north district, all the other 10 districts in Delhi had a sero prevalence of more than 50%. Of these 10, six had a sero prevalence of more than 55%. Also Read | Hospitals relieved as Delhi govt reduces number of reserved Covid-19 ICU beds“In the fifth sero survey done in the national Capital, antibodies have been detected in 56.13% of the population. This was the largest survey conducted by the Delhi government so far. Delhi has largely won over Covid-19, but we should continue to practise Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” Jain said. The minister said the full report of the latest serological survey will be released in a day or two after further examination of the findings. The survey was conducted between January 15 and January 23 and at least 100 samples were collected from each of the 272 municipal wards of Delhi. “Like the results in the previous surveys, this time too the number of females having antibodies was more than that of males. There means that all these people had Covid at some point and now have fully recovered. In total, the sero prevalence in Delhi is ranging from 49%-62% with an average of 56.13%,” Jain said. He stated that over the past 10-12 days, Delhi has been reporting less than 200 Covid-19 cases every day and the positivity rate, which at one point had touched 15%, is now stable at lower than 1% for the past one month. “Still, I want to urge everyone to continue wearing masks for a few more months. In the past two months, the compliance has improved substantially, the result of which is in front of everyone - Covid cases have drastically come down. If people continue to wear masks this way, we will be able to totally control the virus in the next few months,” the minister said. Dr Nutan Mundeja, director general of health services (Delhi state health mission) said this time, the sero survey was not just bigger in scale, but also a better technology was used. “We used CLIA technology this time. These kits have higher sensitivity as a result of which results come out more accurate. All the samples were tested at the ILBS hospital to ensure uniformity. The survey was conducted in association with Maulana Azad Medical College. The samples were collected from people of all socio-economic strata and from across all kinds of population and age groups,” said Mundeja. On herd immunity, minister Jain said there is no clear yardstick as of now to define the term. “Some say herd immunity is achieved at 50%, others say it should be 60%. I don’t think we should get into the debate of herd immunity now. This is a new form of virus or disease, we should not get lax with our precautionary measures because in October, we had thought the virus was brought under control, but then we got the third wave,” said Jain.Also Read | Is wearing one mask enough?Herd immunity is when enough people have immunity – estimated to be 60-80% of the population in case of Sars-CoV-2 – to a disease that it leaves very few vulnerable people for it to spread to, slowing an outbreak.Delhi’s first serological survey was done in the city in June-July and it had shown that 23.4% of people surveyed had developed antibodies against the virus. Similar surveys in August showed that 29.1% of people had antibodies, 25.1% in September, and 25.5% in October. A positive result implies that the person has developed antibodies against the virus. This means that the person was infected at some point and developed immunity against it.Jain said that earlier, the Delhi government was conducting sero survey every month. “But, now we are doing it after 1.5-2 months. The next survey will also be done after about 2 months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-5th-sero-survey-over-56-people-have-antibodies-against-covid19-101612264534349.html

02-02-2021||Delhi||Hospitals relieved as Delhi govt reduces number of reserved Covid-19 ICU beds||A healthcare providers' association told the Delhi high Court on Tuesday that various private hospitals, which were earlier asked to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for COVID-19 patients, were satisfied with the Delhi government's recent decision to reduce the number to 25 per cent.Justice Navin Chawla was informed by the counsel for the Association of Healthcare Providers that he has instructions to withdraw the petition seeking quashing of the government's September 12, 2020 order to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in 33 private hospitals which are its members.The high court allowed the prayer for withdrawing the petition and disposed of the plea.Advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, representing the petitioner association, said the hospitals were satisfied with the government's January 15 order by which the reservation of COVID-19 ICU beds in private hospitals here was reduced from 40 per cent to 25 per cent which have over 100 beds.The reservation percentage has been gradually reduced by the government after reviewing the pandemic situation. With the COVID-19 infection number reaching its peak of over 8,000 in a day in November, 2020 in Delhi, the numbers are now declining and 121 fresh cases were recorded on February 1, that is, Monday.The high court said, “In view of the January 15 order of Respondent no. 1 (Delhi government), the petitioner's counsel has instructions to withdraw the petition. The petition is disposed of as withdrawn.”The court added that this would not preclude the association to make further representation to the government in view of the change in circumstances.As per the government's order, a review meeting was held by the competent authority on January 15, in which the data with respect to pattern of COVID-19 beds and COVID-19 ICU beds occupancy on that date in 115 private hospitals providing coronavirus treatment was analysed.Keeping in view the low occupancy of COVID-19 beds/ ICU beds in the private hospitals, it was decided in the review meeting to further lower reservation of the total bed capacity from 30 per cent to 15 per cent, and of ICU beds from 40 per cent to 25 per cent of the total bed capacity in 45 hospitals having more than 100 beds and providing coronavirus related treatment, the government order said.It was also decided in the meeting that other 70 hospitals which have up to 100 beds shall have the option of reserving COVID-19 beds/ ICU beds there.Earlier, the Delhi government counsel had said not a single non-COVID-19 patient has come to the court that he was denied treatment in the hospital due to 80 per cent of ICU beds reserved for COVID-19 patients.He had stated that not even a single private hospital has approached the high court claiming that they suffered financial loss due to this reservation order.The petitioner organisation's counsel had contended that ICU beds were kept vacant and even no payment was made by the government to the hospitals which were facing financial losses.He had further argued that there was no validity or permissibility to continue with the September 12, 2020 order.The Delhi government had told the high court that it has decided to de-escalate to 60 per cent the number of ICU beds reserved for COVID-19 patients in 33 private hospitals here as was recommended by a De-escalation Committee.The September 12, 2020 order of the Delhi government was earlier stayed by the high court on September 22 last year. However, a division of the high court on November 12, 2020 vacated the stay order taking into account the change in circumstances since the time the stay order was passed.The petitioner association had told the high court that the 33 private hospitals are its members and the Delhi government's order shall be quashed as it was passed in an irrational manner and is ex-facie perverse.The government, however, had contended that the situation of COVID-19 infection in Delhi has become critical recently and the -19 cases are spiralling and it was critical that 80 per cent of ICU/ HDU beds be reserved for COVID-19 patients in the 33 private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospitals-relieved-as-delhi-govt-reduces-number-of-reserved-covid-19-icu-beds-101612255979097.html

SAD president and former Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal had a narrow escape when his SUV got caught in the clash at the Jalalabad tehsil office. “Though Sukhbir Singh Badal escaped unhurt, his vehicle was damaged in the stone-pelting,” his media adviser, Jangveer Singh, said. Mob led by Congress MLA: SAD media adviser The SAD chief was at his political bastion to oversee the filing of nominations by his party leaders. “It was a blatant attack on Sukhbir, a Z+ protectee, who represents Ferozepur in the Lok Sabha. His vehicle was targeted by the mob led by Jalalabad Congress MLA Raminder Singh Awala,” he said. He said at least three Akali workers were hit by bullets and several others injured in the stone-pelting. Sukhbir could not be contacted as his personal team said the leader was busy briefing the Lok Sabha Speaker. Sukhbir instigated supporters: Awala When contacted, Awala charged Sukhbir with creating a ruckus and inciting his supporters to attack the Congress workers. He said at least one Congress activist suffered bullet injuries and more than six got head injuries in the stone-pelting. “Nominations by SAD and others for the nearby Arniwala local body elections went on peacefully on Monday. But today, Sukhbir brought workers from other places as a show of strength at Jalalabad. He had lost the last byelection to me from Jalalabad.

02-02-2021||Delhi||May have identified cop who shot video of assault during riots: Police to Delhi HC||The Delhi Police on Monday told the Delhi high court that they may have identified the police officer who shot a viral video in which police officers are seen assaulting a few men and forcing them to sing the national anthem during the northeast Delhi riots in the national capital in February last year.The police, in response to a plea by the man’s mother seeking an SIT investigation into the death of her son Faizan due to the alleged assault, have said that they have not been able to identify the police officers in the various videos and CCTV camera footage because they were wearing helmets and did not have nameplates.The police said that in one of the videos, a person in uniform is seen holding a tear gas gun and recording a video of the five men being beaten by policemen on his mobile phone.However, they contended that while the person who was recording the incident was not wearing a helmet, his face was not clear as the footage was distantly shot.“Policemen who were carrying tear gas guns are being questioned and one has been pinpointed on probable basis. His mobile phone has been seized and referred to the Forensic Science Laboratory, to get an opinion as to whether the said video was shot from this mobile . The opinion is still awaited. Lie Detector Test, Face Recognition and Voice Sampling of this probable policeman is being conducted through FSL expert,” the police said.In an affidavit filed through the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Mahajan, the Delhi Police informed the court that they have examined 170 police officers and their mobile phones.“Their mobile phone numbers have also been taken on record for technical analysis,” the police said.The police also said that efforts were made to obtain CCTV camera footage from the Public Works Department (PWD) but no CCTV camera was found installed near the scene of crime.“Furthermore, the CCTV cameras installed by individuals in the area of Kardampuri were either found broken much prior to the incident or their directions were changed. However, CCTV camera footage/video clips available on different social media and other sources as collected by the Cyber Cell of Crime Branch have been taken on record,” the probe agency said.Justice Anu Malhotra asked the police to file an affidavit with information about the lack of CCTV camera functioning along with documents. The matter wll be now heard on March 15.In her plea, filed through advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, Faizan’s mother, Kismatun, told the court that he died on February 26 after he was allegedly brutally assaulted by police officers and detained from February 24 to February 25.The petition sought the constitution of a court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct a fair and impartial investigation into the alleged custodial death of Faizan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/may-have-identified-cop-who-shot-video-of-assault-during-riots-police-to-delhi-hc-101612245272807.html

It has planned to inoculate frontline workers along with healthcare workers. It has completed the mock drill on Monday for the frontline workers. It has also directed the district administrations to increase the vaccination centres. Frontline workers include the police, sanitation workers and revenue department officials.The state health department officials, however, said that they are ready to start phase 2 of the immunisation programme, but it all depends upon the Centre as they have to activate the system for phase 2 on Co-WIN app.Around 580,000 frontline workers have registered themselves on the Co-WIN app for the vaccination till date.The Co-WIN app assists programme managers in the state during vaccination sessions.

02-02-2021||Bangalore||Interim report on Akshaya Patra submitted, more details sought from EY, KPMG||A two-member committee headed by former Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) of India KV Chowdary has submitted its interim report on allegations made by former trustees of the Akshaya Patra Foundation. However, the committee has sought a report from statutory auditors—EY and KPMG—for additional details, according to the foundation. “The interim report has been submitted by the committee but the committee has sought (a) report from the statutory auditors EY and KPMG. This report is expected in the month of march,” according to a spokesperson of the foundation. Also Read: Union budget a catalyst that can revive economy: Karnataka CM YediyurappaA two-member committee was formed on November 20 last year to look into alleged irregularities in the foundation’s workings, including the non-maintenance of records of related parties using the kitchens of the foundation for uses other than the government-sponsored midday meal programme. A letter by Suresh Senapaty, former Wipro chief financial officer and a former member of the audit committee at Akshaya Patra Foundation, last year alleged, among other issues, that costs per meal are far higher than any other organisation for a similar offering. “Any amount of questioning/review didn’t yield any result because the individual kitchens are run by missionary unit presidents who never demonstrated their accountability to the Akshaya Patra organisation,” according to the letter. Akshaya Patra Foundation, which gets grants from multiple state governments and the union government to provide midday meals for school children, serves over 1.8 million meals a day through 52 kitchens across 12 States and two Union Territories of India. The allegations have been largely directed at Madhu Pandit Dasa, the chairman of the Akshaya Patra Foundation and Chanchalapathi Dasa, the vice-chairman, and people associated with them that raised several questions against the very workings of the Akshaya Patra.“After due investigation, in almost all cases, it has been established that there has been wrongdoing on the part of Unit Presidents and / or other missionaries,” the letter states. People aware of the developments had stated that only a transparent audit would reveal the true extent of irregularities. The total income of Akshaya Patra Foundation in 2018-19 (most recent published report) was ₹52,118.33 lakh and the organisation incurred an expenditure of ₹51,627.02 lakh. The public trust has total assets worth ₹43,967.74 lakh, according to details in the 2018-19 annual report.The organisation is reported to have received over ₹247 crore from the government and over ₹352 crore from donations in the previous fiscal. “Some (statements) are suggestions made, implemented that the previous board did not know, some might be baseless and some have merits that the new audit committee has said,” said one person aware of the developments, requesting not to be named.

02-02-2021||Delhi||AAP govt criticises ‘meagre’ allocation for Delhi in Union budget 2021||The Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi on Monday criticised the Union Budget for poor fiscal devolution as it claimed that Delhi got a “megre” ₹957 crore, adding that the Central government’s policies will only benefit “big companies” and cause inflation.Comparing the Central grant to Delhi with other Union Territories that have an assembly, Delhi finance minister Manish Sisodia said that the Centre did not grant any funds to the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations in Delhi to help them tide over a financial crisis.“The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is constitutionally on similar a footing with the NCT of Delhi, has been provided a grant of ₹30,757 crore compared to ₹957 crore to Delhi. There are three UTs with a legislature in India, and of them Delhi gets the least grant in absolute terms and ridiculously low amount in terms of per capita grant from the government of India,” Sisodia said in a statement.Last year, Delhi was provided the same amount of ₹325 crore as it share in central taxes.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the budget will lead to price rise across the country. “This budget will benefit to a few big companies. It will lead to price rise and more problems to the people,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi hours after the budget was announced.Also read: Allocation for Delhi Police up by over ₹487 croreSisodia criticised the BJP-led central government for not helping Delhi’s municipal corporations. “The BJP government at the Centre did not even give a single penny to the BJP-ruled MCDs, while it has given ₹2 lakh crore to other municipal corporations across the country. During the last MCD election in Delhi, BJP had said they will bring the money directly from the Centre to the MCD,” Sisodia said.Slamming the Budget proposals and allocations, the deputy chief minister said the budget “completely bypasses” the education and health sectors, and “spells only doom” for the poor, middle class and farmers. At a time when there is farmer agitation happening all over the country, the agriculture budget has also been reduced, he said.“The Union Budget has shockingly reduced the spending on education by 6% compared to last fiscal. It seems no lesson has been learnt from the coronavirus pandemic. History tells us that be it a family or the country, only those who invest in the education of their children become ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant). Reducing expenditure on education by ₹6,000 crore shows that the call for Atmanirbhar Bharat was merely a joke,” Sisodia said.The Central government has decreased the allocation for the ministry of education by 6.13%. According to the finance minister’s speech, for 2021-22 a total amount of ₹93,224 crore will be allocated to the education ministry. In 2020-21, the budget estimate for the ministry was ₹99,312 crore, which was revised to ₹85,089 crore.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the Union budget will help in making India self-reliant in every field.“Special care has been taken in the budget about the health of the common man. Apart from this, soon people will start getting benefits of one nation, one ration card in the country. The expansion of rail and road corridors will boot the country’s infrastructure,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-govt-criticises-meagre-allocation-for-delhi-in-union-budget-2021-101612224241765.html

He is likely to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday.Haldar won the Diamond Harbour seat in 2011 and 2016 but was suspended from the TMC for a few months in 2015 on disciplinary ground.The constituency is located in South 24 Parganas district. Diamond Habour made headlines on December 10 when BJP national president JP Nadda’s convoy was stoned by some people during his visit to a party meeting.Haldar, who sent his resignation letter to the party by registered post, said, “I was never allowed to work freely. I was not even allowed to supervise projects that were carried out using the MLA’s area development fund. I decided to leave instead of taking the insult.”Also read: Twitter restores 250 accounts blocked in India for a controversial hashtagKunal Ghosh, the TMC spokesperson, said, “Why did he feel this urge to leave after serving as an MLA for 10 years? Like the other defectors, he, too, was blessed by wisdom just before the polls. We are neither surprised nor bothered. Haldar knew that the TMC would not field him again.”That Haldar might leave the TMC became apparent when he met Mamata Banerjee’s aide-turned-opponent Suvendu Adhikari and another turncoat and former Kolkata mayor Sovon Chatterjee in December. Haldar is known to be close to Chatterjee.Haldar is likely to join the BJP at Adhikari’s rally in South 24 Parganas on Tuesday.On Saturday, former forest minister Rajib Banerjee and a group of rebels were inducted into the BJP at Union home minister Amit Shah’s Delhi residence.Those who joined the BJP alongside Banerjee are Vaishali Dalmiya, the MLA from Bally in Howrah who was expelled by the TMC recently; Prabir Ghosal, the MLA from Uttarpara in Hooghly district; Rathin Chakraborty, former mayor of Howrah town; Partha Sarathi Chatterjee, former MLA from Ranaghat in Nadia district and actor Rudranil Ghosh, who recently started speaking against the TMC.Banerjee, who was Bengal’s forest minister, resigned from the Domjur assembly seat in Howrah on Friday. He won the seat twice.Vaishali Dalmiya, the daughter of former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, joined politics in 2016. So did Ghosal, a senior journalist.

02-02-2021||Other||Plan reopening of colleges and universities: Maharashtra minister to V-Cs||Following their demand to restart physical classes, state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant on Monday asked vice-chancellors (V-Cs) across Maharashtra to come up with a plan on reopening universities and colleges. He also asked them to discuss the issues over the difficulties in resuming physical classes with all the teaching and non-teaching staff.The directives were issued on Monday in a meeting with the V-Cs of all the universities. The meeting called after the V-Cs had last week called for the immediate resumption of colleges and universities after they met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is also the chancellor of all the universities in the state.“There are many issues that need to be addressed before resuming physical classed in colleges and universities. Hence, the higher and technical education minister asked the V-Cs to come up with plans, which will be discussed before a decision is taken by the state disaster management authority, headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” said a senior state official.The state feels that as all the students may be unable to attend physical classes, the institutes will have to conduct both offline and online lectures and teach the same subject twice in both the modes, which will add to the teaching staff’s work load, officials said.The V-Cs, however, were of the view that the government should allow both the modes for conducting lectures, but Samant directed them to discuss the matter with the staff first, said the official.The other concern is the lack of hostels to accommodate all the students if Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is to be followed. “Before Covid-19, four students used to be accommodated in one hostel room. However, now that is not possible as Covid-19 appropriate behaviour needs to be followed. We’ll have to allot one room per student to ensure social distancing is practised. But in that case, what will happen to students who are left out? We don’t have that many hostels to accommodate one student per room,” said another senior official.The state is also contemplating the problem of Covid-19 testing for students and staff. “We have over 200,000 teaching and non-teaching staff and over four million students, and testing all of them would be a major task, but allowing physical classes without conducting Covid-19 tests would be a big risk. All these issues were discussed in detail and the vice-chancellors were asked to come up with their solutions in the plans,” said the senior official.On Sunday, Samant had said it was time to reopen colleges. He also met the governor the same evening to apprise the latter on the state’s plan to reopen colleges and universities.On Friday, after meeting with the V-Cs, Koshyari said allowing physical classes for schools and not allowing them for colleges and universities seemed contradictory. Schools across the state, except in Mumbai, have been reopened for students from Class 5 to 12. “Universities have already started their academic year with online lectures. As the pandemic is under control, the universities should consider resuming physical classes at colleges. They can conduct classes in shifts,” the governor had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plan-reopening-of-colleges-and-universities-maharashtra-minister-to-vcs-101612209089929.html

We are keeping a tight watch on the daily cases and are also making preparations for the ongoing vaccination drive,” BMC’s additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said. Said to be the lifeline of residents living in Mumbai and the surrounding satellite towns, the services were suspended following the Covid-19 outbreak last March and then restarted for essential service staffers, women and lawyers in different time slots. Now, all citizens will be able to travel by local trains during three slots –from the start of the day’s services to 7 am; noon to 4 pm; and 9pm till the last service. The timings have been restricted to avoid crowding amid the Covid-19 pandemic. According to BMC officials, it will not deactivate any Covid-19 infrastructure such as quarantine centres, dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, jumbo Covid-19 centres, for the next two months to ensure that the situation does not goes out of control, in case of a spike. However, few of the centres have been temporarily deactivated after the cases declined in the city. But BMC said these centres can be activated within 24 hours, in case of an emergency situation. “We are constantly monitoring the situation and until March 31, none of the Covid-19 infrastructure will be deactivated permanently,” said Kakani. From Tuesday, BMC expects to kick off the second phase of the vaccination drive for around 200,000 frontline workers, including the police, civic officials, waste collectors, BEST staff etc. On Monday, the highest number (7,707) of healthcare workers (HCW) were vaccinated, against the target of 8,250 HCWs, at a turnout rate of 93%.

02-02-2021||City||Maharashtra: At least 12 children given sanitiser instead of polio drops||In an act of abject carelessness by the health department staff, at least 12 kids were administered hand sanitiser drops instead of oral polio vaccine drops at a Primary Health Centre at Kapsi-Kopari, an interior village, under Ghatanji tehsil of Maharashtra's Yavatmal district on Sunday afternoon.According to the available information, over 2,000 children, ageing 1-5 years, had gathered along with their parents for the polio vaccination programme. After being administered sanitiser drops, the children started vomiting and showed symptoms of uneasiness. All were immediately brought to the paediatric ward of the Government Medical College and Hospital at Yavatmal.“The condition of the children is stable and they continue to be under observation,” informed Dr Milind Kamble, dean, Yavatmal Medical College. On the possible repercussions of the oral intake of hand sanitizing liquids, he said that though it is not fatal, it contains around 70 per cent alcohol which may potentially create health complications, especially among children, as in the present instance. “All children are now out of danger,” Dr Kamble said.Parents of the children alleged that the health workers at the booth were reluctant to shift them to the government-run medical college and hospital and tried to cover up the issue. But they had to inform their seniors after three kids started vomiting.Also read: Twitter restores 250 accounts blocked in India for a controversial hashtagOne P Meshram, a villager from Kapsi-Kopari, whose two sons were among the 12 affected kids, said, initially, the health workers were casual about the incident. “They called us back from home after some time and administered the polio dose to my children. But they did not reveal the reason behind giving it again. We realized their mistake only when our children started vomiting,” Meshram said.When four of the twelve children started showing symptoms like vomiting and dizziness, the on-duty officials admitted them to the local public health centre. But, following some pressure by sarpanch Yuvraj Marape and other villagers, they started the process to shift the children aged between 1-5 years to the government-run medical college and hospital at Yavatmal. The kids were finally shifted after Sunday midnight.Yavatmal district collector M Devender Singh spoke to the parents of the affected children at the medical college on Monday and ordered an inquiry headed by the Yavatmal Zilla Parishad CEO Shrikrishna Panchal.Panchal said that he has received a preliminary inquiry report from the district health officer in which he has held that a community health officer, an ASHA worker and an Anganwadi sevika guilty of negligence.

So far, the state has inoculated 309,846 of the around 800,000 HCWs registered on the centralised CoWIN app. The state will start vaccinating frontline workers, including the police, sanitation workers and revenue department officials, from Tuesday, senior health department officials said. Mumbai too improved its turnout to 93.4% on Monday after 7,707 HCWs were inoculated. Of these, 5,746 vaccines were administered in the suburban district – which is 61% above its daily target – while the island city recorded 65% of its target after vaccinating 1,961 HCWs, data provided by the state health department revealed.

The security guard, Saurabh Tripathi, died on the spot, as the slab fell on his head, while seven others who were rescued from under the debris are undergoing treatment.Soon after the collapse, Bhiwandi police, Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) fire brigade team, ambulances, Thane civic body fire brigade, Thane Disaster Response Force (TDRF) and National Disaster Management personnel reached the spot. The rescue operations were called off around 5pm. Canine search was also conducted at the collapse site to ensure no one was trapped under the debris. One of the workers – 20-year-old Hrutik Patil – who was rescued around 4.30pm has suffered severe injuries on both his legs as he was trapped under the debris for six hours. He is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. “He was stuck under the debris in a way that there was no space to rescue him. The NDRF team took over the rescue operations and created a cavity in the area where he was stuck. After this, they managed to pull him out, but both his legs are severely injured,” said Santosh Kadam, chief, regional disaster management cell (RDMC), Thane. According to Ashish Kumar, deputy commandant, NDRF, the personnel were unable to cut the pillar that collapsed over Patil. “It would have led to further collapse of the structure. So we decided to make space below and he was rescued,” said Kumar. Patil’s mother Jaimala waited outside the godown all through the rescue operations till her son was found. Patil had left home around 7am on Monday. His brother Ajay, 24, who also works in the same godown, stayed at home. “I had asked Hrutik to wait and go with Ajay in the afternoon, but he wanted to add extra work hours, and thus left in the morning,” said Jaimala. For 20-year-old Kayum Khan, the cleaner of the container, this was a narrow escape. Khan was about to enter the godown to take his phone which he had kept for charging. As he walked towards the godown, it collapsed before his eyes, leaving him in a state of shock. “I can never forget the incident. I would have also been trapped if I had entered the godown to get the mobile phone. Our parked container actually helped many survive the collapse,” said Khan.Some workers claimed that construction was being carried out recently on top of the existing godown, exactly at the portion which had collapsed. According to them, the new construction led to the collapse. Nitesh Marathe, 30, who works at the dispatch section of the godown, said, “There is a construction happening exactly above the portion of the godown which collapsed.” “The godown was built in 2006 and the permission for its construction was acquired from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). We will ask the MMRDA to carry out an audit of all the structures nearby as this godown is not very old,” said Aadik Patil, tahsildar, Bhiwandi.An MMRDA official said,” The godown was built before the MMRDA was appointed as the planning authority of the village. We’ll check the details and accordingly act further.” Meanwhile, the Narpoli police are awaiting a report from MMRDA to take further action. “We will wait for the authority to send the report so that the exact cause of the collapse is known, following which legal action will be taken,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/33yearold-security-guard-killed-7-hurt-in-godown-collapse-near-mumbai-101612207890606.html
02-02-2021||Other||Nothing for us in budget, say Ludhiana’s industrialists||City-based industrialists gave a thumbs down to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget on Monday, stating that there was nothing in it for them and that they were highly disappointed as they were expecting some relief package in view of the Covid losses they suffered in 2020. Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) chairman KK Seth said the bicycle industry has again been completely ignored. “We (India) are the second largest bicycle manufacturers in the world, coming only after China. But the government is not focusing on this industry even in these testing times. The government should have announced a special package to help us upgrade and overtake China,” said Seth.Sewing machine development club general secretary Kulwant Singh said, “We were expecting a special package from the government but we have been left empty-handed. The industry is struggling to stand on its feet but the government doesn’t seem to care.”Exporters too have said that they are dejected with the budget. “We have been demanding freight equalisation scheme and relief in terms of income tax for exporters but the government has not paid heed to any of these demands,” said Jaspal Singh Shahpuri, vice-president of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU). Ludhiana woollen manufacturers association and knitwear club president Darshan Dawar said, “The government has announced that seven mega industrial parks will be established across the country in the next three years. The number of such parks should have been higher. The government should also have provided some special relief package for the industry.”The reduction of customs duty on import of gold from 12.5% to 7.5% has failed to please the jewelers, who say that as the government has also imposed 2.5% agri cress on gold, there won’t be much profit for them. Thapar jewellers owner Tribhuvan Thapar said, “The government should have given some major relief as the gold (24 carat) rates have increased from around ₹34, 000/10gram to around 50, 000/10gram amid the pandemic.” FICO vice-president Manjinder Singh Sachdeva Senior said that the Credit Link Capital Subsidy Scheme has not been reintroduced, even when the industry was seeking increase in its limit. “The scheme should have been made permanent as it is the only scheme for the technological upgrade of the MSME industry,” he said.A few see ray of hopeA few announcements have, however, been applauded by some sections of the industry. Among those are the reduction in customs duty on imports of semi-flat and long products of non-alloy, alloy and stainless steel and duty-free import of steel scrap. The industrialists said that this will reduce the steel prices in the country and to some extent end cartelisation. Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) general secretary Pankaj Sharma said, “Reduction in custom duty or scrap and increase in customs duty of several manufactured items is a welcome step. Encouragement to start-ups and low-cost housing projects will boost investment and double the budget for MSME sector, which is also a good sign.” He added that the voluntary vehicle scrappage policy will also boost the automobile sector. Knitwear and textile club president Vinod Thapar stated that announcement of a mega textile park in Punjab is a major relief for the textile and hosiery sector. He added that the reduction of the basic customs duty on caprolactam, nylon chips and nylon fiber and yarn to 5% will encourage the growth of the Man Made Fibre (MMF) sector, especially the MSMEs.Former president of the federation of Indian Export Organisation (FIEO) SC Ralhan and Chartered accountant MK Gupta said the government has simplified taxation through faceless dispute resolution committee among other steps. Also income tax assessment time-limit has been reduced to 3 years from 6 years, which is a major relief.MBD Group’s joint managing director Sonica Malhotra Kandhari said, “Allocation of ₹64,180 crore to healthcare, which also includes Rs.35,000 crore for Covid-19 vaccines, is a welcome step. However, we were looking for some measures related to travel and hospitality sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nothing-for-us-in-budget-say-ludhiana-s-industrialists-101612206571318.html
02-02-2021||Chandigarh||Apni mandis reopen in Chandigarh||Apni mandis opened in Chandigarh for the first time since March 2020 on Monday. Although there was a lukewarm response, with people apparently wary of visiting a crowded market, the low prices came as a big respite from that being charged by vendors.Potatoes, which are available for ₹25 per kg from roadside vendors, were being sold for just ₹10 per kg. Tomatoes were also availanle for almost half the price, at ₹20 per kg. Officials said the difference was because locally grown potatoes and tomatoes were being directly brought to the mandis. However, onion was available at the same price, ₹40 per kg. Residents, who did make it to the mandi, were happy because of the cheaper prices. Sukhbir Singh, a resident of Sector 44, said he regretted buying vegetables on Sunday as he was now getting better prices at the mandi in Sector 45.However, the mandi had many vacant stalls. Satbir Singh, an auction recorder for Punjab Mandi Board, said: “This is just the beginning, which is why the footfall is less than half of the usual. We expect that within a week or so, the business will improve.”Farmers who came to the mandi were also a relieved lot. Talwara Singh from Mohali said: “Earlier, it was hard for us to find buyers for our vegetables, and we couldn’t sell them by ourselves in Chandigarh. Apni mandis are a free and fair way for us to reach customers.”Lallan Kumar, another vendor, said: “We charge fair prices and people will start coming once they see the quality of vegetables.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apni-mandis-reopen-in-chandigarh-101612206569429.html
02-02-2021||Chandigarh||Union Budget gives fillip to infra projects in Chandigarh||Infrastructure projects in Chandigarh are set to get a fresh impetus with the allocation for capital expenditure increased by 25% in the Union Budget outlay for the UT in the coming fiscal.Capital expenditure is the government spending on infrastructure and development works. However, overall, there is only a marginal increase of 0.93% ( ₹48 crore) in the budget estimates from ₹5138.10 crore in 2020-2021 to ₹5186.12 crore in 2021-2022. In the last year’s budget, the total outlay was increased by 8.1%.On the administration getting nearly ₹500 crore lesser than its own proposal for ₹5,670 crore, UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “I was expecting a cut due to overall fund constraints in the Covid-19 scenario. We are grateful to the Union government for enhancing our allotment by ₹48 crore as compared to last year.”From routine spending to productive worksKeeping the UT budget stagnant, the Centre has shifted a major portion of the allocation under the revenue expenditure (government money spent on salaries, wages, subsidies, loan interest, etc) to capital expenditure, which officials said would help in expanding development works and creation of new projects. The UT’s revenue expenditure has been decreased from ₹4,693 crore in 2020-2021 to ₹4,567 crore in 2021-2022. At the same time, capital expenditure allocation stands increased from ₹494 crore to ₹618 crore.Arun Gupta, home and finance secretary, said: “Allocation for salaries, made under revenue expenditure, is generally not used fully, as sometimes provisions for posts that end up remaining vacant are also made. This was the case this year too. So, the outlay for revenue head has been cut and shifted to more constructive capital expenditure head.”Urban development biggest gainerEven as revenue expenditure for urban development has been cut, capital allocation has been increased by nearly 37% from ₹171 crore to ₹238 crore, thus bringing Chandigarh in a better position to take up new infrastructure works, said officials.Capital expenditure outlay for police has been increased from ₹53 crore to ₹87 crore. This includes provision for police housing and allied works, such as development of infrastructure and renovation of existing houses. For public works, the allocation has been increased from ₹19.55 crore to ₹24.91 crore.Similarly, on education, sports, art and culture, capital expenditure allocation has been increased from ₹78.63 crore to ₹93.88 crore. As per the budget document, this includes provision for modernisation and purchase of equipment, development of infrastructure for NCC and modernisation of polytechnic and industrial training institute.“We are better placed if we get more funds under the capital head as this money is to be spent solely on infrastructure development,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/union-budget-gives-fillip-to-infra-projects-in-chandigarh-101612206389554.html
02-02-2021||Mumbai||MVA leaders term Budget a maha disappointment; Opposition denies||With no major announcement for Maharashtra in Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s speech on Monday, barring next phases of Metro lines for Nagpur, Pune and a couple of road and railway projects, political parties in the state had mixed reactions to the Union budget. State officials said they would study the details of the budget to see the benefits for Maharashtra. In her speech, Sitharaman announced a provision of ₹2,092 crore for Nashik Metro and ₹5,976 crore for the second phase of Nagpur Metro. An allocation of ₹65,000 crore has been made for the national highway measuring 1,100km, including Mumbai-Kanyakumari corridor of 600km.Officials said they were expecting allocations for infrastructure, agriculture and health. They also said the Centre has increased borrowing from ₹5.35 lakh crore to ₹12.5 lakh crore in its revised estimates for FY 20-21 and it will benefit the states. “Maharashtra, being one of the largest states, will definitely get a significant share of these funds, although it is not what would be the share of the state in the provisions for agriculture and irrigation. The state’s borrowing limits have been upped to 4% of the GDP and it will help us in pump in more money into system,” he said. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state expressed its unhappiness over the union budget. “The budget should be for the country and not only for the elections. How can the budget presented with an eye on elections in certain states fulfil the expectations of people,” asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his initial reaction, referring to various announcements made by Sitharaman for poll-bound states such as West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Maharashtra finance minister Ajit Pawar said that Modi government’s bias towards Maharashtra was visible in the Centre’s budget. “Poll-bound states like West Bengal have been given a major share, but their actual realisation seems to be difficult. Mumbai, Pune or Maharashtra have got nothing in the budget. The provision for Metro in Nashik and Nagpur has been done keeping an eye on civic polls in these cities. The minister uttered no word about Wardha-Yavatmal-Nanded, Nashik-Pune, Karad-Chiplun railway corridors. MPs from Maharashtra should now come together to urge the finance minister for adequate outlay for the state,” he said. According to an official, the allocation for the national highway too will not come to Maharashtra. “The highway is connected to the existing corridor originating in Mumbai, but the spending is fully in Kerala. The outlay for the Metro projects is for the ones already under implementation. No new project has been allocated for the state. There is no announcement for extension of the GST compensation beyond June 2022 or inclusion of more items (from six presently) in cess collection fund as was expected,” said an official from the finance department. Sitharaman announced tax sops for setting up units at the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City in Gujarat. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, lauded the budget. Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis described the budget as full of confidence which would lead India on the path of self-reliance. “The proposals for the Nagpur and Nashik Metro lines were sent during our government. We are thankful to the Centre for accepting them. Although only a few projects from Maharashtra have been named in budget, there would be many more projects and sizable allocation for Maharashtra in the actual budget,” Fadnavis said. “Shifting of the IFSC to Gujarat was a sin committed by the then UPA government in 2012, which gave it a nod. The Congress and NCP government should not blame us for it.” Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut dismissed the speculations that the Centre gave allocation to the two cities to gain electorally in municipal polls. “I do not think that they have given allocation to Nashik and Nagpur because they are in power there. They may be in power now, but going forward it will not be so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-leaders-term-budget-a-maha-disappointment-opposition-denies-101612206331219.html

Names of some such students might have reflected in the portal too,” he said. Officials from the education department said that there were no guidelines from the government yet regarding additional admissions rounds. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad did not respond to HT’s calls and messages. The education department conducted seven phases of FCFS admissions between January 14 and 30.

02-02-2021||Mumbai||Budget fails to cheer up realty sector in Mumbai||The Union budget has failed to bring cheer to the real estate sector, which is reeling under slowdown especially after Covid-19 lockdown, in Mumbai region. Though the sector was awaiting various sops like grant of industry status, waiver of Goods and Service Tax (GST) on under-construction projects, tax breaks, the Budget did not bring any such relief.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman extended additional deduction of interest amounting to ₹1.5 lakh taken for affordable units by another year. Similarly, the tax holiday for builders constructing affordable houses has also been extended by one year. Both these measures were also announced last year.According to the Builders Association of India (BAI), there was hardly anything in the Budget for Mumbai. “There is hardly any apartment within Mumbai limits costing less than ₹45 lakh, which is specified as affordable house. So the buyer as well as builder got no benefit from this Budget,” said Anand Gupta, chairperson (Housing and RERA committee), BAI. He said the sector was expecting waiver in GST on under-construction flats. “People prefer to buy readymade flats rather than invest in under-construction ones; hence builders are chocked of funds,” he said.Real estate experts said it was just status quo from the Central government. “The market needed impetus from the government. They should have allowed the incentive to be passed for houses up to ₹1 crore instead of the present ₹45 lakh. The additional deduction of interest should have been extended to at least ₹8 lakh per annum as ₹1.5 lakh is not very attractive. This would have boosted the sales considerably,” said Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras, a real estate research firm.The real estate sector is in slowdown mode as there was very less sales even before the Covid-19 pandemic, and the lockdown only aggravated matters. In the past two months, there has been activity due to various measures taken by the state government such as reduction of stamp duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/budget-fails-to-cheer-up-realty-sector-in-mumbai-101612204949806.html
02-02-2021||Mumbai||Day 1 of local trains for all sees the return of ‘rush hour’ in Mumbai||Nearly 3.4 million passengers travelled by local trains on the first day after suburban train services resumed for the general public after 10 months. Nearly 1.9 million passengers had travelled by Central Railway (CR) and 1.5 million had travelled by Western Railway (WR) by late Monday night. Before the lockdown, 8 million people travelled by Mumbai’s local train network daily. Local train services were suspended on March 23, 2020, and had resumed for certain groups, like essential workers and cancer patients, since July 15, 2020. As of Monday, suburban train services are open to the public from the first local train of the day till 7am; between 12pm to 4pm; and post 9pm till the last local train of the day. Face masks are mandatory for those travelling by train. On Monday, there were long queues at booking offices outside Nalasopara, Kurla, Ghatkopar, Diva, Thane and Dadar railway stations. “At Nallasopara station there was a bit of crowd for renewal of season passes. On explaining that time slots beyond 7am till 12am are for nominated categories, they dispersed,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer (PRO), WR. Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel at Kurla, Dadar and Ghatkopar railway stations were seen streamlining passengers and directing queues. Ticket-checking staff were deployed on foot overbridges and at platforms. On Monday, Government Railway Police (GRP) collected ₹1,02,400 in fines ( ₹55,000 on CR; ₹47,400 on WR) from passengers travelling without face masks. “There is an excitement to travel by local train after 10 months. However, some people have come to the station only to get their passes renewed,” said Dinesh Trivedi, a Vidyavihar resident who had to wait 20 minutes to get a train ticket at Kurla station. Commuters said there wasn’t much overcrowding inside the trains. “There is no queue inside the local train compartment, but just to reach it took 15 minutes,” said Aditi Thakur, a Dadar resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/day-1-of-local-trains-for-all-sees-the-return-of-rush-hour-in-mumbai-101612204889375.html
02-02-2021||Delhi||Farm protests: Cops wanted Delhi-bound trains stopped||Delhi Police asked Northern Railways to terminate at least 15 Delhi-bound trains, which passed through Punjab and Haryana, at the edge of the Capital in a bid to stop farmers from entering the city on Monday and joining ongoing protests against three agriculture laws, HT has learnt.But Northern Railways said on Monday it diverted only three trains, for “operational reasons”.Citing intelligence inputs, Delhi Police told Northern Railways on Sunday that farmers from Punjab and Haryana planned to protest in the Capital on Monday – when the Union budget was being presented – and hoist flags on Parliament House, according to two letters written by the force. HT has accessed the letters.The police order came in the backdrop of violent clashes during a tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day, when many protesters broke through barricades, ran riot on streets, stormed the Red Fort and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the flag of Sikhs, from its ramparts.Also read: Allocation for Delhi Police up by over ₹487 crore“There is an input that on 01.02.21 farmers from Haryana and Punjab are coming to New Delhi through train to join the ongoing protests against the three Central Farm Acts & other agrarian issues in Delhi. They are also planning to hoist Flag at Parliament House. In view of recent incident at Red Fort and to maintain law & order in the city, it is become necessary to restrain these farmers from entering Delhi,” the letter said.“Hence, it is requested to terminate the following trains at Narela Railway Station in place of Old Delhi Railway Station to restrain these farmers to enter Delhi in view of law & order situation,” the letter added. Narela lies on the northwestern edge of the Capital.The police communication to top Northern Railway officials asked at least 15 trains from Punjab and Haryana be terminated, including four intercity trains, Jammu-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, Delhi-Katra Vande Bharat Express, Nanded Express, Amritsar-Mumbai Pashchim Express, Una-New Delhi Jan Shatabdi, Ferozpur-Mumbai Punjab Mail, Kalka-New Delhi Shatabdi Express, Pune- Jammu Tawi Jhelam Express and Katra-New Delhi Shri Shakti Express among others.To be sure, Northern Railways said three trains were diverted on Monday citing “operational reasons.” The three trains included Punjab Mail, Ganganagar intercity and Bhatinda-Delhi Kisan Express.“The trains were diverted due to operational reasons,” Northern railways spokesperson said. According to officials aware of the development, the railways is on high-alert and monitoring passengers coming from the aforementioned trains.On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio address that the country was saddened by the “insult to the Tricolour” on Republic Day, his first public comments on the violent clashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-protests-cops-wanted-delhi-bound-trains-stopped-101612204768522.html
02-02-2021||Delhi||Iron spikes, barbed wire and concrete walls at Delhi farm protest sites||The Delhi police have enhanced barricades at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur where thousands of farmers are protesting against three farm laws for over two months. While the iron spikes have been placed on the road leading to the main protest site at Tikri, besides heavy metal and concrete barriers, the police have created a wall at Singhu and Ghazipur by pouring concrete between two rows of cement barricades.The measures were taken in the aftermath of clashes between the police and the protesters when the farmers during a tractor rally on Republic Day went beyond the routes approved by the police by breaking barriers and barricades placed on the roads.The internet connectivity continued to be disrupted at all the three borders on Monday even as more farmers from Haryana and Punjab joined the protest.At Tikri, on the road towards Delhi, the police have overall set up a five-layer security system which begins right behind the main stage at the protest site. The first obstruction consists of two layers of iron barricades. After that, the police have joined rows of cement barricades by filling the space between them with concrete. Beyond that, the police have dug up the road and installed iron spikes. Then, there are large trailers and dumpers serving as the fourth layer. And finally, a set of iron barricades forms the fifth layer of hurdles.“This is one of the many measures being taken to instil confidence among the Delhiites and to reiterate our commitment to ensure the safety of life and property of citizens,” said A Koan, deputy commissioner of police (outer), when asked about the iron spikes on the road.The protest site at Singhu border also has five layers of barricades with the first one nearly 1.5 km away from the main protest site. Only police vehicles were allowed beyond this point and locals as well as media personnel were only allowed on foot after stating their purpose of visit. Most of the locals were not allowed to enter unless they had an emergency.Also read: Closure of border points, barricades trigger traffic snarls in DelhiOn Monday, police officials were seen supervising the installation of concrete barricades with a cement mixer pouring concrete between two layers of barricading near the main stage area. The two layers were also joined with iron rods in between them to strengthen the barricading further. Containers at the spot have also been used to store concrete barriers. Several routes leading to the protest site were either barricaded, closed using concertina wires, or dug up restricting movement of farmers between the two stages and cutting off supplies.Protesting farmers at Singhu said the police were trying to “crush their movement” by setting up so many layers of barricading. Major Ram Singh, 65, a member of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee which has set up the first stage at Singhu, said, “These are efforts to break the spirit of our movement by creating hurdles in arranging for our daily needs like water and toilets. But farmers from Punjab and Haryana are reaching the agitation spot using different route and carrying supplies which we may need here.”Buta Singh, president BKU (Ekta), Dakoda, who has been camped at Tikri border said that the government was “terrified” because of which it was resorting to placing several layers of hurdles.“We are peacefully protesting here, so where is the need for such security measures? The police are installing iron spikes, creating concrete barricades and deploying more police and paramilitary forces. All these are efforts to instil fear among us but we are not going to let our movement die. About 1,000 more tractors are coming from Haryana and Punjab to give us strength,” Singh said.Sudesh Goyat, a farmer at Tikri Border, said that the huge “police bandobast” showed that the police were planning some action against farmers. “They have put barricades like as if we are their biggest enemy. We are cautious that the police might use force against us even though we are protesting peacefully. We are only fighting to repel these black laws,” Goyat said.Like Singhu, police have completely blocked the movement of the media and locals anywhere near the Tikri protest site and have also blocked many lanes in the nearby Baba Haridas Nagar colony. This led to inconvenience to a number of locals who had to go towards Haryana.“Our half of the colony falls in Delhi and the rest in Haryana. When the police and the farmers blocked the main highway for commuting between Delhi to Haryana, we used the bylanes in the colonies to reach our destinations. But since Sunday night, the police put barricades in several lanes and blocked them. I have my shop in the Haryana side of the colony but now I further have to take a detour of more than a kilometre to reach my shop,” Pawan Dahiya, a resident of Baba Haridas Nagar colony said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iron-spikes-barbed-wire-and-concrete-walls-at-delhi-farm-protest-sites-101612204708512.html
02-02-2021||Delhi||Red Fort vandalism: Police arrest first suspect||The Delhi Police on Monday said they had made the first arrest in one of the two cases registered in connection with the violence at the Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally in the national capital on January 26, while six more cases have been registered in the violence and January 29 incident when a group of persons who said they were locals entered the protest site at Singhu border leading to clashes with farmers and police.With the six new cases that have been registered at different police stations in the last four days, the total number of first information reports (FIRs) pertaining to violence during the ongoing farmers’ agitation rose to 44 on Monday. While 120 people have been arrested, two minor boys have been apprehended so far in these cases, the police said.Sharing details of the arrest of the man involved in the Red Fort violence, a senior police officer associated with the investigation said on the condition of anonymity that the suspect, identified as Akash Preet Singh, had allegedly attacked and injured a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawan with a sword.Also read: East Delhi cops get sword-like metal batons, metal arm covers“Singh was also injured in the clash and he had admitted himself at a government hospital in north Delhi from where we caught him. Since he was also tested for Covid-19, we have formally arrested him but is continuing his treatment,” said the officer, adding that the suspect had already been identified through video footage and was wanted for the attack.Like Sunday, farmers on Monday also said that at least 250 persons who were part of the agitation are still missing since the Republic Day violence and 150 farmers from Punjab and Delhi have formed the “Lawyers for Kisan” platform to trace the missing farmers and provide free legal aid to those arrested during the farmers’ agitation. A helpdesk has been set up behind the Samyukta Kisan Morcha stage at Singhu border agitation spot.However, the city police on Monday appealed to people not to believe in rumours about the illegal detention of farmers and asserted that the investigation is being carried out in a fair and transparent manner. They also used their Twitter handle to refute the allegations of illegal detention and to update about the arrests and cases registered.Simranjeet Kaur Gill, 34, a lawyer from Mohali, is one of the volunteers at the help desk coordinating with family members of the missing farmers. “We have a helpline number and volunteers are constantly manning it. Upon getting calls from family members who claim that the protester has been unavailable, or their phone is not reachable, our team checks with hospitals and courts to track the person. We have also made announcements from the stage for protesting farmers to come and share any information they may have on the missing farmers.” Gill added that so far, they have tracked 163 arrested farmers and at least 250 are still missing.The lawyers’ collective, which works under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, will also tie up with security volunteers at the spot to track if the missing farmer has arrived at the tractor-trolley unit of their village or district.Narpinder Singh, 37, a farmer from Rauni village in Ludhiana district, said, “One of the farmers from my village had gone to Narela to withdraw cash on Friday when a mob attacked farmers at the first stage. We couldn’t find him the entire day and later got a call from their family the next day saying he had been arrested. The police officers have been calling families back home as intimidation tactics so that more and more farmers don’t arrive here. But that won’t deter us.”“The information about the cases and arrests has been updated on the official website of the Delhi Police as per guidelines of the Supreme Court to facilitate the public. We appeal to the public to not believe in rumours. Investigation carried out by the Delhi Police is transparent and fair,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Eish Singhal, adding that the kin of those arrested can also seek information from the police stations concerned.According to the police, notices have been sent to nearly 150 people, including farm leaders, farmers and owners of tractors and other vehicles, asking them to join the investigation and record their statements.“None of them turned up till Monday evening. We may issue fresh notices to them,” the officer said.Investigators said that they have received over 4,000 video footage and photographs from the public and other sources after their appeal to assist them in their investigation by sharing videos and pictures of the violence.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/red-fort-vandalism-police-arrest-first-suspect-101612204648556.html
02-02-2021||Delhi||East Delhi cops get sword-like metal batons, metal arm covers||New Delhi: Police personnel in east Delhi’s Shahdara district were given sword-like iron batons and a metal forearm cover on Monday to protect themselves from “rioters armed with swords”.Senior officers who spoke on condition of anonymity said the batons were being used “as an experiment” after several cops were injured during clashes with protesters who carried swords during the Republic Day tractor rally taken out by the farmers who are protesting against the three contentious farm laws.A picture of the policemen holding the improvised metal baton was widely circulated on social media on Monday. Officers aware of the matter, who wished not to be named, said so far only 10-15 policemen have been given the baton.Also read: Closure of border points, barricades trigger traffic snarls in Delhi“It’s a makeshift arrangement to minimize injury in case of a sword attack. It is not an aggressive but defensive mechanism. The baton is 4-5 feet long and has a metallic arm guard that protects the person holding it against the attack by a sword,” the officer said.“This [the metal forearm cover] can be used to stop an attack by a sharp-edged weapon. The guard and the baton are lightweight making it easy to carry,” he added.The station house officer of Alipur police station, who was posted at Singhu Border, was injured after a protester allegedly attacked him with a sword on Friday. The SHO had sustained cuts in his left hand. The man was caught at the spot and arrested for attempting murder.“We are not officially procuring it yet, the batons being used on an experimental basis,” said another officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/east-delhi-cops-get-sword-like-metal-batons-metal-arm-covers-101612204589171.html
02-02-2021||Delhi||Closure of border points, barricades trigger traffic snarls in Delhi||All roads leading to central Delhi were heavily barricaded with the police checking vehicles at several points on Monday, when the Union Budget was presented in the Parliament, leading to traffic snarls across the Capital.Senior police officers who spoke on condition of anonymity said security was further enhanced in the city in anticipation of trouble by thousands of protesters who are camping on Delhi borders against the three contentious farm laws. On Republic Day, the farmers took out a tractor rally, clashed with the police at several points and barged into the Red Fort.Farm leaders had announced a march to Parliament on February 1, but cancelled it after the violence during the tractor rally. The officers said they enhanced the security anyway as they did not want to take any chances.Besides Delhi police and central paramilitary personnel, traffic police was also deployed in adequate numbers, one of the officers said. Buses had also been parked on the roads as a precautionary measure to prevent any protesters from going towards Parliament.Throughout the day, massive traffic jams were reported from the eastern, southern and central parts of Delhi which were worsened by the closure of the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border, Delhi-Meerut expressway and NH-9, NH-24. The closure of the almost all the lanes of the NH-24 resulted in bumper-to-bumper traffic which went up to three kilometres along the Anand Vihar road.At GT Karnal Road, the carriageway towards Delhi also saw massive traffic throughout the day due to police barricades installed near the Bhalswa landfill. On Monday evening, commuters faced a delay of around 40 minutes to cover the stretch.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said apart from the Delhi-Meerut expressway, all the carriageways of NH-9 and NH-24 were closed since Sunday night due to the farmers’ protest. “But as the closure of the roads caused a massive bottleneck, one carriageway on NH-24 going towards Delhi was opened for traffic. The other roads are still closed. No vehicles are being allowed on these roads for people going towards east Delhi or Ghaziabad,” said DCP Yadav.Also read: Farmers announce ‘chakka jam’ on Feb 6Traffic police officials said vehicles are being diverted on other routes such as Vikas Marg, DND, and those in the south and north Delhi. Among the roads that have been witnessing traffic jams are Road No. 56 between Ghazipur and Dilshad Garden via Anand Vihar ISBT, Vikas Marg (both carriageways), Ring Road (towards south Delhi and central Delhi), DND, and Ashram Chowk.As motorists faced inconvenience and complained about the traffic chaos on social media, the Delhi Traffic Police began posting updates about diversions and suggested alternate routes.Police said there were also rumours and misleading posts on social media that the police are cordoning west Delhi neighbourhoods inhabited by a particular community. Joint commissioner of police (western range) Shalini Singh said because of the call for march to Parliament, as a precautionary measure roads leading to Parliament were heavily barricaded.“Adequate police deployment is being maintained to avoid any law and order situation. There are rumours that police are barricading neighbourhoods dominated by a particular community which are absolutely baseless and false,” Singh said.The joint commissioner said police teams have also been asked to conduct coordination meetings with gurdwaras and aman (peace) committees. All measures are being taken to ensure peace, she said.Delhi Police also tweeted to dispel rumours. “These barricades are installed for routine law and order arrangement and checking of vehicles. We are a secular force with mission to safeguard all religious groups and communities.”“If anybody is having apprehensions, please feel free to call concerned police station SHO.” A list of all SHOs in the west district was attached to the tweet.Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastav also visited Ghazipur border along with other senior officers to take stock of the security arrangements. He also briefed the police personnel deployed at the border and appreciated their hard work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/closure-of-border-points-barricades-trigger-traffic-snarls-in-delhi-101612204588556.html
02-02-2021||Delhi||Union Budget: Allocation for Delhi Police up by over ₹487 crore||The central government has allocated R 8,644.12 crore to the Delhi Police in its budget estimates for fiscal 2021-22 – ₹487.56 crore or 5.97% more than the previous year’s revised estimates (RE) allocation of ₹8,156.56 – aimed at the upgradation and expansion of communication and traffic infrastructure, procurement of vehicles, modernisation of equipment, and capacity building of the police force.Delhi Police’s budget allocation for 2021-22 has increased by R 3,990.93 crore from R 4653.19, that was allocated to them by the Union government in its 2014-15 Union Budget. In percentage, this budget allocation increase is 85.76%.As per the documents accessed from Delhi Police, the total budget estimates allocated (BE) to them for 2020-21 was R 8,608.08. This amount was brought down to ₹8,156.56 – a decrease of Rs451.52 – in the revised estimates (RE). So if the budget estimates of this year is compared with the last BE, there is only an increase of Rs36.04 crore. Police officials are hoping that the amount may be increased in the government in their revised estimates.Delhi Police spokesperson Anil Mittal said that of the total budget estimates ( ₹8,644.12 crore) allocated by the Union government, ₹8,100.20 crore is under revenue section (planned expenditure) and it has been earmarked for paying the salary of police personnel and other establishment related expenditures.Also read: East Delhi cops get sword-like metal batons, metal arm covers“ ₹237.92 crore that has been allocated under capital section (non-planned expenditure) shall be incurred for the upgradation and expansion of communication infrastructure, modernisation of equipment, installation of traffic signals, upgradation of training and procurement of vehicles for policing,” said Mittal.The city police are in the process of procuring advanced version of communication system and a file related to inviting tender for its design, supply and installation is pending approval in the home ministry. The artificial intelligence traffic management system (ITMS) project that was initiated almost a decade ago is yet to be launched, police officials said.“There are more than 200 police stations in the city and each police station has two-three inspectors. However, official four-wheeler is only allotted to the station house officer (SHO) while the other inspectors either use police bikes or their personal vehicles while on duty,” a police official who did not want to be named said.According to Mittal, the government has allocated ₹306 crore that shall be spent exclusively for police infrastructure – construction of office buildings, residential buildings, and development of the new Police headquarters building.Police data show that less than 20% police personnel have got been allotted government flats while more than a dozen police stations are still operating from rented buildings.“A total of ₹10.14 crore has been allocated separately under the scheme for Safety of Women (financed from Nirbhaya Fund) in addition to the total allocation for construction of building for special police units for women, children and north-east residents and various other activities for awareness and gender sensitization,” added Mittal.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/union-budget-allocation-for-delhi-police-up-by-over-rs-487-crore-101612204468567.html
02-02-2021||Delhi||HC rejects PIL that sought action against police for failure to contain violence in R-Day tractor rally||The Delhi high court on Monday rejected a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), imposing a cost of ₹10,000 on the petitioner, who sought action against the police and intelligence officials responsible for the “failure” in “anticipating and controlling” the farmers’ protest on Republic Day.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh declined to entertain the PIL, saying it was too early for the court to interfere in the issue as police have registered FIRs in relation to the incident on January 26, and authorities are looking into the matter.The NGO, Delhi Citizen Forum for Civil Rights, in its petition had claimed that the incident occurred due to major lapses in the security set up and also violated the national honour as instead of the national flag a religious one was hoisted at Red Fort by the farmers on Republic Day.Joginder Tuli, the chairman of the petitioner NGO, confirmed that the court has dismissed the petition with costs of ₹10,000.Also read: Closure of border points, barricades trigger traffic snarls in DelhiThe NGO had contended in its petition that the “violent turn of a peaceful protest/rally especially on Republic Day casts a huge doubt on the security agencies and their preparedness to deal with criminal or even terrorist activities especially in the capital of India”.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over two months now against the three farm laws.The tractor parade on January 26 that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws devolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort.Meanwhile, a separate plea has been filed in the high court seeking release of all persons who have been “illegally detained” on or January 26. The plea filed by Harman Preet Singh, who identifies himself as a social worker, is likely to be heard this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-rejects-pil-that-sought-action-against-police-for-failure-to-contain-r-day-tractor-rally-101612204349639.html
02-02-2021||Mumbai||After week-long cold spell, mercury rises in Mumbai||After almost a week of a cold spell, temperatures in the city soared on Monday. The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is indicative of the city’s temperature, recorded a maximum temperature of 34.9 degrees Celsius, 3.5 degrees above normal. At Colaba, maximum temperature was 32 degrees Celsius, 1.7 degrees above normal.Minimum temperatures, too, increased slightly on Monday and were well above normal. At Santacruz, minimum temperature was 19 degrees Celsius, which was 1.4 degrees above normal while Colaba recorded 20.5 degrees Celsius, 0.9 degrees above normal.“It was a good warm morning in Mumbai on Monday with minimum temperature, as expected to be observed, at 19°C. Similar trend is seen in the state with rising trend in both minimum and maximum temperature. As per IMD GFS guidance, by end of this week, minimum temperatures are expected to start falling,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD, on Twitter.Meanwhile, air quality improved marginally on Monday but remained in the poor category. An overall air quality index (AQI) — an air quality indicator — of 221 was measured on Monday as opposed to Saturday’s 286.Andheri with an AQI of 301 had the worst air, followed by Mazagaon at 280.“Air quality of Mumbai is in the poor category. With current wind, local emission with continental pollution will keep AQI poor for Mumbai in the next two days,” according to a short range forecast by SAFAR.AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor; and above 400 as severe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-week-long-cold-spell-mercury-rises-in-mumbai-101612204349199.html
02-02-2021||Other||AAP govt criticises ‘meagre’ allocation for Delhi||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi on Monday criticised the Union Budget for poor fiscal devolution as it claimed that Delhi got a “megre” ₹957 crore, adding that the Central government’s policies will only benefit “big companies” and cause inflation. Comparing the Central grant to Delhi with other Union Territories that have an assembly, Delhi finance minister Manish Sisodia said that the Centre did not grant any funds to the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations in Delhi to help them tide over a financial crisis. “The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is constitutionally on similar a footing with the NCT of Delhi, has been provided a grant of ₹30,757 crore compared to ₹957 crore to Delhi. There are three UTs with a legislature in India, and of them Delhi gets the least grant in absolute terms and ridiculously low amount in terms of per capita grant from the government of India,” Sisodia said in a statement.Last year, Delhi was provided the same amount of ₹325 crore as it share in central taxes. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the budget will lead to price rise across the country. “This budget will benefit to a few big companies. It will lead to price rise and more problems to the people,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi hours after the budget was announced.Sisodia criticised the BJP-led central government for not helping Delhi’s municipal corporations. “The BJP government at the Centre did not even give a single penny to the BJP-ruled MCDs, while it has given ₹2 lakh crore to other municipal corporations across the country. During the last MCD election in Delhi, BJP had said they will bring the money directly from the Centre to the MCD,” Sisodia said.Slamming the Budget proposals and allocations, the deputy chief minister said the budget “completely bypasses” the education and health sectors, and “spells only doom” for the poor, middle class and farmers. At a time when there is farmer agitation happening all over the country, the agriculture budget has also been reduced, he said.“The Union Budget has shockingly reduced the spending on education by 6% compared to last fiscal. It seems no lesson has been learnt from the coronavirus pandemic. History tells us that be it a family or the country, only those who invest in the education of their children become ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant). Reducing expenditure on education by ₹6,000 crore shows that the call for Atmanirbhar Bharat was merely a joke,” Sisodia said.The Central government has decreased the allocation for the ministry of education by 6.13%. According to the finance minister’s speech, for 2021-22 a total amount of ₹93,224 crore will be allocated to the education ministry. In 2020-21, the budget estimate for the ministry was ₹99,312 crore, which was revised to ₹85,089 crore.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the Union budget will help in making India self-reliant in every field.“Special care has been taken in the budget about the health of the common man. Apart from this, soon people will start getting benefits of one nation, one ration card in the country. The expansion of rail and road corridors will boot the country’s infrastructure,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-govt-criticises-meagre-allocation-for-delhi-101612204288624.html
02-02-2021||World||Joe Biden moves to provide Covid-19 vaccine to pharmacies||The Biden administration will begin providing Covid-19 vaccines to U.S. pharmacies, part of its plan to ramp up vaccinations as new and potentially more serious virus strains are starting to appear.A White House announcement was expected Tuesday, a person familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the official announcement.Initially the government will be shipping limited quantities of vaccine to drug stores around the country, but that's expected to accelerate as drugmakers increase production. Drug stores have become a mainstay for flu shots and shingles vaccines, and the industry is capable of vaccinating tens of millions of people monthly.The partnership with drug stores was originally announced by the Trump administration last November.

02-02-2021||World||Biden’s pick for Pentagon deputy Kathleen Hicks vows to defend nuclear triad||President Joe Biden’s nominee for deputy defense secretary told senators she backs plans to modernize the air-land-sea triad of nuclear weapons in the face of threats from China and Russia, an effort where she’d play a leading role.“I am worried about the state of the readiness of the nuclear triad, and if confirmed that is an area I would want to get my team in place and start to look at right away,” Kathleen Hicks said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. “Nuclear deterrence is the cornerstone of American national security as long as there are nuclear threats out there.”Hicks would be the first woman confirmed as deputy defense secretary, an opportunity she called “another crack in the glass ceiling.” She would report to new Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the retired four-star Army general who is the first Black leader of the Defense Department.Austin’s RecusalHicks will assume primary responsibility for procurement decisions about modernizing the nuclear triad -- which may be a trillion-dollar effort over coming years -- because Austin has recused himself from matters involved Raytheon Technologies Corp., where he previously served as a director. Raytheon’s Collins Aerospace unit is a subcontractor on a planned new intercontinental ballistic missile effort led by Northrop Grumman Corp., and Raytheon is the top contractor on the missile known as the Long-Range Standoff weapon.In written questions to Hicks, the Armed Services Committee said Austin’s “broadly scoped recusal will almost certainly prohibit” his participation in those major decisions.Hicks also would be responsible for directing day-to-day management of the vast Pentagon bureaucracy as it grapples with restoring frayed trust with American allies and helping in the nationwide roll-out of coronavirus vaccines.Hicks, 50, headed Biden’s Pentagon transition team and is an expert on national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She also has been serving on the board of closely held Aerospace Corp. She was deputy undersecretary of defense for strategy, plans and forces from 2009 to 2012 and principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy from 2012 to 2013.Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who introduced Hicks, said she has “deep knowledge” of the Defense Department and its “bureaucratic black arts” and helped shape strategic policies in times of constrained budgets.Hicks also commented on the challenges presented by China’s rise, echoing Austin in describing the Asian power as “the pacing challenge of our time.” She said that “armed conflict between the United States and China is not desirable and it is not inevitable,” but acknowledged that it’s possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-pick-for-pentagon-deputy-kathleen-hicks-vows-to-defend-nuclear-triad-101612283297241.html

The official was responding to a question if the US was in touch with countries that have good relations with the Myanmar military, such as India and Japan.“We’re having daily ongoing conversations with them and we certainly appreciate that some other countries have better contact with Burmese military than we do, so we’re continuing those conversations,” the official added.The coup-related US restrictions were still being worked out, but the official said they will not impact humanitarian non-governmental assistance such as those meant for Rohingya refugees.President Joe Biden had on Monday warned of “appropriate action” against the Myanmar government that could include the possible reimposition of sanctions.“The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House.The United States had removed economic sanctions on Myanmar in 2016. But many of the key figures in the Myanmar military are under restrictions for human rights violations, including those related to the Rohingya people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-in-touch-with-india-japan-on-myanmar-coup-101612286444861.html

Several countries have reported that Candida auris, first identified in Asia in 2009, has caused severe illness in hospitalised patients. The yeast is reported to be able to enter the bloodstream and spread through the body leading to invasive infections."CDC fungal experts had never received a report describing a Candida infection resistant to all antifungal medications, let alone Candida that spreads easily between patients. After hearing the news that infections like this were identified by international colleagues in 2016, CDC sounded the alarm in the United States about C. auris, a life-threatening Candida species," a CDC report stated."It is a creature from the black lagoon. It bubbled up and now it is everywhere," The Sun quoted CDC's Dr Tom Chiller as saying.Here's all you need to know about the fungus:1. The severe infection causing pathogen is multi-drug resistant meaning it is resistant to multi antifungal drugs used to treat types of Candida.2. Standard laboratory methods can misidentify the fungus without specialised technology which can cause greater mismanagement.Also Read | Candida auris: Mysterious fungus that infected Covid-19 patients at US hospital3. It can cause outbreaks in the healthcare environment and hence it is important to identify C auris in a hospitalised patient quickly to control the spread.4. While it is yet not clear if it caused lung or bladder infection, C auris has caused bloodstream, wound and ear infections.5. Hospitalised patients or people who have recently been discharged from healthcare facilities after invasive surgeries in which lines and tubes go into the body like breathing tubes, feeding tubes and central venous catheters are the most vulnerable group.6. Severe infections by the pathogen can be fatal. Based on limited data, CDC has said 30-60 per cent people with C auris infections have died.7. Infections have been diagnosed in people of all ages from infants to elderly.8. The fungus is also resistant to common healthcare disinfectants.Also Read | Covid-19 triggering rare, fatal fungal infection: Here’s all about mucormycosis9. The fungus can be carried on a patient's skin without causing infection, allowing spread to others.10. Cases of C auris infections have been reported in several parts of the world including the US, eastern Asia, South America and Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/creature-from-black-lagoon-cdc-warns-of-fungal-infection-that-poses-global-health-threat-101612284061027.html

But his term ended before the beginning of the Senate trial, prompting Republican lawmakers to argue it is unconstitutional to convict a president after he has left office.It is an argument Trump's lawyers are expected to make in his defense, but the Democrats rejected that reasoning outright."There is no 'January Exception' to impeachment or any other provision of the Constitution," they wrote, adding that a president must answer for his conduct in office "from his first day in office through his last."The brief points to multiple videos -- expected to be used as evidence in the trial -- which they say show Trump inciting the crowd to commit violence, and show rioters chanting "Hang Mike Pence!" and hunting for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Trump spent much of his time after the November 3 vote claiming that the election was stolen through massive fraud.Dozens of courts in multiple states found the argument baseless.But impeachment managers argued that Trump's constant promoting of the unfounded accusations that the election was stolen fueled his supporters into backing efforts to overturn the election.When those efforts failed, the Democrats wrote, Trump "summoned a mob to Washington, exhorted them into a frenzy, and aimed them like a loaded cannon down Pennsylvania Avenue."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-provoked-violence-lawmakers-say-in-impeachment-trial-brief-101612285111211.html
02-02-2021||World||New York snow sets record, city starts digging out||The nor’easter that paralyzed New York and blanketed the East and Midwest with heavy snow will edge its way along the coast as a blast of Arctic air sweeps behind it, sending temperatures tumbling across the central US. New York’s Central Park received 19.3 inches (49 centimeters) since Sunday, which makes the storm the city’s ninth heaviest since 1869, said Rob Carolan, owner of Hometown Forecast Services Inc. The bulk of the snow fell Monday, setting a record for the date, according to the National Weather Service. “The setup was perfect for the tri-state area to get buried,” said Carolan, who provides forecasts for Bloomberg Radio. “The radar looked like a fire hose coming off the Atlantic.”The storm closed Covid vaccination sites across the region and tied up road and rail traffic, with trains and subways being suspended in New York on Monday. While school buildings were closed, many students were still required to log on for remote learning.Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in 44 counties, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio enacted a travel ban in the city. More than 3,100 flights in the U.S. have been canceled since Sunday, according to Flight Aware, an airline tracking service.There will be some light snowfall Tuesday, “but it will be more of a digging out and cleaning up,” Cuomo said on 1010 WINS radio.With the worst of the storm over in the mid-Atlantic, Metro North trains resumed regular service, while the Long Island Rail Road is operating on a weekend schedule. Amtrak is operating on a modified schedule. New York schools are still closed through Tuesday, with students learning from home. New York subways began operating above ground at 5 a.m.New York has ordered all vaccine sites to honor appointments. “It will be honored, and that is a state order,” Cuomo said Tuesday.Snow ShowersThe storm will linger off the East Coast with snow showers continuing across large cities along the Interstate 95 corridor, but the heaviest amounts will fall in interior New York and New England, said Lara Pagano, a meteorologist with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center. The highest total from the storm so far was Nazareth, Pennsylvania, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of New York, which received 31 inches.Along the Massachusetts coast, Boston’s Logan International Airport got 1.2 inches, while suburbs just to the north and west got between 17 to 20 inches, Carolan said.As the snow heads off to Canada, frigid, Arctic air is set to rip into the Great Plains and Midwest, sending temperatures 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (6 to 11 Celsius), or more, below normal later this week, Pagano said. Lows will reach 3 degrees Fahrenheit in Milwaukee Friday and 6 in Chicago. Minneapolis will be minus 2.By early next week, some of that cold will arrive in the East, she said.Below NormalThroughout the season, winter has been relatively mild across the U.S. with few major snowstorms and above-normal temperatures. Meteorologists have been predicting a blast of cold after a sudden stratospheric warming event occurred over the Arctic earlier this year, which usually precedes a breakdown of the polar vortex and allows frigid air to spill southward into Asia, Europe and North America.The cold could mean temperatures dropping 5 to 8 degrees below normal across the eastern half of the U.S. from Feb. 7 to 16, according to Matt Rogers, president of the Commodity Weather Group LLC. That will drive up energy demand, and possibly shore up natural gas prices.“A significant pattern change favoring a two-week period of very cold air appears,” said Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist with the Energy Weather Group. “The full wrath of winter arrives in the East in a week.”However, the cold will likely prove short-lived, with temperatures becoming milder again in March, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-snow-sets-record-city-starts-digging-out-101612277011949.html

He had tested positive for Covid-19 on Jan. 22 and was fighting pneumonia.Over the last five years, Moore had been receiving treatment for prostate and skin cancer, his family said. He had not been vaccinated against Covid-19 due to the other medication he was taking.When he started his sponsored walk at his home in the village of Marston Moretaine, 80km (50 miles) north of London, he hoped to raise 1,000 pounds.Instead, he raised millions of pounds for the National Health Service, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, broke two Guinness world records, scored a No. 1 single in the pop charts, wrote an autobiography and helped set up a charity."We share our deepest condolences and sympathies with his family and loved ones at this incredibly sad time," Bedford Hospital's chief nurse Liz Lees said."We’d also like to say thank you, and pay tribute to Captain Sir Tom Moore for the remarkable contribution he has made to the NHS."Sunshine during lockdownRaised in Yorkshire, northern England, Moore served in India, Burma and Sumatra during World War Two.Queen Elizabeth II, who knighted Moore, will send a message of private condolence to the family. Elizabeth "very much enjoyed meeting Captain Sir Tom" and her thoughts were with his family, Buckingham Palace said."The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of," his daughters said."Whilst he'd been in so many hearts for just a short time, he was an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay alive in our hearts forever."Politicians paid tribute to Moore."I'm so sorry to hear that Captain Tom has passed away in hospital," British health minister Matt Hancock said on Twitter. "He was a great British hero that showed the best of our country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-record-breaking-fundraiser-captain-tom-moore-dies-aged-100-101612284957348.html

It has felt like at times we're all living the same day over and over again,” one of the members said. “Groundhog Day also shows us that the monotony ends. The cycle will be broken.”“Today actually is Groundhog Day, there's only one,” he added. “There is quite literally a new day coming over the horizon.”The spectacle that is Groundhog Day at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, still went on, but because of the coronavirus pandemic, revelers weren’t able to see him and celebrate in person: This year, it’s all virtual.Read | What is Groundhog Day and how social media found new meaning under Covid-19 lockdown?A livestream, which had more than 15,000 viewers at one point, played footage from previous Groundhog Day's ahead of the big reveal.Then of course, the prognosticator of prognosticators — assisted by his Inner Circle — emerged at dawn. The lore goes that if he sees his shadow as he did this year, there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring comes early.The livestream from Gobbler's Knob, a tiny hill just outside Punxsutawney about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, is made possible by the Pennsylvania Tourism Office's Holi-stay PA. The event there — always Feb. 2 — dates back to 1887.Phil this year, like many years in the past, gave his forecast during a major snowstorm that hit the entire Northeast.The annual event has its origin in a German legend about a furry rodent. Records dating to the late 1800s show Phil has predicted longer winters more than 100 times. The 2020 forecast called for an early spring — however, Phil didn't say anything about a pandemic.Punxsutawney Phil may be the most famous groundhog seer but he's certainly not the only one. There are two other high-profile “imposters,” as the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club calls them, in the region.Staten Island Chuck will be asked for his prophesy Tuesday around 8 a.m. at the Staten Island Zoo in New York. That event will be streamed on Facebook since the zoo is closed.Also without fanfare, Chuckles, Connecticut's official state groundhog, will make a prediction from home: the Lutz Children's Museum in Manchester. That will also be streamed on Facebook. Chuckles X died in September, and it remains to be seen whether an anointed Chuckles XI will emerge Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/groundhog-day-punxsutawney-phil-says-there-will-be-6-more-weeks-of-winter-101612281207382.html

Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, saw its own shadow which, according to the legend, meant there will be six more weeks of winter.What is Groundhog Day?The annual tradition, which has its origin in a German legend about a furry rodent, is celebrated every year on February 2 in the United States and has been part of its pop culture for many years. The legend of Groundhog Day dictates that if a groundhog emerges on this day from its burrow and sees its own shadow, it will return to its den and the winter will extend for six more weeks. On this day, people hold events around the country and weather reporters Live broadcast the so-called weather prediction.However, this year has been different due to the ongoing pandemic and social media users have compared the day with the hit 1993 comedy Groundhog Day. In the movie, actor Bill Murray played the character of weatherman Phil who was sent to cover the event for a news channel. After arriving in Punxsutawney town of Pennsylvania, he wakes up the next day and relives it over and over again.What’s the pandemic connection?At the beginning of the last spring, governments around the world started imposing movement restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus disease. While vaccines have rolled out in several countries to provide immunity against the disease, social distancing measures are still in place with different variants of virus creating concern for authorities. Social media users said that the pandemic has made every day a Groundhog Day as they are forced to stay at home.

The two other activists are minors.Thousands of Hong Kong residents have fled the territory since Beijing’s imposition of a tough new security law that some say is destroying the territory’s Western-style civil liberties. Since the law was introduced in response to anti-government protests that began in 2019, dozens of pro-democracy activists have been arrested or detained.The Henan Judicial Department held a hearing on the license revocation on Friday in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, according to other lawyers who turned up to support Ren. They were not allowed into the hearing.Ren is the second lawyer to have his license stripped by the authorities for handling the activists' case. Two weeks ago, judicial officials in Sichuan took away the license of Lu Siwei, another lawyer on the case.Ren was told that comments he made in court in a case in 2018 defending Falun Gong practitioners had caused a “negative impact on society,” according to a notice from the Henan Justice Department that he showed to The Associated Press.An official who answered the phone at the Henan Justice Department declined to comment on the case, saying they did not deal directly with media.Ren has years of experience in handling politically human rights cases in China. He has defended people affiliated with the Falun Gong, a spiritual movement which China has labeled a cult and is the subject of persecution after its followers protested in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1999.Most recently, he represented citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was sentenced to four years in prison last December for attempting to report on the situation in the city of Wuhan during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic early last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-strips-license-from-second-lawyer-who-represented-hong-kong-activists-101612257837515.html

02-02-2021||World||Why did the military stage a coup in Myanmar?||A coup in Myanmar has left the military in control under a one-year state of emergency, while the country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior politicians have been detained. Here’s a look at what could be behind the military’s actions.WHY NOW?Monday was supposed to be the first day of a new session of Parliament following November elections that Suu Kyi’s party won in a landslide — and that the military-backed party did poorly in. The military has claimed widespread irregularities on voter lists could have led to fraud in that vote, though the election commission said there was no evidence to support those claims.But the announcement on military-owned Myawaddy TV of the takeover cited the government's failure to act on the allegations as part of the reason for the move.The military maintains its actions are legally justified, and the announcement cited an article in the constitution that allows the military to take over in times of emergency, though Suu Kyi's party's spokesman and many outsiders have said it's effectively a coup.Some experts expressed puzzlement that the military would move to upset the status quo — in which the generals continue to hold tremendous power despite progress toward democracy in recent years.But some noted the looming retirement of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who has been commander of the armed forces since 2011 and who was put in charge on Monday.“There’s internal military politics around that, which is very opaque,” said Kim Jolliffe, a researcher on Myanmar civilian and military relations. “This might be reflecting those dynamics and might be somewhat of a coup internally and his way of maintaining power within the military.”WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE MYANMAR?Television signals were cut across the country, as was phone and internet access in Naypyitaw, the capital, while passenger flights were grounded. Phone service in other parts of the country was also reported down, though people were still able to use the internet in many areas.Barbed wire road blocks were set up across Yangon, the largest city, and military units began to appear outside government buildings such as City Hall.Residents flocked to ATMs and food stalls, while some shops and homes removed the symbols of Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, that typically adorn the streets and walls of the city.WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SUU KYI?Suu Kyi spent years under house arrest and received the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to bring democracy to Myanmar. But her reputation outside of the country soured after she went on the international stage to defend a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims — a campaign the U.S. and others have labeled genocide.Former U.S. diplomat Bill Richardson questioned Suu Kyi’s ability to lead given that defense.“Because of Suu Kyi’s failure to promote democratic values as Myanmar’s de facto leader, she should step aside and let other Myanmar democratic leaders take the reins with international backing and support,” Richardson said in a statement.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Governments and international organizations condemned the takeover, saying it sets back the limited democratic reforms Myanmar has made.“This is an extremely crushing blow to efforts to present Myanmar as a democracy,” said Linda Lakhdhir, a legal adviser at Human Rights Watch. "Its creditability on the world stage has taken a massive hit.”Watchdog groups fear a further crackdown on human rights defenders, journalists, and activists is coming. Even before the current military takeover critics of the military often faced legal action.The coup will also be a test for the international community, which had isolated Myanmar during the decades it was under strict military rule but then enthusiastically embraced it as it moved toward democracy in recent years.In a statement condemning the military's actions, U.S. President Joe Biden threatened to impose new sanctions on Myanmar — a possibility others have raised.Myanmar’s military leaders “must immediately free the democratic leaders of Myanmar and remove themselves from government,” said Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “If not, the United States and other countries should impose strict economic sanctions, as well as other measures” against the military and its leaders, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-did-the-military-stage-a-coup-in-myanmar-101612274851873.html
02-02-2021||World||Rohingya refugees fear returning to Myanmar after coup||Rohingya refugees from Myanmar living in camps in Bangladesh condemned the military coup in their homeland and said it makes them more fearful to return.A counterinsurgency operation by Myanmar's military in 2017 involving mass rape, murders and the torching of villages drove more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims into neighboring Bangladesh.Bangladesh has hosted them in crowded refugee camps, and is eager to begin sending them back to Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Several attempts at repatriation under a joint agreement failed because the Rohingya refused to go, fearing more violence in a country that denies them basic rights including citizenship.Refugees said Tuesday they are more afraid now that the military is in complete control.“The military killed us, raped our sisters and mothers, torched our villages. How is it possible for us to stay safe under their control?” said Khin Maung, head of the Rohingya Youth Association in the camps in Cox’s Bazar district.“Any peaceful repatriation will hugely be impacted," he told The Associated Press. "It will take a long time because the political situation in Myanmar is worse now.”Officials from Myanmar and Bangladesh met last month to discuss ways to start the repatriations, with Bangladesh’s Foreign Ministry seeming more hopeful of success and officials saying they expected to begin sometime in June.But refugees said they totally oppose the military takeover.“We strongly condemn the coup. We love democracy and human rights, so we are worried about losing them in our country,” Maung said.“We are part of Myanmar, so we feel the same as Myanmar’s common people. We urge the international community to raise its voice against the coup,” he said.Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that it hopes the coup will not hamper the repatriation.“As an immediate and friendly neighbor, we would like to see peace and stability in Myanmar.

Until the next government is formed after the upcoming election, we need to steer the country," Min Aung Hlaing was quoted as saying.

02-02-2021||World||Turkish minister LGBT comments about protesters 'hateful conduct', says Twitter||Turkey's interior minister on Tuesday condemned protesters at a top Istanbul university as "LGBT deviants" in a statement which Twitter deemed as hateful conduct.Students and teachers at Istanbul's Bogazici University have held protests for the last month against the appointment of Melih Bulu as rector by President Tayyip Erdogan, which they said was undemocratic.On Monday, scuffles broke out between police and those protesting against the detention of four people after images were shared on social media of them laying a picture on the ground that mixed sacred Islamic imagery with symbols supporting LGBT issues.Police entered campus later in the day to disperse students who were planning an all-night vigil outside the rector's building and detained 159 in total throughout the day, the governor's office said.Istanbul police said 61 people were still detained and were giving statements on Tuesday."Should we tolerate the LGBT deviants who insult the great Kaaba? Of course not. Should we tolerate the LGBT deviants who attempted to occupy the rector's building? Of course not," Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Twitter, repeating a phrase that sparked outrage amongst students and rights groups over the weekend.In a rare move, Twitter placed a warning on Soylu's tweet, saying it violated rules about hateful conduct but added it decided to keep it on the site as it might be in the public interest for it to remain accessible.Turkey's presidency communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said Monday's protests were a response to the university's decision to block an application to set up an LGBTI club - which he said tried to "trample our values underfoot".The government has harshly criticised the protesters, with Erdogan praising his party's youth wing on Monday for "not being the LGBT youth."The main opposition CHP has supported the protests and several parliamentarians from the pro-Kurdish HDP were turned away at the university's entrance on Monday.Erdogan's critics say the president and his AK Party, which promotes conservative Islamic values, have eroded social rights and tolerance during their 18 years in power. Erdogan's supporters say he has restored freedom of religious expression in a once strongly secular republic.Bulu, who applied to be an AKP candidate in a 2015 parliamentary election, was the first rector chosen from outside a university since a military coup in Turkey in 1980, Bogazici faculty members have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-minister-lgbt-comments-about-protesters-hateful-conduct-says-twitter-101612273181373.html
02-02-2021||World||Coup for US, ‘cabinet reshuffle’ for China: Here’s how the world reacted to Myanmar crisis||Myanmar’s armed forces, the Tatmadaw, on early Monday morning declared they have taken control of the country after detaining several political leaders, including state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. The military alleged that the November elections, in which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) registered a massive win, were marred with irregularities. It declared a state of emergency for a year and pledged to hold fresh elections. The announcement triggered strong reactions from all over the world and US President Joe Biden even threatened to put back the sanctions that were removed by former president Barack Obama.Here’s how the world reacted to Myanmar’s political crisis:United StatesPresident Joe Biden called the coup a “direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy”, urging the armed forces to respect Myanmar’s progress towards the establishment of civilian government and peaceful transfer of power. In a statement released by the White House, Biden called on the international community to press the Tatmadaw to immediately relinquish the power, release all activists and leaders, and lift all telecommunication restrictions.“The United States is taking note of those who stand with the people of Burma in this difficult hour,” the statement read, adding that the US will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack.IndiaThe ministry of external affairs (MEA) gave a short and measured response to the developments unfolding in Myanmar, saying India has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition. “We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. We are monitoring the situation closely,” the ministry said.United KingdomPrime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the military coup and called on the armed forces to respect the vote of people and release civilian leaders. In a separate statement, the UK Foreign Office said that there is a need for peaceful reconvening of the National Assembly and respecting the results of general elections.“The UK calls on the military to respect the rule of law and human rights, and release those unlawfully detained,” the statement read.Read | Myanmar military coup: 24 hours later, whereabouts of Aung San Suu Kyi remains unknownChinaWhile China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a news conference that Beijing has “noted” the developments, the state media reported the coup as "major cabinet reshuffle". Wenbin said that Beijing hopes all parties will properly their differences under the constitutional and legal framework and uphold political stability. "Myanmar military announced a major cabinet reshuffle hours after the country declared the state of emergency on Monday," reported Xinhua.European UnionEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell released a statement condemning the “unacceptable attempt to forcibly overturn” the election results, urging to settle the allegations of voting irregularities within proper legal and administrative channels. The 27-members bloc called upon the armed forces to immediately release all those who have been arrested, end the state of emergency and restore the civilian government. “We stand ready to support dialogue with all key stakeholders who wish to resolve the situation in good faith, and to return to the constitutional order,” the high representative said on the behalf of the EU. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen echoed the statement and reiterated the call for the unconditional release of all those detained.I strongly condemn the coup in Myanmar. The legitimate civilian government must be restored, in line with the country's constitution & the November elections. I call for the immediate & unconditional release of all those detained. https://t.co/YbIkxLZlve||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coup-for-us-cabinet-reshuffle-for-china-how-world-reacted-to-myanmar-crisis-101612270977587.html

The forecast may be adjusted in the future as additional contracts are reached.Pfizer is commanding a higher price for its vaccine than some rivals. Under the terms of its supply deal with the U.S., it is charging $19.50 for each shot of the two-dose regimen. Rival AstraZeneca Plc, which hasn’t yet gained authorization for its vaccine in the U.S., has said it plans to charge less than $4 per dose.Excluding its vaccine sales, the drugmaker said it expects 2021 full-year revenue of $44.4 billion to $46.4 billion. Annual earnings per share will be $3.10 to $3.20. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said earlier this month that earnings would top out at $3.10 a share. The guidance was raised primarily because of its shifting vaccine forecast, according to the company.Shares of the New York-based company were little changed in premarket trading Tuesday. Through the close Monday, the stock lost 2.7% so far this year.Vaccine SalesPfizer’s newly authorized Covid-19 vaccine brought in $154 million in sales in the fourth quarter. The two-dose regimen based on a new technology known as messenger RNA was cleared for emergency use in the U.S., U.K. and European Union in December.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech initially expected to produce 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine, known BNT162b2, this year. They later boosted their output goal by more than 50% to 2 billion doses after a label change allowed doctors to extract six doses instead of five from each vial, and they secured additional manufacturing capacity. The boon to supply will certainly add to the companies’ sales.Pfizer and BioNTech have reached agreements totaling 836 million doses, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker, including 300 million for the EU and 200 million for the U.S. Pfizer remains in discussions with governments around the world about new deals and exercising additional options, Bourla said last week in an interview.The drug giant’s overall fourth-quarter figures were anticipated to be messy as it explains how earnings stack up year-over-year following the fourth-quarter spinoff of its off-patent drug unit, Upjohn, into a combined company with Mylan NV now known as Viatris Inc.Innovation-FocusedThe new, slimmed-down Pfizer brought in $11.7 billion. Its major blockbusters, including the cancer drug Ibrance, the anticoagulant Eliquis, and the Prevnar vaccine franchise drove much of the company’s growth.Pfizer spent more than $9 billion on research and development, including on its pandemic response efforts, in 2020. Bourla cited the company’s “decade-long conversion into a pure-play, science and innovation-focused company,” for the company’s progress.“Our record-breaking success at developing a vaccine against Covid-19, along with our partner BioNTech, is just one example of what we believe this new Pfizer is capable of achieving,” he said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-forecasts-15-billion-in-covid-19-vaccine-sales-for-2021-101612271275961.html
02-02-2021||World||Suu Kyi's party demands her release as Myanmar generals tighten grip||The party of Myanmar's detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi called on Tuesday for her immediate release and for the military junta that seized power a day earlier to recognise her victory in an election in November.The Nobel Peace laureate's whereabouts remained unknown more than 24 hours after her arrest in a military takeover that derailed Myanmar's tentative progress towards full democracy.A senior official from her National League for Democracy (NLD) said on Tuesday he had learned that her health was good and she was not being moved from the location where she was being held after the coup against her government.She was picked up in the capital Naypyidaw on Monday along with dozens of other allies but her exact whereabouts have not been made public."There is no plan to move Daw Aung San Su Kyi and Doctor Myo Aung. It's learned that they are in good health," NLD official Kyi Toe said in a Facebook post which also referred to one of her allies. An earlier post said she was at her home.Kyi Toe also said NLD members of parliament detained during the coup were being allowed to leave the quarters where they had been held. Reuters was unable to contact him for more information.The U.N. Security Council was due to meet later on Tuesday amid calls for a strong global response to the military's latest seizure of power in a country blighted for decades by army rule.The United States threatened to reimpose sanctions on the generals who seized power.The coup followed a landslide win for Suu Kyi's NLD in an election on Nov. 8, a result the military has refused to accept citing unsubstantiated allegations of fraud.The army handed power to its commander, General Min Aung Hlaing, and imposed a state of emergency for a year, crushing hopes that the country was on the path to stable democracy.The NLD's executive committee demanded the release of all detainees "as soon as possible".In a post on the Facebook page of senior party official May Win Myint, the committee also called for the military to acknowledge the election results and for the new parliament to be allowed to sit. It had been due to meet on Monday for the first time since the election.Various activist groups on Tuesday issued a flurry of messages on social media urging civil disobedience.Suu Kyi, 75, endured about 15 years of house arrest between 1989 and 2010 as she led a democracy movement against the military, which had seized power in a 1962 coup and stamped out all dissent for decades until her party came to power in 2015.Her international standing as a human rights icon was badly damaged after she failed to stop the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims in 2017 and defended the military against accusations of genocide. But she remains hugely popular at home and is revered as the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, Aung San.INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATIONU.S. President Joe Biden called the crisis a direct assault on Myanmar's transition to democracy."We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burma's democratic transition," Biden said in a statement.The United Nations led condemnation of the coup and calls for the release of detainees, in comments echoed by Australia, the European Union, India and Japan as well as former colonial ruler Britain.China did not join the condemnation, saying only that it noted the events and called on all sides to respect the constitution.The streets of Myanmar were quiet, as they have been for weeks because of the coronavirus. Troops and riot police took up positions in Naypyitaw and the main commercial centre Yangon.By Tuesday morning, phone and internet connections were restored and banks in Yangon reopened after halting services on Monday due to poor internet connections and amid a rush to withdraw cash.But Myanmar's international airport in Yangon will stay closed until April or even May, its manager, Phone Myint, told Reuters. He did not say why."IMMEDIATE RESPONSE"One of the first calls for specific action to oppose the coup came from the Yangon Youth Network, one of Myanmar's biggest activist groups.Doctors at a hospital in the city of Mandalay had also begun a similar campaign.Any street protests will raise alarm in a country with a grim record of military crackdowns.China's state Xinhua news agency quoted a military official as saying most regional and state leaders who were detained during the takeover were released on Tuesday.The chief minister of the Sagaing region, Myint Naing, told the BBC after his release that he had been kept in a dormitory and treated well."I worry for the future of the nation. We hoped for the best but the worst is happening," he said.The latest coup marks the second time the military has refused to recognise a landslide election win for the NLD, having also rejected the result of 1990 polls that were meant to pave the way for multi-party government.Following mass protests led by Buddhist monks in 2007, the generals set a course for compromise, while never relinquishing ultimate control.The NLD came to power after a 2015 election under a constitution that guarantees the military a major role in government, including several main ministries, and an effective veto on constitutional reform.Consolidating its position, the new junta removed 24 ministers and named 11 replacements for various portfolios including finance, defence, foreign affairs and interior.Military chief Min Aung Hlaing has promised a free and fair election and a handover of power to the winner but without giving a timeframe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suu-kyi-s-party-demands-her-release-as-myanmar-generals-tighten-grip-101612269478997.html
02-02-2021||World||Russia's Sputnik V vaccine 91.6% effective in late-stage trial, affirming early data||Russia's Sputnik V vaccine was 91.6% effective in preventing people from developing Covid-19, according to peer-reviewed results from its late-stage clinical trial published in The Lancent international medical journal on Tuesday.Scientists said the Phase III trial results meant the world had another effective weapon to fight the deadly pandemic and justified to some extent Moscow's decision to roll out the vaccine before final data had been released.The results, collated by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow that developed and tested the vaccine, were in line with efficacy data reported at earlier stages of the trial, which has been running in Moscow since September."The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency," Professor Ian Jones of the University of Reading and Professor Polly Roy, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said in a comment shared by The Lancet."But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated," said the scientists, who were not involved in the study. "Another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19."The results were based on data from 19,866 volunteers, of whom a quarter received a placebo, the researchers, led by the Gamaleya Institute's Denis Logunov, said in The Lancet.Since the trial in Moscow began, there were 16 recorded cases of symptomatic Covid-19 among people who received the vaccine, and 62 among the placebo group, the scientists said.This showed that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine - two shots based on two different adenovirus vectors, administered 21 days apart - was 91.6% effective against symptomatic Covid-19.Russia approved the vaccine in August, before the large-scale trial had begun, saying it was the first country to do so for a Covid-19 shot. It named it Sputnik V, in homage to the world's first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union.Small numbers of frontline health workers began receiving it soon after and a large-scale roll out started in December, though access was limited to those in specific professions, such as teachers, medical workers and journalists.In January, the vaccine was offered to all Russians."Russia was right all along," Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is responsible for marketing the vaccine abroad, told reporters ahead of the publication of the results on Tuesday.He said they supported Russia's decision to begin administering Sputnik V to frontline workers while the trial was still underway, and suggested scepticism of such moves was politically motivated."The Lancet did very unbiased work despite some of the political pressures that may have been out there," he said.The number of people vaccinated in Russia has remained low so far. Authorities have pointed to some early issues with scaling up production, while polls have shown low demand among Russians for the vaccine.Russia has already shared data from its Phase III trial with regulators in several countries and has begun the process of submitting it to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for approval in the European Union, Dmitriev said.The data release comes as Europe scrambles to secure enough shots for its 450 million citizens due to production cuts by AstraZeneca and Pfizer while the U.S. roll-out has been hampered by the need to store shots in ultra-cold freezers and uneven planning across states.There were 2,144 volunteers over 60 in the trial and the shot was shown to be 91.8% effective when tested on this older group, with no serious side-effects reported that could be associated with Sputnik V, The Lancet summary said.The vaccine was also found to be 100% effective against moderate or severe Covid-19, as there were no such cases among the group of 78 participants who were infected and symptomatic at 21 days after the first shot was administered.Four deaths of participants occurred, but none was considered associated with vaccination, The Lancet said."The efficacy looks good, including in the over 60s," said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. "It's good to have another addition to the global arsenal."The authors of the study noted that because Covid-19 cases were only detected when participants reported symptoms, further research is needed to understand Sputnik V's efficacy on asymptomatic cases and transmission.Sputnik V has been approved by 15 countries, including Argentina, Hungary, and the United Arab Emirates and this will to 25 by the end of next week, the RDIF's Dmitriev said.The sovereign wealth fund also said vaccinations using Sputnik V will begin in a dozen countries, including Hungary, Bolivia, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Iran.However, large shipments of the shot have only been sent so far to Argentina, which has received enough doses to vaccinate about 500,000 people, and Bolivia, which received 20,000 shots.Production for export will primarily be conducted by RDIF's manufacturing partners abroad, the fund has said.On Tuesday, Dmitriev said that production had begun in India and South Korea, and would launch in China this month. Trial doses have also been produced by a manufacturer in Brazil.Russia is also conducting a small-scale clinical trial of a one-dose version of the vaccine, which developers expect to have an efficacy rate of 73% to 85%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-sputnik-v-vaccine-91-6-effective-in-late-stage-trial-affirming-early-101612270219778.html
02-02-2021||World||WHO team visits animal disease center in Wuhan, China||A World Health Organization (WHO) team of international experts visited an animal disease center in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Tuesday as part of their investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.Team member Peter Daszak, a zoologist with the EcoHealth Alliance, said “excellent facilities, very informative meeting” from an open window as the group left the center in minivans.He also tweeted that they had met with staff in charge of livestock health in Hubei province, toured laboratories and had an in-depth discussion along with questions and answers. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei.Further details of the visit were not announced in what has been a tightly controlled trip, with the media only able to glimpse the team coming and going from its hotel and site visits.The team members wore full protective gear during Tuesday's visit.It’s not clear if they wore similar full-body suits at the research institutes, hospitals and markets they visited on previous days. Outside their hotel and en route to and from visits, the experts have worn masks and professional or business casual attire.Intense negotiations preceded the WHO visit to Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 cases were detected in late 2019. China has maintained strict controls on access to information about the virus, possibly to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the Chinese government had provided significant support and assistance to the WHO team, responding to criticism that China has not revealed much about what the researchers are being allowed to do.“The Chinese experts have shared a lot of information and research results with the WHO team, and they had several rounds of in-depth exchanges on scientific issues of common concern,” he said.On Monday, WHO officials in Geneva pushed back against suggestions China is being less than forthcoming about how the pandemic started.Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO emergencies chief, dismissed critics who said any report from the mission would be incomplete. The team “deserves the support of the international community,” he said.The data the team assembles will add to what is expected to be a years-long quest for answers involving taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.China has largely stopped domestic transmission of the virus through sometimes draconian measures, including strict testing and electronic surveillance. Mask wearing in public is standard and lockdowns are routinely imposed on communities and even entire cities where cases are detected.Schools have gone online and travel has been drastically cut during this month’s Lunar New Year holiday, with the government offering incentives for people to stay put in the cities rather than return to their home towns for family gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-visits-animal-disease-center-in-wuhan-china-101612269319830.html
02-02-2021||World||France says Europe’s vaccine strategy is safer than UK’s||France is taking the lead in defending Europe’s faltering vaccine program and it’s taking a jab at the UK in the process.“The Brits are in an extremely difficult health situation,” France’s junior minister for European Union affairs, Clement Beaune, said on France Inter radio on Tuesday. “Understandably, they are taking many risks in this vaccination campaign.”Beaune cited the UK’s decision to focus on the first vaccine jabs and its reliance on AstraZeneca Plc despite doubts over its efficiency on older people. “I don’t think citizens would accept us taking risks that contradict scientific recommendations,” he said.With nations all over the world counting on Covid-19 vaccines to return to normal life as swiftly as possible, delivery delays in Europe announced by vaccine-makers Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca sent chills through the bloc -- which is trailing the UK when it comes to vaccination -- and gave ammunition to anti-EU politicians like Marine Le Pen in France.Beaune defended the EU’s decision to purchase the doses in common, an approach that avoided a race between member states and put the bloc’s less affluent countries on an equal foot with its richest countries such as Germany or France.Had countries purchased vaccines on their own, “each government -- imagine Germany, France, Italy -- would be calling labs to have doses delivered to get in ahead of their neighbors,” Beaune said. Buying the vaccine in common also allowed the EU to obtain better prices.In France, a country of 67 million inhabitants, about 1.5 million people have received the jab. It plans to give the first dose to 2.4 million more patients by end February, compared to an initial target of 4 million. Government officials have defended their strategy by insisting on the need to focus on most vulnerable people first, and on obtaining their consent as well as following scientific guidelines on doses.France’s Health Agency is set to give its green light to AstraZeneca’s vaccine later Tuesday, but it’s unclear if it will be recommended for people over 65.With some hospitals starting to transfer patients to relieve pressure on intensive-care units and more contagious forms of the virus on the rise, the French government is closely monitoring indicators and remains ready to move quickly if a third lockdown is needed.For now, President Emmanuel Macron is holding off calls for a full lockdown, as he seeks to navigate pressure from doctors to contain the new coronavirus variants and the need to protect the economy, while avoiding the risk of civil disobedience amid mounting fatigue. Instead, he strengthened curfew controls, imposed extra border checks and announced the closure of malls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-europe-s-vaccine-strategy-is-safer-than-uks-101612266952941.html
02-02-2021||World||Offline message app Bridgefy downloaded 600,000 times after Myanmar coup||Offline messaging app Bridgefy said it was downloaded more than 600,000 times in a few hours in Myanmar, after the country's military seized power on Monday and temporarily disrupted internet traffic.The Mexico-based startup, which gained popularity during Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in 2020, tweeted that it hoped people in Myanmar would find its app "useful during tough times."After the country's democratically elected leaders were arrested, phone and internet connections were disrupted in the main city Yangon and the capital Naypyitaw and some other parts of the country.Communications had been restored by late Monday but, in social media posts seen by Reuters, activists in Myanmar encouraged the download of Bridgefy as a solution to possible further shutdowns.Bridgefy, whose backers include Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and which has also been used at anti-government rallies in Thailand, is one of several apps based on Bluetooth that use mesh networks to allow users to communicate without internet connections.They have gained popularity globally, especially in countries which have a history of imposing restrictions on social media platforms and internet providers - though security experts say they can be penetrated, exposing users to surveillance risks.A similar app, Firechat, has been used in protests in Iran and Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/offline-message-app-bridgefy-downloaded-600-000-times-after-myanmar-coup-101612265160506.html
02-02-2021||World||Wikipedia launches new global rules to combat site abuses||The foundation that operates Wikipedia will launch its first global code of conduct on Tuesday, seeking to address criticism that it has failed to combat harassment and suffers from a lack of diversity."We need to be much more inclusive," said María Sefidari, the chair of board of trustees for the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. "We are missing a lot of voices, we're missing women, we're missing marginalized groups."Online platforms have come under intense scrutiny for abusive behavior, violent rhetoric and other forms of problematic content, pushing them to revamp content rules and more strictly enforce them.Unlike Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc which take more top-down approaches to content moderation, the online encyclopedia, which turned 20 years old last month, largely relies on unpaid volunteers to handle issues around users' behavior.Wikimedia said more than 1,500 Wikipedia volunteers from five continents and 30 languages participated in the creation of the new rules after the board of trustees voted in May last year to develop new binding standards."There's been a process of change throughout the communities," Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, said in an interview with Reuters. "It took time to build the support that was necessary to do the consultations for people to understand why this is a priority."The new code of conduct bans harassment on and off the site, barring behaviors like hate speech, the use of slurs, stereotypes or attacks based on personal characteristics, as well as threats of physical violence and 'hounding,' or following someone across different articles to critique their work.It also bans deliberately introducing false or biased information into content. Wikipedia is a relatively trusted site compared to major social media platforms which have struggled to curb misinformation.Maher said some users' concerns that the new rules meant the site was becoming more centralized were unfounded.Wikipedia has 230,000 volunteer editors who work on crowdsourced articles and more than 3,500 'administrators' who can take actions like blocking accounts or restricting edits on certain pages. Sometimes, complaints are decided on by panels of users elected by the communities.Wikimedia said the next phase of the project would be working on the rules' enforcement."A code of conduct without enforcement...is not going to be useful," said Sefidari. "We're going to figure this out with the communities," she said.Maher said there would be training for communities and interested task-forces of users.Wikimedia has no immediate plans to beef up its small 'trust and safety' team, a group of about a dozen staff which currently acts on urgent matters such as death threats or the sharing of people's private information, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikipedia-launches-new-global-rules-to-combat-site-abuses-101612264361693.html
02-02-2021||World||Joe Biden expands quick bid to undo Trump’s immigration policies||The Biden administration on Tuesday announced steps to address harm to thousands of families that were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border, expanding efforts to quickly undo relentless changes to immigration policy over the last four years.President Joe Biden planned to sign orders on family separation, border security and legal immigration, bringing to nine the number of executive actions on immigration during his first two weeks in office. Details were thin, but the moves aim to reverse many of former President Donald Trump's policies to deter immigration, both legal and illegal.Alejandro Mayorkas, whose nomination as Homeland Security secretary awaits Senate confirmation, will lead a task force on family separation, focused largely on reuniting parents and children who remain apart. It is unclear how many, but about 5,500 children have been identified in court documents as having been separated during Trump's presidency, including about 600 whose parents have yet to be found by a court-appointed committee.The review of border security includes a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexican border cities for hearings in U.S. immigration court. It is a step toward fulfilling a campaign pledge to end the Remain in Mexico policy, known officially as Migrant Protection Protocols, which enrolled nearly 70,000 asylum-seekers since it began in January 2019.The White House said it will “create a humane asylum system” by rescinding or reconsidering Trump policies that caused “chaos, cruelty and confusion.” It warned that it will take time, which may cause grumbling among some pro-immigration advocates.“The situation at the border will not transform overnight, due in large part to the damage done over the last four years.” the White House said in a statement. “But the President is committed to an approach that keeps our country safe, strong, and prosperous and that also aligns with our values.”Roberta Jacobson, a top Biden aide on border issues, asked Spanish-language media on Friday to discourage audiences from coming to the U.S. border. “It is not the moment," she said in Spanish, adding that the journey was “very dangerous, and we are in the middle of creating a new system.”The White House will also do a “top-to-bottom review of recent regulations, policies, and guidance that have set up barriers to our legal immigration system.” It will include a review of Trump's “public charge rule,” which makes it more difficult for people who use government benefits to obtain green cards.The moves demonstrate that, just as Trump remade immigration policies from the White House, Biden can undo them with the stroke of a pen — some more easily than others. On his first day in office, Biden halted work on a border wall with Mexico, lifted a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries and reversed plans to exclude people in the country illegally from the 2020 census. He also ordered efforts to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which has shielded hundreds of thousands of people who came to the U.S. as children from deportation.More lasting changes must pass Congress, a daunting job that Trump and his predecessors Barack Obama and George W. Bush failed to achieve. Also on his first day in office, Biden proposed legislation to give legal status and a path to citizenship to everyone in the country who doesn't have it — an estimated 11 million people.Biden promised far-reaching changes on immigration during his campaign, but it was unclear how quickly he would tackle the lightning-rod issue. His first-day actions delighted and surprised many pro-immigration advocates who are now being asked for patience.It is unclear when Biden will lift bans on many temporary work visas and green cards that took effect after the coronavirus pandemic struck or when he will stop allowing authorities to immediately expel people at the border on public health grounds without an opportunity to seek asylum.Esther Olavarria, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council for immigration, said at a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting last month that an executive order aimed at “restoring sanity at the U.S.-Mexico border” would end the Remain in Mexico policy and agreements that the Trump administration struck with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for the U.S. to reject asylum applicants and instead send them to those Central American countries with an opportunity to seek protection there.Olivarria told the mayors to expect an order that restores the U.S. refugee resettlement program after dramatic cuts under Trump but that measure was not included in Tuesday's announcements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-expands-quick-bid-to-undo-trump-s-immigration-policies-101612261966239.html

02-02-2021||World||Joe Biden tries to show US as democracy beacon post-Capitol riot||Less than two weeks in office, President Joe Biden is facing two critical tests of whether the deadly riot at the US Capitol has damaged America’s standing as a beacon for democracy.Protests in Russia and a military coup in Myanmar come as American credibility on the world stage has plummeted after last month’s storming of the Capitol by a pro-Donald Trump mob looking to stop the certification of Biden’s election victory.That adds to the weight on Biden as he seeks to fulfil a campaign pledge to dramatically reposition the US as a global leader following four years of a Trump foreign policy driven by an “America First” mantra. That policy was marked by the frequent disparagement of democratic allies and the occasional embrace of authoritarian leaders.Biden’s top diplomat, Antony Blinken, acknowledged the difficulty.“I think there’s no doubt that the attack on our own democracy on Jan. 6 creates an even greater challenge for us to be carrying the banner of democracy and freedom and human rights around the world because, for sure, people in other countries are saying to us, ‘Well, why don’t you look at yourselves first?’” the secretary of state said in an interview with NBC News.Blinken added, “The difference, though, between us and so many other countries is that when we are challenged, including when we challenge ourselves — we’re doing it in full daylight with full transparency.”Biden, in the early days of his presidency, has sought to send the message in a series of calls with foreign leaders that America is back.He’s reassured Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga that the US has its support in an ongoing territorial dispute with China over islets in the East China Sea. He's sought to reset the relationship with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was belittled by Trump as “dishonest & weak." And he's told Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that the US would send $4 billion to help development in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — nations whose hardships have spawned tides of migration through Mexico toward the United States.“The United States remains a country in the world that is looked to for leadership,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. “It’s going to take some time, but he’s certainly committed to doing that.”But the crises in Myanmar and Russia present Biden with difficult tests of his promise to reestablish global leadership that are likely to be far more complicated than mending fences with traditional allies.Biden on Monday threatened to slap new sanctions on Myanmar after a coup that saw the military arrest the civilian leaders of its government, calling the episode “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law.”In his first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin as counterparts last week, Biden raised concerns about the detention of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the crackdown on supporters backing his arrest. The mass arrests have only accelerated in the days since the two leaders spoke as protests have continued across the country.“For Putin, he looks at the Capitol riot and sees it as more evidence of his worldview, a continuation of the degradation of liberalism in the world," said Michael McFaul, who served as US ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. “The Biden election doesn't mean much to him about his theory about liberal democracy. Whereas Putin's opponents are very encouraged by the election of President Biden because it shows that American democratic institutions were resilient.”To that end, Navalny's supporters wrote to Biden over the weekend urging him to take meaningful action with sanctions against members of Putin's inner circle to demonstrate that he's serious about reclaiming the US role as a champion of democracy.“Their argument is, If you just sanction a bunch of no-name, low-level colonels ... that’s exactly who Putin is expecting," McFaul said. “They want the Biden administration to sanction the economic actors in the Putin regime, and they’ve made it easy for the Biden administration in they’ve named them all in their seven-page letter."Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chair of the House Intelligence Committee, drew a line from Trump to the coup in Myanmar. Trump had made baseless accusations of widespread voter fraud that were rejected by multiple courts as well as Trump's own Justice Department.An announcement read on Myanmar's military-owned Myawaddy TV explained that the seizure was necessary because the government had not acted on the military’s unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the Southeast Asian nation’s recent elections and because it allowed the election to go ahead despite the coronavirus pandemic.“When America speaks and acts, the world watches, and when our leaders propagate conspiracy theories and subvert democracy here at home, it sets a dangerous example for the rest of the world,” Schiff said.Adversaries such as China, Iran and Venezuela pointed to the Capitol riot as evidence of the fragility of US democracy. Even some allies said the scene was unsettling and has caused them to reconsider the United States' position as the self-proclaimed beacon of democracy.“After something like this, I believe it would be very difficult for the world to see the United States as a symbol of democracy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinskiy said in an interview with “Axios on HBO.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-tries-to-show-us-as-democracy-beacon-post-capitol-riot-101612260315874.html
02-02-2021||World||Covid-19 impact: European economy contracts less than forecast in fourth quarter||The European economy shrank by a smaller than expected 0.7% in the last three months of 2020 as businesses in France and Germany weathered a renewed round of anti-Covid-19 lockdowns somewhat better than expected.That consolation in official figures released Tuesday couldn't erase a gloomier outlook for this year, as the 19 countries that use the euro are expected to lag China and the US in bouncing back from the worst of the pandemic.For the year, the eurozone shrank 6.8%, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.The growth figures underscored a rollercoaster year of freakish economic data, with a plunge of 11.7% in the second quarter, the biggest since statistics started in 1995, followed by a rebound of 12.4% in the third quarter in late summer. The winter wave has meant new restrictions on travel, business and activity, but companies in some sectors such as manufacturing have been better able to adjust than services businesses such as hotels and restaurants.The German economy, Europe's biggest, grew by a scant 0.1% while France saw a smaller than expected drop of 1.3%. Overall, economists had expected a drop in the eurozone of as much as 2.5% as recently as mid-January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-impact-european-economy-contracts-less-than-forecast-in-fourth-quarter-101612260623315.html
02-02-2021||World||Data points to Covid-19 vaccine shortfall for Black Americans||A study out Monday suggested Black Americans had not gotten the coronavirus vaccine at a rate proportionate to their population in the nation.Between December 14 and January 14, nearly 13 million people received at least one injection of the two vaccines authorized in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the country's main federal public health agency.The ethnicity of about half of those patients -- about 6.7 million people -- is known. Of them, only 5.4 percent identified as Black, compared to 60.4 percent who identified as white, 11.5 percent as Hispanic and six percent as Asian.However, the CDC also noted that about 14 percent of those vaccinated self-identified as "multiple" or "other" ethnicities, limiting the possibility of drawing definitive conclusions."More complete reporting of race and ethnicity data at the provider and jurisdictional levels is critical to ensure rapid detection of and response to potential disparities in Covid-19 vaccination," the CDC said.The data was released amid growing concern in the United States about disparities in access to vaccines.In certain regions, vaccination centers are located in predominantly white neighborhoods. The same imbalance can be seen in access to an internet connection needed to make a vaccination appointment.Meanwhile, African-Americans are 2.9 times more likely to be hospitalized due to Covid-19 and 2.1 times more likely to die of the disease, Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to coordinate an equitable response to the coronavirus crisis, said Monday.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the executive branch was paying particular attention to this issue, including "supporting additional venues for vaccinations, targeted (at) reaching those at the highest risk" and calling on states to develop plans for equitable vaccine distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/data-points-to-covid-19-vaccine-shortfall-for-black-americans-101612258716554.html

Canadian diplomat's T-shirt logo angers China||Canada said it regretted a "misunderstanding" after China lodged a formal complaint over a diplomat's order of a custom T-shirt displaying the word Wuhan, the city where the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged, over the emblem of hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan.The logo of the American group is a stylized "W". Reports of the T-shirt order circulating on China's Twitter-like Weibo described it as depicting a bat, without mentioning Wu-Tang Clan. Many scientists suspect bats to have been a reservoir for COVID-19 before it jumped to humans.It was not immediately clear how images of the T-shirt logo, which the Canadian embassy said was created early last year, came to circulate on Chinese social media."We are very shocked by this and have lodged representations with Canada, asking for a thorough investigation and a clear explanation," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in response to a question at a daily briefing on Monday, adding that the virus should not be linked to specific countries or regions.Beijing has been highly sensitive about the source of the virus, and has sought to cast doubt on the notion that it originated in China."The T-shirt logo designed by a member of the Embassy shows a stylized W, and is not intended to represent a bat. It was created for the team of Embassy staff working on repatriation of Canadians from Wuhan in early 2020," a spokesperson for Canada's foreign service told Reuters by email early on Tuesday. "We regret the misunderstanding."Relations between Beijing and Ottawa have been strained since late 2018, when China arrested two Canadian men and accused them of spying, shortly after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.A team led by the World Health Organization is in Wuhan investigating the outbreak's origins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-or-wu-tang-canadian-diplomat-s-t-shirt-logo-angers-china-101612258825969.html
02-02-2021||World||Pakistan SC orders Omar Saeed Sheikh to be moved to govt rest house||Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Tuesday directed authorities to move Omar Saeed Sheikh, one of three terrorists released by India in 1999 in exchange for a hijacked airliner, from his death row cell to a government rest house within two days.A three-judge bench headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial issued the directive when it resumed hearing the Sindh provincial government’s review petition opposing the court’s earlier order of January 28 to release Sheikh and three other men convicted of the abduction and murder of journalist Daniel Pearl.The Supreme Court said proper security arrangements should be put in place at the rest house and Sheikh should not be granted access to mobile phones, the internet or the outside world. It also said Sheikh’s family should be allowed to visit him at the rest house from 8am to 5pm and that he should be permitted to spend Kashmir Day with relatives, according to reports in the Pakistani media.Also Read: Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese stranded as Hong Kong rejects BN (O) passportsPakistan observes Kashmir Day on February 5 every year as a show of support for separatists in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.The Supreme Court’s order to free Sheikh has been criticised by India and the US. The external affairs ministry’s spokesperson described it as a “travesty of justice” and said it reflected the “lack of any seriousness on the part of Pakistan on taking action on terror-related issues”.The matter was the focus of US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s introductory phone call to Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on January 29. Blinken discussed how to “ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh” and the US also called on Pakistan to hand over Sheikh so that he could be prosecuted in America.Pakistan’s Supreme Court is currently hearing the Sindh government’s appeal against its recent order upholding the Sindh high court’s order of December 24 to free Sheikh and the three other convicts. Sheikh is being held in a prison in Sindh province.The Supreme Court again rejected the appeal to suspend the Sindh high court’s order acquitting Sheikh, after Sindh’s advocate general told the bench that Sheikh could escape after his release. The advocate general also said Sheikh was a “mastermind of terrorists” and his accomplices could attack the rest house and help him flee.Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, a member of the bench, asked whether the court should justify what he described as illegal detention. “Is it necessary to keep the accused in jail to prevent them from escaping?” asked Justice Umar Ata Bandial, according to a report by Dawn newspaper.The Supreme Court subsequently adjourned the case indefinitely.Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was a key suspect in the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl. Pearl, 38, was South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was abducted in Karachi in January 2002 while researching links between Pakitani militants and Richard C Reid, known as the “shoe bomber” for trying to detonate a bomb on a flight from Paris to Miami in 2001.It is believed Sheikh played a key role in luring Pearl to Karachi, where he was killed by his captors.Sheikh was arrested in India in 1994 and imprisoned over the kidnapping of one American and three British tourists. He was freed with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814, which was hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-supreme-court-orders-omar-saeed-sheikh-to-be-moved-to-govt-rest-house-101612259313452.html
02-02-2021||World||Chinese police bust counterfeit Covid-19 vaccine ring||Chinese police have arrested more than 80 people who were making counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines, state media said, as China races to inoculate millions before the Lunar New Year holiday.The gang had been putting saline water into vials and selling them as Covid-19 vaccines in an operation that had been running since last September, according to Xinhua news agency.Police swooped on several locations across Beijing and multiple cities in the eastern provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong, seizing "more than 3,000 fake Covid-19 vaccines on the spot," Xinhua said.It has not been made public how many vaccines were sold, but police have traced where the vaccines ended up, it said.China has been racing to develop homegrown jabs and aims to vaccinate 50 million people before the start of the Lunar New Year in mid-February.The holiday normally spurs a travel rush with hundreds of millions traversing the country -- though authorities are encouraging people to stay home this year through a mixture of restrictions and incentives.As China ramps up its vaccine campaign, authorities have repeatedly assured the public of the jab's safety and efficacy, despite not releasing any detailed clinical trial data.State-owned firm Sinopharm's vaccine was approved by Chinese regulators for general use in December.Since the virus emerged in 2019, China has charged thousands of people with crimes related to the pandemic, including spreading "rumours", concealing an infection and not complying with guidelines.The country is also no stranger to vaccine scandals.In 2018, leading vaccine manufacturer Changsheng Bio-Technology was fined $1.3 billion after regulators discovered its vaccines were substandard, which hugely damaged public trust in vaccines at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-police-bust-counterfeit-covid-19-vaccine-ring-101612258773266.html

In line with sensitive locations policy, enforcement operations will not be conducted at or near vaccine distribution sites or clinics, the DHS also said.Biden also plans to restore US asylum protections, strengthen refugee processing and set up a task force to reunify families separated by Trump's border control policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-promises-undocumented-migrants-equal-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-101612256899268.html

02-02-2021||World||12 burning questions about Myanmar military coup. Answered||The military’s coup against Aung San Suu Kyi’s government has knee-capped Myanmar’s democratic transition and undercut its push to attract more foreign investment, particularly from the West. What’s the army’s endgame and how will governments such as the US, Britain and China respond?Bloomberg hosted a Q&A live chat on LINE messenger, where readers got their questions answered. Below is an abridged transcript.What’s happening in Myanmar? Myanmar’s de facto leader, Suu Kyi, and other top political leaders including President Win Myint were detained in a raid on Monday, in an apparent coup. The nation’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized control of the country.Is this a temporary takeover or a permanent military government?The military has said that it is using a state of emergency to take control for one year, promising that it will hold elections afterwards. It is unclear, however, if the pledge is genuine or a ploy to buy time.What was the response from the US?President Joe Biden has said the US could reinstate sanctions on Myanmar if the Southeast Asian country’s military doesn’t “immediately relinquish the power they have seized” in a coup and release activists and officials. What is the military trying to achieve here?While the military had previously committed to transition Myanmar to a democracy, it had never truly relinquished power, retaining authority in the parliament with veto rights and a guaranteed number of seats. Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party in the latter months of their first term moved to give more authority to the civilian government, and the military simply were not buying. By following through on a coup, the military is sending a clear signal that it has no plans to be marginalized in a government it has controlled for decades.Read | Suu Kyi's timeline: Myanmar's most famous political figure detained againWhat are the implications of the coup to the Rohingya?It’s not good news. The thrust of the pushback on the atrocities in Rakhine state came from strong international pressure, which is now squarely focused on the coup. It is unclear what might occur now that the military, which is alleged to have been responsible for genocide there, may do next. It is further worth noting that mobile and internet communications in Rakhine state have been heavily restricted amid accusations from rights groups that the atrocities are ongoing. The military and Suu Kyi’s former government have denied wrongdoing.Where is Suu Kyi and is she safe?According to an official from the National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi and now-former President Win Myint are understood to be under lock and key in their respective homes. Both leaders were detained by the military on Monday.What effects, if any, might Myanmar’s coup have on neighboring countries, such as Thailand?That is unclear. Southeast Asian nations all seem to have a trajectory of their own while many countries like Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia were on a path of democratic backsliding well before Myanmar’s troubles arose. There's no indication that will change or be exacerbated by the coup.How will this coup impact global markets and the global economy?While not a fully globalized nation, the political crisis in Myanmar does threaten to impact a number of companies around the world, ranging from rare-earth miners in China to global oil and gas majors. China’s rare-earth miners dropped on Monday following the coup while some businesses belonging to Yoma Strategic Holdings, a Singapore-based company that invests in a number of Myanmar industries including real estate and food and beverage, had been disrupted due to telecommunications outages. Under the military government, it will be very difficult for investors to know, in the short term, whether they plan to revert to protectionist policies that had worked so well for the elite, even while promising to maintain some form of democracy.What’s China’s role in all of this?China plays an increasingly important role in Myanmar. Chinese President Xi Jinping has a vested interest in dozens of infrastructure projects key to his regional Belt and Road ambitions. During the Rohingya crisis, China was one of the few countries that stood behind the government, and has provided the nation with free Covid vaccines. If it were to support the military government now, it could in fact help to get several stalled projects off the ground.What does this coup mean for Myanmar’s democracy? Will there be elections again?Myanmar’s democracy is still in its infancy. There are varying opinions on whether this is the end of democracy in the country, but that remains to be seen as the military will have to choose what to do with an NLD party that has the overwhelming support of voters. The military has promised to hold fresh polls after a one-year state of emergency.How effective would sanctions be on Myanmar if governments or the UN decide to impose them?It depends on the definition of effective. Global sanctions would devastate the economy and could impact the livelihoods of millions of people. But would they do harm to the military elite or dissuade them from pursuing this course of action? The former is unlikely because the military is well-documented to have vast riches across diverse segments of the local economy — from raising billions mining precious stones to millions more from brewing beer.Other than sanctions, how else can governments pressure Myanmar?Aside from sanctions, it will be tough to pressure the military. For example, during the Rohingya crisis, the West collectively condemned the actions of the military while US sanctions had no impact. The international response proved slow and largely ineffective. It was also left with fewer cards after the private sector largely withdrew investment interest. Western soft power has also taken a hit.

Sheikh is accused of kidnapping and murdering American journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002 and was acquitted by the court last year.Under house arrest, Sheikh will be allowed to meet his family from 8 am to 5 pm. He will be kept under strict surveillance. His access to phones and internet will also be restricted.Pakistan Supreme Court announced the decision while it was hearing an appeal filed by Sindh provincial government against the court's earlier order to release him. Earlier this month, it upheld the acquittal of Omar Sheikh triggering outrage from the United States.

His release was delayed as the Sindh state government and Pearl’s family appealed to the Supreme Court.Lawyers for Pearl's family have argued that Omar Sheikh played a crucial role in organising the abduction and detention of the journalist before ordering his captors to kill him.

Demonstrators affiliated to All Nepal National Free Student Union (ANNFSU) of ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) had scuffled with police as they attempted to organise a flash mob in front of Parliament in Kathmandu.Prior to this, three former Nepali Prime Ministers, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal on Sunday participated in a sit-in-protest at Maitighar of Kathmandu against the dissolution of Parliament.Amongst the trios former Prime Ministers, Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal serve as Chairman of NCP which practically has split after now caretaker PM Oli dissolved the Parliament on December 20 last year.Also Read | Nepal's top court serves contempt notices to beleaguered PM OliNepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the Lower House on Oli's recommendation on December 20. After dissolving the Parliament, the PM also proposed elections on April 30 and May 10, 2021."We will continue our protests and demonstrations till the time, the House of Representatives is reinstated. We will continue this fight till eternity- we will organise sit-in-protests, mass rallies, mass meetings, public meetings, this is an expression of public opinion, their votes and it would continue," Jhalanath Khanal, former Nepali PM had told ANI.Trio former Prime Ministers of Nepal sat on side of the road accompanied by supporters and members of different provincial and upper house assembly protested for an hour against the "unconstitutional" move by Oli.Following the announcement of its third phase of agitation against the dissolution of parliament by the party on January 25, the party has been staging a series of protests and demonstrations across the country.The rival faction of the ruling NCP removed PM Oli from the party, amid increasing political unrest following his decision to dissolve the lower house of the Parliament.According to the rival faction's spokesperson Narayankaji Shrestha, PM Oli no longer remains a member of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-calls-constitutional-council-meeting-amid-ongoing-political-crisis-101612246535996.html
02-02-2021||World||Russia court to weigh jailing Navalny as Putin battles dissent||A Moscow district court is due to decide whether to jail Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny for as long as 3 1/2 years Tuesday, as President Vladimir Putin seeks to crush a resurgence in protests against his rule.The court is to rule on demands by penal authorities and prosecutors that Navalny, 44, serve time instead of the suspended sentence he received for a 2014 fraud conviction, for alleged violations of his probation. Navalny’s supporters have vowed to gather outside the court during the hearing.Navalny was detained in mid-January as he returned from Germany, where he recovered from a near-fatal nerve-agent attack that he and Western governments blamed on Putin’s security service. The Kremlin denies responsibility. A prison term risks escalating the confrontation between the authorities and opposition protesters that has already resulted in thousands of detentions at rallies in dozens of cities nationwide in the last two weekends.The US and the European Union have called on Russia to release Navalny. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his detention “profoundly disturbing” in an interview Sunday with MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.” The EU’s top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, has said he’ll raise the case when he visits Moscow for talks this week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.Riot police were accused of using electric shock devices against some people at the latest protests on Sunday amid allegations of a particularly harsh response. There were 5,646 detentions, adding to nearly 3,600 at Jan. 23 protests, according to the OVD-Info monitoring group.Navalny received the suspended sentence in a fraud trial involving the Russian branch of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher that also led to a 3 1/2 year jail term for his younger brother, Oleg. Both men denied wrongdoing, and the European Court of Human Rights has called the case politically motivated.As well as the threat of a jail term , Navalny also faces possible new fraud charges that could carry an additional 10-year punishment.Putin, 68, has been in power since 2000, the longest rule since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. In July, he pushed through constitutional changes that would allow him to stay as president until 2036. Last year his support fell to a record low amid the Covid-19 downturn, and the continuing slide in incomes is weighing on the Russian leader’s popularity, pollsters say.Gross domestic product contracted 3.1% last year, the biggest slump since 2009, the Federal Statistics Service reported Monday. Still, Russia suffered a smaller decline than most major economies after the government opted not to reimpose a lockdown in the second half of the year.Navalny raised the focus on officials’ opulent lifestyles in a video released after his arrest that got more than 100 million views and alleged that Putin owns a giant $1.3 billion Black Sea palace. Putin dismissed the claim and a billionaire ally, Arkady Rotenberg, said last week that he is the beneficial owner of the residence.While Putin has survived several past outbursts of anti-Kremlin protests, the opposition is digging in for a long-term struggle ahead of 2024, when he must decide whether to seek a fifth presidential term. Backers of Navalny say he’ll become a potent symbol of resistance behind bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-court-to-weigh-jailing-navalny-as-putin-battles-dissent-101612246544892.html

The readout said that he “looked forward to strengthening the bilateral trading relationship and Canada-US supply chains, and avoiding the unintended consequences.” Cooperation between the two North American neighbours in combating the Covid-19 pandemic was also discussed. Climate change also figured on the agenda as did “North American energy security”, shorthand for Trudeau pushing the Biden administration to reverse its decision to cancel permission granted earlier to the contentious Keystone XL Pipeline project.Trudeau has already spoken to Biden twice since he was elected, and the two leaders are expected to meet in person this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-help-free-canadians-held-in-china-harris-assures-trudeau-101612246712742.html
02-02-2021||World||Impeachment case 'undemocratic', ill-advised, says Donald Trump's lawyer||Democrats are using the upcoming Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump as a political “weapon” to bar the former president from seeking office again and are pursuing a case that is “undemocratic” and unconstitutional, one of his lawyers said Monday night.Trump faces trial next week on accusations that he incited a harrowing and deadly siege at the US Capitol on January 6, when a mob of loyalists in town for a rally supporting the president overran the police and stormed the building. The House passed a single article of impeachment against Trump one week before he left office, A trial would allow Democrats to present evidence against Trump and hold him publicly accountable for the attack.However, whether a Senate trial is constitutional is a point of contention because Trump is no longer in office and, if convicted, cannot be removed from an office he doesn't occupy. Democrats point to an 1876 impeachment of a secretary of war who had already resigned and to opinions by many legal scholars. The Senate could vote to bar Trump from holding federal office if he were convicted, which is a goal Democrats support.On the eve of expected legal briefs from lawyers for both sides, Trump attorney David Schoen's appearance on Fox News forecast some of the arguments he plans to make at the trial, calling the case needlessly divisive as well as unconstitutional and undemocratic.“It's also the most ill-advised legislative action that I've seen in my lifetime,” Schoen said.Trump is the first president in American history to be impeached twice. He was acquitted at a Senate trial last year over his contacts with his Ukrainian counterpart. Impeachment, Schoen said, “is the weapon they've tried to use against him.”The new case was an effort to bar Trump from ever running for office again, Schoen said, “and that's about as undemocratic as you can get.”Schoen, a criminal defense and civil rights lawyer, and Bruce Castor, a former county prosecutor in Pennsylvania, were announced as Trump's legal team on Sunday evening, one day after it was revealed that the former president had parted ways with another set of attorneys in what one person described as a mutual decision.In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Schoen said he did not plan to argue that Trump lost the election because of fraud, as Trump has repeatedly insisted, and would instead argue that the trial itself is unconstitutional since Trump has already left office and that his words were protected by the First Amendment and did not incite a riot.House Democrats plan to lay out what happened on January 6 in graphic detail — an effort to get through to Senate Republicans who have largely avoided talking about the attack itself and Trump’s role in it, instead focusing on the process of the impeachment trial. They are expected to play videos and verbally recount the violence of the day in hopes of stirring the Republicans, most of whom fled the Senate that day as the rioters broke in.The nine House impeachment managers who will argue the case also are expected to lay out how they believe Trump’s actions over the previous several months led up to it and eventually incited the insurrectionists to act.Their arguments will include a look at Trump’s “prolonged effort” to persuade his supporters to believe his false claims that the election was stolen — and describe how his pleas for them to come to Washington and his words immediately before the attack directly caused it.The mob that broke into the Capitol as the House and the Senate tallied electoral votes not only ransacked the building but repeatedly called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and for Vice President Mike Pence, who was in the building to preside over the count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-case-undemocratic-ill-advised-says-donald-trump-s-lawyer-101612242354661.html
02-02-2021||World||UK’s Rishi Sunak poised to stick to tax pledges in March 3 Budget||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is sticking to an election promise not to hike taxes on wages and sales next month, rejecting pressure to increase revenue to tackle the record deficit run-up during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a person familiar with the matter.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak‘s budget next month will not raise income tax, national insurance or value added tax after the prime minister was clear he didn’t want to break the pledge, said the person, who was speaking on condition of anonymity because the plans are private.Johnson vowed not to increase the three taxes during his campaign for election in 2019, but the economic damage caused by the pandemic called into question the commitment, which covers the Treasury’s biggest revenue raisers.After almost a decade of austerity, there’s little appetite for spending cuts to shrink a deficit that’s on course to reach 400 billion pounds ($546 billion) this year. That’s put potential tax rises in focus as Sunak prepares to set out plans in his March 3 budget to start restoring the public finances.But the prime minister has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to break the pledge. It was Johnson who persuaded the chancellor to honor the commitment, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified Treasury officials.Both Johnson’s office and The Treasury declined to comment on the plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-rishi-sunak-poised-to-stick-to-tax-pledges-in-march-3-budget-101612242300425.html
02-02-2021||World||China state media celebrates top entrepreneurs. But not Jack Ma||Jack Ma was conspicuously absent from a list of China’s entrepreneurial greats published by state media Tuesday, underscoring how the the iconic Alibaba co-founder has run afoul of Beijing.Ma, lionized at home for creating some of his country’s largest corporations, didn’t make the cut in a Shanghai Securities News front-page commentary lauding the leading lights of technology. Instead, the official Chinese paper held up archrival Pony Ma as “rewriting the mobile age” with Tencent Holdings Ltd. Also on its list were BYD Co. Chairman Wang Chuanfu, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun and Huawei Technologies Co.’s Ren Zhengfei.The brief editorial -- which ran the same day Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is slated to unveil earnings -- may help assuage fears Tencent could get caught up in a broader industry crackdown now focused on Ma’s Alibaba and Ant Group Co. Beijing has launched a campaign to curtail the growing power of private technology corporations in almost every facet of Chinese life, as exemplified by the ubiquity of Tencent’s WeChat messaging service. Shares in Tencent and Xiaomi rose more than 2% Tuesday.Jack Ma’s absence is telling given the Shanghai Securities News is the most important business publication in Alibaba’s backyard. The billionaire made his first public comments in January since disappearing from view late last year, after his now-infamous rebuke of Chinese regulators prompted a backlash that derailed Ant’s record $35 billion initial public offering and spurred an investigation into his e-commerce giant. Much about the future of China’s most recognizable and outspoken businessman remains unclear.“A generation of Chinese entrepreneurs emerged from the rigid structures of our old economic system with the desire to escape poverty and passion to achieve business ambitions,” the newspaper, which is backed by the official Xinhua News Agency, wrote. “They have breathed new life into China’s economic reforms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-state-media-celebrates-top-entrepreneurs-but-not-jack-ma-101612237434343.html

The army had early on Monday seized control of the country and imposed a state of emergency for a year. After seizing power, General Min Aung Hlaing promised a free and fair election and a handover of power to the winning party, without giving a timeframe.The army has also named 11 ministers as replacements to oversee ministries including finance, defence, foreign affairs and interior.Among the people who were arrested in the coup on Monday included a Buddhist monk Shwe Nya War Sayadawa who is known for his outspoken support for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD).

02-02-2021||World||WHO slams critics of Covid-19 origins investigation||The World Health Organization on Monday blasted critics of its investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and challenged those claiming to know better to come forward with the smoking gun.A WHO investigative team is in Wuhan, China -- where the first cases were discovered in December 2019 -- trying to piece together how the virus jumped from animals to humans before going on to kill more than two million people.The UN agency's emergencies director Michael Ryan hit out at those sniping at the mission, and said people claiming they have information on how the pandemic broke out should emerge from the shadows.Ryan said many critics were saying they "won't accept the report when it comes out", or that there is "other intelligence available that may show different findings" on how the virus broke out.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage"If you have the answers... please let us know," Ryan told a press conference from the WHO's headquarters in Geneva.He asked how responsible it was "to say you won't accept a report before it's even written? To say that you have intelligence that has not been provided?"The WHO mission comes with heavy political baggage -- China refused the team access until mid-January and there are question marks over what the experts can hope to find, one year on.Beijing is keen to put the focus on its recovery from the outbreak. The team toured a propaganda exhibition celebrating China's recovery from the pandemic in Wuhan on Saturday.Ryan was responding to a question which referenced new US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who earlier Monday told NBC that China was falling "far short of the mark"."China has to step up and make sure that it is being transparent, that it is providing information and sharing information, that it is giving access to international experts and inspectors," Blinken said."Its failure to do that is a real problem."Ryan said the team in the field deserved international support, and in the meantime, "it's time for people who say and think they have information to start providing it".He added that all infectious disease investigations find information that then throws up further questions."It's a detective story," he said.Virology lab visitThe expert team in Wuhan has now started investigations on the ground, notably visiting the Huanan seafood market where one of the first reported clusters of infections emerged, and the hospital where early patients were treated.Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, said the team would be visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Former US president Donald Trump pushed an unsubstantiated theory that the virus escaped from the facility.The team are having "very productive discussions with Chinese counterparts, visiting different hospitals around Wuhan", Van Kerkhove said."They had a very good visit to the market, seeing first-hand the stalls and walking through."Van Kerkhove said they had also met with counterparts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention."They will visit the Institute of Virology. That is being planned," she added.Meanwhile WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was "encouraging" that the global number of new coronavirus cases had fallen for the third week in a row."It shows this virus can be controlled, even with the new variants in circulation," he said.However, "we have been here before", he warned."Over the past year, there have been moments in almost all countries when cases declined, and governments opened up too quickly and individuals let down their guard, only for the virus to come roaring back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-slams-critics-of-covid-19-origins-investigation-101612234316179.html

02-02-2021||World||US hits pandemic milestone with more vaccinated than cases||More Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine than have tested positive for the virus, an early but hopeful milestone in the race to end the pandemic.As of Monday afternoon, 26.5 million Americans had received one or both doses of the current vaccines, according to data compiled by the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Since the first U.S. patient tested positive outside of Seattle a year ago, 26.3 million people in the country have tested positive for the disease, and 443,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The U.S. has been administering shots at a faster daily rate than any country in the world, giving about 1.34 million doses a day, according to data gathered by Bloomberg. While the rollout stumbled in its early days, in the six weeks since the first shots went into arms almost 7.8% of Americans have gotten one or more doses, and 1.8% are fully vaccinated.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It’s worth noting that today, for the first time, the data said that more people were vaccinated than were reported as newly diagnosed cases,” said Paula Cannon, a professor of microbiology at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. “That’s worth celebrating. I’m all for that win.”Only a few other countries have crossed that milestone: Israel, the U.K. and the U.A.E. beat the U.S. to the more-vaccinations-than-cases line days or weeks ago.After a holiday surge in American cases, officials at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention are calling the top, though that’s likely because of behavioral changes, and still not widespread impact from the vaccine. New Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and emergency-department visits are starting to decline, said Jay Butler, the agency’s deputy director for infectious diseases.“While these trends are encouraging, I want to stress that the numbers nationally are still high, and they’re as high as they’ve been at any point in the pandemic up to this point,” he said at a briefing Friday hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “If this pandemic were a stock, we might be wanting to sell.”It’s still possible for the virus to roar back, particularly if variants that are emerging in South Africa and elsewhere take hold. Studies suggest vaccines, particularly the newer shots from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc., are less potent against that strain and at least one other.The goal is to eventually reach herd immunity, when so many Americans have protection thanks to a vaccine or natural infection that the virus struggles to spread and eventually dies out. Public health officials, including Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor, estimate 70% to 85% of the 330 million Americans must be exposed to the pathogen through virus or vaccine to reach that level.Race for ImmunityWhile past infection can create immunity, it’s not clear how long it lasts. And it comes at a cost -- not just deaths but hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and some who report lingering illness and a baffling array of symptoms, including fatigue, depression and respiratory issues.“There’s a price to pay in suffering and in cost for the health system,” said Alessandro Sette, a professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “It’s protracted and severe.”No deaths, meanwhile, have been conclusively linked to the receipt of a Covid-19 vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s voluntary system for tracking adverse events includes reports of about 290 deaths following the administration of a vaccine against coronavirus as of Jan. 22. Most were in elderly people with other health issues and none were determined to be tied to the immunizations.Questions persist. It’s still not clear exactly how many people have been vaccinated or infected, and it may never be. Many more people have had the virus than tested positive, in particular those with mild or asymptomatic cases.Reported vaccinations are also lower than the number actually given because people are more focused on injecting them into arms than recording the data into tracking systems, Cannon said. Two shots are required for full immunity, which only 5.82 million Americans have received.It’s still early in the immunization effort, which has been beset by a lack of coordination, confusion over who should have access and a shortfall in supply that crimped the number of people who were able to get the shot in the first weeks of the rollout.It’s also important to make sure the right people are getting immunized in order to get the most benefit, said Bill Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins University’s International Vaccine Access Center.“There are a lot of people who are getting vaccinated who aren’t in high risk categories,” he said. “If that’s the case, it’s going to take longer to see a reduction in serious disease and death. Everyone needs a vaccine at some point, but I’m concerned about the inequities in how the system has rolled out.”The emerging variants have created new urgency to increase the pace of vaccinations, said Daniela Weiskopf, a research assistant professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Each time the virus replicates, there’s a chance a variant could emerge.“The faster we interrupt this, the more likely we’re not seeing more variants pop up,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-pandemic-milestone-with-more-vaccinated-than-cases-101612226590681.html
02-02-2021||World||Americans scramble for appointments for second Covid-19 vaccine dose||As more Americans ready for their second Covid-19 vaccine shot, some patients are falling through the cracks of an increasingly complex web of providers and appointment systems.While many people are getting their required second doses, the process is taking a toll on some of the most vulnerable - older adults who in many cases rely on family members or friends to navigate complex sign-up systems and inconvenient locations.Available vaccines need to be given as two separate doses weeks apart, and confusion is further taxing an already challenged health care system. Houston's health department on Friday told those seeking a second dose to be patient, saying the volume of calls was creating long wait times at its call center.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageAs of Monday, 26 million people in the United States had received a first vaccine shot, and almost 6 million had the second, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC has also said states lag in reporting data so it is unclear if that might affect the dose counts.“There's going to be some delay in getting second doses,” said Beth Blauer, Executive Director at the Centers for Civic Impact at Johns Hopkins University, who is tracking vaccination data for the university’s Coronavirus Resource Center.She had expected the number of first doses to plateau as priority populations began to get second doses, but that tapering off was happening slower than expected.“We're still seeing the first dose climb which means that there's going to essentially be an unrealistic expectation that you're going to get your second dose, because we know that there's finite supply.”SECOND SHOT PROCEDURESPractices vary. Seminole County in Florida schedules follow-ups during the 15-minute observation period after people get their first shots. New York's Onondaga County holds off on scheduling second appointments until days before the shot.After an online system showed no appointments, Stacey Champion secured a second appointment for her 78-year-old friend Dan Pochoda at Cardinal Stadium in Phoenix, Arizona - at 1:51 a.m. on Feb. 9. It took several calls to get even that, Champion said."If they had been saving appointments for second doses, would they really need to send people way out to the edges of the city in the middle of the night?" Champion asked.Many providers expect their vaccine allocations to fall sharply this week."When this started, it was only for hospitals. Now a smaller pot needs to be divided between many more - the pharmacies, the mega sites and everyone else," said Felipe Osorno, executive administrator of continuum of care operations and value improvement at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.People in recent days have been showing up at USC hospitals seeking their second vaccine dose, saying their original vaccine provider could not confirm an appointment, Osorno said.On Twitter, concerns about getting the second shot are mixed with triumphant tweets by many who got follow-ups on time, without drama.St. John's Well Child and Family Center, a network of public health centers in South and Central Los Angeles, is running nine vaccination clinics, and began administering second doses on Jan. 25 after sending email and telephone reminders to patients."We screamed and yelled" to secure second doses on top of meeting the need for first shot appointments, said Jim Mangia, the center's president, who added most people are returning.West Virginia, a leader in getting shots into arms, hired critical event management firm Everbridge to manage scheduling as it opens up vaccinations to more groups."Any time there's ambiguity, that's not a good feeling," said Andy Malinoski, marketing director for West Virginia's Department of Commerce.Guidelines call for a second shot of Moderna Inc's vaccine four weeks after the first dose, while the gap is three weeks for the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech vaccine. The CDC has said an interval as long as six weeks is acceptable for either vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-scramble-for-appointments-for-second-covid-19-vaccine-dose-101612226760976.html
02-02-2021||World||Myanmar coup to dampen US trade, impact footwear companies, experts warn||The coup in Myanmar is expected to dampen the interest of US and Western companies in investing in Myanmar, and may prompt some big US companies to pull out, trade experts and analysts said on Monday.Total trade in goods between Myanmar and the United States amounted to nearly $1.3 billion in the first 11 months of 2020, up from $1.2 billion in all of 2019, according to US Census Bureau data.Apparel and footwear accounted for some 41% of total US goods imports, followed by luggage, which accounted for nearly 30%, and fish, which accounted for just over 4%, said Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.Also Read | UN Security Council to hold emergency meet over Myanmar coupLuggage maker Samsonite and privately owned apparel maker LL Bean are among big importers, along with retailer H&M and Adidas, Panjiva said.US imports increased in part due to tariffs on goods from China, but Myanmar still ranked only 84th on the list of US goods suppliers, according to US data.The World Bank reported a 33% jump in total foreign direct investment commitments in Myanmar to $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2019/2020, led by Singapore and Hong Kong, but said the outlook was uncertain due to the pandemic and market developments.U.S. direct investment data was unavailable, the US Trade Representative's office said.Myanmar's army on Monday handed power to military chief General Min Aung Hlaing and imposed a year-long state of emergency, saying it had responded to what it called election fraud.The move sparked condemnation from Western leaders and a threat of renewed sanctions by the US government, and raised questions about the outlook for a million Rohingya refugees.Lucas Myers, analyst with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said the coup would exacerbate strains in US-Myanmar ties following sanctions imposed by Washington in December 2019 and would further complicate trade relations."On trade, the Rohingya situation and Myanmar's troubled human rights record rendered investment less attractive for Western firms as compared with China," Myers said.William Reinsch, trade expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said US companies could opt to pull out of Myanmar, given new developments and the Biden administration's vow to focus more on human rights.While some US companies had moved work from China to Myanmar in recent years to take advantage of lower wages, the country's infrastructure was still lacking, which had kept investment from booming, he added.Most of the US work was in relatively low capital-intensive industries and could be relocated fairly easily, even if doing so would take time, Reinsch said. "It's not semiconductors. These factories are relatively easy to set up."Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said many of the trade group's members did business in Myanmar and found the coup deeply concerning."We urge the full and immediate restoration of democratic rights and institutions," he said. "Our hearts and prayers are with the Myanmar people for a swift, peaceful, and democratic resolution to this crisis – one that does not take away the economic progress made by the hardworking people of Myanmar."A spokesperson for H&M said the company was monitoring events and was in close contact with suppliers, but had no immediate plans to change its sourcing strategy. "We are closely following the developments, but refrain from speculating about what this will mean for us going forward," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-to-dampen-us-trade-impact-footwear-companies-experts-warn-101612226525284.html

Any unused funds will be spent on diversity efforts at Google.The company already conducts annual pay audits, but like other big tech companies, it remains under public scrutiny for a workforce that does not reflect the country's makeup in terms of race and gender.The company said in a statement, "We believe everyone should be paid based upon the work they do, not who they are, and invest heavily to make our hiring and compensation processes fair and unbiased."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-to-pay-3-8-million-to-settle-accusations-of-hiring-pay-biases-101612226398234.html
02-02-2021||World||Covid-19 ICU deaths plunge, but progress may be stalling: study||Covid-19 treatments and improved hospital care have reduced death rates in intensive care by more than a third since the early months of the pandemic, but this progress might be stalling, according to research published Tuesday.Whereas medical staff in the first wave of the epidemic had few insights to help them tackle the new virus, they now have some effective drugs and therapies for treating severely ill patients.A large-scale meta-analysis of overall mortality of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) around the world, published in the journal Anaesthesia, found that it had fallen to 36 percent by October.An earlier analysis by the same authors found that ICU mortality had fallen from 60 percent in late March 2020 to 42 percent at the end of May.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage"After our first meta-analysis last year showed a large drop in ICU mortality from Covid-19 from March to May 2020, this updated analysis shows that any fall in mortality rate between June and October 2020 appears to have flattened or plateaued," the authors said.Researchers looked at data from 52 observational studies involving 43,128 patients.The studies were from Europe, North America and China -- areas included in the earlier analysis -- as well as reports from the Middle East, South Asia and Australia.Pressure from new variantsThe authors said that hospitals now have much more knowledge about what works -- and what does not.In particular, medics now can use steroids like dexamethasone to improve the survival chances of seriously ill patients on oxygen support. Strategies for oxygen therapy, fluid therapy and management of blood clotting have all evolved since the early days of the pandemic.But with several new variants of the coronavirus emerging in the months since the end of their analysis, they said ICUs may come under further pressure.British scientists recently warned that the variant that emerged there was not only more transmissible, but could also be more deadly.Peter Horby, who leads the Recovery trial that provided the evidence for the use of dexamethasone, said recently however that the drugs should continue to work equally well with the new variants. This is because they act on the body's immune response, not the virus itself.Horby, professor of emerging infectious disease at Oxford University, said overall improvements in therapies and treatments have brought down case fatality rates since the first wave and could even "offset any difference with this new variant".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-icu-deaths-plunge-but-progress-may-be-stalling-study-101612226037382.html

White House not preoccupied with former president||To hear the new White House spokeswoman tell it, Joe Biden's team doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about former president Donald Trump -- and they certainly don't miss him on Twitter.White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked at the daily briefing on Monday whether Trump's banishment from Twitter makes it easier for Biden to negotiate a Covid-19 relief package with Congress."This may be hard to believe," Psaki told reporters. "We don't spend a lot of time talking about or thinking about president Trump here -- former president Trump to be very clear."I think that is a question that's probably more appropriate for Republican members (of Congress) who are looking for ways to support a bipartisan package and whether that gives them space," she said."But I can't say we miss him on Twitter," Psaki added.Asked whether Biden favored Trump's continued ban from his favorite messaging platform, Psaki said "that's a decision made by Twitter.""We've certainly spoken to and he's spoken to the need for social media platforms to continue to take steps to reduce hate speech," she said.Twitter banned Trump in the wake of the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by his supporters, citing a "risk of further incitement of violence."The decision was condemned by supporters of the former president but also by some free speech advocates who voiced concern about the power of social media companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-who-white-house-not-preoccupied-with-former-president-101612225869647.html

02-02-2021||World||Myanmar coup tests Biden democracy push but with few options||Myanmar's military coup marks an early test case of President Joe Biden's determination to advocate democracy but, unlike a decade ago when the United States nurtured a transition there, he has limited options.The rise of democracy in Myanmar had initially been hailed as a key achievement of former president Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as number two, representing an opening of a long-closed nation that had been in rival China's orbit.But Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's civilian leader who was detained with others Monday, had been rapidly losing Western support as the Nobel laureate stayed reticent -- some argue so as not to antagonize the military -- about a brutal campaign against the mostly Muslim Rohingya minority.Also Read | Aung San Suu Kyi detained as army grabs power in MyanmarBiden in a forceful statement Monday warned of a return of sanctions and steadfastly backed the principle of democracy -- in line with his campaign promises as he vowed to turn the page from his predecessor Donald Trump, who praised autocrats and unsuccessfully tried to overturn his own election defeat."The United States will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack," Biden said, demanding that the military in the nation also known as Burma "immediately relinquish the power they have seized."Less US leverageDerek Mitchell, the first US ambassador to Myanmar after the opening, said the United States no longer enjoyed the same leverage."I think the Rohingya crisis set things back substantially -- for good reason, obviously, in that we had to speak out and act against the kind of genocide that occurred -- but that came at the expense of relationships," he said.Mitchell, now president of the National Democratic Institute, urged coordination with US allies and said that the world needed to respect the overwhelming victory of Suu Kyi's National League of Democracy in last year's elections.The West "may have considered her this global icon of democracy and that luster is off. But if you care about democracy in the world, then you must respect the democratic choice and she is clearly that.""It's not about the person; it's about the process," he said.In a growing rarity in Washington, Myanmar policy has wide bipartisan consensus with Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, long a vocal supporter of Suu Kyi.Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Biden administration should resist immediately imposing sanctions -- a nearly daily tool of the United States under Trump -- and try diplomacy."Myanmar is an unexpected early test for the Biden administration, which has emphasized human rights and democracy as cornerstones of US foreign policy," she said."Quickly dispatching a senior envoy to Naypyidaw carrying rare bipartisan congressional backing would be an appropriate next step," she said, referring to Myanmar's 15-year-old capital.Complex role of ChinaWhen Myanmar began its democratic transition, the United States -- led by secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who paid a landmark visit in 2011 -- coaxed reformists within the junta with promises of economic engagement, sanctions relief and an alternative for highly nationalist rulers to reliance on China.The United States has less to offer a military chief whose ambitions led him to turn his back on a decade of change.Myanmar's top general and coup leader, Min Aung Hlaing, is already under US travel and financial sanctions for the campaign against the Rohingya, which the United States has described as ethnic cleansing."It's easy to make statements but hard to figure out what to do next" said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies."What more do you do? I guess you can sanction a few military companies. That might bring a little pressure because they are so deeply burrowed into so many sectors of the economy," he said.Key nations with which the United States could coordinate are Japan and India, close US partners that enjoy warm relations with Myanmar, with New Delhi days earlier shipping 1.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine.China also developed cordial ties with Myanmar's civilian leadership, which appeared more interested in Beijing's massive Belt and Road infrastructure-building blitz than the insular and sometimes paranoid generals."One thing that is ironic is that I think China actually had much better relations with Aung San Suu Kyi than they are going to have with the military," Hiebert said.But with the West set to tighten the screws, Myanmar's new junta may have no choice but to lean on China.Biden has promised a renewed focus on its allies and many in Southeast Asia have been eager to see Washington as a hedge against Beijing."What happened in Myanmar just instantly makes that more difficult," Hiebert said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-tests-biden-democracy-push-but-with-few-options-101612225091146.html

On the contrary, you are the ones who repair broken hearts."'Inciting hatred'Rights groups accuse Erdogan of taking the mostly Muslim but officially secular country on an increasingly socially conservative course during his 18 years in power.Homosexuality has been legal throughout modern Turkey's history.But gay people often face harassment, and LGBT events -- including Istanbul Pride -- have been blocked under Erdogan.Turkey was hit by a wave of student protests last month after Erdogan appointed a loyalist as the head of Bogazici University.During one demonstration last Friday protesters hung an artwork opposite the new rector's office depicting the holy site in Mecca and images of the LGBT movement's rainbow flag.Turkish police accused four people of "inciting hatred in the population". Two of them have been remanded in custody and the other two placed under house arrest.Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu branded the suspects "four LGBT freaks".Groups of students once again demonstrated at Bogazici university on Monday despite the presence of hundreds of riot police, demanding the four be freed and the rector stand down.AFP reporters saw several students dragged away by the police and Istanbul's governor later confirmed 159 people had been arrested.Further afield in the Aegean resort city of Izmir, social media posts showed police scuffling with a small group of rainbow flag-waving students.The rallies have echoes of the 2013 protests that sprang up against plans to demolish an Istanbul park before spreading nationally and presenting a direct challenge to Erdogan's rule.Erdogan last month accused some of those taking part in the student demonstrations of being "terrorists".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkeys-erdogan-hits-out-at-lgbt-youth-as-police-break-up-fresh-protest-101612224817496.html

Polish police raided discos that defied restrictions on Saturday, using stun grenades and tear gas to clear dance floors.In the Netherlands, Amsterdam police cleared out the city’s museum square after some 600 people gathered there for an illegal protest. Thousands of people marched through the Austrian capital Vienna to protest coronavirus restrictions there, ignoring a police ban on the march, with many shunning masks and social distancing. The march was organised by the far-right Freedom Party of Austria.In Brazil, protestors marched in several cities on Sunday to condemn President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the crisis.The emergence of the new variants has further complicated the fight against the coronavirus.

02-02-2021||World||Aung San Suu Kyi detained as army grabs power in Myanmar||Myanmar’s military seized power in a bloodless coup on Monday, detaining democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and imposing a one-year state of emergency.The intervention ended a decade of transition from outright military rule in Myanmar, with the generals justifying the power grab by alleging fraud in the November elections that Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party won in a landslide.Suu Kyi and President Win Myint were detained in the capital Naypyidaw before dawn, party spokesman Myo Nyunt told AFP, just hours before parliament was meant to reconvene for the first time since the elections. Later, Myanmar state television announced the removal of 24 of Suu Kyi’s ministers, and 11 new appointments.The military sealed off roads around the capital with armed troops, trucks and armoured personnel carriers. Military helicopters flew across the city.The military declared, via its own television channel, a one-year state of emergency and announced that former general Myint Swe would be acting president for the next year.Also read: Min Aung Hlaing, the military chief who engineered the coupIt alleged “huge irregularities” in the November polls that the election commission had failed to address. “As the situation must be resolved according to the law, a state of emergency is declared,” the announcement said. The army later pledged to hold fresh elections after the year-long state of emergency.Suu Kyi had issued a pre-emptive statement ahead of her detention calling on people “not to accept a coup”, according to a post on the official Facebook page of her party’s chairperson.The military moved quickly to stifle dissent, severely restricting the internet and mobile phone communications across the country.India expresses concern, China has muted reactionIndia expressed deep concern at the developments in Myanmar, as the US and several other countries called for restoration of democracy.“We have noted the developments in Myanmar with deep concern. India has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. We are monitoring the situation closely.”The US was swift to react to the news, with secretary of state Antony Blinken calling for the release of Suu Kyi and thers detained by the military. “We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections on November 8,” Blinken said in a statement.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the European Union, UK and Australia also condemned the coup.China’s response, however, was more muted. “We hope that all sides...can appropriately handle their differences,” a foreign ministry spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aung-san-suu-kyi-detained-as-army-grabs-power-in-myanmar-101612205026821.html

That progress should be respected,” Biden said in the statement.“We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burma’s democratic transition.” In response to a question at the daily news briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to elaborate what actions could be taken on Myanmar. She added that Biden’s statement about the coup in Myanmar is directed at all countries in the region, when asked if it was directed at China.The president’s statement had said, the United States “will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack.”The US had removed economic sanctions on Myanmar in 2016.Biden also called for the international community to “come together in one voice to press the country’s military to immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained, lift all telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against civilians”. Secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed “grave concern and alarm” over the situation in a separate statement. “We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections on November 8,” Blinken said. “The United States stands with the people of Burma in their aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace, and development. The military must reverse these actions immediately.”On Sunday, the White House had put out a statement saying the United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar’s democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed.

02-02-2021||World||Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna condemns vandalisation of Gandhi statue||Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna on Monday strongly condemned the vandalisation of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the US state of California, calling it as a shameful act.The 6-ft tall, 650-pound (294 kg) bronze statue of Gandhi in the Central Park of the City of Davis in Northern California was vandalised, broken and ripped from the base by unknown miscreants early this week.“Nonviolent, respectful protest was the essence of Gandhi’s life mission. To see the desecration of this magnificent statue only underscores the need for more people to study Gandhi’s teachings, not unilaterally erase him from the public discourse,” Khanna said.“This was a shameful act. At a moment in our history when disagreement needs to be managed with tolerance and patience, I urge everyone involved to take the time to listen and talk instead of resorting to acts of public vandalism,” he said.As the Democratic Vice Chair of the India Caucus, Khanna said he will continue to work with his colleagues to build bridges across these divisions.“I encourage everyone to join me in working through disagreement with dialogue and discussion, rather than resorting to violence that tears at the fabric of our society,” he said.Meanwhile, two groups gathered at the park in Davis on Sunday where the statue was vandalized, local media reported. While one group demanded that the statue be restored, the other opposed such a move.The City of Davis has launched an investigation into the incident.“The City of Davis condemns the vandalism that destroyed the statue of Mahatma Mohandas Gandhi in Central Park. We do not support any actions that include the destruction of property,” the city said in a statement on Sunday.“We understand that our community reflects a diversity of views and values, but we expect that everyone will extend respect to each other and to shared spaces," it said.“But we reiterate our belief that the solution to solving such differences is never in violent acts but through compromise and dialogue. It is our sincere desire that our community move forward with peaceful and positive discourse and reconciliation,” the city said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-congressman-ro-khanna-condemns-vandalisation-of-gandhi-statue-101612204075981.html
02-02-2021||World||Trump finds new defence lawyers for Senate impeachment trial||Former US president Donald Trump has announced new lawyers to defend him in the impeachment trial set to start on February 9, in place of those who left abruptly over the weekend.Trial lawyers David Schoen and Bruce L Castor Jr will head the defence team, Trump’s office announced on Sunday evening, a day after the departure of five leading members of the team reportedly over differences of opinion on the defence strategy.The announcement said the new defence team will argue “this impeachment is unconstitutional”. The earlier lawyers had left reportedly because the former president had pressed them to argue he had lost the election because of fraud, a lie that Trump, his lawyers and allies had failed to establish through more than 60 lawsuits and multiple requests for vote recounts and audits.Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on January 13, for inciting supporters to storm the US Capitol to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying the electoral victory of President Joe Biden. He became thus the only US president to be impeached twice.Also read: Trump impeachment defence lawyers quit ahead of Senate trialTrump is also the first US president to face impeachment trial after leaving office. The Senate, which is evenly divided but controlled by Democrats with the tie-breaking vote of vice-President Kamala Harris, will determine his fate in a trial starting February 9.“It is an honour to represent the 45th President, Donald J Trump, and the United States Constitution,” Schoen said.And Castro added, “I consider it a privilege to represent the 45th President. The strength of our Constitution is about to be tested like never before in our history. It is strong and resilient. A document written for the ages, and it will triumph over partisanship yet again, and always.”They will go up against nine Democratic members of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives appointed Impeachment managers to prosecute the case in the Senate, whose 100 members will act as jurors. The proceedings will be presided by Patrick Leahy, a Democratic senator.At least 17 of the evenly split Senate Republicans will have to vote with 50 Democrats to meet the threshold of two-thirds needed to convict the former president. A conviction will bar him from holding any federal office ever, effectively shutting down another run for the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-finds-new-defence-lawyers-for-senate-impeachment-trial-101612160367411.html

02-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand: ‘Anti-national’ posts to hit passport clearance||Dehradun Applying for a passport in Uttarakhand? Well, you’d better not have made what the state’s top policeman termed “anti-national posts” on social media. Applying for a gun licence in Uttarakhand? See answer above. At a time when comments and posts seen as critical of the government are seen as anti-national, the comments of Ashok Kumar, the hill-state’s DGP have caused a stir. They were made on Tuesday, the concluding day of state Police Officers Conference held at police headquarters in Dehradun. “Until now, in cases of any person putting up any anti-national posts on social media, the police used to counsel them. A case was registered only if it was a very serious case,” he added. Under the new approach, he said, ”the police would scrutinise social media accounts to check if they were habitual posters of anti-national posts”. Those identified as such would see the police not signing off on their so-called police verification -- mandatorily required for passports or arms licences. A second police officer said the police took the decision to combat “an increase in the number of people putting anti-national posts on social media in the state.”“The number of such posts on social media platforms have increased which is a clear threat to the law and order.” Lawyers believe the move is an “infringement” of an individual’s freedom of expression. Kartikeya Gupta, senior lawyer at Uttarakhand High Court, said: “It is a complete infringement of an individual’s freedom expression. Police has no right to decide whether any post on social media is anti-national or not; it is the job of the courts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-anti-national-posts-to-hit-passport-clearance-101612289325781.html

Joshi said that the opposition parties were obstructing important discussions with their sloganeering. The Lok Sabha session was adjourned thrice on Tuesday as opposition leaders from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Congress raised slogans demanding a total repeal of the farm laws passed in the previous session.“In the last session, when a decision was taken to not hold Question Hour due to pandemic they said it was the murder of democracy. Now when it is being conducted, they're obstructing. I appeal to them to hold discussions in Parliament,” Joshi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier in the day, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told parliamentarians from opposition parties that the government is ready to hold discussions on the farm laws both ‘inside and outside Parliament.’ He said, “If members are ready to discuss the laws and issues related to farmers, the government is ready for debate inside and outside parliament. Had you started discussing and debating, half of the discussion would have completed by now.”Proceedings in the Rajya Sabha were also adjourned for the day as members of opposition parties protested against the implementation of the farm laws and demanded discussions regarding the violence that erupted during the tractor rally on January 26.Farmers are agitating since November last year against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The farmers’ groups believe that these three laws will affect the procurement under the Minimum Support Price system and allow private and multinational companies to make profits off farmers as it will encourage corporate farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-obstructing-important-discussions-joshi-101612288545913.html

02-02-2021||India||Action on old vehicles, traffic congestion in Delhi's plan against air pollution||The task of curbing air pollution in Delhi will now require even state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana to report action taken against polluting diesel and petrol vehicles that are over 10/15 years old once in every two months to the Commission on Air Quality Management, the body set up by the Central government to curb pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas.This was stated by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in an affidavit submitted before the top court during the hearing of a set of petitions dealing with air pollution in Delhi.The affidavit highlighted the steps taken by the broad-based Commission having representatives from states adjoining Delhi along with representatives from Central ministries and representatives of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state pollution control authorities.The Commission, appointed in November 2020, identified five focus areas while tackling the issue of pollution in Delhi-NCR. These included industrial pollution, agricultural stubble burning, municipal solid waste management and biomass burning, construction and demolition activities and vehicular pollution.During the interactions with representatives from Delhi and neighbouring states, the Commission noticed lack of enforcement against polluting, over-aged vehicles not just in Delhi but in neighbouring districts of the national capital. The neighbouring states also did not have a traffic management plan in place to tackle vehicular pollution.Also read: CAA rules are under preparation - Govt tells Lok SabhaThe affidavit said, “It was strongly reiterated that such overaged petrol/diesel vehicles more than 15/10 years of age, must not be allowed to ply in NCR at any cost and if found doing so, shall be taken off the roads immediately.”Accordingly, the Sub-Committee on “Safeguarding and Enforcement” working under the Commission on January 8 this year, prepared a reporting format to be submitted by Delhi and adjoining states every two months. This format has details about over-aged vehicles impounded, traffic congestion spots identified and resolved, new pollution under control (PUC) centres added, existing and proposed car parking facilities, and additional CNG fuelling stations.On industrial polluting units, the Commission examined nearly 6,642 units operating in Delhi-NCR, of which 3,138 were found to be using clean fuel (CNG/PNG). The Commission set a deadline of January 31 for remaining 2,904 units (Haryana -2220, UP- 420, Rajasthan-151) to convert to clean fuel.On stubble burning, the affidavit said that the Commission’s focus was on crop residue management by which the paddy straw, that is usually burnt, could be cut using farm machinery and used by other industries as the source of fuel. The affidavit said, “Stubble burning and pollution arising therefrom is a major area of concern, particularly during the months of October-November… The Commission identified Crop Residue Management as one of the priority areas.”To facilitate this, the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmer Welfare, under the Central government, has developed an app-based aggregator platform for hiring and renting of farm machinery required for stubble cutting. The app called FARMS (Farm Machinery Solutions) has nearly 1.47 lakh individual farmers and over 22,000 custom hiring centres (CHC) across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh. Nearly 1.58 lakh machines have been supplied to individual farmers and CHCs through the app and other financial incentive schemes, the affidavit stated.Though the issue of stubble burning affects the quality of air in Delhi during the winter months, the Commission is focusing on crop residue management as a technique to curb stubble burning incidents. The top court has expressed concerns over stubble burning after a public interest litigation (PIL) filed before the Court pointed out that pollution caused by stubble burning can impact mortality rate due to the coronavirus disease.In 2020, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh reported a decline in stubble burning incidents but Punjab reported a 15 per cent increase. In Haryana last year, 5,000 farm fires were reported as compared to 6,652 in 2019. Punjab reported 76,590 farm fires as against 52,991 in 2019.On Tuesday, the apex court took up the PILs on stubble burning and air pollution in Delhi but adjourned the matter after two weeks. The Centre’s affidavit will be examined by the Court on the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/action-on-old-vehicles-traffic-congestion-in-delhi-s-plan-against-air-pollution-101612286706178.html
02-02-2021||India||RJD, NCP hold alliance talks with TMC to fight BJP in Bengal assembly polls||Top leaders of Bihar's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Maharashtra's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) held talks with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership on Monday and agreed to form an alliance against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Bengal assembly polls due in March-April.RJD national general secretary Shyam Rajak met Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee in Kolkata. TMC’s senior Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy held talks with NCP founder and former Union minister Sharad Pawar in Delhi. Pawar also spoke to Mamata Banerjee over phone.“I met Abhishek Banerjee and we agreed on one agenda - the BJP has to be defeated in Bengal. That is our only goal,” Rajak told HT after returning to Patna on Tuesday evening. “We did not discuss the issue of seat sharing in the first round of talks. That can take place later. We will be frequenting Bengal from now on,” he added. The RJD also held a workers’ meeting in Kolkata on Sunday.Roy said he was very happy that regional parties have offered their support to the TMC.“Pawar and I had a round of talks on Monday. He is in touch with Mamata Banerjee. The NCP’s Darjeeling district unit will hold a meeting on Wednesday,” said Roy.The Samajwadi Party (SP), the main opposition force in Uttar Pradesh, is also eager to form an alliance with the TMC, Roy said. “Akhilesh Yadav may visit Kolkata. This is a hopeful sign. A consensus is emerging that the BJP needs to be stopped,” said Roy.SP vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda, who served as fisheries minister in the Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments when his West Bengal Socialist Party merged with Yadav’s party, is in Kolkata since last week.HT reported on January 31 that while Mamata Banerjee is trying to consolidate anti-BJP votes, top parties from the Hindi heartland have geared up to enter the race, raising the possibility of a split in votes cast by Hindi-speaking and tribal people. The advantage of such a division, no matter how small, may help the TMC in some regions, feel political experts and TMC leaders.The BJP says it will win more than 200 of the state’s 294 seats while election strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by Banerjee in 2019 after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, has announced on social media that he will leave his profession if the BJP bags more than 99 seats.Against this backdrop, Bihar’s ruling party, the Janata Dal (United) and Jharkhand’s ruling party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena have also geared up to contest the Bengal polls either in alliance with local parties or, as independent forces. JD(U) and Sena leaders told HT last week that they will contest with an anti-BJP agenda.Though all these parties contested a few seats in Bengal in the past without much success, this time around, the electoral dynamics is significant because of the deep inroads made by the BJP which Banerjee has branded as “a party of outsiders” while simultaneously making efforts to reach out to Hindi-speaking voters. Bengal has a substantial number of Bihari voters.Last Thursday, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren addressed his first rally at Jhargram, a district with a high tribal population. In the adjoining districts, the BJP won the Lok Sabha seats of Purulia, Bishnupur and Midnapore in 2019. Tribal people constitute a sizable chunk of voters in these seats. Soren spoke against the Centre in his speech.Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay said the TMC will benefit from the voices of these regional parties and that will matter more than the votes these parties may get in the bi-polar election.The BP shrugged off the NCP and the RJD as nonentities in Bengal"The NCP and RJD are nonentities in Bengal. This is a bi-polar contest between TMC and BJP. Banerjee's efforts are exposing the dichotomy in the TMC. On one hand, ruling party leaders call the BJP a party of Hindi-speaking outsiders while on the other they seek help from regional forces. As far as RJD is concerned, one must remember that its leader Laloo Prasad Yadav was put in jail in the fodder scam case by the then CBI joint director Upen Biswas who was later made a minister by Banerjee when she came to power in 2011," said Samik Bhattacharya BJP's chief spokesperson in Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-ncp-hold-alliance-talks-with-tmc-to-fight-bjp-in-bengal-assembly-polls-101612285214711.html

The state government can frame a law. In the past, doubts were raised during the elections (about EVM tampering)."Voting is a fundamental right and one should have the option of casting vote using ballot papers or EVM, he said.Several parties, including the Congress, had in the past urged the Election Commission to revert to the ballot paper system, alleging tampering of EVMs in polls.Representing the applicant on Tuesday, advocate Satish Uke said it is the right of voters from the state to have the option of casting their votes via ballot paper as well.According to the statement, he said it should be left to people to decide whether EVMs or ballot papers are trustworthy and it is the legislature's responsibility to frame a law keeping in mind public sentiments.Several opposition parties across the country have in the past alleged tampering of EVMs and demanded reverting to the ballot paper system.However, the BJP had previously hit out at the opposition parties for raising doubts over the credibility of EVMs.In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are in power under the aegis of the Maha Vikas Aghadi, while the BJP is in the opposition in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-speaker-patole-calls-for-law-for-using-ballot-paper-in-polls-101612280682160.html

02-02-2021||India||Eviction of homeless people in Indore reunites couple||The eviction of homeless people to the city’s outskirts which became a major embarrassment for the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), brought happiness for a woman who reunited with her husband after 15 days.A resident of Damodar Nagar, Pushpa Salvi, 52, found her missing 55-year-old mentally unstable husband on Sunday after a municipal officer called her. “My husband went missing on January 3. I searched for him a lot but didn’t find him. I lodged a complaint with police on January 15 but police also failed to locate him,” Pushpa Salvi said.“On January 30, I got a call from a person who introduced himself as an officer of IMC. He asked me my husband’s name and his whereabouts. When I told him that he was missing, he told me that he was at Nipaniya’s by-pass. I hired a taxi and the officer directed the driver to the exact location,” said Salvi.She said that when she reached the site she found about six people including her husband sitting on the ground. “The IMC officials at the site allowed me to take my husband with me. I took him to a hospital for a health check-up. The doctor allowed him to go home on Monday,” said Salvi.Salvi said, “I came to know later that my husband was one of the victims, who were dumped outside the city by IMC officials.”The IMC had come under fire on Saturday after a video went viral showing municipal employees dropping elderly homeless people from a truck near Shipra village of the district. After villagers objected to such callous behavior, the IMC employees were seen herding the people back in the truck“If the villagers had not opposed the act of IMC officials of dumping elderly homeless people, I might have lost my husband for forever. IMC officials tried to locate the family members of these people including my husband after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took action against them,” Salvi added.Chandan Nagar police station town inspector Yogesh Tomar said Salvi’s husband became mentally unstable after an accident a few years ago“I am happy that Pushpa Salvi found her husband. The woman works as a daily wage earner and used to live alone with her husband. Her husband was injured in an accident a few years ago and became mentally ill,” said the police officer.Despite repeated attempts, IMC commissioner Pratibha Pal could not be contacted for comment.Following the outrage over the dumping of the elderly homeless people, the chief minister suspended IMC deputy commissioner Pratap Singh Solanki and sacked two contractual employees.The Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission (MPHRC) has also sought a report from the state's chief secretary, Indore divisional commissioner, district collector and IMC chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eviction-of-homeless-people-in-indore-reunites-couple-101612283491719.html

The Rules under The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) are under preparation. The Committees on Subordinate Legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have granted extension of time upto 09.04.2021 and 09.07.2021 respectively to frame these rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA),” Rai said in the Lok Sabha while replying to a question regarding the implementation of CAA.The act allows persecuted minorities belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to avail Indian citizenship. People belonging to these communities who arrived in India till December 31, 2014, due to religious persecution in these three countries will not be treated as illegal migrants but will be provided with Indian citizenship. President of India Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the legislation on December 12, 2019.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that CAA will ensure that persecuted minorities will get access to a secure future while speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in 2019 and assured that the law will not snatch anyone’s citizenship. Union home minister Amit Shah has also on several occasions said that CAA is meant to give persecuted minorities a chance towards living a dignified life.Opposition parties and several groups have protested against the implementation of CAA. CAA’s detractors believe that the law coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise is intended to target Muslims living in India. Several protests were held against CAA last year and agitation in northeast Delhi turned violent and spiralled into communal riots on February 24, 2020. More than 50 people died and 200 people were injured in the riots. Uttar Pradesh also witnessed riots and clashes between anti-CAA protesters and police officials at the beginning of 2020.The announcement made by Rai comes at a time when Assam and West Bengal is preparing to hold elections. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during its campaign in both states have promised on several occasions to implement the CAA and NRC to resolve the issue of illegal migrants in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-rules-are-under-preparation-govt-tells-lok-sabha-101612282653469.html

02-02-2021||India||Supreme Court says, offence under Prevention of Corruption Act is against society||Offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act are “offences against the society”, the Supreme Court Tuesday said while setting aside the Gujarat High Court verdict which had acquitted an accused in a graft case.The apex court, which observed that there was no re­-appreciation of entire evidence on record in detail while acquitting the accused, said the matter deserves to be remanded to the high court to consider it afresh in accordance with law.“The high court ought to have appreciated that it was dealing with the offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act which offences are against the society. And therefore, the high court ought to have been more careful and ought to have gone in detail. We do not approve the manner in which the high court has dealt with the appeal,” a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said.“The impugned judgment and order dated January 12, 2015…..passed by the high court acquitting the accused for the offences under the Act for which he was tried is hereby quashed and set aside. The appeal before the high court is restored to its original file,” it said.The bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, delivered the judgement on an appeal filed by state of Gujarat against the January 2015 verdict of the high court.The high court had acquitted the accused for the offences under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act by setting aside the trial court verdict.The trial court had convicted the accused, who was working as assistant director in ITI Gandhi Nagar, for the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act and awarded him five years imprisonment along with a fine of ₹10,000.While setting aside the high court verdict, the apex court said, “The approach of the high court in dealing/non-­dealing with the evidence was patently illegal leading to grave miscarriage of justice.”“Therefore, we are of the firm opinion that the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court acquitting the respondent–accused without adverting to the reasons given by the trial court while convicting the accused and without re-appreciating the entire evidence on record in detail cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-says-offence-under-prevention-of-corruption-act-is-against-society-101612282400506.html

Uttarakhand police won’t verify passport||Uttarakhand police will now scrutinise social media behaviour of those putting “anti-national” posts on such sites and may not clear verification for passport or arms licence if they are found to doing it habitually, state director general of police Ashok Kumar said on Tuesday."Till now, in case a person was putting anti-national posts or fake news on social media, the police used to counsel him and ask him not to repeat it in future. A case was registered only if it was a very serious case," Kumar said."From now onwards, the police will scrutinise the accused's social media behaviour to check if he is habitually putting such anti-national posts. If it is found so, then the police would mention it in his/her police verification and may not clear in his application for passport or arms license," he said on the concluding day of state police officers’ conference held at police headquarters in Dehradun.The development was among other measures discussed by the police officers during the conference to improve policing in the state."The decision was taken as there has been an increase in people putting anti-national posts on social media in the state," said another police officer privy to the development."The social media monitoring team has been keeping a strict eye to track down such people. It was found that the number of such posts on social media platforms has increased, which is a clear threat to law and order," the officer said.However, the legal experts have termed the move as an infringement of an individual's freedom of expression.Senior lawyer at Uttarakhand High Court, Kartikeya Gupta said, "It is a complete infringement of an individual's freedom expression. Police has no right to decide whether any post on social media is anti-national or not as it is the job of the courts."Gupta added, "Police cannot pass such a gag order.

02-02-2021||India||Bhubaneswar civic body destroys heritage structures around Lingaraj temple||Bhubaneswar’s municipal corporation has razed portions of a heritage complex around Lingaraj temple in the Odisha capital to create more space for devotees to pray on Shivratri next month at the 11th-century shrine, conservation group Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has said after an inspection by its eight-member team.Noted historian Anil Dhir, who led the INTACH team, said the municipal corporation’s action in the heritage zone, ostensibly part of a beautification attempt, was carried out in violation of the law governing archaeological sites and without the approval from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).Dhir said the corporation team even used mechanical equipment such as jackhammer drills in the sensitive heritage zone. “It was pathetic… We saw evidence of vandalism”.The historian said it is standard practice to carry out a ground-penetrating radar survey to image the subsurface before any construction or demolition at a heritage zone. This wasn’t done and has led to damage to the heritage structures.The state government wanted to use the area for peripheral development of Lingaraj temple under their Ekamra Kshetra Heritage project in the Old Town area of Bhubaneswar. The Ekamra Kshetra Heritage Project, announced in December 2019 by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, envisaged comprehensive developmental work near the Lingaraj temple.A portion of the area that has been demolished near Suka-Sari temple over ṭhe last few months is likely to be developed into an open prayer site for devotees of Lord Lingaraj during Shivratri.BMC commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury was dismissive of INTACH’s concerns. The demolition was done on private land and the corporation did not bulldoze its way through as is being alleged. "Who is the person levelling the allegation?... In any case, we have now written to ASI seeking their permission for redevelopment around the area. We are waiting for their permission," said Chaudhury.Arun Malik, the ASI’s superintending archaeologist, backed INTACH, underlining that the demolished structures were covered by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act.“No one informed ASI over the last 3 months when the demolition was being done. We also don't know where the debris has gone,” Malik said, complaining how heritage structures had been removed and dumped somewhere.“We also don't know where the debris has gone. I have been looking for it since the debris also had huge heritage value... The bulldozers have damaged much of the heritage structures and nothing can be done to retrieve it," said Malik.Some of the important structures that were destroyed by the civic body was a Yoni Peeth, a revered icon in Hindu religion. The upper portion of the subsidiary shrines of Suka Sari temple that were discovered last week was destroyed in the demolition drive.Among the heritage structures demolished around the Lingaraj temple include the 11th century Ganesh temple called Budha Ganesh on the northern side of Lingaraj complex. It has been listed as a protected monument years ago and is one of the smallest Ganesh temples of Bhubaneswar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhubaneswar-civic-body-destroys-heritage-structures-around-lingaraj-temple-101612278122295.html

Their petitioners said the Mathura chief judicial magistrate did not have the jurisdiction to try the matter or remand them in custody. The petition added that Rehman and Masood were going to meet the bereaved family while Alam was transporting them to the destination.The PFI is an Islamic organisation formed as a successor to the National Development Front (NDF) in 2006. It has often been accused of involvement in anti-national and anti-social activities by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-alleged-pfi-members-can-meet-lawyers-in-jail-up-govt-tells-allahabad-hc-101612278499203.html

02-02-2021||India||PIL in Delhi HC to include judges, judicial staff in first phase of Covid-19 vaccination||A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in Delhi High Court on Tuesday seeking inclusion of judges, judicial staff, advocates and members of the legal fraternity in the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination.The petition seeks directions to Centre and Delhi Government to arrange and facilitate required infrastructure within two months in all court premises for Covid-19 vaccination.Petitioner Amrender Singh, a practising lawyer, said the rule of law depends on the functioning of courts and litigants are suffering delays in delivery of justice in absence of normal functioning of courts. The plea said several advocates amongst the legal fraternity had faced unprecedented times due to Covid-19 pandemic and were still dealing with the repercussions.It said the government "failed to include" the legal fraternity in its first vaccination drive "without having regard to the life, health and wellbeing of judges, practising advocates and other staff of the legal fraternity".It added that due to pandemic, the courts have not functioned to their full capacity and restricted audience, absence of examination of witnesses, limited hearing of cases, malfunctioning of software programmes and delays in the hearing were leading to a crisis not only for the litigants and lawyers but to many who draw their sustenance from the courts such as small canteen workers, couriers, photostat shops and stationers.Many are being driven to penury, the plea said.It sought directions to extend the present vaccination programme to the legal fraternity to usher in normalcy in the working of the judicial system."This will restore the faith of the people in the judiciary. Opening court halls and hearings in physical form are of seminal importance. It would be in the larger interests not only of the litigating public but also in the history of the administration. It will assuage a system that has been fractured by the pandemic," the plea said.It said the Supreme Court Bar Association had on January 18 requested the Union Law Minister to extend vaccination to judges, members of the staff and lawyers who work in the judicial system as frontline workers, "but no action has been taken to date to include the legal fraternity in present vaccination drive".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-in-delhi-hc-to-include-judges-judicial-staff-in-first-phase-of-covid-19-vaccination-101612275047163.html

All of these states are ruled by the BJP.In an unstarred question MHA was also asked whether the government is of the view that interfaith marriages are happening due to forceful conversions and does it have evidence with respect to the same.MHA's response stated, "‘Public Order’ and ‘Police’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Hence prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of offences related to religious conversions are primarily the concerns of the State Governments/Union Territory (UT) Administrations.

The cash-loading agency Writer Business Services Pvt Ltd staffers Vishal and Vinod told us they had mistakenly left ₹1.50 lakh in the ATM after loading ₹23.50 lakh cash,” Naresh Prasad Sinha, officer-in-charge of Azadnagar police station said.Wasim said he saw the cash lying behind the ATM when he entered the kiosk to withdraw money Monday evening.“I came out with the money and informed Shahid Akhtar and Abdul Rashid who were standing in the queue outside. We then pasted a notice on the ATM kiosk wall with our mobile numbers stating that the person to whom the money belongs may contact us on these numbers,” said Wasim.Shahid and Abdul said they later decided to take the money and deposit it at the Azadnagar police station“We had gone to our respective houses and then went to the police station and handed over the cash to the OC late last evening. We are happy that we are clear in our conscience and that the cash loaders didn’t have to face any consequence or financial loss,” said Shahid.Vishal, one of the cash loaders, acknowledged that they had indeed left the money and thanked Wasim, Shahid Akhtar and Abdul Rashid for their honesty.“We had come to the ATM around 7.30 pm with Vinod, security guard Manish Kumar and driver Prakash. We were supposed to load ₹25 lakh cash into the ATM but mistakenly left the ATM after loading only ₹23.50 lakh. We were in a hurry to load another ATM. Luckily, these three boys returned the money and saved our jobs,” Vishal, Writer Business staff, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-loaders-forget-rs-1-5-lakh-in-atm-in-jamshedpur-teens-return-it-to-cops-101612274530488.html
02-02-2021||India||Left with no option: Govt defends Delhi Police action on farmers||The Centre on Tuesday said the Delhi Police were left with no option but to use tear gas, water cannons and mild force to control the crowd after the tractor rally by protesting farmers in the national capital turned violent on January 26. The Union ministry of home affairs also informed Parliament that the Delhi Police have registered 39 cases against the farmers’ protesting against the three farm laws on the outskirts of Delhi between September to December 2020.“As regards the use of tear gas and resorting to Lathi charge against protesting farmers by the Delhi Police, it has been reported by Delhi Police that at Delhi border, large convoys of protesting farmers in tractor trolleys tried to furiously force their way and go past Police barricades to enter Delhi to mark their protest against the recently enacted ‘Farm Laws’,” minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy said in his written reply in the Lok Sabha.“They aggressively resorted to rioting, damage to Government property and used criminal force to deter public servants from the discharge of their duty, thereby inflicting injuries to the on-duty police personnel. Moreover, social distancing was not followed by the farmers/protestors and they gathered in large numbers without face masks amid Covid-19 pandemic. The farmers’ actions left the Delhi Police with no option but to use tear gas, water cannons and mild force to control the crowd,” Reddy said.Reddy also said that Delhi Police, which report to the MHA, have also informed the Centre that one case of suicide has been reported to them during the protest against the farm laws at the Delhi border. The minister did not specifically respond to another question that asked the Union home ministry for evidence that “terrorists infiltrated the farm agitation”. Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava, whose department has been under fire for the heightened security at the Ghazipur and Tikri borders of the national capital, also defended the action. “I am surprised that when tractors were used, police were attacked, barricades were broken on January 26, no questions were raised. What did we do now? We have just strengthened barricading so that it's not broken again,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Shrivastava, who had visited the Ghazipur border on Monday to inspect the security arrangements, was replying to a question about the barricading at Delhi’s borders.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-with-no-option-govt-defends-delhi-police-action-on-farmers-101612273297535.html

He did not provide details on how much he expected demand to fall.Demand for the drug was still robust in October and November, but began to drop in December, Upadhye said.India's average daily coronavirus caseload was about 53,000 in October and November, and plunged to around 27,000 in December, according to a Reuters tally. Daily cases had hit a peak in September.The World Health Organization in November advised that the drug not be used for patients hospitalized with Covid-19, for lack of evidence it could improve patient survival.But there has been no change to protocols on remdesivir's use in India, Upadhye said.Mumbai-headquartered Cipla said on Friday its consolidated net profit more than doubled during the three months ended December 31, helped by higher demand for other drugs across its portfolio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-demand-for-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-to-fall-says-cipla-101612272108086.html

Union government is employing cheap tactics of disconnecting water, electricity and internet connections at the agitation venues,” Himmat Singh Gujjar of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha said at the mahapanchayat.He alleged that the Centre is pro-corporate and is insensitive towards the farmers agitating under an open sky in the winter.Raman Simala, another leader of the Morcha, said the farmer agitation will continue till the three laws are withdrawn. He said a rally and another mahapanchayat of farmers will be organised in Dausa on February 5 and many such meetings will be held in neighbouring districts in coming days."Although the farmers at the mahapanchayat have called for Delhi march, a committee will take a final call on whether to go to Delhi or join the agitation at Shahjahanpur border in Alwar," he said.After the mahapanchayat, farmers submitted a memorandum to the sub-divisional magistrate against the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-meet-in-rajasthan-s-dausa-calls-for-delhi-march-on-feb-7-101612271319718.html
02-02-2021||India||SC to hear on Wednesday pleas related to tractor rally violence on Republic Day||The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a batch of pleas pertaining to tractor rally violence in the national capital on the Republic Day, including the one which has sought setting up of a commission headed by a retired apex court judge to inquire into the incident.The tractor parade on January 26 that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.The petitions would be taken up for hearing by a bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.One of the pleas filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari has sought setting up of a three-member inquiry commission under the chairmanship of a former apex court judge and comprising of two retired high court judges for collecting and recording evidence and submit a report on the January 26 violence to the top court in a time bound manner.He has also sought direction to the concerned authority to lodge FIRs against individuals or organisations responsible for the violence and causing dishonour of the National Flag on January 26.Another petition has been filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma who has sought a direction to the concerned authority as well as the media not to declare farmers as "terrorist" without any evidence.Sharma has claimed in his plea that there was a “planned conspiracy” to sabotage the protest by farmers’ and they were allegedly declared as “terrorist” without any evidence.He has sought directions to prohibit propagation of “false allegations and actions declaring” farmers as terrorist without any evidence.Besides the petitions filed by Tiwari and Sharma, the court would also hear some other pleas related to the incident.In his petition, Tiwari has said that farmers’ protest against the three new agri laws is going on for over two months but it took a “violent turn” during the tractor parade.“Unfortunately, the tractor march took a violent turn leaving injuries and destruction of public property. This incident also effected the daily life of the public. The internet services were interrupted as government ordered the operators to suspend the same. In the present time, the internet services are very essential to carry out the work in different professions especially in advocacy as the courts and our Supreme Court of India is functioning online,” Tiwari has said in his plea.It said that clash between the farmers and police on the Republic Day has caught the attention of the entire world.“The matter is serious because when the protest was going on peacefully for last two months then suddenly, how it turned into violent movement and led violence on January 26. The question for consideration in national security and public interest arises that who is responsible for creating the disturbance and how and who turned the peaceful farmer protest into violent movement or how and who created the circumstances which let the protest turn violent,” it said.The plea said there may be some conspiracy by some “notorious forces or organizations” to cause disturbance and damage the peaceful protest and create clash between police and protesting farmers.On January 20, the Centre had withdrawn its application, filed through Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor march on January 26 after the apex court had said that issue of tractor rally by farmers protesting against the new farms laws was in “executive domain”.On January 12, the apex court had stayed the implementation of the contentious new farm laws till further orders and constituted a four-member committee to make recommendations to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers' unions protesting at Delhi borders.The members of the court-appointed committee were -- Bhupinder Singh Mann, National President of Bhartiya Kisan Union, All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Anil Ghanwat, President of Shetkari Sanghatana.Later, Mann had recused himself from the committee.The top court had on January 12 said it would hear the pleas against the farm laws after eight weeks when the committee would give its suggestions to resolve the impasse after talking to the protesters and the government.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-on-wednesday-pleas-related-to-tractor-rally-violence-on-republic-day-101612270227232.html
02-02-2021||India||Andhra assembly to summon state election commissioner for breach of privilege||Andhra Pradesh’s state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar’s long-running battle with the Jagan Mohan Reddy government took another turn on Tuesday with the privileges committee of the state legislative assembly proposing to summon him for a personal appearance in the House.The committee wants to seek Ramesh Kumar’s explanation on some objectionable comments he had allegedly made against two ministers in the Jagan Mohan Reddy cabinet last week.It is for the first time in the history of Andhra Pradesh state legislature that an election commissioner, who is a Constitutional authority, would be summoned for a trial before the House.The privileges committee, headed by YSR Congress party MLA Kakani Goverdhan Reddy, held an emergency virtual meeting to look into the notice for a privilege motion forwarded to him Monday evening by state assembly Speaker Tammineni Sitaram.Reddy said under clauses 212 and 213 of the state legislature’s rules, the assembly can summon state election commissioner for causing breach of privilege of any members. He reminded that there was a precedent in Maharashtra state legislature in which the SEC was summoned before the assembly under similar conditions.Telugu Desam Party member of the privileges committee Anagani Satyaprasad, however, objected to summoning of the SEC. He said under Article 243K of the Constitution of India, the SEC enjoyed supreme powers and as such, he could not be called to the assembly.The committee decided to meet again next week physically, instead of virtually, to take a final decision on summoning the SEC after a detailed discussion, since it is a serious issue.The notice for a privilege motion against Ramesh Kumar was given to the Speaker on Saturday by two ministers – panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy and municipal administration minister Botsa Satyanarayana.The ministers, in their separate representations to the Speaker, alleged that the SEC had made certain objectionable comments against them in his letter to Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan last week.Stating that the tone and tenor of the letter was intimidating, the panchayat raj minister alleged that the SEC had made several castigating remarks which were libelous in nature and amounted to breach of privilege of the members.A YSRC leader familiar with the development said the privileges committee looked into a precedent in Maharashtra assembly in 2008, when it summoned then state election commissioner Nandlal to the House on charges of breach of privilege.“When Nandlal did not turn up before the assembly for giving an explanation, the assembly sentenced him to two days' simple imprisonment for contempt of the House. He was not even given a chance to move the state high court,” the YSRC leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-assembly-to-summon-state-election-commissioner-for-breach-of-privilege-101612268755953.html

02-02-2021||India||Ahead of Kerala assembly election Sabarimala comes under spotlight once more||Ahead of the assembly election in Kerala, the contentious issue of allowing women devotees into the Sabarimala temple is shaping up as a major factor for political parties with the Congress first off the blocks to leverage it.While the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) has questioned secular credentials of the Muslim League, one of the oldest allies of the opposition United Democratic Front(UDF), the Congress raked up emotional Sabarimala issue to corner both the government and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Congress leader Oommen Chandy had written a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan last week asking him to approach the Supreme Court to expedite a ruling on the contentious temple issue and withdraw its earlier affidavit that favoured entry of women of all ages to the hilltop shrine. Chandy, a former chief minister, said the government’s affidavit had created much confusion which ultimately led to a Supreme Court verdict in 2018 that triggered violence in the state.One of the reasons for the drubbing of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the 2019 general election in which it lost all but one of the 20 Lok Sabha seats was the government’s handling of the temple issue. In 2018 the state had witnessed unrest when the government tried to implement the Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the temple and worship the presiding deity Lord Ayyappa. After a long spell of unrest the apex court later referred the issue to a larger bench in 2019 and a final verdict is pending.“The government should withdraw its earlier affidavit and apologize to devotees for hurting their sentiments. Its position complicated the issue and it tried to enforce the verdict with brute force. It is time for the government to approach the court for a final decision,” said Chandy.Chandy played the Sabarimala card after CPI (M) state secretary A Vijayaraghavan taunted the Congress, questioning frequent trip of the party’s leaders to the house of Muslim League chief Panakkad Hyderali Thangal. He alleged that the Congress had surrendered to the League and questioned its secular credentials.“The League is controlling Congress these days. Even Oommen Chandy was brought in as per its initiative,” he claimed. After his comments sparked a row, Vijayaraghavan clarified that he was talking about a possible UDF alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, similar to the one during the last local body election. The League said it was wrong to dub the whole Muslim community as communal for a few votes and asked the CPI (M)’s central leadership to explain it.A worried CPI (M) has asked its leaders not to fall in the temple trap.“We all know why the Congress is raking it up now. We have already made it clear that what the court decides we will go by it,” said Finance Minister Thomas Issac.He also said the Congress was bereft of any issues so it was falling back on an old issue which is in the apex court.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, who is on a state-wide yatra, also said the UDF will bring legislation to protect believers if it comes to power. Assembly elections in Kerala and four other states are due in April-May.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also upset with the Congress for hijacking a poll plank. Congress leaders also questioned top BJP leaders, including Amit Shah, who had promised to protect believers’ rights. “What happened to those tall promises made by PM Modi and then party president Amit Shah?” asked Chennithala.The BJP claimed that its initiatives led to a rethinking on the part of the Supreme Court which later referred it to it to a nine-member bench.“It is a live issue. We suffered most during the Sabarimala stir. Some of us are facing dozens of cases filed by the government,” said BJP’s Kerala unit chief K Surendran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-kerala-assembly-election-sabarimala-comes-under-spotlight-once-more-101612266493978.html
02-02-2021||India||TDP Andhra president arrested for allegedly threatening YSRC leader||The police in Andhra Pradesh’s Srikakulam district on Tuesday arrested former minister and Telugu Desam Party’s state unit president Kinjarapu Atchan Naidu for allegedly threatening and intimidating a YSR Congress party leader at his native village Nimmada a couple of days ago.The police swooped on the residence of Atchan Naidu, also a lawmaker from Tekkali assembly constituency, early in the morning and took him into custody. They questioned him at the Kotabommali police station for a few hours before producing him in a local court in the afternoon.The court remanded the TDP leader to 14-day judicial custody. He was later moved to Srikakulam district jail. He is expected to file a bail petition in a day or two.The police acted on a complaint by the YSR Congress party leaders that Atchan Naidu had threatened and intimidated a sarpanch candidate supported by their party asking him to withdraw his nomination in Nimmada village.While Atchan Naidu’s wife Vijaya Madhavi also filed her nomination for the sarpanch post, a YSRC leader has roped in his cousin, Kinjarapu Appanna, as a rival candidate for the same post.Also read: Delhi’s 5th sero survey - Over 56% people have antibodies against Covid-19Appanna alleged that Atchan Naidu had threatened him with dire consequences if he did not withdraw his nomination. However, the TDP leaders claimed that Atchan Naidu had only tried to convince Appanna to drop out from the contest.On Saturday, the last day of nominations, both TDP and YSRC leaders entered into an altercation at Nimmadda. The Kotabommali police booked cases against 22 people including Atchan Naidu.Strongly condemning the arrest of Atchan Naidu, TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu accused the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government of resorting to vindictive politics against the TDP leaders.He alleged that the YSRC leaders were unleashing a reign of terror in the otherwise peaceful north-coastal Andhra districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam.He pointed out that YSRC leader in-charge of Tekkali assembly constituency Duvvada Srinivas, along with his followers, came to Nimmada village brandishing rods, knives and axes and openly threatened the TDP cadres. Yet, the police did not file any case against him, but foisted cases against Atchan Naidu based on false complaints, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-andhra-president-arrested-for-allegedly-threatening-ysrc-leader-101612265162102.html
02-02-2021||India||After Delhi's 5th serosurvey, health minister Jain says don’t let guard down||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday people should continue wearing masks and maintain Covid-19 appropriate behaviour even though more than half of the residents of the national capital exposed to coronavirus were found to have developed antibodies against it during the fifth serosurvey. The survey in the Capital showed that as many as 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled were found to have developed antibodies against Sars-Cov-2. “We should not get into discussions over herd immunity. Everyone should follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour including wearing masks and sanitising hands regularly,” Jain said. The health minister also said that there is no clear yardstick to define the term ‘herd immunity’. “Some say herd immunity is achieved at 50%, others say it should be 60%. I don’t think we should get into the debate of herd immunity now. This is a new form of virus or disease, we should not loosen our precautionary measures because in October we had thought the virus was brought under control, but then we got the third wave,” said Jain.Herd immunity is when enough people have immunity to a disease so that the disease leaves very few vulnerable people for it to spread to, slowing the outbreak. In the case of coronavirus, experts believe that herd immunity will be achieved when 60-80 per cent of the population is immune to the virus. This was the fifth serosurvey conducted in the national capital and the largest in the country so far. The survey was conducted from January 15 to January 23.On Monday, the national capital reported 121 new Covid-19 cases and three deaths, the lowest in the last 10 months. Only 32 Covid-19 patients needed hospitalisation which was also the lowest in the last 10 months. With this, the death count mounted to 10,856 and the Covid-19 case tally count in the city rose to 6,35,217.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-5th-serosurvey-health-minister-jain-says-don-t-let-your-guard-down-101612264692531.html

02-02-2021||India||Farm loan waiver scheme kicks off in Jharkhand, 9 lakh farmers to benefit||Molindra Besra, 45, became Jharkhand’s first farmer to receive the benefit of JMM-led government’s ambitious farm loan waiver scheme.Out of total ₹91,693.26 loan burden on him, the state government has waived ₹50,000 of the total burden. He will now have to pay remaining ₹41,639.26 to the bank, officials said on Tuesday.Besra, a resident of Tarabahal village in Karmatand block of Jamtara district, said, “I had taken a loan for mustard and vegetable cultivation around two years back. However, the majority of the crops had got damaged due to drought. The loan had turned a very big burden on me, as I have to feed my family of six.”“I feel lucky that the government’s loan waiver scheme came at a time when I needed it badly. Now, I have to work hard to repay the rest of the amount to the bank,” he added.Chief minister Hemant Soren on December 29, on the occasion of one-year of his government, had officially announced the farm loan waiver scheme. In the first phase, the government has decided to waive farm loans up to ₹50,000. The state government expects the initiative would benefit around nine lakh farmers.State agriculture minister Badal Patralekh said, “We have formally started the process of farm loan waiver benefit to farmers from Monday. One farmer was given the benefit as token disbursement. Now, we have to ensure that the benefit reaches the last farmer in the state.”State agriculture director Nisha Oraon Singhmar said, “The department has set a target to disburse at least ₹1,000 crore by the end of March. Since the entire process is almost online, technical glitches partially delayed the launching.”She said, “We have identified nine lakh farmers under the loan waiver scheme. However, six lakh farmers have seeded their Aadhaar with banks. The process of Aadhaar seeding of rest three lakh farmers has been started.”However, the benefit will go to only those farmers who have taken loan before March 31, 2020 and have an Aadhar card. To get the benefit, farmers are going through a strict scrutiny.As per the process, the bank will upload the data of eligible farmers in batches which will be available for public view. With this, farmers will get SMS asking them to submit their loan details at nearest Pragya Kendra (common service centre) or to banking correspondents. If their loan details are found to be genuine, the farmers will have to furnish mobile number and ration card details.Under the scheme, only one loan in a family will be waived. If there are three farmers in a family, only one farmer will get the waiver, officials said.“The ration card details will be checked with PDS (public distribution system) data. Once it is found genuine, the farmer will be called for e-KYC. In the third step, eligible farmers will be asked to deposit Re 1. Then, district will issue a fund generate order, which will come to the director for final verification. The director will submit it in a system where every detail is checked through software. When the system finds it okay, the director will ask the nodal bank officer for disbursement,” Singhmar said.The Hemant Soren government had proposed ₹2,000 crore in budget for the current financial year (2020-21) for the waiver. State cabinet on December 24 had taken the decision of farm loan waiver, partly fulfilling the promise made by the ruling coalition ahead of the 2019 assembly elections.The ruling alliance had promised to waive farm loans of up to ₹2 lakh, ahead of the assembly elections last year, if voted to power. The farmers would be charged a service of Re 1 against the farm loan waiver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-loan-waiver-scheme-kicks-off-in-jharkhand-9-lakh-farmers-to-benefit-101612263997962.html

Different kinds of flora and fauna including smaller species like butterflies and moths are found abundantly in Devalsari region. We are considering the proposal and once approved it will become the first state declared biodiversity heritage site,” said Bhartari.He added that the board has been working to declare places as biodiversity heritage sites, but villagers in most cases do not agree as the tag can restrict development activities. But in the case of Devalsari, about 80 km north of Dehradun, the villagers have themselves sent a proposal.A group of five van (forest) panchayats including Bangsil, Teva, Moldhar, Butkottheek and locals working to protect the area sent a detailed proposal to the biodiversity board last month. The Board is now examining a 25-km stretch of forests as part of the proposal.Arun Gaur, director of Devalsari Paryavaran Sanrakshan Samiti, who sent the proposal said, “Devalsari region is rich in biodiversity with different plants, animals, birds and butterflies being found there. The region also has a lot of potential for ecotourism. If it is declared as a biodiversity heritage site, then it will become more famous among tourists and protection of rare species can be done in a better manner.”In October last year, a rare day-flying moth, Achelura bifasciata was spotted in forests of Devalsari in the Garhwal Himalayas for the first time in history. Before this, the moth was last spotted in Kumaon region in 1890s after which it was spotted in large numbers in Tehri Garhwal district’s Sreedev Suman Titli Park, a butterfly park created by locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/devalsari-likely-to-become-uttarakhand-s-first-biodiversity-heritage-site-101612263476564.html
02-02-2021||India||DMK walks out on first day of Tamil Nadu assembly session||The first day of the last assembly session under Tamil Nadu’s present regime on Tuesday saw high drama with the Opposition, led by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin arguing with Governor Banwarilal Purhoit and walking out before his customary speech. The DMK will boycott the entire session, Stalin told reporters after leading the walkout. Stalin condemned the Governor’s inaction in deciding on the clemency of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case after the Cabinet had sent a resolution in 2019 for their release. “..,the Governor has not given any formal response nor created a situation for their release,” said Stalin. He also accused the Governor of colluding with chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and his ministers in corruption. Last December, Stalin had submitted a 97-page document with graft charges against Palaniswami, his deputy O Paneerselvam and six ministers. “We submitted the complaint with evidence but he didn’t take any action.”Also Read | Attacked by elephant when she was 3, 23-year-old finally gets compensationStalin had attempted to raise issues before the Governor could start his address. Purohit urged him to wait and reacted by saying that Tamil Nadu got ₹1 lakh crore in the Union Budget presented a day ago. “This is a day to rejoice towards infrastructure,” Purohit said, which was also objected to by the DMK. “We are not here to discuss the Central government,” responded DMK’s general secretary Duraimurugan. The Governor retaliated that he stated a fact. “I haven’t said anything wrong...Why are you shouting; getting angry on the contrary?” he told DMK members. Purohit urged the Opposition to cooperate as they were on their feet. “Mr Stalin, as leader of opposition, I’ve a request for you...this is the last session of this term. Take full advantage of it, take part in the debate,” Purohit said. “All of you senior leaders, you are one of the best orators, why don’t you use skills? I’ve a suggestion; if you want to register your protest, go out for five minutes and come back again.”But Stalin led a walkout and later, Congress MLAs who had wrapped green scarves over their heads in support of agitating farmers, also left the assembly. In his speech, the Governor lauded the state for its key achievements, including keeping the Covid-19 pandemic under control, receiving the Centre’s award for water management. He condemned the death of four fishermen who recently died after their boat collided with a Sri Lankan naval vessel and said that the Indian government is being proactive to bring back the remaining 12 fishermen from Lankan custody. He allayed concerns regarding the new National Education Policy stating that the two-language policy of the state will continue. The assembly session will conclude on February 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-walks-out-on-first-day-of-tamil-nadu-assembly-session-101612263393808.html

The aircraft to be ordered include 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft.Also Read | ‘Cannot remain dependent on others for India’s defence,’ says Rajnath Singh The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123.The 40 LCAs already ordered by the IAF are in the initial operational clearance and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far. The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aero-india-govt-to-award-rs-48k-cr-contract-to-hal-for-83-advanced-tejas-jets-101612263333775.html
02-02-2021||India||Crane tagged in Russia covers over 4300 km to reach Rajasthan||A Demoiselle crane tagged in Russia's Transbaikalia was spotted in Khinchan village in Jodhpur district on Sunday. The crane traveled about 4,368 km to reach here, the longest distance covered by the tagged migratory birds reported so far, bird experts claimed on Monday.On Sunday morning at the shelter site of migratory birds in Khinchan village, bird watcher Sewaram Mali saw the tagged crane, which he reported to bird expert Dr Dau Lal Bohra. Dr Bohra, associated with the international network engaged in the watch of migratory birds, verified that this bird was tagged on August 2, 2019 by Oleg Goroshko in Transbaikalia in Onon District near Novy Dutulgui village. Now it is the second winter in India for this crane.The last signal from this bird was on January 17 this year. Until January 17 this crane was in Gujrat in the area south of Kachchh Bay between Arabian sea coast and Manavadar. He said that this is the second crane found this winter season that was tagged, but the crane A-5, which was spotted on Sunday, covered the most distance to reach here.“Under the international project of “1000 Cranes”, Demoiselle cranes were tagged with color plastic rings and GPS-GSM transmitters in Russia and Mongolia in 2018 and 2019. Main objectives of the research were to identify pre-migration staging areas, migratory stopovers and wintering grounds along the flyways to India through tagging of cranes and subsequent tracking. In 2018 Demoiselle Cranes tagged in Russia and Mongolia were sighted in Rajasthan and Gujarat, where their wintering grounds are located,” he added.According to the report, “Threats to cranes at wintering grounds in India” published by the Severtsov’ Institute of Ecology and Evolution Russian Academy of Science, in Rajasthan, power lines are also a big issue for migratory bird’s mortality. More than 1000 lethal electrical poles are near feeding and roosting sites, and collisions with electric wires are a major issue for Demoiselle Cranes mortality.In 2012, 19 cranes were dead due to electrocution near a feeding station. At the end of 2019, around 47 Demoiselle Cranes were found dead in a single observation caused by electrocution. The other threats are plastic and sewage water pollution, semi-wild dogs and heavy salt water which probably causes leg injuries or sarcoma.“Rajasthan and Gujarat both are big states and very important for migratory and wintering cranes. Therefore, work on identifying and assessment of threats to cranes and other birds should be conducted with a focus on places determined through crane tagging and tracking. It is necessary to identify where the electric power lines have the greatest negative impact on birds during migration and in wintering grounds, as well as what types of pesticides cause their poisoning,” Dr Bohra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crane-tagged-in-russia-covers-over-4300-km-to-reach-rajasthan-101612261806908.html

She has sought treatment in at least nine hospitals. An artificial tracheal tube was inserted in her throat for her to breathe and is dependent on a liquid-only diet for sustenance.“It is the basic expectation of every human being to live a healthy and active life. If such expectation is breached due to the negligence of the state or its agencies, then it becomes an obligation of the state to do the needful,” the court said. It added that her right to life was impaired and she couldn’t speak, be with her friends or had to deal with ‘scattered marital prospects’ due to the incident.Her father has taken care of her medical expenses with his meagre earnings as transport corporation employee. The court observed his financial support “isn’t possible forever”. With her BE qualification in Computer Science, the court directed that she is “competent to execute any computer related work at the office of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department or any temples” under the department.The petitioner had visited Arulmigu Maariamman Temple in Trichy district in 1999 with her parents when a temple elephant went rogue and the crowd ran around in fear.The state had disputed this version and submitted that the mother and daughter had fallen into a garbage carrier vehicle after a mahout had fallen down creating chaos which the court rejected citing evidence from newspaper reports from 1999 which carried the petitioner’s photo with injuries.“If it is not so, there was no need for the mahout to visit the child at the hospital....the Mahout's conscience did not allow him to stay back in the temple without visiting the child,” the court order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attacked-by-elephant-when-she-was-3-23-year-old-finally-gets-compensation-101612260730078.html

Jaishankar to Colombo to shore up support for the 2019 deal, that also involved Japan and India's Adani Group ."The commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka ... has been conveyed several times in the recent past, including at the leadership level," a spokesman for India's embassy in Colombo said in an emailed statement on Tuesday."Sri Lanka's cabinet also took a decision three months ago to implement the project with foreign investors. All sides should continue to abide by the existing understandings and commitment."Spokesmen for Adani, the Japanese embassy in Colombo and Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Sri Lanka is key in the battle for influence in South Asia between traditional power India and China, which has been making increasing inroads there.The island nation is a crucial staging post for much of the cargo coming in and out of India, and China's growing influence has alarmed New Delhi.Beijing took over Hambantota port in the south of the country in 2016 after Sri Lanka failed to keep up with debt repayments, and is involved in the construction and operation of a neighbouring port terminal in Colombo, as well as other critical infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tells-sri-lanka-to-honour-pact-after-colombo-takes-back-port-contract-101612259350983.html

Thousands of farmers been protesting on the outskirts of Delhi in protest against the laws introduced by the Centre in September last year. The government says the new laws will open up opportunities for farmers and reform the agriculture sector but the protesters say the laws will benefit big corporations.“Our slogan is 'kanoon wapsi nahi, to ghar wapsi nahi'. This agitation will not conclude before October, it will not end anytime soon,” Rakesh Tikait, who is the spokesperson for BKU, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella organisation of over 40 Indian farmers unions leading the agitation, said earlier on Tuesday that there can be no "formal" talks with the government until "harassment" by police and administration stops and detained farmers are released. The organisation alleged that increased barricading, including digging trenches, fixing nails on roads, setting up barbed-wire fences, closing internal roads, stopping internet services and "orchestrating protests through BJP-RSS workers" are part of "attacks" being organised by the government, its police and administration against the farmers."The SKM decided in its meeting on Monday that there can be no formal talks with the government until police and administration's harassment of different kinds against the farmers' movement is immediately stopped. Though no formal proposal for talks came from the government, we clearly state that the talks will be held only after the unconditional release of farmers who are in illegal police custody,” it said.The protesting farmers and the government have held 11 rounds of negotiations over the farm laws — the last one on January 22. Farm unions have rejected the government’s offer to put the three laws in abeyance for at least one-and-a-half years. The government had offered to suspend them in its most far-reaching proposal yet in the 10th round of negotiations. But the farmers hardened their already rigid position and have said they will not budge from their demand for a complete repeal of the laws.Also read | 'Ego won't help run the country': Raut after meeting Rakesh Tikait at GhazipurThousands of farmers have been protesting at the Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, since November last year.The protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. The Centre, however, has said that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and reform the agricultural sector.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said during an all-party meeting on last Saturday the government's offer to suspend the farm laws for 18 months was still on the table and that Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar was just a phone call away to take the talks forward. The morcha had reacted to Modi's statement by reiterating its demand for repeal of the three laws. The protesting farmers have also declared a nationwide 'chakka jam' or road blockade on highways on February 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-against-farms-laws-won-t-end-anytime-soon-says-bku-s-rakesh-tikait-101612257494217.html

I write about festivals and love. The aim is to encourage Halbi, which is the traditional language of tribes in this region,” said Lalit Kumar Kashyap, a tribal, famous as Boya Raja.Kashyap is a great fan of Mumbai-based rapper Emiway Bantai and dreams that one day he will rap with him in Halbi.“I have deep respect for my mother tongue Halbi and hence my aim is to make Halbi rap songs famous in the music industry. Till now, I have made only three songs, but things are going well,” said Kashyap, whose father is a marginal farmer.Halbi, also known as Bastari, is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language and is spoken by tribes across the central part of India. It is written in Devanagari and Odia script, as per experts.Kashyap, along with two of his friends, records the video and then gets it edited in studio in the nearest city of Jagdalpur.“The rap scene in Halbi started a couple of years ago. There are around six young Halbi rappers and people across seven districts of Bastar and even in Odisha love Halbi rap songs. We all have a similar goal: to make our language Halbi famous and to give our tribal culture a new platform,” said Kashyap, who is writing a new song on Maoist problems in the Bastar region.Till now most of the hip hop scene in the Bastar region is focused on love, betrayal, food and festivals.The other famous halbi rappers are Rapper Ram, Rapper Anil and others.“Initially, we focused on writing about common topics, but now we have decided to write on issues faced by our community in this Maoist-affected Bastar region,” said Suresh Kumar, a resident of Kondagaon district, one of the seven districts of Bastar region.People in Bastar believe that rapping in Halbi is a new thing and surely it will help the local language and culture in many ways.“I believe that rap songs are a very simple way of expressing emotions, rage and anger. The Halbi rappers in the region are amateurs but doing well...The people of Bastar, who mostly live in the jungles and mountains, are connecting with the outside world and this connection is also visible in the field of art. Bastaria rap songs have their own taste and in coming days there will be an art explosion internationally,” said Avinash Prasad, a filmmaker and writer, who directed the film in Halbi.Shivnarayan Pandey, alias Koyla, a local artist who is working on Halbi language since last decade said the language is spoken in many parts of Bastar region, including Gondi, Dorli and other dialects.“Halbi was a trade and state language of Bastar when kings used to rule this region. Halbi connects people and hence is popular in deep forests also. There is a history of songwriting and music in Halbi. I believe that if youth are doing it they should focus on purity. There are many words in Halbi which are extinct now and through these youths we believe that these words will come into existence again,” said Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-the-tribal-halbi-rappers-of-chhattisgarh-s-maoist-hit-bastar-101612253955930.html

But now, the focus has shifted to Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border where Tikait is leading the farmers to push for the demand of repealing the three laws.He is also one of the accused in the January 26 violence in Delhi.Meanwhile, security arrangements continue to be strengthened at the Delhi-UP border site, which is galvanising farmers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. On Monday, Delhi Police Commissioner S N Srivastava and other senior police officers visited Ghazipur border to take stock of the security arrangements.Drones have also been deployed to monitor the protesters.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been camping at Delhi's borders for weeks, seeking a repeal of the three agriculture laws.They claim that the new laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system. But the Centre says the laws will only give farmers more options to sell their produce.The issues even affected Parliament proceedings as the Rajya Sabha or Upper House was adjourned thrice in the day, and then for the day due to opposition protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ego-won-t-help-run-the-country-raut-after-meeting-rakesh-tikait-at-ghazipur-101612253889099.html

The embassy has said that travellers may contact them if required."In view of the recent developments in Myanmar, all Indian citizens are required to take due precautions and avoid unnecessary travel. They may be in touch with the Embassy if required," the embassy said.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that it was deeply concerned and was closely monitoring the situation in Myanmar.We have noted the developments in Myanmar with deep concern. India has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar...We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. We are monitoring the situation closely," it said.The National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Suu Kyi won the 2020 elections by a landslide but the country's military claimed that the polls were marred with irregularities and termed the results 'invalid'. They questioned the legitimacy of almost 9 million votes, suggesting the possibility of 'voting malpractice.'The United Elections Commission (UEC), a national level electoral commission responsible for organising and overseeing elections, dismissed the allegations, stating that there was no evidence of electoral fraud.The military detained democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and imposed a one-year state of emergency. However, they said that they would return power after a fair and free election.Detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi's and 24 other ministers' whereabouts are still unknown after 24 hours of his detention. The army named 11 ministers as replacements to oversee ministries including finance, defence, foreign affairs and interior.The country was under military rule for nearly five decades before a democratic transition in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-embassy-in-myanmar-urges-travellers-to-exercise-precaution-101612250469867.html

Four persons, including three women, have been arrested. According to the police, the women, from different districts in upper Assam, had been lured with promise of jobs and were about to be trafficked outside the state when they were rescued. “I got a call on Monday evening informing me that several women were being kept in two houses in Murajhar. Based on the information, we conducted a raid. But by the time we reached the spot, the traffickers had taken the women to another location,” said Dipti Mali, deputy superintendent of police, Hojai. “We found several bags full of clothes in the two houses. On questioning, the two women in the house said that the women had been taken to the paddy fields. We conducted search in the dark for several hours and were able to rescue 11 women,” she added.Also Read: Rajasthan law student arrested for threatening to rape a journalist on twitter Police have arrested one Abida Begum (25), who is reportedly the mastermind of the racket, and the two women in whose houses the rescued women were kept. One person, who was coordinating the trafficking, has also been arrested and search is on to nab another accused who fled the scene. “Local residents say Abida has been involved in trafficking women for quite some time now. She reportedly used to promise the women jobs outside the state, and after some time these women used to disappear without any trace,” said Mali “Detailed interrogation of the accused will reveal where they used to traffic the women and what happened to them. Most of the women rescued on Monday night belong to the tea tribe community and are from Tinsukia and Margherita in upper Assam,” she added. Police have registered a case against the accused and are conducting further investigation to unearth the total number of women trafficked till date.According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) figures for 2019, the rate of human trafficking in Assam per 100,000 population, was 0.6, which is three times the national rate of 0.2. The state accounted for 8.9% of the total human trafficking cases reported in India in 2019, which is the third highest after Maharashtra (12.5%) and Andhra Pradesh (10.8%). Maharashtra recorded 282 cases of human trafficking in 2019, followed by Andhra Pradesh (245) and Assam (201).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-interstate-trafficking-racket-busted-11-including-4-minors-rescued-101612253312949.html

His party, the Congress, has been demanding that the Centre should talk to the protesting farmers and repeal the three farm laws.

Harjeet Singh, her father, also thanked PM Modi for mentioning her daughter’s achievement in his radio programme.The PM had said that Gurleen’s experiment had shown that growing strawberries was possible in Jhansi too.Experts said the PM’s mention during the ongoing strawberry festival is now likely to help push up strawberry cultivation in Bundelkhand region.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had virtually inaugurated the festival in Jhansi on January 17. The festival ends on February 16.Later, in a tweet, Yogi Adityanath thanked the PM for mentioning strawberry cultivation in Jhansi in his radio talk show. During his meeting, Yogi encouraged Gurleen to promote strawberry cultivation.The soil of Bundelkhand region is suited for strawberry farming as it is free of pesticides, experts said. Initially, strawberry was grown at the roof–top of a house in Jhansi and thereafter it was cultivated in a field with the help of drip irrigation.“There is a general belief that the soil of the Bundelkhand region is not suitable for such fruits. Strawberry could prove to be an additional mode of earning for farmers of the region,” said an expert.Andre Vamsi, district magistrate of Jhansi, assured all help to farmers who opt to cultivate strawberries. “Strawberry cultivation will be promoted all over Bundelkhand. Farmers of the region can benefit a lot from this fruit crop,” said Raja Bundela, vice chairman, Bundelkhand Development Board.He said the Board will also help popularise strawberry cultivation in Bundelkhand.Experts said that on 1.5 acres of land, around 10,000 kg of strawberry is grown which could be sold for ₹100 per kg.Mahabaleshwar in south-western Maharashtra is also known for strawberry cultivation. Nearly 85 per cent of the country’s strawberries are produced there.Along with strawberry, raspberry, mulberry and gooseberry are also produced there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jhansi-strawberry-cultivator-meets-yogi-adityanath-day-after-pm-praises-her-101612246739713.html

Even after getting 99 marks, they could not secure a job and there are such people in this meeting."Reddy mentioned that all government officers include officers from backward castes, who don't know any work, which has led to the state becoming 'spoiled', adding that there was an outrage among upper castes due to this matter."Today for example in our constituency, they came to us and said there is a good officer (Officer from Backward caste). I asked them if he excelled in his work to which they replied in affirmative and then he was brought here. He (Officer from Backward Caste) doesn't know a single word, I asked them that why did they bring such an officer here, their reply was that when asked to give his signature, he will sign wherever we want but if a good officer comes he will refuse to sign."Responding to Reddy's statements, Senior Telangana Congress leader and spokesperson Sravan Dasoju on Monday slammed the TRS MLA and called for filing a criminal case against him for 'racist arrogance'."Criminal case should be filed against TRS MLA Challa Dharma Reddy for his racist arrogance and derogatory comments on downtrodden sections," he tweeted.

It is one of the oldest intergovernmental accord signed by members countries to preserve the ecological character of their wetlands of international importance.According to Union environment ministry, the theme this year is "Wetland and Water". The ministry said that with the theme, the intention is to bring the focus to the availability of water and its usage.It said that only 2.5 per cent of water on earth is fresh and less than 1 per cent is usable. "Our water use has increased six-fold in the last 100 years and rises by 1 per cent each year," the environment ministry said.Natural wetlands are permanently or seasonally saturated in water and create habitats for aquatic plants. They retain large volumes of water and their slow release makes them important for combating extreme weather conditions like floods and droughts. Termed 'kidneys of landscape', wetlands contribute to water purification, water regulation, biodiversity, aesthetics and recreation, according to the United Nations.India has maximum wetlands in South Asia - 7.7 lakh - covering the country’s 4.6 per cent geographical area, according to a report of NGO Wetland International. The number of wetlands in India is only next to Japan and China in Asia.Last year, Ramsar declared 10 more wetland sites from India as sites of international importance.According to environment ministry, 35 per cent of wetlands have disappeared since the 1970s and 87 per cent have been lost since the 1700s. Causes of wetland loss are drainage and infilling for agriculture and construction, pollution, overexploitation of resources (like overfishing), invasive species and climate change.It has asked state governments and other agencies involved to ensure that wetlands are preserved as the future of many species depend on the health of these regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-wetlands-day-the-origin-purpose-and-theme-this-year-101612239233865.html

02-02-2021||India||After two days of peace, Opposition fireworks to return in Parliament||After two peaceful days of proceedings, fireworks over farm protests will dominate the third day of the Budget Session of Parliament as both Houses start debate on the President’s speech. The Congress and other Opposition parties have decided to join two key debates on the President’s speech and the Union Budget after launching protests over three farm laws inside and outside Parliament, according to people aware of the developments.The Opposition leaders indicated that protests and frequent disruptions will be a part of their strategy in the discussion on the President’s speech on Tuesday.Opposition parties such as the Congress, Trinamool Congress and Left outfits have prepared to push an adjournment motion on the farm issue in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Also read | What Union Budget means for your moneyOne Opposition leader, however, added, that they might allow the Question Hour to run in the Rajya Sabha as they had been demanding it after it was dropped in the last session.In Lok Sabha, the second question listed for the Question Hour is related to minimum support price for the farmers -- potential ammunition to attack the government over the farm bills. At the third and last all-party meeting on Sunday over the Budget Session, the government’s managers suggested that the Opposition parties can raise all issues related to the farm laws during the debate on the President’s speech and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he intervenes in the debate, would reply to them, another leader said. Among other senior ministers, defence minister Rajnath Singh is expected to speak in the debate, he added.At Sunday’s meeting, convened by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, six ministers and 25 leaders of various parties were present. A press statement said, “Chairman Naidu today made a fervent appeal to leaders of various parties to ensure effective functioning of the House during the ongoing Budget Session. In response, the leaders assured that there will be full participation in all the debates and discussions in the House.”The Opposition, however, plans to corner the government on the issue of the three contentious farm laws. “We will press for a separate debate on the farm issue given the gravity of the situation. But the government wants to tackle the issue in the President’s speech debate only. This might lead to another flashpoint,” another leader said, asking not to be named.Thousands of farmers have hunkered down at the Capital’s borders for more than two months to protest against the three farm laws that they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming..Meanwhile, upcoming assembly elections are also set to find political space in the debate on the President’s speech. As per the current schedule, first-time BJP MP from West Bengal, Locket Chatterjee, will initiate the debate in Lok Sabha to send a political message to the voters of Bengal. The President’s speech to the joint session of the House, too, had prominent references about poll-bound Assam, Bengal and Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-two-days-of-peace-opposition-fireworks-to-return-in-parliament-101612237600915.html

02-02-2021||India||Decade after scam, Odisha imposes penalty of ₹2056 cr for illegal mining||A decade after the mining scam rocked Odisha leading to tightening of rules governing raising and transportation of minerals, the state mining department for the first time detected a major illegality, imposing penalty of ₹2,056 crore on Sarda Mines, a merchant miner for excess mining.The joint director of mines in Joda of mines-rich Keonjhar district last week sent the notice to Sarda Mines under Section 21 (5) of The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (MMDR) Act, 1957, for raising 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore in excess of the limits stipulated under environmental clearance, mining plan as well as the limit set by State Pollution Control Board.The mines department in its penalty demand said the Thakurani Block-B iron mines held by Sarda Mines in Keonjhar district over an area of 947.046 hectare produced at least 7 times of the limit set up by different government agencies such as Indian Bureau of Mines, the OPCB as well as the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Climate Change for the financial year 2019-20The demand note from the joint director of mines said the excess mining happened in the month of February and March 2020. The mines department calculated the penalty taking into account the price of lump ore decided by the Indian Bureau of Mines. In February 2020, the highest price of lump ore was ₹4,691 per tonne while in March it was ₹4,835 per tonne.Also read: Twitter restores 250 accounts blocked in India for a controversial hashtag"This is the biggest ever penalty on any mining company after the mining scam broke out a decade ago," confirmed joint director of mines, Salil Behera. He, however, could not clarify how the company raised so much ore in excess of the limits set by various authorities even after many regulations were brought in after the mining scam. In 2010, the state mining department had started Integrated Mines and Minerals Management System (i3MS), a comprehensive information technology-based e-Governance initiative that provided an end-to-end tracking of minerals produced, despatched and consumed in all the 14 mining circles.Other senior mining officials did not comment on the penalty imposed. HN Singh, vice-president of Sarda Mines, said his company would challenge the order in High Court. "We don't agree with the penalty demand. There are several flaws in it," he said.After the mining scam was unearthed in Odisha in 2009, Justice MB Shah Commission of Enquiry had found that around ₹60,000 crore worth of ore was mined illegally from Keonjhar and Sundargarh between 2000 and 2010. However, in 2017, central empowered committee, that was appointed by Supreme Court to probe into illegal mining in Odisha, put the amount at ₹17,576.17 crore following which the apex court ruled that the errant companies have to pay the amount. The CEC calculated the figure for illegal extraction of 215.5 million tonnes of iron and manganese ore between 2000-01 and 2010-11.The Thakurani B iron ore mines in Joda area leased to Sarda Mines in August 1991 was a supplier of high-quality ore to the Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel and Power Limited plant before it was closed on March 31, 2014, due to lack of environment clearances. In January last year, the Supreme Court had allowed it to resume mining operations after directing to pay around ₹933 crore towards environmental compensation to the state government.However, in September last year, the Ministry of Environment and Forest and Climate Change asked Sarda Mines to stop operation immediately noting that its environment clearance was invalid. Sarda Mines, however, got a stay against the order from Delhi High Court and resumed its operation. Its lease over the Thakurani B mines is scheduled to end in August this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decade-after-scam-odisha-imposes-penalty-of-rs-2056-cr-for-illegal-mining-101612209948737.html
02-02-2021||India||Highways to welfare funds: 4 poll-bound states get infra boost||New Delhi: Investments on infrastructure projects ranging from fishing harbours to highways and metro rail networks, a welfare fund for tea garden workers and quotations from the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore and Thiruvalluvar in finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget speech underscored the Centre’s focus on states headed for elections in the coming months.Assembly elections are due by April -May in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, along with the Union territory of Puducherry. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is sparing no effort wo win West Bengal and Puducherry, at least improve its position in Kerala and Tamil Nadu and retain power in Assam.The BJP is paying special attention to these states, especially West Bengal, the state with the third largest representation in the Lok Sabha with 42 seats. ‘’Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark,’’ Sitharaman quoted from Tagore to emphasize how India is well poised to be a land of promise and hope in a world that is battling to end the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.And for good measure, she also quoted Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar: “A king/ruler is the one who creates and acquires wealth, protects and distributes it for common good.”. .Among the projects she unveiled for the poll-bound states were 675 km of highways in West Bengal worth Rs25,000 crore; more than 1,300 kms of highways valued at Rs. 34,000 crore in Assam, where work is already in progress on roads worth Rs19,000 crore; and 1,100 km of highways in Kerala with an investment of Rs. 65,000 crore . Her budget also proposed ₹1,000 crores for the welfare of tea workers, especially women and their children, in Assam and West Bengal—a major social issue that has wider political ramifications in the BJP’s citadel in north Bengal and Assam. “We will undertake future dedicated freight corridor projects namely East-Coast Corridor from Kharagpur to Vijayawada, East-West Corridor from Bhusaval to Kharagpur to Dankuni and North-South corridor from Itarsi to Vijayawada. Detailed Project Reports will be undertaken in the first phase.” Kharagpur and Dankuni are key towns in West Bengal. Two more road projects running through the poll-bound states also found a mention in the budget speech. Sitharaman announced that Bengaluru–Chennai and Chennai–Salem expressways will be contracted out soon and construction work on them would start in FY21-22. These projects will not only fill critical gaps in connectivity in these states but also generate jobs for locals. The long list of infrastructure projects also includes Central counterpart funding for 11.5 kms in the second phase of the Kochi Metro Railway, 118.9 km in Phase-II of the Chennai Metro Railway and similar projects in Bengaluru and Nagpur. The finance minister also announced plans for fishing harbours in Kochi, Chennai and Bengal’s Petuaghat apart from Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam and Odisha’s Paradip. “We will also develop inland fishing harbours and fish-landing centres along the banks of rivers and waterways,” the minister said. The BJP was able to open its account in Kerala in the last assembly polls. It has three MLAs in Bengal but in the 2019 national elections, the party won 18 seats in the Lok Sabha, ts best tally ever in the largest eastern state. The BJP doesn’t have any seat in Tamil Nadu, but hopes to be part of a key alliance with the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.“As expected, the FM has paid special attention to election-bound states. She announced large capital outlays for Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Assam. People are not fools: they know that the proposals are only outlays and the actual expenditure will happen only after the schemes are approved,” former finance minister P Chidambaram said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highways-to-welfare-funds-4-poll-bound-states-get-infra-boost-101612206211416.html
02-02-2021||India||Will the Budget alleviate distress?||India imposed one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infections. The Economic Survey justified this by arguing that it prevented up to 3.7 million Covid-19 cases, but the strategy also caused a massive disruption to economic activity, affecting incomes and employment of those at the bottom of the pyramid. In response, several economists, including Raghuram Rajan, the former RBI governor and Abhijit Banerjee, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 2019, argued for putting more money in the hands of the poor to compensate for this disruption. The government did that in 2020-21. It enhanced allocation under key welfare programmes such as the MGNREGS , provided additional food grains to the poorest at subsidised rates, and made direct cash transfers to over 400 million people. These measures have been withdrawn in the 2021-22 Budget, which has focused more on boosting capital spending and growth rather than welfare spending. In short, the government is hoping that growth will address the issue. Budgetary numbers show this clearly. The 2021-22 (BE) allocation for MGNREGS is ₹73,000 crore, compared to an allocation of ₹1.12 lakh crore in the 2020-21 Revised Estimates (RE). This seems to be a cut in real terms even from the 2019-20 allocation of ₹71,687 crore. Similarly, allocation for National Social Assistance Programme, which was increased to ₹42,617 crore in 2020-21 (RE) from the 2020-21 BE allocation of ₹9,197 crore has been brought down to ₹9,200 crore in the 2021-22 BE numbers. PM-KISAN, this government’s flagship scheme for boosting farm incomes actually saw a decline even during the pandemic. Against a 2020-21 BE allocation of ₹75,000 crore, the RE number for 2020-21 is ₹65,000 crore, which is also the allocation for 2021-22 BE. The government spent ₹3.4 lakh crore in food subsidy payments to the Food Corporation of India in 2020-21 according to the RE numbers. These cannot be compared with the 2020-21 BE numbers, because the government has rightly discontinued the practice of treating this spending as an off-budget item. However, this too has been brought down to ₹2 lakh crore in the 2021-22 BE allocation. An analysis of spending on important pro-poor heads such as agriculture, social welfare, housing for poor (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna) have also seen a decline in 2021-22 BE allocations compared to 2020-21 RE numbers. The macro takeaway from these statistics is clear. While the government did spend more than what the last budget allocated to this heads, it has decided against continuing its distress relief push in the next fiscal year as things return to normal. Instead, the spending push has been reoriented towards capital spending, by which the government hopes to boost growth in days to come. This clearly suggests that the government is pinning its hopes on the ongoing economic recovery to take care of those at the bottom of the pyramid. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman explained this in an interview. “The balance (between welfare and capital spending) is expected to get reset largely by the fact that the money is going only for capital expenditure. When you create windows for capital expenditure, you’re confident that what you’re spending money on is actually asset creation,” Sitharaman said. “Therefore, the kind of money going into the hands of the people directly, without looking at what it’s going to create — it will create short-term demand, yes — but when it goes through this [asset creation] route, it also gives encouragement for sectors that will help create better roads, ports, other infrastructure facilities. Thus, it’s both a short-term and long-term impact,” she added. Not everyone is convinced. “Cutting back on welfare spending at a time when labour markets are in distress and the poor are still dealing with the loss of incomes and livelihoods, and more importantly a wage squeeze due to the pandemic, will only worsen the demand problem in the economy,” said Himanshu, associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “There is enough evidence to show that the sequential recovery in the economy was driven by profits, even as employment and wages took a hit. A reduction in welfare spending will increase the burden on the poor and erode their bargaining power in the economy, which will generate headwinds for rural demand going forward,” he added. High-frequency indicators seem to paint a mixed picture. The Purchasing Mangers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in January 2020 was reported at 57.7, significantly above the threshold of 50 which signifies an improvement in economic activity over the previous month. This rise in production notwithstanding, employment went down for the tenth consecutive month, although the pace of decline in employment continued to moderate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-the-budget-alleviate-distress-101612206208769.html
02-02-2021||India||Farmers, villages at heart of budget: PM||New Delhi : Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday described the Union Budget 2021-22 as “not just active but proactive” , and stressed that villages and farmers were “at its heart”.In a televised address shortly after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the budget in Parliament, the PM said the Budget will enhance ease of living for the common man by simplifying procedure and rules and bring positive changes for individuals, investors, industry and infrastructure sector. “The budget has the vision of self-reliance and features every section of the society,” Modi said.The principles behind the budget, he said, included expansion of new opportunities for growth, opportunities for the youth, giving a new dimension to human resources, infrastructure development; and helping new sectors grow.“This budget has a special focus on strengthening the agriculture sector and boosting farmers’ income. Villages and farmers are at its heart,” he said.The PM had earlier said the Union Budget should be seen in continuation of the four to five “mini budgets”, or the over ₹20 lakh crore economic packages, announced by the finance minister in 2020.At a time when a section of farmers are agitating against the recently announced farm bills that they allege are anti-farmers and will only benefit corporates, the PM offered reassurance that the budget focuses on increasing farmers’ income. He said farmers will be able to get loans easily, and the new laws will allow for the strengthening of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMCs) with the help of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. Modi further said that the government, while keeping in with fiscal sustainability, stressed on increasing the budget size, and did not put pressure on the citizens.On the provisions in the budget for the development needs of southern states, the North-east states, and Ladakh, he said these aspects will play a key role particularly in turning the coastal states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal into “business powerhouses”. All three states go to the polls in the first half of 2021, along with Assam and the Union territory of Puducherry.During the budget speech, the finance minister said national highway projects of 8,500km will be awarded by March 2022, and an additional 11,000km of National Highway Corridor will be completed. She announced new road and rail projects for Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal.Referring to the government’s Covid response Modi said, it was not reactive but proactive, and that the budget, too, doesn’t have a reactive approach. “We have gone beyond active and have given a proactive budget”, he said.While the Prime Minister said the “positive early response” to the budget -- the Sensex, for example, rose 5% -- is indicative of the government giving proper attentions to its responsibility towards fiscal sustainability, while increasing the size of the budget.Opposition parties, however, slammed the budget.“Forget putting cash in the hands of people, the Modi government plans to handover India’s assets to his crony capitalist friends,” Congress MP and former party president Rahul Gandhi said.Addressing the media former finance minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram said that the budget was a “let-down” and the increase in cess on petrol and diesel were a cruel act on poor and farmers. He said it was a vengeful act against the thousands of farmers who took out the largest tractor rally in history. “It is also a cruel blow to federalism because states do not get a share in the revenue from cesses,” he said. The MSMEs were dismissed in a sentence and the intent of this government is clear - let the PSBs bleed slowly so they can all be privatised in short term he went on to add. Congress MPs Jasbir Singh Gill and Gurjeet Singh Aujla wore wearing gowns to Parliament on Monday as a mark of protest over the farm laws.The BJP’s former ally the Shiromani Akali Dal staged a walkout while the budget was being presented. SAD MP, Harsimrat Badal, who is also a former food supplies minister in the Modi Cabinet, termed it “unfortunate” that the government not thinking of the farmers sitting in protests on their doorstep on the outskirts of the Capital.Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal, whose Rashtriya Loktantrik Party also broke away from the National Democratic Alliance over the farm laws, also staged a walkout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-villages-at-heart-of-budget-pm-101612206150488.html
02-02-2021||India||Long term finance and a bigger playing field for private sector to lead infra push||The Narendra Modi government has set itself a target of creating a ₹111 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline by 2025. The 2021-22 budget has deployed a mix of old and new to achieve this target. This year’s budget has announced the creation of a Development Finance Institution (DFI), an idea India tried in the pre-reforms era before giving up. What is new is the unprecedented expansion in scope for private sector activity in infrastructure this budget proposes. If the ideas discussed in the budget are actually implemented, India might see more privately owned and operated roads, airports, railways, freight corridors, and ports. Both these ideas are extremely important and potentially game-changing.Let us take the idea of DFI first. Collapse of infrastructure projects, partly due to over optimistic revenue projections and partly because of courts cancelling resource allocations such as telecom spectrum and coal mines, played a big role in creating the bad loan crisis in Indian banks after the 2008 global financial crisis. While it did not help that banks, especially the government-owned ones, had poor governance mechanisms and kept evergreening stressed loans so that they would not have to make extra provisioning to meet capital adequacy norms, many experts have pointed out that banks were not the best suited institutions to lend to infrastructure projects. This was because infrastructure projects take a long time to break even, while banks deal with mostly short-term deposits.Experts call this an asset-liability mismatch. It is in this context that the discussion about recreating a DFI framework started doing the rounds. This budget has tried to tap into this sentiment. The fact that the proposed DFI will begin with a budgetary allocation of just ₹20,000 crore, suggests that the government wants to test the waters. It has set itself a modest target of building a portfolio of ₹5 lakh crore for this DFI in three years’ time.The other potential game changer in the infra sector is the focus on asset monetisation. The budget speech says that “monetizing operating public infrastructure assets is a very important financing option for new infrastructure construction” and has proposed that even existing infrastructure assets including those with National Highway Authority of India, Power Grid Corporation, freight corridors of railways, airports, and oil and gas pipelines will be a part of the asset monetisation programme. To be sure, the asset monetisation programme is being taken along with a sharp rise in capital expenditure allocation in 2021-22. The budget proposes to award contracts for construction of 8,500km of roads by March 2022, and completion of an additional 11,000km of national highway corridors. Ambitious targets have also been set in railways, waterways and urban transport infrastructure including public buses and metro rail network. The budget has also made an outlay of ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years towards reforms-based and results-linked power distribution sector scheme to address the viability crisis in power distribution companiesIt also seeks to provide a bigger playing field to foreign capital in the field of infrastructure by proposing to make amendments to relevant legislations to allow debt financing of InVITs (infrastructure investment trusts) and REITs (real estate investment trusts) by foreign portfolio investors. “The FY22 budget, by announcing the setting up a development finance institutions (DFI) with a corpus of ₹20,000 crore will go a long way in filling up the gap created by the demise of erstwhile DFIs namely Industrial Finance Corporation of India, Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, and Industrial Development Bank of India. DFIs, unlike banks, besides bringing in the knowledge of project financing are known to have the patient capital suited for infrastructure financing. The debt financing of InVITs and REITs by foreign portfolio inflows and monetisation of operating public infrastructure assets are the right steps towards infrastructure financing,” said a note by India Ratings and Research.To be sure, some have pointed to part of the infra-push as being driven by the upcoming assembly elections in five states. “The budget announced construction of roads in states going for elections, is there any motive behind it? Why not other states? It announced road projects of 625km in West Bengal, but the state government has already constructed 88,841km of rural roads in 10 years, which has been recognised by the Government of India,” said Amit Mitra finance minister of West Bengal. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a dig at the government’s asset monetisation plan in a tweet criticising the Budget. “Forget putting cash in the hands of people, Modi Govt plans to handover India’s assets to his crony capitalist friends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-term-finance-and-a-bigger-playing-field-for-private-sector-to-lead-infra-push-101612206150958.html
02-02-2021||India||How the fiscal math changed during and after the pandemic?||When Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the 2020-21 Union Budget last year, she announced that the Revised Estimate (RE) for the 2019-20 fiscal deficit would be 3.8% of GDP, 50 basis points higher than the Budget Estimate (BE) of 3.3%. It was seen as an undesirable development by the markets. The BSE Sensex fell by 2.4% on February 1, 2020. Sitharaman pegged the 2021-22 fiscal deficit at 3.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Then the pandemic struck, making budgetary calculations completely irrelevant. Not only has the fiscal deficit reached an all-time high of 9.5% of GDP in 2020-21,as per the Revised Estimates (RE) given in the 2021-22 budget, it is not expected to come down anytime soon. Sitharaman said in her budget speech on Monday that she expects the fiscal deficit to come down to 4.5% by 2025-26. In normal times, this would have created a huge uproar. But these are not normal times, and the BSE Sensex endorsed the fiscal deviation, which is crucial for growth, by rising 5% on budget day. It is useful to understand how the government’s fiscal math changed during and after the pandemic, and the assumption behind the 2021-22 Budget Estimate (BE). India’s absolute fiscal deficit almost doubled from ₹9.3 lakh crore in 2019-20 to ₹19.5 lakh crore 2020-21 (RE). When compared to the 2020-21 BE numbers, the 2020-21 RE fiscal deficit has increased by 2.3 times. To be sure, this is not the additional government spending during the pandemic. Total central government spending increased 1.3 times from ₹26.9 lakh crore in 2019-20 to ₹34.5 lakh crore in 2020-21 (RE). When compared to the BE figure of ₹30.4 lakh crore for 2020-21, the increase was 13.5%. The rest of the increase in fiscal deficit can be attributed to two factors. The first is the fall in nominal GDP in 2020-21 , a contraction of 4.4%. With the denominator going down, the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP can increase for the same amount of absolute deficit. The other big reason for an increase in the fiscal deficit is a sharp fall in revenue collections, the biggest components of the three receipt items – revenue receipts, recovery of loans and other receipts (disinvestment). These three are subtracted from the government’s total spending to calculate the fiscal deficit. Revenue receipts, as per RE figures, fell short of the 2020-21 BE numbers by more than ₹4.6 lakh crore. Disinvestment income is expected to be just ₹32,000 crore (RE) against the BE target of ₹2.1 lakh crore. How is the fiscal math going to change in the next fiscal year? There is not much of a difference between the 2021-22 BE numbers with the 2020-21 RE numbers. The central government has retained spending at the levels seen during the pandemic. It also does not expect much of a revival in revenue receipts. The 2021-22 BE figure of ₹17.9 lakh crore is lower than the 2020-21 BE projection of ₹20.2 lakh crore. A disinvestment target of ₹1.75 lakh crore for 2021-22 (BE), when read with the ₹2.1 lakh crore target in 2020-21 (BE) and a realisation of just ₹32,000 crore (RE) means that the government will try to accomplish in the next fiscal year, what it started in 2020-21. Given the fact that the government has announced disinvestment of a general insurance company and a public sector bank — neither was on the cards earlier — this also suggests a moderation in expectations of disinvestment income. How realistic are the fiscal deficit calculations for 2021-22? The core assumption behind fiscal calculations, especially when there are no major changes in tax slabs, is the projected nominal GDP growth. Taxes, after all, are a fraction of nominal GDP. By assuming 14.4% nominal GDP growth in 2021-22, one percentage point less than what the Economic Survey said it will be, Budget 2021-22 seems to have taken a conservative approach. Finance minister Niramala Sitharaman admitted as much in an interview, saying that the finance ministry has been “reasonable... in assessing” what it can do. Most importantly, Union Budget 2021-22 has won a lot of praise for bringing a lot of off-budgetary spending back into the budget calculations. The biggest manifestation of this is the allocation for subsidy to the Food Corporation of India under the National Food Security Act from ₹77,983 crore in 2020-21 (BE) to ₹3.4 lakh crore in 2020-21 (RE) and ₹2 lakh crore in 2021-22 (BE). The higher fiscal deficit numbers, going forward, need to be seen in this context as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-fiscal-math-changed-during-and-after-the-pandemic-101612206089328.html
02-02-2021||India||What does the budget do to boost growth?||The 2021-22 budget, on the face of it, has given a massive fiscal boost to the economy. Fiscal deficit as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has gone up from the 2020-21 Budget Estimate (BE) of 3.5% to a massive 9.5% according to the Revised Estimate (RE) numbers. Fiscal deficit is expected to remain high going forward. It may only come down to 4.5% by 2025-26. Does this mean that the budget provides a massive fiscal boost to growth? A careful reading suggests a more nuanced picture. A large part of the increase in fiscal deficit is explained by lower tax collections. Gross Tax Revenue in 2021-22, as per the BE figures, is not expected to reach 2020-21 BE levels. In absolute terms, the 2021-22 fiscal deficit (BE) is expected to be lower than the 2020-21 fiscal deficit (RE) by ₹3 lakh crore. So, where will the boost to growth come from in 2021-22? The central government has pinned its hopes from public and private capital spending, and further enhancing ease of doing business. There is a direct boost to the first. Capital expenditure was increased from ₹4.12 lakh crore in 2020-21 (BE) to ₹4.39 lakh crore (RE) during the pandemic. This has been increased further to ₹5.54 lakh crore for 2021-22 (BE). This takes the share of central government capital expenditure in India’s GDP to 2.48% in 2021-22, the highest since 2015-16, the earliest period for which capital spending data is available at the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s (CMIE) database. In addition to the cap-ex push, the Budget also talks about incentivising state governments to take up additional investment expenditure. As far as private sector investment is concerned, the government has placed its bet on infrastructure and financial sector. In keeping with the targets laid down in the National Infrastructure Pipeline, which targets investment of ₹111 lakh crore by 2025, the Budget has announced three ways to boost infra spending: creating the institutional structure for it; focusing on monetising assets; and enhancing the share of capital expenditure in central and state budgets. The first will be taken care of by setting up a Development Finance Institution (DFI), while the second will implemented by setting up a National Monetization Pipeline which will involve toll roads, gas pipelines, airports and government owned warehouses. This, the budget speech says, will help in providing “viability to investors”. The budget has also announced the privatisation of two state-owned banks, a general insurance company, and an IPO for the Life Insurance Corporation, along with an increase in FDI limit from 49% to 74% in the insurance sector. The government clearly hopes that this will bring in fresh capital. The budget has also proposed a conciliation mechanism and mandated its use for quick resolution of contractual disputes for businesses dealing with central public sector enterprises. It has allocated ₹1.97 lakh crore to the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic manufacturing in 13 key sectors, so as to make companies in these an “integral part of global supply chains, possess core competence and cutting-edge technology”. The budget has also tried to boost the construction sector, a crucial source of non-farm employment by continuing to incentivise the affordable housing sector. Additional tax exemption of ₹1.5 lakh crore for affordable housing and a tax holiday for affordable housing projects have been extended by a year up to March 31, 2022. “The finance minister has presented a progressive budget, focused on achieving growth through capital investment, job creation, infrastructure and health care build out which will be part funded through disinvestment and privatisation. The finance minister has also kept direct tax rates unchanged and proposed to simplify contractual regulations and investment regulations and proposed creation of more enabling organizations”, said Bhavik Damodar, Partner, Deal Advisory, Office Managing Partner-Mumbai, KPMG in India. To be sure, the budget could also generate some headwinds to growth because of a roll back in revenue spending compared to the 2020-21 RE figures. While capital spending has seen an increase, revenue spending, especially on welfare heads such as MGNREGS and even the flagship PM-KISAN scheme has been reduced. Some experts believe that this ignores the crisis facing the poorest sections in the economy. “The proposed increased in capital expenditure is coming at the expense of non-capital expenditure, keeping aggregate spending the same. This shift is desirable in normal times, but in these times, it leaves a massive livelihoods crisis unaddressed”, said Amit Basole, an associate professor of economics at Azim Premji University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-does-the-budget-do-to-boost-growth-101612206029281.html
02-02-2021||India||Supreme Court recalls 2019 order on employee pension||The Supreme Court has recalled its 2019 order which had paved way for higher pension for employees by removing the current salary ceiling of ₹15,000.An SC bench, headed by Justice Uday U Lalit, allowed the review petitions filed by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and decided to reconsider the previous order that permitted grant of Provident Fund pension proportionate to the salary.The bench, which also included Justices Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, jointly heard the EPFO’s review petition and the appeal filed by the Central government on Friday last week. The court order was released a day ago.Starting February 25, the bench will now re-examine the 2018 Kerala high court judgement, which had asked the organisation to pay full pension to retiring employees on the basis of their total salary instead of capping the amount, on which the contribution of a pensioner is calculated, at a maximum of ₹15,000 per month.The HC had then noted that some workers made more contribution voluntarily towards EPFO but their pension calculation was on the ₹15,000 salary ceiling, which was not fair on workers post their retirement.Also read: Law ministry gets allocation for purchases of EVMs by ECThe top court, however, withdrew its approval to the HC judgment after hearing Attorney General KK Venugopal and senior advocate CA Sundaram, on behalf of the Union government and the EPFO, and agreed to review the correctness of the HC judgment. The bench further took note of an argument that the Kerala HC’s judgment would lead to benefit upon employees retrospectively which, in turn, would create great imbalance.Venugopal and Sundaram further pointed out that another bench in the Kerala HC has expressed doubts over its 2018 judgment in the pension matter and the case there had also been referred to a larger bench for a re-look.On April 1, 2019, by a brief order, the Supreme Court had dismissed the EPFO’s appeal against the Kerala HC’s judgment, compelling the retirement fund body to file a review petition. At the same time, the union labour ministry also decided to file a separate appeal against the HC’s judgment to highlight that such an order will make the organisation financially unviable since there will be shortage of several thousand crores every year.Citing the pendency of the case in the Supreme Court, the Kerala HC judgment was not implemented while the labour ministry pleaded for a stay of the HC ruling.At present, an organised sector employee pays 12 per cent of his basic salary as mandatory Employee Provident Fund (EPF) contribution every month and a matching amount is contributed by the employer. Of the employer’s contribution, 8.33 per cent goes towards pension contribution but this amount is capped at ₹1,250 a month. The remaining 3.67 per cent goes to the provident fund corpus.While the EPFO gets an EPS contribution of around ₹36,000 crore per annum from over 60 million subscribers, it has over 2.3 million pensioners, who receive a pension of ₹1,000 every month. Their contribution to PF is, however, less than a quarter of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-recalls-2019-order-on-employee-pension-101612206028694.html
02-02-2021||India||Sasikala may fight EC move on poll symbol||Expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader VK Sasikala is likely to challenge in the Supreme Court the Election Commission’s 2017 decision of allotting the party name and the iconic two-leaves symbol to sitting Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s party, her lawyer announced on Monday.At the time, two factions of the AIADMK were fighting for control of the party and the poll watchdog decided in favour of the Palaniswami-led faction. Sasikala was close aide of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa.“We will file a curative petition soon,” said Sasikala’s lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian. “We haven’t filed a case so far due to the pandemic and we had expected her to be released by August on remission. So we thought of filing it once she is out. We have to discuss.”Also read: TN poll battle heats up as Sasikala leaves hospitalOn November 23, 2017, the EC allotted Palaniswami-led faction with the ‘two leaves’ symbol after freezing it briefly when two factions – the other led by current Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam -- were vying for it following Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016. Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran challenged this decision in the Delhi high court, which upheld the EC order in 2019. The Supreme Court also dismissed two petitions -- in March 2019 and in July 2020.A curative petition is the last legal option in a case, and is usually filed if the petitioners believe that a legal error was committed while deciding a case. It is rare for curative petition to succeed. Tamil Nadu is scheduled to go the polls in April-May.Sasikala was hospitalised a week before her release from prison in Bengaluru on January 27 after serving a four-year jail term in a disproportionate assets case. On Sunday, she was discharged from the city’s Victoria hospital where she was treated for Covid-19. Sending out her first political message, Sasikala left the hospital in a car bearing the AIADMK flag. She is expected to return to Chennai WHEN after completing week-long quarantine in Bengaluru.AIADMK, which expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran on September 12, 2017, have condemned her for using the flag and termed it illegal. Law minister C V Shunmugam warned of legal action against ‘Sasikala or anyone’ who is not a member of the party and ‘misusing the flag’.But Dinakaran justified her move. Dinakaran, an independent MLA, floated the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) with some of Sasikala’s supporters who want her to unite them by reclaiming the AIADMK. Palaniswami, who is the chief ministerial candidate of the AIADMK-led National Democratic Alliance, has made clear that Sasikala will not be taken back.Sasikala briefly held the reins of the party after Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016 amidst a power struggle with her loyalist-turned-rebel Paneerselvam. She handpicked Palaniswami as chief minister before surrendering in prison but he later united with Paneerselvam. After ousting her, AIADMK created new posts with Paneerselvam as coordinator and Palaniswami as joint coordinator and Jayalalithaa as the ‘eternal general secretary’.Sasikala challenged this decision and the matter is pending before the Madras high court. The AIADMK expelled party functionaries who put up posters welcoming Sasikala after her release. “She may gain some supporters but the AIADMK status quo will continue,” says political analyst Ravindran Duraisamy. “The present AIADMK has contested the 2019 parliamentary elections and by-elections on the symbol and name without any hindrance. It’s a settled matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-may-fight-ec-move-on-poll-symbol-101612205068673.html
02-02-2021||India||Twitter temporarily blocks 250 handles amid farm stir||Twitter temporarily blocked in India, nearly 250 accounts that allegedly used a controversial hashtag after the central government asked the social media company to block access to the handles, in a move aimed “to prevent an escalation of violence” in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers agitation, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The local ban was imposed in the morning. By evening, the accounts were restored and the microblogging company said the content constituted free speech and was newsworthy. At least one of the handles to be restricted said it deleted a tweet that used the controversial hashtag.“Pending our discussions with the regulatory authorities, we temporarily withheld these accounts in India under our Country Withheld Content policy in response to a valid legal request from the Ministry of electronics and information technology(MeitY),” Twitter said. “During our subsequent meetings with the officials, Twitter conveyed that the accounts and tweets in question constitute free speech and are newsworthy. Therefore, these tweets and accounts have now been un-withheld. Protecting public conversation and transparency is fundamental to the work we do at Twitter,” the company added.HT reached out to MEITY but did not get a response immediately. MeitY issued the directions under section 69 (A) of the Information Technology Act after the ministry of home affairs (MHA) stepped in, the people cited above said. “The home ministry said that the tweets could lead to an adverse law and order situation. The accounts have been withheld to prevent an escalation of violence,” a government official familiar with the matter said.The action was criticised by activists and free speech advocates who said the temporary suspension of the accounts violated constitutional rights to freedom of speech, and alleged the microblogging site had different standards of moderation and complying to government orders in different countries.Under Section 69(A) of the IT Act, the government can suspend accounts that pose a threat to public order. It wasn’t immediately clear if the owners of the blocked handles were notified in advance. Users outside India could still see tweets from them.Among the handles was that of Kisan Ekta Morcha, a farm organisation linked to the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is an umbrella group leading the ongoing farmers’ protest on Delhi’s borders. Action was also taken again the Twitter accounts of media outlet Caravan, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar, activist Hansraj Meena, former Lok Sabha MP and CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim, and actor Sushant Singh, among others. All accounts were restored by evening.Withholding an account under Twitter’s policy restricts access to posts by the user. This is different from a suspension, as the account can be made available again and the restrictions are limited to the “specific jurisdiction that has issued the valid legal demand or where the content has been found to violate local law”. The accounts, according to the message displayed by the site, were withheld in India upon receipt of a legal demand. They are accessible outside the country.The government official cited above said MHA conveyed to MeitY last week that the “situation had the potential to spiral”. “The accounts were tweeting about an impending farmer genocide. The government can’t allow anyone to incite violence,” the official said.The blocking of Prasar Bharati CEO Shekhar’s account was likely a mistake because he drew the government’s attention to the controversial hashtag, the same official added.On January 27, the microblogging website took down at least 500 accounts for “spam and platform manipulation”, a day after violence erupted during a rally by farmers in the national capital on Republic Day.Digital rights advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation tweeted that decision to withhold accounts was taken under the “opaque” IT Act.“Section 69A and the IT blocking rules prevent intermediaries like Twitter from disclosing any information about blocking of an account or tweet. The confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the IT Blocking Rules creates a bizarre situation where citizens have the right to challenge blocking of online content, but they are unable to do so because they don’t have access to these legal orders,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-temporarily-blocks-250-handles-amid-farm-stir-101612205008568.html

02-02-2021||Today's||Budget 2021-22: Sitharaman borrows a leaf out of Pujara’s notebook||The expectations were running high, but finance minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman had to strike a delicate balance between fiscal expansionism and fiscal prudence in Budget 2021-22. Nobody denies that the economy needs a strong booster shot with growth at a historical low, amid Covid-19. However, excessive borrowing this year in times of uncertainty would have curtailed the room for the government to address this evolving situation in the future.The most critical number in the budget ---- fiscal deficit for FY21-22 ---- stands at 6.8% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a sharp decrease from the 9.5% estimated for FY20-21. Even before the pandemic struck India, government borrowings were already in the shaky territory – the actual fiscal deficit for 2019-20 was 4.6% of GDP, the highest since 2012-13, reflecting the precarious nature of public finances. In keeping with the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, (FRBM), the path for consolidation outlined in last year’s budget would have cut fiscal deficit to 3.1% of GDP and eliminated the primary deficit (borrowings excluding expenses on interest payments) by 2022-23. But Covid-19 derailed that plan. The government has made no projections for 2022-23 and 2023-24 due to an impending amendment to the FBRM Act. However, FM said that the Centre’s fiscal deficit will be brought down to below 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26. Clearly, a gentler path towards fiscal consolidation is being planned. This is a positive sign in uncertain times.Another central feature of this year’s budget is the paltry increase in government expenditure. The Centre’s outlays will increase by less than 1% over (the historically high) the revised estimates of 2020-21. This suggests that much of the heavy-lifting in fiscal policy is either behind us or limited to the next three months with an over 13% increase in revised expenditure over the budgetary figures for 2020-21.However, this 13% boost deserves a closer look. The government will spend an additional ₹3 lakh crore on food subsidy for the poor in 2020-21, making up almost 75% of the ₹4 lakh crore-gap between budgeted and estimated expenditures in the pandemic year. Although automatic stabilisers played a crucial role in countercyclical fiscal policy –government expenditure didn’t fall even while revenues dried up – where is the other stimulus spending promised in the several mini-budgets last year? There are some welcome changes announced in the quality of government expenditure. Almost 80% of borrowings in 2020-21 were undertaken to finance deficit on the revenue account. If the budgetary estimates hold, this will fall to about three-fourths in 2021-22. This government has made capital spending a centrepiece of its vision for India – the gross budgetary support for asset creation will climb to almost 2.5% of GDP, making up 16% of all government outlays. This is a significant boost from the average CAPEX of 1.7% of GDP from 2011-19. Many will ask whether the actual fiscal deficit is likely to be within the ballpark of the budgetary estimates. A lot will rely on success in meeting disinvestment targets.Except for two years in the past decade (2017-19), realised disinvestment receipts have been consistently lower than what was budgeted for. Worryingly, this gap exacerbated in the last two financial years, with collections for 2019-20 being half of budgetary estimates and only 15% in 2020-21. This year, the government hopes to collect ₹1.75 lakh crore – a record figure – but progress on Air India’s sale gives hope.On the tax front, no significant changes in rates on personal income were announced. Thankfully, the rumours of a Covid-19 cess or a higher surcharge – a hare-brained idea during a recession - remained just that. However, as is usual, the budget relies on optimistic targets for tax collection. It works with the assumption of 14.4% nominal GDP growth, causing a 17% spike in tax revenues. The implied buoyancy of gross tax revenue - increase in tax collection if income grows by 1% - is a bit higher than historical averages computed by the Reserve Bank of India. Thus, actual deficit might be considerably more than what is projected in the Budget. If the long-term estimates for buoyancy hold in 2021-22, the Centre’s kitty will shrink by ₹67,000 crore from what is budgeted for corporate and income taxes alone. To borrow the chief economic adviser’s analogy, this is not a big-bang Rishabh Pant budget, although that doesn’t mean it is bad. Particularly impressive is the keenness showed by FM in imparting integrity to fiscal numbers. Phasing out opaque extra-budgetary borrowings deserves our full compliments.Rising capital expenditure is a welcome sign too –RBI estimates that each rupee spent on creating long-term assets adds over seven times as much to GDP compared to expenditure on current items like subsidies and salaries.Finally, an unhurried move towards fiscal consolidation and the cushion of a 60-time bigger contingency fund suggests that the government is balancing caution with a willingness to do more in the future if required.In that, Nirmala Sitharaman might have borrowed a leaf out of Pujara’s notebook.Sarthak Agrawal is an economist from the University of Oxford, and previously a researcher at the London-based Institute for Fiscal StudiesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/budget-2021-22-sitharaman-borrows-a-leaf-out-of-pujara-s-notebook-101612277507215.html
02-02-2021||Today's||Decoding the budget and the economics of welfare||Covid-19 is a crisis like no other. And, expectedly, it has wreaked havoc on the Government of India (GoI)’s financial arithmetic as it struggled to deal with collapsing tax revenues and increased expenditure pressures. Therefore, there are two questions that need to be asked of the FY 2021 budget.How did the Union government reorient its macro-fiscal position to counteract the economic fallout of the pandemic and what does this reveal about the nature of the policy choices made by the government to respond to the Covid-19-induced economic crisis? Second, what does the budget offer as a policy pathway to nurture the economy back to health in FY 2021-22?In FY 21, the lockdown-induced freeze on the economy expectedly resulted in a collapse in revenues while expenditure pressures increased. Revenue receipts collapsed from ₹20.2 lakh crore to ₹15.5 lakh crore, expenditure increased from ₹30.4 lakh crore to ₹34.5 lakh crore, as did the one number that the government has thus far worried about the most — the fiscal deficit.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman must be congratulated for breaking with tradition and being transparent about the fiscal deficit numbers while offering a path to fiscal consolidation by FY 2025-26. Importantly, she has discontinued the practice of off-budget borrowing for food subsidy. However, a closer look at the numbers reveals a more complex picture.First, while tax revenues fell, the real hit to the Centre’s finances came from a fall in disinvestment receipts and bringing off budget expenditure back on to the budget. The fall in net tax revenue to the Centre is responsible for a mere 1% of the rise in fiscal deficit numbers. Second, most of the increase in expenditure outlays is driven by the food and fertiliser subsidy (around 80%). Increases in health accounted for 3.88%. Third, the share of states in the divisible pool of taxes fell from 32% in the budgeted estimates to 28.9% (Revised Estimates 2020-21).Three facts emerge about the macro fiscal picture. First, the government has increasingly relied on the assumption that proceeds from disinvestment will fund its expenditure commitments. In good times, this is bad fiscal management. But in times of pandemic, this can be seriously damaging. The government’s reluctance to adopt an expansionary fiscal stance in response to the pandemic is a consequence of historical fiscal mismanagement rather than the Covid-19-induced economic shock. The emphasis on disinvestment in this budget, while welcome, risks a similar fate. The government will have to urgently double down in FY 22 to meet these targets.Second, expenditure increases in FY 21 were limited to subsidies and essential relief through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). Overall, in FY 21, expenditure increased from a 13.53% of GDP Budget Estimates (BE) to 17.74% in RE. However, because GDP contracted significantly in FY 21, these numbers overstate the magnitude of increase in expenditure. It is important to note that transfers from centrally-sponsored schemes (including MGNREGS whose allocations increased by 81% over budget estimates) increased by 14%, suggesting significant contraction in expenditure for other schemes in FY 21. Finally, state governments, at the frontlines of the Covid-19 battle, have been forced to rely on market borrowing as their share in the central government taxes fell significantly. The consequences of this on state budgets, that have displayed far greater fiscal discipline than the Centre will be significant, in the long-term.As this column noted in a pre-budget piece, the post-lockdown economic recovery is showing signs of deepening structural inequality. Economic activity has reached near pre-pandemic levels, but this is largely profit-led. Large listed firms have profited at the cost of small firms and the informal sector. And the scars in the labour market, particularly informal labour, run deep. Reversing this trend is both a moral imperative and good economic sense — after all, if purchasing power remains low for the bulk of the economy, demand will collapse.In this context, the FY 22 budget ought to have increased expenditure for welfare, provided for an inclusive social protection architecture that protects vulnerable groups especially migrant workers, and increased capital expenditure. At first glance, the government has only done the last.Several important announcements have aimed at reforming what economist Arvind Subramanian has called the “software” — a bad bank, the proposal for a DFI, and bank recapitalisation. All of these are steps in the right direction. However, these increases will not immediately translate into employment and increased wages for the poor.There are continuing governance challenges, which will not be addressed overnight. In this context, it is a mistake to assume that FY 22 will present space to the government to curtail its welfare expenditures. But the FY 22 budget cuts allocations to food subsidy and MGNREGS. It offers no comfort that the government, in response to the migrant crisis, will address the extreme vulnerabilities faced by India’s informal sector and urban workers. Expenditure in FY 22 will see little planned growth over FY 21.The pandemic has disproportionately impacted India’s poor and vulnerable. The hope was that this budget would, by adopting an expansionist fiscal stance, respond to their needs while putting the economy back on track. It has not.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive of the Centre for Policy Research The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/decoding-the-budget-and-the-economics-of-welfare-101612199430638.html
