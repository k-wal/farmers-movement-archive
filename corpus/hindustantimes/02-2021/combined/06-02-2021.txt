Recently, students living in and around Haryana and Delhi were unable to attend online classes as there was an internet shutdown due to the ongoing farmer protests.The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) recently called around 200 of its students from across the country to return to the campus, especially those facing internet or broadband trouble. Students from affected areas in Haryana and Delhi have been asked to travel back to their campuses.“Students, who are having internet or power-related problems, have been allowed to come back to the campus. Those having broadband at home do not seem to have any problem. On top of that, if anyone points out any network interruption, the respective professors have also given them additional time towards submission of assignments, etc.,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of the institute.The state government earlier this month decided to restart colleges and universities from February 15. State higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said colleges and universities will be able to restart physical classes after a gap of over 10 months. However, it has restricted the attendance in physical classes with only 50% students allowed to attend lectures physically at a time.The restriction on attendance will continue for a month. The state government will take further decisions after reviewing the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-starts-bringing-back-students-affected-by-internet-troubles-101612636179835.html
06-02-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz: Tracker on all those making, or faking, news||Students submit answer sheets, PU puts off exams due to glitch Memes trolling Panjab University have again started doing the rounds on social media after the exams of environment and road safety education and violence against women and children were put off on Friday due to a technical glitch. Students had even submitted their answer sheets when the exam was postponed. An extension for Chandigarh MC commissioner? The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation special general house meeting on the budget was a speedy affair with some tense moments when BJP councillors and a Congress member exchanged barbs. But the members burst out laughing when former mayor Rajesh Kalia, while praising the budget, told mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and MC commissioner KK Yadav, “Aap dono ki jodi bani rahe (May this partnership continue).” Sharma was quick to respond, “Aap chahete hei commissioner sahab gets an extension (You want the commissioner to get an extension).” Yadav’s three-year term ends this May. High-flying Mohali mayoral nominee does not own a car Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu’s brother, Amarjeet SinghSidhu, who is the Congress mayoral candidate in the Mohali municipal corporation elections, has declared he does not own a car in an affidavit filed before the returning officer last week. Popular as Jeeti, he is a liquor contractor and runs a real estate business. A director in the SAS Nagar Central Cooperative Bank Limited, he is often seen travelling in style in a Toyota Fortuner. Incidentally, former mayor and real estate baron Kulwant Singh, who heads the Azad Group in these elections, owns assets worth ₹248 crore but does not own a car either. He has only two two-wheelers in his name! Meet the real garbage collectors During a recent meeting with members of the Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (Crawfed), Chandigarh mayor Ravi Kant Sharma shared an interesting perspective on garbage collectors. “We call them kudewalas (garbage collectors) when it is we who are the real kudewalas. The garbage collectors are swachhta walas (sanitation staff) who help ensure our homes and surroundings are clean.” The mayor assured the residents at the meeting that the garbage collectors will retain their jobs in the new system of collection and will continue to be posted in localities where they have been working.

06-02-2021||Mumbai||PM Modi should make phone call to resolve deadlock: MNS chief||Amid speculations that Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray is moving closer to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Thackeray on Saturday attacked the BJP over the ongoing farmer’s protest. He said that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi should make a ‘phone call’ to resolve the farmer’s stir. He also indirectly slammed PM Modi saying that if the Centre does not want non-Indians to give out opinion on issues of India, then he should not have campaigned for former United States president Donald Trump.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, the MNS chief spoke on varied issues including the Maharashtra government’s U turn on giving relief to consumers for inflated bills. He also targeted the BJP and Shiv Sena for playing politics over renaming Aurangabad to Sambhaji Nagar. He asked why the BJP did not rename the city when it was in power at the Centre and in Maharashtra between 2014 and 2019.In a bid to revive his party’s political future, the MNS has adopted the hard-line Hindutva stand — the space that fell vacant as the Sena no longer advocates stringent Hindutva lines after forming alliance with the Congress and NCP. Thackeray said he will visit the Ram temple in Ayodhya soon. The date, however, is not decided, he said. Political observers said Thackeray cozy-ing up to the BJP could be early signs of an alliance in the offing ahead of Mumbai civic election. The BJP would need the MNS to cut into the Marathi votes of the Sena. Thackeray said that if Union ministers are unable to break the deadlock in discussions with the farmers then PM Modi should intervene to resolve it. He, however, backed the Centre’s law and said there could be some shortcoming which must be rectified.He said the issue has stretched on for too long. “I have not seen such security at China or Pakistan border. There was no need for such arrangement for farmers,” he said. Referring to PM Modi’s statement in all-party meeting where he said he is a “phone call away”, Thackeray added, “I think that if PM has said he is a phone call away then he should pick up the phone and put an end to this. If his agriculture minister or any other minister cannot find a solution in talks, then the PM should pay attention to this issue.”The MNS chief further attacked PM Modi and said there was no need to for the Centre to issue clarification after pop singer Rihanna tweeted on the farmer’s agitation. “They say that outsiders should not get involved in matters of the country. Then by that same logic there was no need to hold rallies saying abki bar, Trump Sarkar; it was that country’s internal matter,” he said in an indirect reference to PM Modi’s Howdy Modi event in Houston.Meanwhile, taking on the Maharashtra government over on not providing relief to power consumers, Thackeray alleged that the “U turn” happened after a meeting between NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Adani. He alleged there would have been some “give and take” between power companies and the government.“First the minister said they would give relief to consumers. Governor asked me to meet Sharad Pawar. After I met him, he asked me to give letters in the name of the power companies like Adani, MSEB, etc. Then after five-six days, I got to know that Adani met Pawar at his home. I do not know what they discussed but after the meeting, the government said that there will not be any relief given to consumers,” Thackeray said.The MNS chief further slammed former allies — the BJP and Sena — on the issue of renaming Aurangabad. He said it is merely politics ahead of the civic elections in the city. “Why was the name not changed when the BJP and Sena were in power? Why are you politicising it now? The BJP and Sena must answer this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm-modi-should-make-phone-call-to-resolve-deadlock-mns-chief-101612635879449.html
06-02-2021||Other||Wildbuzz: Under the eagle’s jackboot||A gang of petty thieves runs away with a diamond. They are intercepted by a band of dacoits who snatch the diamond from the lesser thieves. A Dirty Harry cop takes on the dacoits and seizes the booty for himself. So went a mirror incident, staged in Nature’s arena and highlighting the power of a majestic Tawny eagle to pirate, ie forcibly grab or steal, the prey taken down by other hunters. It ended with the eagle placing its powerful leg and talons on the booty, a Neelgai calf. The eagle bore such an imperious, triumphal, ‘don’t mess with me, this is my possession’ look in the eyes that it was as if the proverbial jackboot had without remorse stamped out resistance. Or, as if a ‘ghamandi’ (proud) rajah had placed his boot on a tiger trophy to strike a pose for a palace wall portrait.Sandipan Ghosh, a Kolkata-based assistant professor of geography, is also a passionate wildlife photographer. He was reveling in his passion outside the famous carcass dumping ground in Bikaner (Rajasthan) where migratory/resident raptors alight to feed. “There were abandoned mines and I chanced upon stray dogs hounding a Neelgai calf the size of a Black buck female. The calf stumbled into a mine and broke a leg. The dogs pulled the wounded calf out but before they could start savaging it alive, four migratory griffon vultures landed and chased away the dog pack. The vultures were just about settling over the twitching calf when a Tawny eagle swooped hard on the vultures and chased them away. The lone conqueror proceeded to tear open the eyes and neck of the still-alive calf with its ruthless beak while pinning the prey down with its mighty talons. The eagle ate parts of the calf and soon crows descended to scavenge the remains. I was left spellbound by the sequence of Nature’s thriller,” Ghosh told this writer.The rolling stonesA ramble up the ‘choes’ or dry rivulets of the Shivaliks affords views of ‘flower beds cast in stones of many-splendoured hues and shapes’. Some are smooth and lustrous as if nature had leveraged its powers of attrition to act as an accomplished gem cutter and polisher. Others are holed through to assume forms that appear strange, curious and yet vaguely familiar to the human creative vision. For example, two holes set closely together in a rock that I chanced upon in a Siswan dam rivulet evoked an analogy to a human skull, though overall it appeared as an esoteric Ganesha statue!The effects of rain splash and water in spate are prime reasons for holes. “The rocks are carbonate rich and the white patches, veins and fragments are of carbonates which get dissolved in water on prolonged action of weathering. Sometimes, big fragments which are enclosed in the rock having a layer of carbonates, get loosened on removal of carbonate layer and come out leaving a hole behind,” Prof. RS Chaudhri, former Chairman and Director of Geology (PU), told this writer.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wildbuzz-under-the-eagle-s-jackboot-101612635759505.html
06-02-2021||Delhi||Six Delhi hospitals declared ‘non-Covid’ facilities||The Covid-19 test positivity rate in the national capital fell to 0.19% on Saturday as the city reported 123 new cases of the coronavirus disease and added four more fatalities in the last 24 hours, according to the state government’s daily health bulletin.The sustained drop in daily new infections led the Delhi government to declare six of its hospitals “non-Covid” facilities, which means these hospitals were removed from the list of dedicated Covid facilities, and paving the way for the resumption of complete non-Covid services there. These include Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Acharya Shree Bhikshu Hospital and SRC Hospital.Along with this, the government also decided to reduce the number of reserve Covid-19 beds in five government hospitals - Lok Nayak Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Burari Hospital and Ambedkar Nagar Hospital.As per the Saturday bulletin, 63,322 tests were conducted in the preceding 24 hours, and 39,543 of these used the RT-PCR method, while the remaining used rapid antigen kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/six-delhi-hospitals-declared-non-covid-facilities-101612634193673.html
06-02-2021||Other||Witerati: What’s in a name? Fame and rename!||It’s the season of many a new name, rename and meme that might poke Shakespeare in his grave to do a rethink of his fabled phrase-ism, “What’s in a name?” The name game has tossed up tribes of Tweeple that have to do with a game, fame or even a meme. The adage alluding to “greatness”, holds true for the name game, too -- Some are born with a name fashioned for fame, some acquire name fame, some have name fame thrust upon them. To the manner born This tribe of Tweeple has a name destined for fame riding its DNA. Future name fame comes embedded in their chromosomes, the way instant noodles ‘deliver’ results the minute they’re barely out of the packet. The way Twitterverse erupts into a tizzy over tinsel town kids -- the latest ‘viral’ being the ‘Virushka’ baby name guessing game --- is something that was unimaginable in the age our Gen navigated the universe in knickerbockers, polka frocks or pigtails. Gone are the days when kids blithely lived in anonymity as “Pappu” or “Pinki” and even star kids were content being christened Chintu, Lolo or Bebo. Now, they’re content not with ‘following’ suit, but boasting a name that begets a 10K or more ‘following’. Poor new rich kid on the block, who has perhaps not yet even ‘batted’ an eyelid at the star status she’s born into, hardly knows she’s already in the eye of an internet frenzy. The Poster Boy of this tinsel town tribe is none other than ‘Saifeena’ offspring Taimur Ali Khan. Taimur has done for Junior India’s Fifteen Minutes of Fame what ‘Baby Bink’ did for cherubic childhood by giving it ‘Baby’s Day Out’ on Celluloid. Taimur is to desi cherubic celebrity-hood what Prince George is to British royalty-hood. It’s another story that Taimur’s trending hashtag-ism is tad threatened with the arrival of Baby Vamika and his sibling-to-be, prodding Twitterverse to stage a meme fest that spelt the threat thus: “Fame sankat mein hai!” The curious case of Baby Vamika poised to be the Princess Charlotte of Junior India’s Royalty-hood. To be or not to be a rename Move over Kamala. Enter Kamalam. Barely had Kamala (Harris) begun basking in newly anointed fame that there popped a phonetic rival (oops, or is it “phoney” rival?) name, which threatened to gobble her Time Out on Twitterverse, for better or adverse. Have you ever while tucking into an exotic fruit salad suddenly felt like choking? Nah, not because one of the specimens from Nature’s flora is unpalatable, but because its nomenclature is tad hard to swallow. That’s the taste Tweeple were dished out by India Redefining’s latest renaming. Riding the ‘Chini Kum” narrative, so hard was it to swallow the Dragon Fruit renaming as ‘Kamalam’ that the meme fest it did spark had a Netizen snark, “What if we renamed the Euro the rupee … What if we renamed coronavirus … Abanindranath. Would it give up and just do paintings?” When the whole Twitterverse dishes out a meme over the rename, can our Lollita ji & Co be far behind? Seeing the “Kamalam” rename blooming in ‘breaking news’, Lamba ji lands his muse. “How about it if I also get renamed?’ he preens pompously. Lollita goggles and glares as if his muse is cause for amuse. “How about …?” Lamba ji fumbles for fame-friendly renames. Lollita obliges caustically, “How about ‘Kum Akalam’!” The curious case of “What’s in a Name?” … A Meme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/witerati-what-s-in-a-name-fame-and-rename-101612635699849.html
06-02-2021||Other||A spoonful of the good old: Four pages of the handwritten word||Last week, I found myself in a quaint position. As a part of my writing routine, I wake up to a mug of chai, open my laptop, and glide straight into action. But no. Not this morning. Something pulled me away from my keyboard and the screen, the mouse pad and the wi-fi. I was in the mood to write but not in the mood to tap away on a digital medium. So, I reached out to the drawer, quickly picked a diary, and started to pen down my thoughts. The alphabets took shape. The pages began to fill up as the blue ink made twists and turns, crests and troughs, curves and lines, scribbles and crosses. Occasional unrecognisable drawings accompanied the readable words. They laid bare the atmosphere of my mind.Time passed like a flash. I help up the first draft of my thoughts. Four pages of the handwritten word moistened on the edge by an accidental drop of tea.Something felt different. I smiled.I could not just visualise but also touch my thoughts as they took shape on paper. Each sentence had an identity of its own. Not because the thoughts were unique but because when written, each word captures a thought that embodies the author’s personality. Slanted words, straight words, hastily written, fully formed letters, trailing off the margins, using crutches to join one with the other, hard-pressed words dark and bold, faint words with a light touch of the nib. Quite a change from the linear punching of words via keypads and keyboards every day. The pages in my diary didn’t look neat and clean or aligned. My alphabets did what they wanted. They were messy. The lines were asymmetrical. But they were real. And they were me. I was tempted to hide the tea stain by turning the paper inward only to laugh and hold back as I remembered my childhood memory of how angry it made my teachers when I made donkey’s ears!There is something so beautiful and connected about translating thoughts into handwritten notes, bringing with them an added element of permanence one aches to hold on to. Once the page is full, we have to move to a new base to write more. We can’t just press Control-A and Delete to use the same word document aka page again and again. We may choose to discard the page. Tear it. Crush it. Throw it in a paper basket. But is it that easy? Haven’t we experienced a sense of parting with our notebooks and marked textbooks, diaries and folders, even when we know the content in them is no longer relevant? Haven’t we been at the crossroads of a bittersweet feeling when we have to decide between throwing or not throwing an old diary or journal or even a piece of paper that holds our long-forgotten thoughts? One glance at those handwritten words and it is hard to miss how they bring alive what, why and how of the person we were, at that time, at that moment. And for me, that extends even to work notes from years ago. They open up to me incredible back stories of my evolution as a professional.In contrast, we wouldn’t take a second to decide whether we want to delete an entire folder of the written word from our computers, right? Let alone feeling a tinge of parting, we would happily go a step ahead and wipe off its existence permanently by emptying the Recycle Bin!Of course, we must use the power of technology and the virtual world to create and communicate in all forms digitally. In large volumes, across the globe. And I had to go back to my laptop and convert my four pages of the handwritten word into the digital format to email it to its destination. Yes, it was a double effort. But a tiny one for the experience of tasting a spoonful of the good old.Anusha Singh is a Mumbai-based corporate communications consultant and a columnist.

06-02-2021||Other||Guest column: Covid-19 taught us the value of offline relationships||At the beginning of 2020, my new year’s resolution involved a lot more book reading and a lot less inane social media scavenging. Marching into the new year armed with a renewed sense of self, I boldly and successfully implemented a month-long exile from my Instagram account and significantly reduced my daily activity on Twitter to once in a couple of days. And then came March torpedoing all our best laid plans. While the novel coronavirus wreaked havoc outside of our homes, swiftly fracturing both our mobility and sanities and banishing us into an asylum of isolation, another kind of pandemic manifested itself within our homes. With connections to the offline world short circuited, the world clung to frantic and increased online connections, losing themselves unabashedly to the addictive dungeons of the World Wide Web. I found myself back on social media in no time. Between toddler tantrums, toilet training, marathon feeding, changing and cooking sessions, that felt like endless abysses in our home bubbles, a quick thumb-scroll on the device started to become the norm. With a spouse working late hours sequestered in the home office for the most part of the day, even the joyous company of a two-year old can start to give way to a subdued but lingering loneliness. I was glad to be able to reach out to old friends around the world while being shackled all the while to my sofa. Recipes and jokes with old friends from Abu Dhabi, Munich and India, zoom calls with the motley gang from Spain, Dubai, South Africa, USA and Germany, all raising a glass on the video call after their respective long days, and the welcoming WhatsApp calls with family back home in India – the soothing balms to our painful predicaments. It was heartening to note that in these testing times technology was able to keep our usual verbosity ventilated, albeit virtually. But we knew it was always going to be a band-aid fix until we could finally reach an airport, take a flight and embrace each other with real, offline, in-person hugs. It was especially heart-wrenching when the toddler would push isolated suitcases towards the door and announce that he was “going to fly in an airplane!” It has been a year and we still haven’t been able to fulfil that wish. And then during the course of the year, something happened. Having just moved to a new country in the midst of the unmitigated monster that the pandemic was turning out to be, we started to make some new connections. When the COVID numbers began to ease up a little towards the onset of July, we gradually started to allow ourselves some socially distanced and masked meetings. Strangers and neighbours started to become friends. The doorbell would often ring with a delivery from another floor of some home-cooked Indian delicacy -a box of Halwa, some Indian sweets like Laddoos and Rice Kheer and even some freshly baked Focaccia bread. It wasn’t the family we had been yearning for since months, but it was certainly starting to feel a lot like home. A tradition of frequently getting together on a different floor each time with good food and better company began on weekends. Whosoever was slated for a grocery run would text the others to ask if anything was needed urgently. A medical emergency would mean the kids would be dropped off for a play date instantly and without hesitation. For most Indians – home or abroad, the magnanimity of the festival of Diwali cannot be obscured even during an ongoing pandemic. The family back home had been sorely missed this year but this newly acquired surrogate family had kept the spirit of the festival alive and somewhat salved the pangs of yearning by hosting a small, homely Diwali dinner. A sense of online fatigue has now set in, both among children with their online classes and adults with home-bound work and increased social media usage as a result of restricted outdoor activity. Netflix has broken all revenue records this past year and the virulent Twitter army continues to scale new heights of intolerance and animosity. Living in “the audacity of hope” – a phrase I borrow from former president of USA Barack Obama (the title of one of his books) – with a vaccine hovering over the horizon but still no definitive end in sight, I have learned to find comfort in the little things. To shun toxicity in the online world and simultaneously appreciate and allocate more of my time to the small offline moments of joyous disruptions from the mundanity of our current routines. “Read the story again mumma”, pleads my son, his head on my arm as he leans in for the tenth story reading of The Little Red Riding Hood. There is no number of likes or followers on social media that will ever be worth giving up a moment like this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/guest-column-covid-19-taught-us-the-value-of-offline-relationships-101612635639558.html

The work was boycotted as the administration deferred hearing of cases listed in February to May-June. The lawyers had even decided to approach the Supreme Court and the Centre, seeking transfer of chief justice and boycott of his court. However, after a meeting on February 4 between lawyers and the HC administration, these resolutions were taken back.SOPs issued by HC admnAs per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) announced by the HC administration, e-passes will be issued to only one advocate in a case and his/her clerk.

06-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 144 volunteers take part in phase 3 trial of Russian vaccine||After Covishield and Covaxin, Mumbai has started the clinical trial of a third vaccine — Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine at the government-run St George hospital. Already 144 volunteers have taken the first shot of the vaccine in January for the third phase of the trial.In November 2020, the hospital had participated in the second phase of trial of the vaccine. During that, 18 volunteers had registered themselves for the trial. Out of this, six of them were doctors. Following which, in January, the third phase was initiated at the hospital.“We started the third phase of the trial on January 20 which was concluded on January 30,” said Dr Akash Khobragade, superintendent of the hospital.The trial was kept under the carpet to maintain its confidentiality. But despite this, the hospital received overwhelming response from volunteers, especially doctors from private hospitals.“Initially, we were given the target to vaccinate only 100 volunteers. But later, we started getting calls from the public and doctors from private hospitals who showed interest in taking part in the trial. Then the number rose to 144 volunteers. Of this, 25 of the volunteers are doctors from private hospitals,” said Dr Khobragade.The new analysis of data from 20,000 phase three trial participants, published in the medical journal The Lancet, claimed that the vaccine provides more than 90% efficiency against Sars-Cov-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19. Sputnik V shots help the body produce antibodies which are specially tailored to the coronavirus which helps the immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters it for real.“Sputnik V is one of the three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90%,” reads the official website of the manufacturer.Among the 144 volunteers, none of them reported any severe adverse effect of the vaccine. “Except a new developed minor fever which is common in any immunisation process,” said Dr Khobragade.Just like Covaxin and Covishield, this vaccine also has two shots. The second one is given after 28 days of taking the first shot. “From next week, we will start providing the second shot to the volunteers. But they will be followed up for the next seven months to check if anyone develops any adverse effect or get infected with Covid-19,” he added.However, unlike Pfizerand BioNTech vaccine, Sputnik V can be stored in a fridge rather than a freezer, which makes it easier to transport and distribute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-144-volunteers-take-part-in-phase-3-trial-of-russian-vaccine-101612635399512.html
06-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra vaccinates close to half a million beneficiaries||Maharashtra has inoculated close to half a million beneficiaries in the nationwide vaccination drive, after 37,862 people received the shots on Saturday. A total of 472,805 beneficiaries have been vaccinated in 14 sessions since January 16. Of them, 444,448 are healthcare workers (HCWs) and 25,600 are frontline workers (FLWs). Maharashtra has around 800,000 HCWs and 580,000 FLWs registered on the CoWIN app, which has been developed by the Centre to manage the vaccination drive. The state had targeted 71,632 beneficiaries across 661 centres on Saturday, but achieved 53% of this target, according to the health department. Of the 37,862 inoculated on Saturday, 25,709 were HCWs and 12,153 were FLWs. There has been a steady rise in numbers since February 3, the first day of vaccination for FLWs, when 793 were vaccinated. Of the total vaccinated beneficiaries in the state, 4,601 across six centres have received Covaxin, made by Bharat Biotech, with the highest number of recipients at Nagpur (1,204), Amravati (1,173) and Pune (678). Across Mumbai’s 21 centres, 6,115 beneficiaries were vaccinated on Saturday and the city achieved 78% of its daily target. A total of 75,751 people have been inoculated across the island city and suburban Mumbai till date.

High turnouts were also reported in Buldhana (83%), Nashik (80%), and Gondia (80%). Low turnouts were recorded at Latur (30%), Beed (31%) and Jalgaon (32%). “We are expecting a rise in turnout of FLWs from next week. We are still facing issues of doubt among people over vaccines, which is affecting our daily targets,” said a senior official requesting anonymity. “From next week, we expect to start giving second shots of vaccine to HCWs who got the first shot 28 days ago. This will also help increase the daily turnout,” he added. Each beneficiary is required to take two shots of the vaccine, with a gap of 28 days. On Saturday, Maharashtra recorded 2,768 new cases of Covid-19, taking the state’s tally to 2,041,398. With 25 new reported deaths, the total death toll stands at 51,280.

06-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi-NCR peaceful as 40,000 security personnel keep vigil during ‘chakka jam’||Delhi-NCR remained peaceful on Saturday — with police and paramilitary forces covering every inch of the city, barricades coming up at all strategic points to deter protesters and some Metro stations shutting their gates for more than five hours — as thousands of farmers held a “chakka jam” protest to press for the repealing of three contentious farm laws that the Central government had passed in September last year.Police said at least 62 protesters were detained from outside Shaheedi Park near ITO in central Delhi on Saturday where they had gathered to hold a demonstration in solidarity with the ongoing farmers’ agitation. All the detained persons were let off in the evening and no first information report (FIR) was registered against them.On Saturday, the three-hour-long chakka jam protest called by farm unions concluded peacefully in Delhi amid heightened security and full-scale police deployment to prevent a rerun of violence that had taken place on Republic Day. On Saturday, nearly 40,000 security personnel from Delhi Police and from the paramilitary forces fanned out across the capital to maintain law and order on the streets.Authorities also suspended internet connectivity at three protest sites of Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri, as well as adjoining areas, for 24 hours till Saturday night. The entry and exit gates of at least 10 metro stations – Lal Quila, Jama Masjid, Delhi Gate, ITO, Mandi House, Janpath, Central Secretariat, Khan Market, Nehru Place and Vishwavidalaya – were closed for nearly five hours as a precautionary measure aimed at avoiding arrival of agitators for taking part in the chakka jam protest. The stations were closed between 10-30 am and 11.30 am and were reopened by 4 pm, officials said.The three protest sites — Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur — where thousands of farmers have been protesting against the three contentious agriculture laws remained under a cloak of multilayered barricading, with barbed wiring on top, concrete walls, trenches, and nails boards being drilled onto the roads. Nets to block stones in case of stone pelting were also placed even as a heavy contingent of security personnel, armed with anti-riot gear, kept a watch at the barricades and patrolled the streets around the protest sites.Drone cameras were also used at the borders and Shaheedi Park for aerial surveillance and to capture the activities of protesters. From Friday evening onwards, checking of vehicles at the border points had been stepped-up to ensure that no miscreants or farmers entered Delhi for the chakka jam.“However, the checking was relaxed late Saturday morning, following intelligence inputs that the protesting farmers or groups were not entering Delhi for their agitation,” a police officer deployed at Anand Vihar border said, requesting anonymity.Farmer unions on Monday had announced a countrywide “peaceful and non-violent” chakka jam on February 6, during which they would block national and state highways for three hours (between noon and 3pm) in protest against the internet ban in areas near their agitation sites; harassment allegedly meted out to them by authorities.Even as the farm unions on Friday declared that “there will be no chakka jam inside Delhi”, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “Considering the violence that erupted on January 26 during the tractor rally, we did not want to take any chances. Elaborate security arrangements were put in place and a full-scale vigil was checked untoward incidents and traffic-related inconvenience. No violence happened and traffic remained normal.”At Shaheedi Park, over 60 protesters, mostly women and students of various pro-Left groups, arrived with placards and drums in two separate batches. The first group of 50 people arrived around 12.30pm and tried to enter the park. However, they were stopped at the barricades places 10 metres from the park’s entry gate. The police asked them to disperse. But when the protesters refused,and were detained, put inside buses stationed there and shifted to Rajender Nagar police station. The other group having 12 students arrived around 1.30 am and began beating drums. They were also removed in another bus.“All of them were released around 4.30 pm. No FIR has been registered,” said deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh.There were reports that the police had closed the India Gate lawns. DCP (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said, “We had not shut the lawns. No protester came to New Delhi district area. The security around the iconic structures and important buildings had been tightened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhincr-peaceful-as-40-000-security-personnel-keep-vigil-during-chakka-jam-101612634206372.html
06-02-2021||Noida||Three burglars wanted in over 50 cases arrested in Noida||Noida: Police on Friday night arrested three persons for their alleged involvement in over 50 cases of burglaries across the national capital region (NCR). Police said that some stolen goods, two countrymade guns and an SUV, among others, have been recovered from their possession.The suspects were identified as Sanjay Pahadia, 35, from Agra; Javed, 40, from Nangloi in New Delhi and Suresh, 32, from Sangam Vihar in New Delhi. According to police, the gang, which was active since 2013, had recently committed burglaries in three houses at Jalvayu Vihar in Sector 25, and also in some houses in Sector 30. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that the Sector 20 police had identified the suspects’ SUV -- a Mahindra XUV 500 -- which had entered the Jalvayu Vihar society a few days ago. “On Friday night, a police team was conducting check in Sector 6. The police received information about movement of burglars in the SUV. The team stopped the SUV for checking and recovered some silver and gold jewellery, a branded watch worth about ₹1.5 lakh, two countrymade guns, four live cartridges, and one knife, among other things,” he said.The police have also recovered one fake registration number plate, a toolkit to break locks, eight mobile phones and two wi-fi dongles from the three suspects. As many as 52 cases of burglaries are registered against the suspects, police said, adding that 45 cases are lodged in Delhi while seven in Noida. Explaining the gang’s modus operandi, police said that the suspects, Pahadia and Suresh, used to visit different societies on pretext of representatives of a water purifier company. “They used to knock the doors at different houses and enquire if they needed water purifier. This way they conducted recce of these houses. If they did not get any response from inside, they believed there was no one in the house,” the DCP said. Pahadia then used to call Javed inside the society with the SUV. Pahadia and Javed used to break the locks and conduct the burglaries while Suresh used to stand guard outside the house, police said. The DCP said the suspects used dongle’s wi-fi to connect each other instead of mobile phone to evade surveillance. They used to sell the stolen valuables to people at cheap rates in Delhi-NCR, and sometimes they also sold the jewellery to some jewellers, he said. Police said that Pahadia, a class 10 drop-out, is known as ‘super thief’ in his circle and speaks English fluently. “Pahadia had also bought a flat worth ₹60 lakh in a housing society in Greater Noida West using the stolen money. The police will charge the suspects under Gangster Act and also seize their properties,” the DCP said. The three suspects were produced in court on Saturday and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-burglars-wanted-in-over-50-cases-arrested-in-noida-101612634858736.html

Constructed by the Uttar Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Limited (UPPTCL), the power transmission company (transcom) of the state, the officials said that the new power station will benefit sectors 61 to 65, 49, 73, 77 and 78, among others. According to the officials, the transcom has also started construction of three 132 kV power sub-stations in the city which will supply electricity to the industrial units in different sectors.Punit Gupta, UPPTCL superintending engineer (transmission), said that Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), which had been awarded the contract to install two transformers of 500 MVA-capacity in the 400kV power station, has almost finished its job. “The new power house will start transmission of electricity to three 132 kV power sub-stations, which are being constructed in sectors 63, 67 and 115, and will be ready by end of the current fiscal 2020-21. These three sub-stations will ensure uninterrupted power supply to different industrial areas of Noida,” he said. Gupta also said that once the new 400 kV power station comes into operation, the load on two existing 400 kV power stations in sector 148 and Pali will automatically be reduced. “With three power stations operative, the electricity can evenly be transmitted to different power sub-stations,” he said, adding that the new power station will get electricity from the 765 kV power grid at Jahangirpur in Greater Noida. The superintending engineer further said the construction work for the new power station was halted on several occasions to check pollution. “But, with almost 80% work done, now we are sure to make it operational by March 31,” Gupta said.It may be noted that the construction for this power station had begun in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/new-400-kv-power-station-to-start-its-operations-by-marchend-101612634800041.html
06-02-2021||Noida||Tikait lashes out at Delhi Police for sending notices||The Delhi Police on Saturday sent out notices to several people who allegedly participated in the tractor rally on Republic Day, inviting the ire of several farmer leaders at the UP Gate protest site.The day, however started off very differently. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait praised the Delhi Police and thanked them with folded hands as the force brought the farmers’ plants planted next to the multi-level barricading under the barricades. But when he learnt of the notices in the afternoon, Tikait lashed out.Farmers at the protest site on Friday evening had offloaded soil from two dumper trucks and planned to sow crops at the barricades on the Ghazipur-Vaishali road. This was their mark of protest for what they called an unnecessary blockade that included heavy concrete blocks, concertina wires and nails studded to the road. So it was a surprise to them when the Delhi Police on Saturday morning included the farmers’ soil too within the barricade perimeter. When Tikait came to know, he rushed to the barricades.“We did pranaam (greeting with folded hands) to the jawans (referring to the security personnel at the barricades). We told them that you protect borders and should protect our soil as well. We will bring in more soil. There is no dearth of soil in the country. Jawan and kisan (farmer) have come together. They will protect our land. In a way we have given our farmland to our soldiers. No one will be able to snatch our land,” Tikait said. A group of farmers from the UP Gate later dug up a pavement where they sowed some plants and sugarcane. Tikait on Friday had called for farmers to bring in soil from their villages and offload it at the protest site. He had also asked them to take away some portion of the soil and sprinkle it in their farmlands. By the afternoon, Tikait rushed to barricades with copies of Delhi Police’s notices in his hands. They called on those who allegedly partook in the rally to join the investigation related to FIRs lodged in connection with violence reported in Delhi.“If someone comes here with his tractor, they are sending notices. Which law says that tractors cannot run on roads? If notices are not taken back, we will take a call and protests will take place at police stations,” Tikait said. Vinod Kumar, a farmer from Baghpat who received a notice from the Pandav Nagar police station in Delhi, said that he had followed the route issued by the Delhi Police for the rally. “I came back through the same route. They don’t want us to come here to attend the protest and are trying to intimidate us by sending notices,” he added. Delhi Police had issued the notices under Section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure over the events of Republic Day. One of the FIRs named Tikait and he was also served a notice which was put up at his camp at UP Gate by Delhi Police officials. “We are working on the basis of inputs and information we have. As of now we have served 10 notices asking these people to aid the investigation. More people have been identified who will be served notices gradually. These people are identified in states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Punjab,” said Deepak Yadav, deputy commissioner of police (East), Delhi. Sources in the Delhi Police said taking the soil dumped by farmers under the perimeter of the barricades was a precautionary measure and that the farmers had themselves removed some part of the dumped soil from near the barricading area.REPORTS OF INFILTRATION BY OUTSIDERS: TikaitOn Friday, the BKU had called off the “chakka jam” in two states – Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand – with Tikait alleging that he had received “inputs” that some “outsiders” had plans to indulge in violence during the blockade.Tikait and BKU-Rajewal president Balbir Singh Rajewal on Friday afternoon had announced that the two states will not observe road blockades, but that the farmers will come in small groups and submit memorandums of their demands at respective district headquarters.The “chakka jam” call given by farmers’ unions was the first event after the tractor rally held on Republic Day, which had ended in incidents of violence in Delhi.“The decision to hold road blockades may have surprised many, but we had inputs that some outsiders will try to indulge in violence at five places ( in different districts) in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. We came to know that they had planned to come out holding tricolours and flags of farmer unions, wearing the caps usually worn by our supporters. They were planning to sabotage our peaceful movement. We never resorted to sabotage and unruly activities in our movement,” Tikait said on Saturday at UP Gate. When asked, however, he declined to reveal the identity of the “outsiders” and sources of the information he had. He said, though, that the call to abstain from road blockades will give much needed to farmers who have been attending panchayats and meetings in western UP and that they will be prepared to remain on “standby” in case they are needed at UP Gate.“We have already deployed our volunteers to figure out people who do not adhere to our thought-process. If we trace such people at UP Gate and hand them over to the police and will lodge FIRs. We found some people on January 26 as well. If anyone has such nefarious designs, they should leave the place. In our camps too, we will only allow people having Aadhaar cards or they must provide us a guarantee of at least five persons known to them. It is only after this that they will be allowed to stay here,” Tikait added.The call for the “chakka jam” ended at 3pm. Farmer leaders at UP Gate gave a call to farmers to blow the horns of their vehicles for at least one minute to mark the end of the road blockade. The blowing of horns, sirens in cars and sounds of modified silencers of motorcycles went on for about two-three minutes.District officials, meanwhile, said the day remained peaceful in Ghaziabad.“The day passed peacefully; a small group of farmers came to the district headquarters and submitted their memorandum. There was no road blockade put up anywhere (in the district). However, our police and security personnel remained deployed, and duties of sector magistrates had also been put in place beforehand at six locations,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.“Traffic was less on roads and national highways in the wake of the call and also due to it being the weekend. There were no road blockades put up by farmers in the district,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). BKU’s state vice-president Rajbir Singh said that the memorandum submitted to district officials included demands for rollback of the three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. “The other demands included release of pending sugarcane payment and reduction in electricity bills, as well as reduction in diesel rates. These are some of the state-specific issues we have been facing,” Singh, added.Tikait on Saturday also said that the farmers have a long agenda of various measures and that they will stay put at the UP Gate protest site till October 2. He added that the farmers will carry out rallies, besides a mega tractor rally across the country which will see participation of about 40 lakh tractors. “They are wrong if they think that they can take back the three bills without bringing any law on MSP. This will not be acceptable to us. We will not leave our protest. If the law is not made now, it will not be possible in future. This agitation is of the entire country and not of some states, as pointed out time and again,” Tikait said.For the rally of 40 lakh tractors, which he termed as “tractor kranti,” he said that farmers should get the slogan “Kisan kranti 2021 – January 26” painted on their vehicles. “We have a target of 40 lakh tractors, while only two lakh participated during the tractor rally on Republic Day. If the government understands this, they should roll back the three farm laws and come up with a new law on MSP. We have given a target till October 2. It may also happen that fathers of people who are working in defence forces and the police will be called here for sit-ins with pictures (of their wards in security forces),” Tikait said, adding that the “non-political” agitation will be carried across the country. The prolonged agitation will also compound problems for the commuters who use the Delhi-Meerut Expressway as it is now completely blocked due to heavy barricading, with one of its sides having been occupied by protesters since December 3, 2020.Tikait had spoken about the mega tractor rally on February 1 when he said that if the farmers win, he will first go to the Golden Temple in Amritsar and thereafter, plan for holding a mega tractor rally across the country which will witness participation of about 40 lakh tractors. “We will take our ‘Yatras’ as well and the dates will be revealed. Farmers have to maintain the gathering and should come in shifts here. The decision about the crops will be taken by farmers and decisions regarding the agitation will be decided by the panchayats,” he added further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/tikait-lashes-out-at-delhi-police-for-sending-notices-101612634798777.html

Police said the arrests were made under a one-day drive conducted in different areas in Noida and Greater Noida.Some arrests were made following breath analyser tests while some people were caught consuming liquor in their cars, police said, adding that some others were found creating public nuisance. The Noida police in a press note said that the suspects were booked under Section 290 (public nuisance) of the Indian Penal Code.Ankita Sharma, assistant commissioner of police, Noida 1, said that the police had received information that people gather near different markets during the evenings and drink at public places. “This drive had been pending for some time, as most police personnel had been deployed at the farmers’ protest sites at the Chilla border and the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal.

06-02-2021||Noida||Two detained in Gwalior in elderly couple’s murder case||Noida/Bhopal: Two suspects were detained on Saturday in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, in connection with the murder of an elderly couple on Friday morning in Greater Noida, said police. “Acting on a tip-off, a team of the UP police detained the two suspects -- Kallu Bhadoria, a resident of Govardhan Colony, and Dev Sharma, a resident of Sainik Colony,” said Suman Gurjar, additional superintendent of police, Gwalior (east). The elderly couple -- Narendra Nath, 70, and his wife Suman Nath, 65 -- was found murdered at their home in Sector Alpha 2 in Greater Noida. The couple’s son Rohit lives with his wife Nidhi at AWHO Society in Greater Noida, while their daughter Sonu and her husband Jatin live in Sarita Vihar in Delhi. The family had said Friday that Narendra was a distant cousin of former MP chief minister Kamal Nath.Gurjar said that the UP police and MP police jointly interrogated the suspects before taking them to Noida on Saturday. The Gwalior police said the duo used to work for Narendra Nath and have also previous criminal records.However, the Gautam Budh Nagar police have not confirmed the latest development. “A team had visited MP and questioned some suspects. It is premature to comment on their arrest/detention,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida.The GB Nagar police have formed five teams which are conducting searches at different places to arrest the suspects involved in the double murder case of the Nath couple in Greater Noida.The police complaint in the matter was filed by Nidhi, who stated that she visited her in-laws’ house on Friday around 8am and found Suman’s body in the drawing room. “My father-in-law’s body was found in the basement. A plumber, a carpenter, a painter and a person named Kapil frequently visited my father-in-law, who had also given loans to them. I suspect these people killed my father-in-law and mother-in-law,” she said.According to the GB Nagar police, the post-mortem report revealed that Narendra was killed by strangulation while his wife Suman died of a bullet injury in her chest. “The Sector Beta 2 Police have registered a case against four persons under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and launched an intensive search,” Pandey said.Police said they spoke to Sonu and other members of the family and found that Suman had called her son-in-law at 11pm on Thursday. She had informed him that Narendra had invited some people over and that they were having a party in the basement, even though she had objected.Police said Narendra allegedly used to party frequently at his house and used to invite local vendors, painters and carpenters and people of similar profiles. Police suspect the same people may have partied at the victim’s house on Thursday night and later killed the couple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-detained-in-gwalior-in-elderly-couple-s-murder-case-101612634678713.html
06-02-2021||City||Accused in Odisha BJP leader murder found dead under mysterious circumstances||A little more than a month after the sensational murder of a BJP leader and his associate in Odisha's Cuttack district by BJD goons, the prime accused of the case, absconding for over months, was found dead under suspicious circumstances.The body of Prafulla Biswal, the prime accused in the case, was found near Nua Bandal Chhak in Tangi area of Cuttack on Friday night. Police claimed that Biswal, absconding for over a month, died in an accident.“The accident occurred near Nua Bandal Chhak between 9.30 pm and 10 pm last night. We recovered the body and shifted it to SCB Medical College and Hospital in an ambulance. The deceased’s motorcycle, a bag containing a helmet, clothes and insurance papers of the bike were also recovered from the spot,” said Tangi police station inspector-in-charge Padarbinda Tripathy.Biswal was among the 13 accused in the murder case of Kulamani Baral, 75, BJP in-charge of Salepur mandal and his 80-year-old associate Dibyasingh Baral. Kulamani, who was also former chairman of Mahanga panchayat Samiti in Cuttack district, was hacked to death along with his 80-year-old associate Dibyasingh Baral near Jankoti village on the evening of January 2 this year while coming home on a motorcycle.The duo received grievous injuries on their face and chest. While Kulamani succumbed to death on the spot, Dibyasingh died while undergoing treatment at the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack on January 3 morning.Odisha law minister and senior BJD minister Pratap Jena is among those who have been accused in the case though he has denied his role. Police have so far arrested 8 people including Bhikari Swain, a local BJD leader and former block chairman of Mahanga in Cuttack district over their alleged involvement in the case.However, BJP claimed that Prafulla was murdered apprehending that he would reveal the involvement of ruling BJD in the murder of former Mahanga block chairman and BJP leader Kulamani Baral along with his associate Dibyasingha Baral.“We have been saying since the beginning that Mahanga double murder case is a political conspiracy which is evident from the death of the accused. Biswal's body was found near Dushasan Jena transport office owned by the minister. The office belongs to Mahanga MLA who was named in the FIR filed in the case. He was kept hidden by the ruling party. As he would have revealed the entire conspiracy, he was eliminated in a well-planned manner,” alleged BJP district president of Cuttack Prakash Behera. He also questioned as to why all other accused involved in the case were nabbed, but the police had failed to arrest the main accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/accused-in-odisha-bjp-leader-murder-found-dead-under-mysterious-circumstances-101612633118967.html
06-02-2021||Gurugram||Apex court issues notice to HSVP on transfer of institutional plot||The Supreme Court has issued a notice to Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran(HSVP) for not passing a speaking order with regards to changes in policy related to transfer of institutional plots alloted by the authority. The directions were issued on the petition of a Delhi-based developer, who had first approached the Punjab and Haryana high court and later the apex court after the authority refused to permit the sale of an institutional plot owned by the developer. As per the details shared by the counsel of the developer, HSVP allotted a 4,050-square metre plot to Nehru Place Hotels and Real Estate in March 2013 for a sum of ₹14.95 crore. Occupation certificate was issued to the developer in 2014, he said. Two years later, the developer sought permission for the sale of plot and building but it was not granted. The authority held that institutional plots are sold with the condition that these can’t be sold or transferred to a third party. Sanjeev Alawadi, counsel for the company, said that the restraining order was incorrect as this condition of non transfer can remain only till the consideration was unpaid. “After making the payment, the allottee is the absolute owner of the plot and has absolute right to transfer it,” he said, adding that the company approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, seeking relief and the court gave directions to HSVP that a fresh order be passed in the matter. Alawadi said that the HSVP has refrained from passing a speaking order in this matter and for the past one year they have been waiting for the same. “We approached the apex court in this matter and submitted that the authority was in contempt of High Court order following which a notice has been issued to the authority’s officials,” he said. A HSVP official, when asked about the matter, said that institutional plots are meant for specified use and cannot be used for speculation purposes. “A policy change is also being carried out for these plots whereby the allottee has to pay half the price of existing circle rates,” he said..Anil Grover, senior additional advocate general of Haryana, who is representing the HSVP in this matter said that directions issued by the apex court will be complied with. “As per directions issued by High Court and Apex Court, a fresh speaking order in this matter will be passed by HSVP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/apex-court-issues-notice-to-hsvp-on-transfer-of-institutional-plot-101612633718418.html
06-02-2021||Gurugram||Over 72% vaccination turnout reported on Saturday||Over 72.5 % of the 700 targeted front-line and healthcare workers took the Covid-19 vaccine shot on Saturday. Data available with the district health department showed that staff members from the police department contributed to almost 89% of the turnout as the vaccination drive for workers of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the revenue department was withheld for the day. It will resume on January 8 with a large-scale vaccination drive targeting over 8,000 registered beneficiaries in a day, said the official. On Saturday, at least 445 out of the 500 targeted police personnel turned up for the vaccination at the five session sites.However, out of 200 healthcare workers, only 13.5% (63) took the vaccine shot at the five locations. The proactive participation of Gurugram Police has led to the inoculation of 1,641 police personnel so far.“In the last three days, inoculation of police staff members remained high among all front-line workers. On Saturday, almost 89% of the police staff members took the shot,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. “The inoculation for MCG and revenue department will start from January 8. A massive vaccination drive has been planned on Monday with a target of immunising roughly 8,000 front-line and healthcare workers. All departments have been informed about the drive to ensure the maximum footfall,” said Singh, adding that across the state, the target has been set for 35,000.According to him, the employees of panchayati raj institutions (PRI) will also be included in the vaccination drive from January 8 onwards. “Over 500 employees from three blocks, namely Sohna, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar, have been registered,” said Singh.For the MCG employees, the health department has planned to increase the vaccination sites from existing five to almost 15 on the vaccine drive day. MCG staffers have been reluctant in getting vaccinated considering their low turnout of merely 13% on Thursday and 32% on Friday.“The department has been gearing up for the vaccination drive to increase the overall footfall. The number of sites will be increased to almost 15 this time,” said Singh. On the other hand, the staff of Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CPRPF), Indian Reserve Battalion and National Security Guards (NSG) will also be covered under the ongoing vaccination drive, said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-72-vaccination-turnout-reported-on-saturday-101612633719226.html

Around 200 protesters sat in the middle of road and shouted slogans against the union government and blocked the traffic for over 2 hours, leading to congestion. The protest took place between 12 noon and 3pm in the afternoon. Heavy traffic congestion was also witnessed at Sirhaul plaza between 11am to 12.30pm due to strict checking by Delhi Police. The traffic movement, however, eased after 12.30 pm, when the police relaxed border checks. Farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur near Jaisinghpur Khera at the Haryana-Rajasthan border also held a chakka jam (road blockade) at two places — one near the protest site on the National Highway-48 and the other at Bawal Chowk. At Bajghera in Gurugram, which was the main site of protest in the city, around 200 farmers, local political leaders and social activists sat on a sit-in protest for about three hours. Santokh Singh, president, Kisan Morcha, said that they held a peaceful sit-in protest and blocked the road to protest against the draconian laws passed by the government. “These laws should be repealed as these violate the rights of the farmers and are meant to push corporates into agribusiness,” he alleged. A large number of women also participated in the protest. They created a human chain on Bajghera Road and Palam Vihar Road, disrupting the traffic. The protesters also distributed anti-government pamphlets and shouted slogans. RS Rathee,councillor, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said that protests will continue till the farm laws are repealed and the government realises its mistake. “Agriculture is backbone of economy and these laws will destroy it,” he said. Pradeep Zaildar, a local political leader, said that people across all communities have joined the protests. “This is a question of survival and we are in for a long fight,” he said.A large group of city police was deployed at the spot to manage traffic diversions and maintain law and order. City police officials said that all arrangements were made to maintain law and order and traffic diversions were carried out to minimise the impact of congestion. “Measures were taken to divert traffic from Palam Vihar Road and Bajghera Road. Traffic personnel at various points were deployed to prevent congestion. The situation remained under peaceful and in control,” said Rajiv Kumar, ACP, Udyog Vihar. Overall, traffic movement remained normal on the remaining part of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and KMP(Kundli-Manesar-Palwal) Expressway. Farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur near Jaisinghpur Khera at the Haryana-Rajasthan border said their road blockade on NH-48 and Bawal was successful. Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that the blockade at both the places was successful. “The blockade took place peacefully without any disruption. We marched a little ahead from the protest site and sat down at an intersection. Emergency vehicles and local commuters were allowed to pass,” said Madhav.He added that protesting farmers from different states including Orissa, Kerala and Haryana sang songs in their native languages to voice opposition against the three farm laws. Naveen Sohlot, a farmer from Bawal, said farmers sat on the roads for nearly three hours and were joined by locals. “Farmers from Rajasthan held the blockade at Shajahanpur while we organised another protest at Bawal. The local administration had extended support and we were able to register our protest peacefully,” said Sohlot.In Nuh too, a blockade was held for three hours by farmers on the Naugaon-Mundka stretch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/chakka-jam-observed-in-the-city-by-protesters-101612633658490.html

Such scammers may defraud citizens through phone calls, emails or even by WhatsApp messages, asking them their details for getting themselves registered for the vaccine.Referring to the modus operandi of fraudsters, he said that they are making phone calls to people, asking them to register their names for the vaccination drive. With this, they are collecting sensitive personal information, such as Aadhaar number and email in the name of Covid-19 vaccine registration. Along with these details, they may also ask to authenticate Aadhaar by sharing an OTP. The moment OTP is given, money is siphoned off from the Aadhaar-linked bank account.Virk advised the people to exercise caution and not to entertain any phone calls regarding the vaccine registration. “Don’t share your personal data with anyone and use only the government health department approved/issued mobile application for Covid-19 vaccination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/police-cautions-residents-on-frauds-relating-to-vaccination-drive-101612633598443.html

The average temperature in January is 13.6 degrees Celsius, whereas this year it was recorded at 14.7 degrees Celsius.DS Pai, scientist and head, climate research and services, IMD, Pune, said that these are expected yearly climate variations.“This activity might be an indirect effect of climate change,” said Pai.“The main increase was in the minimum temperature, particularly in the northern part and southern part of the country. There was record rainfall at the start of January. This time in the north there were western disturbances and in the south, there were easterly winds. In some places, they interacted and there was clouding. So maximum temperature reduced and minimum temperature increased. Cloudy days are cooler than normal,” added Pai.The weather department also noted that the mean temperature in southern peninsular India was 1.07 degrees higher than normal this year. The mean temperature of the southern peninsula is 25.30 degrees Celsius and in January 2021, the recorded mean temperature was 26.36 degrees CelsiusThe average minimum temperature for central India in January 2021, which includes Maharashtra, was recorded at its third-highest since 1901. The average temperature for central India is 13.56 degrees Celsius whereas the reported temperature this time was 14.82 degrees Celsius, 1.25 degrees above normal.Speaking about the variations, OP Sreejith, scientist, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group, said the reason behind the variations is the Madden–Julian oscillation which the region experienced mainly at the beginning of January.The Madden–Julian oscillation is the largest element of the intra-seasonal variability in the tropical atmosphere.“We also recorded exceptional rainfall due to Madden–Julian oscillation. The minimum temperature is higher so the mean temperature is also on the higher side,” said Sreejith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unusually-warm-january-could-be-indirect-result-of-global-warming-imd-scientist-101612633598981.html

DTCP officials, who conducted the inspection, said that after finding rampant encroachments in the mall, the manager and secretary of the market association were called and asked to remove violations on their own within two days. RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram, said that the team spent an hour in the market and interacted with shopkeepers and asked them to.clear the encroacments. “The association has assured us that the encroachments will be removed within two days. The team will conduct an inspection randomly next week and if required changes are not made by then, a sustained demolition drive will be carried out,” he said. Earlier on Friday, the enforcement team visited Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok and took stock of the situation. The department had carried out an anti-encroachment drive in the market few days back in which a number of vends were removed. “The situation in this market has improved and we have told shopkeepers not to repeat the violations,” said Bhath. In the last one week, markets and malls in private colonies have come under the scanner of the department, as several complaints have been lodged by local residents regarding encroacments and other similar violations, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/shopkeepers-told-to-remove-encroachments-in-dlf-phase1-101612633538947.html

However, traders said the turnout was lower than usual. Members of the New Delhi Traders’ Association (NDTA) in Connaught Place (CP) said all shops were open throughout the day. “But, traders in the commercial and shopping hub of CP did say that the footfall declined by 50-60% compared to last Saturday. Clearly, there were fewer visitors as many people preferred to stay home to avoid any traffic inconvenience as was seen during the tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day,” said NDTA president Atul Bhargava.Sanjeev Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders association, said all shops operated as usual in the upscale market.Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarva Vyapar Mandal, said only around 25% of the usual business happened on Saturday. “There were much fewer shoppers and visitors as many are still apprehensive about coming to the area after the chaos and violence that happened in Red Fort on Republic Day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/markets-unaffected-by-chakka-jam-but-turnout-low-101612633478423.html
06-02-2021||Delhi||Three protest sites at Delhi borders remain peaceful during chakka jam||Amid the large-scale police deployment and a host of steps taken to curtail the movement of farmers, the three-hour nationwide “chakka jam” — a blockade of national and state highways — called by farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws, went off peacefully on Saturday at the three protest venues at Delhi’s Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders.In view of the violence in the Capital on Republic Day during the tractor rally taken out by farmers, in which one person died and several others were injured, the Delhi Police had put in place a thick security blanket to ensure that no untoward incident takes place during the chakka jam. Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “Considering the violence that erupted on January 26 during the tractor rally, we did not want to take any chances. Elaborate security arrangements were put in place and full-scale vigil was maintained to check any untoward incident and traffic-related inconvenience. No violence happened on Saturday and the traffic remained normal.”The blockade was not observed inside the Capital. Highways leading to Delhi were free from the blockade so that farmers could reach the protest sites. There was no blockade in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh either as decided by farmer unions, for the same reason.However, all three protest venues saw thinner crowds on Saturday with farmer leaders saying that a large number of protesters had returned to their respective states to take part in the chakka jam there.At the Singhu border, farmers did not stop any private or shared public vehicle from plying along the stretch where the protest has been taking place for over two months now. “These locals have supported us from Day One. They have already done more than their bit for our movement. So we decided not to impose the jam on them,” said Jagmohan Singh, one of the many volunteers there. At Tikri, farmer leaders on the stage continued to remind the participants to hold the chakka jam as a non-confrontational event. Several young farmers, who had been camping at Tikri border, went back to their villages and home towns to lead the blockade of state highways there.“We have been sending out messages to our brothers in other states that instead of coming to Delhi for protests, on Saturday they should support the movement by blocking their respective state highways and internal roads. The gathering here might be smaller than usual, but that is because the participation at the state level is immense,” said Sahil Kamboj, a volunteer.Despite peaceful scenes at the Tikri border, the security arrangements near the protest site were intense on Saturday. Between Friday and Saturday night, the Delhi Police had set up a multilayered security cordon comprising their personnel, paramilitary personnel, concrete barricades, barbed wire fencing, and nail boards drilled onto roads to stop farmers from entering the national capital.On the roadside near the police barricades in Ghazipur, farmers prepared a small patch of land for cultivation and planted sugarcane and potatoes. Lata Chaudhary, a farmer from Baruat, said, “The police have set up a multilayered barricading and have drilled nails onto the road to prevent our movement as though we are criminals. Today, we planted sugarcane here in front of them (police) to make them realise that we are just farmers and they should not wage a war against us.”On Friday, Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had planted flower saplings beside the police barricades. The police, on their part, added another layer of barricades on Saturday and allegedly removed the flowers planted by protesters. “The government fixed iron nails in our path, but we have planted flowers next to them, Tikait said.At 3pm, farmers gathered at the Ghazipur border site started honking their vehicles in unison. However, at Singhu border there was no such collective honking. “In the rest of the country, the jam was for three hours. Here, it has been going on for 73 days now. If the government can’t hear us despite so long, our involvement in the chakka jam won’t make a difference,” said Manmeet Kaur, a farmer from Gurdaspur in Punjab.“You can see that thousands of farmers have gathered here. The crowd is sitting for kilometres from here. If we wanted to cause trouble, their (police’s) barricades will not be able to stop us. Our movement was always meant to be peaceful. On January 26, some unruly elements tried to defame farmers and our movement but that was a political ploy,” said Daya Ram, a farmer from Mansa in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-protest-sites-at-delhi-borders-remain-peaceful-during-chakka-jam-101612633359112.html

Senior health officials said health care workers who got the first jab on January 16, the day the drive was launched, will start getting their second and final dose of the same vaccine from February 13. The programme was also formally opened up for a second batch of recipients on Saturday, with frontline workers now in the fray to receive a jab of either Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin or Serum Institute of India’s Covishield — the two Covid-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the country.Frontline workers, a category which comprises police personnel, municipal staff, revenue officials, teachers and so on, can get vaccinated at all centres across Delhi. On Thursday, only a few centres were opened to frontline workers, as part of a trial.Several district magistrates (DMs) and other bureaucrats took the jabs on Saturday, to instil confidence among the public about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. However, the daily turnout stayed low on Saturday, as marginally more than 50% of the scheduled beneficiaries turned up for their shots. Of the 17,900 slated to receive the vaccine on Saturday, only 9,510 arrived at Delhi’s 179 vaccination centres on the day.While the turnout number included both health care and frontline workers, the state government did not share the numbers for each category separately.Senior IAS officers, including district magistrates of southwest Delhi, Naveen Aggarwal, and west Delhi, Neha Bansal, took the first dose of the vaccine on Saturday. G Sudhakar deputy commissioner of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) also took a jab on the same day.“Vaccination is the only way we can reach herd immunity. Right now, the fear of catching Covid-19 is lower than it was, but no one knows what lies ahead. So, I urge all front-line workers to come forward and take the vaccine at the earliest,” said Aggarwal after taking the jab. West district vaccinated 1,242 people on Saturday - the highest of all 11 districts in Delhi. The district has 19 session sites for the day. A total of five districts inoculated more than 1,000 beneficiaries on Saturday these also included south, east, central and northwest districts. The fewest vaccinations — 373 doses — were administered in north district. Of the vaccine recipients on Saturday, nine had adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI).“Delhi today (Saturday) has crossed the 100,000 mark in Covid-19 vaccination. We have also formally launched the vaccination of frontline workers now. DMs of many districts and police personnel also came forward for vaccination on Saturday to remove vaccine hesitancy among the people,” said a Delhi government spokesperson.The numbers also include vaccinations that have started in hospitals run by the three municipal corporations. The north Delhi municipal corporation vaccinated 132 beneficiaries on Saturday and till date it has administered 709 jabs in total.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-100-000-get-covid-jab-in-delhi-101612633299153.html
06-02-2021||Other||Police wait for Google to help them trace creators of ‘toolkit’||New DelhiThe Delhi Police on Saturday said they were waiting for a response from Google from which they have sought assistance in identifying the author/creator of a “toolkit” or document, which allegedly detailed an action plan for online and offline protests associated with the ongoing farmers’ agitation. Any concrete progress in the investigation into the toolkit case will happen only when the Google helps the investigating team with the IP addresses and details of the two e-mail accounts, through which the toolkit was created, a senior police officer associated with the probe said. “We are hoping that Google will share the desired information. As of now, we are collecting details of the social media accounts that posted the toolkit or screenshots of its content,” said the officer. On Friday, the cyber prevention and awareness detection (CyPAD) unit of the city police sent a letter to Google and asked for details of the people who drafted the toolkit, edited and circulated it. Separately, police are also trying to get details of the Instagram account mentioned on the original toolkit, through which a live session was screened. Apart from the toolkit case, police have registered 44 more cases in connection with January 26 violence and the incident of January 29 when a group of people, claiming to be locals, entered the protest site at Singhu border and clashed with farmers and police. Police on Saturday updated the list of arrested persons on their website. The new list has the names of 125 persons, three more than the previous list. The names of three persons, who were arrested by the Burari police station on February 3, also figure in the updated list. Their identification was done on the basis of video footage analysis. While two persons have been arrested so far in connection with the vandalism and violence at the Red Fort, investigators said that they have been conducting raids to nab eight key suspects, including actor Deep Sidhu and one Jugraj Singh, who were allegedly involved in the violence at the UNESCO World Heritage site. Police have identified Jugraj as the one who had allegedly hoisted a religious flag at the ramparts of the fort. The other six absconding suspects have been identified as Buta Singh, Iqbal Singh, Gurjant Singh, Gurjot Singh, Jagbir Singh and Sukhdev Singh. Police have already announced R6 lakh rewards – R1 lakh each for Deep, Jugraj, Gurjant and Gurjot while R50,000 each for the other four – for information leading to their arrest. Another officer who did not want to be named said that Iqbal has been identified as the one who had done a Facebook live from the Red Fort during the violence.

It is not just the parivartan (transformation) of the government but the parivartan of thinking. Mamata Banerjee came to power a decade ago with the slogan Ma Mati Manush (mother, people and soil) but down the line, the mother was looted, the people weren’t protected and the soil was disrespected,” he added.The BJP would be organising four more Rath Yatras in the next few days. The last one is likely to be flagged by Union home minister Amit Shah. It would end in Kolkata where PM Modi is likely to address a rally in March. Each yatra would run for at least 20–25 days and together they would cover all 294 assembly constituencies in February and March.“Why is she so much against Jai Shri Ram? This shows that they keep politics above culture. They won’t protect the culture. Because of vote bank politics, they won’t also let down their conscience,” Nadda said.Also read: ‘To uphold law’ - Centre defends power cut at farmers’ protest sitesIn December, Nadda’s convoy was attacked near Diamond Harbour, the parliamentary constituency of TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, who also happens to be the chief minister’s nephew.The prime minister would be visiting West Bengal for a little more than three hours to dedicate to the nation and lay the foundation stone of some infrastructure projects at Haldia. He is also scheduled to address a public rally in Haldia before attending the program.BJP leaders said that even though PM Modi had come to West Bengal on January 23, he didn't address any public rally to bolster the BJP's campaign ahead of the polls.Nadda sharpened his attack saying, “This government has to go. If they can attack me then I can understand what the common people are going through in West Bengal.”Just after his convoy was attacked, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had indulged in name-calling by mocking the name of the BJP president as "Chadda Madda Fadda Bhadda Nadda".“Mamata won’t be able to tackle the culture of Bengal which belongs to icons like Swami Vivekananda, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Rabindranath Tagore, among others. The BJP will protect the culture of Bengal. The way you added adjectives before my name, it only speaks of your culture,” he added.The BJP chief also attacked the TMC supremo saying that all these years the state government had almost forgotten Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.“Today you are remembering him (Netaji) because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has remembered him,” he added.The TMC lashed back saying that local BJP leaders are misleading Nadda and that he is raising all wild allegations.“The TMC would hold a public rally at Nabadwip on Sunday. Every allegation would be countered.

06-02-2021||Pune||A much-needed change||Chaitanya Tamhane’s next “The Disciple” is set to release on Netflix sometime this year. This is a bit of good news because it means that cinema-lovers will be able to watch the next film by the maker of the much coveted “The Court”. Not just that, even before its release, “The Disciple” has already made waves at the prestigious Venice Film Festival, winning awards for best screenplay and also the FIPRESCI, which is the award for best film selected by the International Federation of Film Critics. The last Indian film to win it at the Venice Film Festival was in 1990 for “Mathilukal” by Adoor Gopalakrishnan. So, the film being picked up by the popular streaming platform comes as no surprise.When the pandemic started (it seems that no conversation can take place without talking about this event!) there was a shift by the audience of their time and attention, and money of course, to OTT (over-the-top) platforms. There was no other choice and they had to make do with whatever was available. The various platforms too jumped at this opportunity and the subscribers increased manifold. It was exciting for the audiences too, to watch new films on their personal devices, at their leisure, without shelling money for tickets. While this was all hunky dory, one thing that almost everyone noticed was that no films made in vernacular languages were picked up by these platforms. Especially, Marathi, Gujarati and Bengali films. In fact, they weren’t interested in even watching the films. I realise now that I had accepted this fact really quickly at that time. I have always believed that it is a business and like every business it works on demand and supply. I think this acceptance might have its roots in the quality of content on television and its consistency over the years. I have not been able to relate to it, either fiction or non-fiction, but have seen many others do. So, the rationalist in me had made peace with this simple economic fact.It is no secret that Marathi films don’t do well business-wise. They are front runners when it comes to critical acclaim and awards, but they don’t enjoy audiences as much as they should. Chaitanya’s previous film too was no exception. There are multiple reasons for this and I don’t want to delve into that topic right now. God knows every person working in this industry talks about it all the time! Since I had a lot of time during the lockdown, I began thinking about a fundamental question – don’t I call myself an “artist”? Or am I just a businessman? So shouldn’t “art” be important as well in making such decisions? And don’t the best of art pieces appeal to our irrational, emotional side? Don’t they provoke us in some way or the other? And very honestly, I do think that even the OTT platforms have been taken for a ride. None of the Hindi films that have been released directly on these platforms would have done well had they released in the theatres! None of them. And the film-makers have held on to those films knowing very well that they will do well in the theatres.So, it feels great to know that the world distribution rights of a Marathi film have been picked up by a platform. Of course, while we celebrate the fact that it is a film in Marathi, we cannot overlook the fact that it is made by a film- maker whose work is internationally recognised and that one of the executive producers of the film is none other than Alfonso Cuarón, the Mexican who dons many hats — film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, and editor. But I think it is time that the people running these platforms start looking beyond numbers. Because even Charlie Chaplin had said - “I don’t believe that the public knows what it wants; this is the conclusion that I have drawn from my career”. Having said that, I look forward to watching “The Disciple” soon and hope it brings about a much-needed change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/a-much-needed-change-101612619977158.html

Additional director general of police, law and order, Navdeep Singh Virk said that cyber criminals never run out of ideas to cash in on the situation. “Such scammers may defraud citizens through phone calls, emails or even by WhatsApp and other social media applications, asking them their details for getting themselves registered for the vaccine,” the ADGP said. Referring to the way the fraudsters operate, Virk said that such fraudsters were found making phone calls to people, offering to register their names for the vaccine. With this, they were collecting sensitive personal information such as Aadhaar number and email on the pretext of Covid-19 vaccine registration. “They also ask unsuspecting people to authenticate the Aadhaar number by sharing an OTP (one-time password). The moment the OTP is given; money is siphoned off from the Aadhaar-linked bank account,” Virk said. The ADGP advised people not to entertain any phone calls on vaccine registration and refrain from sharing personal data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fraudsters-duping-people-on-pretext-of-covid-vaccine-registration-101612611757022.html

06-02-2021||Pune||Demand to allow general public in local trains in Pune grows||With Mumbai local trains returning back to service, demand to allow the general public inside the Pune –Lonavla local train has been raised by passengers. Currently, the Pune-Lonavla train runs four times on both sides and services were resumed from October 12, but it is only for those working for essential services. Identity cards of passengers are checked at the railway station before boarding the local trains. When asked about when the local train services will be allowed to common people, Pune railway divisional manager (DRM) Renu Sharma in an online press conference held on February 4 said, “The orders related to this decision comes from the railway head office and we only implement it here. Once we get the orders, accordingly services will be allowed for the common public too.” Earlier to the countrywide lockdown which started in March 2020, there were eight local trains running to and fro from Pune to Lonavala from early morning 5am to 12 midnight. A total of 20,000 passengers would travel daily on this route which consists of students and officer-goers in a large number. Just like Mumbai local trains, the Pune-Lonavla local is a lifeline for thousands of office going people on this route. BJP leader Vikas Mathkari said, “If the local trains in Mumbai can start and be allowed for common people then why not in Pune? In comparison to Mumbai, the number of passengers travelling from local trains in Pune is less and following Covid guidelines and social distancing it can be allowed. Currently, the public transport bus service is ongoing, but the local train service is cheaper, faster and safer for common public.” Demanding to start the local train service immediately for people, Roshni Hiremath who stays in Talegaon and daily travels to Shivajinagar for office work said, “I work in a private finance company in Pune and travel daily from Talegaon by a public transport bus. Earlier I used to travel by local trains, like me there are thousands of other officegoers who want common people be allowed to travel by local trains.

The petrol price increased by ₹0.29 on Feb 5 and recorded ₹93.14 rs per litre, the diesel price also increased by ₹0.31 and recorded a price of ₹82.38 per litre which is also the highest rate ever. Ali Daruwala, spokesperson of All India Petrol Dealers Association claimed that the petrol price had reached to ₹93 per litre in 2013 though he could not remember the specific date. The price on Friday is highest since then. “Unfortunately, petrol has crossed ₹93 in Pune. In 2013, the petrol price had reached ₹93 in the UPA regime. Taxation is the main reason behind it. Our income has gone down because of Covid-19 pandemic and the government is getting income through taxation. I request the government to cut taxation and give relief to common people,” Daruwala said. Petrol prices have been steadily increasing in the last few months. On August 16, 2020 petrol prices were at ₹87.05 and diesel prices at ₹78.67 per litre. After price fluctuations in the following months, on Dec 7, 2020 petrol price reached to ₹90 and diesel price at ₹78.97 per litre. After remaining steady almost for a month, petrol and diesel prices soared on Jan 6, 2021 and reached to ₹90.25 per litre and ₹79.25 per litre respectively. The prices have been on the rise since then and on Friday, the petrol price finally crossed the mark of ₹93. According to experts, these are the highest prices of petrol and diesel ever in the city and the heavy taxation is responsible for it. “We are paying ₹32 excise duty on petrol imposed by the Central government. The government increased ₹10 excise duty on petrol in May 2020. If it withdraws the price, it will fall back in the range of ₹80. The best option is to bring petrol and diesel under GST,” Vivek Velankar president of Sajag Nagrik Manch and RTI activist. “The higher price of petrol will impact the lives of common people and the rising price of diesel will increase inflation. The government has to take immediate action,” added Velankar. The soaring price of petrol has started to impact the livelihoods of common people. “Our income margin has reduced because of the rise in petrol prices. First, we used to get ₹30-40 per home delivery order in the area of 8 kilometres. Now, we have to do delivery up to the area of 12 kilometres and are just making ₹15 per order. The increasing petrol prices are making it more and more difficult to survive. I don’t know how we are going to cope with it,” said Sagar Ghare who is working as a delivery person for Zomato in Pune. “Now offices have resumed, and travelling is a must. Due to the risk of Covid-19, priority is given to private vehicles for travelling. But because of increased prices of petrol and diesel we need to think before using our two-wheeler or four-wheeler vehicle. If this trend continues, I fear soon the prices of other essential goods will start to rise,” said Deepali Hatekar, a resident of Kothrud said.

In one month, the central government hiked fuel prices 11 times and the price of petrol has reached an all-time high,” they said.BJP’s Kasba assembly constituency workers, meanwhile, held a protest at MSEDCL and condemned the MVA government over inflated electricity bills.“Citizens are already suffering due to Covid-19 pandemic, instead of easing their pain, MSEDCL is sending them notices to pay bills or face power cut. Ruling Maha Vikas Agadi is responsible for causing inconvenience to at least 75 lakh families,” said BJP leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shiv-sena-protests-against-rising-fuel-prices-bjp-over-inflated-power-bills-101612608936182.html
06-02-2021||Pune||Survey: 83% of IAS officers feel states must have autonomy to formulate own responses in crises||A survey conducted among 570 retired and serving IAS officers found that 83 per cent of them opined states must have the autonomy to formulate their own responses based on the needs and capacities and close to 85 per cent believed that effective communication works better than penal measures to curb people’s inherent tendencies towards indiscipline.The survey conducted by the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi through August and September 2020 last year asked civil servants to reflect on the decisions, actions and conduct of the Indian state, bureaucracy, citizens, and key non-state actors and agencies in response to the Covid-19 crisis and its management. The survey has found some interesting results based on the responses given by the participants, a striking 83 per cent agreed that states must have the autonomy to formulate their own responses based on their needs and capacities, this response was similar across seniority.Mahesh Zagade, retired IAS officer and former PMC commissioner said, “The protocols made by the Centre or state are also made along with IAS officers keeping in mind the ground situation. I think the example of the nationwide lockdown when it comes to giving states the autonomy, all I can say is that I know the laws and the provisions, the Centre had to take the step because the states did nothing. When I handled H1N1, I broke multiple WHO norms, but I took those decisions only because I knew the ground situation. Like for example WHO has said that there should be only one screening centre which was Naidu hospital at the time which I then increased to seven and then 49 as thousands of patients started coming forward. I was even criticised by the Central team and also the state but when they got to the ground situation, they understood my action. So, my comment is that protocols are not sacrosanct and so in this case when the states did not do anything the Centre took the drastic step.”In view of the nationwide lockdown imposed, the responses garnered interesting responses. 54.9 per cent of the respondents stated that the lockdown was successful because the public understood the need for the same and cooperated willingly. It was also found that IAS officers came across as highly motivated, placing public service commitment above personal risk as 72 per cent of serving officers felt the refusal to undertake assigned roles due to vulnerability and risk of exposure to infection should invite penal action. When it came to their preferred strategy for ensuring successful pandemic management over the long term, an overwhelming majority of civil servants (85 per cent) chose mounting an effective communication campaign to secure people’s understanding and cooperation over strict enforcement of penal measures to curb people’s inherent tendencies towards indiscipline.Majority of the respondents, 51.1 per cent, also found that the health system preparedness also increased reasonably in anticipation of a large number of infections while 27.6 per cent stated that the health system preparedness increased only marginally.The survey also found that fear of ostracisation was found to be a major culprit in the failure of people to self-report for testing which has been an impediment to the success of the government’s test-trace-isolate strategy.Followed by the inconvenience of quarantine options available, difficulty in accessing tests, exposure to infection from testing, time taken for testing, perception of poor treatment in hospitals and fear of loss of livelihood resulting from quarantine were some of the reasons for failure to self-report as per the respondents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/survey-83-of-ias-officers-feel-states-must-have-autonomy-to-formulate-own-responses-in-crises-101612608876122.html

An editorial in the Sena's mouthpiece Saamana said the Congress was given the Constitutional post for a full-term and not for Patole to resign in a year. It sought to caution Congress over Patole's appointment.The editorial said the Congress should not become "excessively" aggressive as the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi allies have pulled off a "miracle" by keeping the Bharatiya Janata Party out of power in the state.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is unhappy with the resignation, while his deputy, Ajit Pawar, said Patole should not have resigned weeks ahead of the assembly's budget session in March.The editorial lauded Balasaheb Thorat's tenure as the state Congress chief and for steering the party to success when nobody wanted to take up the role. It added that Congress is an "important partner" in the government and that the power has given it a new lease of life in Maharashtra."Now the way forward must be decided. What the Congress does within its party is its right, but they must ensure that their decisions do not have any impact on the government, Vidhan Sabha, and the majority mark," the editorial said.It dismissed talk of any threat to the government. "The election for the Speaker's post will have to be held. Again, the numbers will have to be arranged. We certainly have the majority and there is no concern over that. Avoiding elections to such constitutional posts is best for everybody."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-expresses-displeasure-over-nana-patole-s-resignation-101612606085560.html

Now, they just need to visit the street market near the government secretariat on Mondays and Fridays for a variety of organic vegetables, being sold on carts and even inside vans.Such organic food selling points can also seen at Rajvanshi Nagar and Patliputra Colony vegetable markets in the city and many more neighbourhood markets are likely to be added to the list in the coming days as the agriculture department is motivating farmers in organic farming with selling their produce in city's street markets, offering them a bigger platform.Bihar government has created an 'Organic Corridor' covering 13 districts from Buxar to Bhagalpur in the third phase of agricultural road map 2017- 22.The first of its kind project in the country, aims for sustainable development in the agriculture sector in the state and seeks to help farmers tap the demand for organic produce in the country and improve the environment in areas along the Ganga river. It has a budget of ₹1.55 lakh crore.Over 22,000 farmers are engaged in organic farming over nearly 20,000 acre land in the state."We have been providing farmers ₹11,500 per acre to create organic fertilisers for farming. Initially, the response was lukewarm but the financial support provided by the agriculture department, has improved things. People are coming forward to join organic farming," Venkatesh Narayan Singh, the agriculture department official, who is handling the Organic Corridor project, said.There has been a global demand for organic, environment-friendly food products. But many farmers here have not been aware of its potential despite the availability of all kinds of natural resources in the region. The department motivated them to compete with the big farmers, he added. "The beginning has been made. Though at the initial stage, if pursued seriously, it may give big benefits," he said.The official said that yet another reason for the stress on the Organic Corridor was to stop water pollution in Ganga. "There were reports of fertilisers, used by the farmers along the river, causing water pollution," he said.This is why the Organic Corridor was initially planned along the shores of the Ganga River and in 2018-19, some other districts were also included in the project, he added.Considering the good response the agriculture department is now considering expanding the project to all the 38 districts of the state, he said."So far the market is concerned, the department is preparing for its branding," Singh said.Ravi Ranjan, one of the organic farmers from Fatuha, who sells his produce near the secretariat in the city, said the response has been very encouraging.Also Read: Impersonators held for taking Bihar police recruitment test"It seems the buyers wait for us. The moment we reach the selling point, buyers turn up in large numbers," he said. Things are really going good and farmers are planning to create such points in other areas also, he added.Rajiv Ranjan, another farmer from Patna district, said the city has a better market potential and it just needs to be tapped. "There are many big shopping points, malls and general stores in the city where sale counters for organic products can be created," he said. The agriculture department can help farmers in this direction and can arrange for collection and transportation of products from farms to selling points, he added.Farmers specialising in gram and lentil farming, said organic food sale points can also be created at big hospitals in the city. "Most of the doctors and other health workers prefer it. Even visitors may avail this facility," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-organic-corridor-produce-reaps-rich-harvest-in-patna-s-roadside-markets-101612601010627.html

If they are threatened, they will speak the truth.”An ACB official familiar with the developments said that these notes were submitted by one of Agarwal’s subordinates during his posting as superintendent of police (SP), GRP (government railway police) between October 16, 2019 and July 5, 2020. More than 10 police districts were under his jurisdiction.“The 27 policemen include policemen from constables to assistant sub-inspectors posted in Alwar, Jaipur, Bharatpur, Ajmer, Kota, Abu Road, Gangapur City, Hindaun Chowki, Bandikui and Jhalawar,” said the ACB official.He added that the notes point out specific details of the 27 policemen and the money extorted from people in different cases. The ACB suspects that the details were recorded by a policeman who was either posted at the intelligence or vigilance wing of the former SP’s office.“From complaints against constables to those against additional superintendent of police, vigilance and intelligence unit of SP, GRP keeps formal or informal record of the complaints. Agrawal exploited these details and used them to extort money. However, how much did he extract from these policemen is yet to be discovered,” the ACB official said on condition of anonymity.Another ACB official said that around half-a-dozen policemen, including some station house officers from Dausa have contacted the anti-graft bureau and shared how they were forced to partake in the extortion racket allegedly being run by Agrawal as SP Dausa.“These policemen told us that the accused IPS, who was posted as SP Dausa, used to give them daily targets to extort money. We are recording their statements too,” the second ACB official said.HT has also accessed an advisory by former director general of police (DGP) Bhupendra Singh to Agrawal, expressing dissatisfaction with the SP’s functioning.“It has come to the notice of the undersigned that as superintendent of police, Dausa district, your integrity is suspect and that you are indulging in conduct unbecoming of an IPS officer and which is also in violation of All India Service Conduct Rules. You are hereby advised to discharge your responsibilities diligently, without compromising on integrity and ethical standards, failing which the undersigned would be compelled to make such mention in your Annual Performance Appraisal System (APAR),” read the advisory written by Singh to Agrawal.Meanwhile, Agarwal was presented before a local court in Jaipur, which remanded him to judicial custody.Also Read: IPS officer Manish Agarwal suspended by Rajasthan govt; professes innocenceAgrawal’s lawyer has denied all the allegations levelled against him. “Neither my client was caught taking a bribe nor has the agency any evidence to prove he demanded a bribe. The so-called middleman Neeraj Meena used to meet him during the lockdown in connection with three instances of robbery,” he said.Agrawal, who had taken charge as the commandant of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) in Jaipur last month, was arrested from his office on Tuesday.Earlier on January 14, two sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) Pinky Meena (Bandikui) and Pushkar Mittal (Dausa) and one Neeraj Meena, an alleged middleman employed by Manish Agrawal, were arrested in the same case.During investigation, it was found that the IPS officer was allegedly involved in a bid to extort money from a road construction contractor, in connivance with the SDMs named above and the middleman. The lid was blown off the racket after a complaint was filed against some of the accused officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-ips-extorted-money-from-27-corrupt-cops-maintained-register-acb-101612589932803.html

The corruption case goes back to 2017, when Dhoot was Majri naib tehsildar. He, in connivance with subordinate revenue officials and private individuals, is accused of fraudulently selling 99 acres of shamlat land in Seonk village, causing loss of crores of rupees to the exchequer, vigilance had claimed.A senior vigilance official seeking anonymity said many suspicious cash transactions amounting to the crores of rupees were detected in the bank accounts allegedly linked to Dhoot or close aides, including his family members, during the probe of the corruption case.The official added that several transactions among builders, developers and Dhoot besides other vital facts also came to light regarding his alleged investments in two prime marriage palaces in Hoshiarpur district. The vigilance is also probing the source of funds for his house in Sector 8, Chandigarh.In 2017, Punjab vigilance bureau had started a probe into Dhoot’s alleged disproportionate assets. The department had accused him of buying prime properties, some in the name of his family members, spending crores of rupees on a palatial house and buying 25-acre land in Hoshiarpur district.In December 2017, a Jalandhar vigilance inquiry had revealed that Dhoot had amassed immovable and movable property, which was beyond his known sources of income, through corrupt or illegal methods. Vigilance had claimed Dhoot spent around ₹50 lakh more than his income between 2009 and 2015, with the total expenditure detected at ₹2.45 crore. Following this, the Jalandhar vigilance recommended an FIR against Dhoot to Mohali headquarters, after legal opinion.In October 2019, nearly two years after this recommendation, Dhoot filed a representation before vigilance headquarters seeking a re-probe into the disproportionate asset case of 2017. This was allowed, and the Jalandhar vigilance again prepared an expenditure report of Dhoot from 2009 to 2015 and calculated it at ₹2.25 crore. This was ₹18.6 lakh more than his income and fell within the government mandated guideline of less than 10%. Following this, the Jalandhar vigilance wrote to the state revenue department for departmental action.The vigilance sources said since then the matter was pending with the vigilance headquarters which has now ordered to conduct a fresh probe in the light of new facts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/disproportionate-assets-case-vb-starts-fresh-probe-against-ex-zirakpur-naib-tehsildar-101612587754675.html

06-02-2021||Chandigarh||Farmer leaders ready for talks with Centre but without any condition||Into its third month, the dogged farmer protests, centred on the three contentious central farm laws, have dramatically gathered a new momentum in the last one week following a surge in support from the Jatlands of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. In the post-January 26 churn, Rakesh Tikait, 52, a cop-turned-farmer leader, and Balbir Singh Rajewal, 73, a veteran Bhartiya Kisan Union leader from Punjab, have emerged as the pre-eminent face of the agitation that has laid siege to Delhi’s key entry points, garnered international attention and put the Narendra Modi government to a severe test. While Tikait, the son of a tall farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, is the prime mobiliser, Rajewal stands out as a moderate voice of reason among ideologically disparate farm outfits from the border state. On Friday, a day before its nationwide ‘chakka jam (road blockade)’, Tikait and Rajewal dropped a conciliatory signal for resumption of talks with the Centre, while steadfastly swearing by their demand for the repeal of the three farm laws and a legally backed minimum support price. In an exclusive joint interview with HT Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak at the Ghazipur border protest site, the two leaders announced the second phase of their stir up to October 2 and spoke about the protests, the negotiations, the January 26 tractor march, the chances of resuming talks with the government, and the way forward for the agitation. Edited excerpts:Prime Minister Narendra Modi underlined his intent to resolve the farmers’ agitation by committing at the January 30 all-party meeting that the proposal to suspend the three farm laws and set up a committee still stands. What’s your response?Tikait: This is not acceptable to us. We will not talk with conditions. What the government offered after 11 rounds of talks has fallen flat. Now if they offer a new proposal, we will consider starting fresh talks.Which conditions are you referring to?Tikait: The one on the 18-month moratorium. If we take this and enter into talks, that will mean our acceptance of their formula. If they want to go beyond this, the doors to talks can open.What should the Centre do to bring the farmer unions back to the negotiating table?Tikait: They should give up their insistence that there will be no repeal of the three laws and say that there will be talks. Then, we will also vouch for talks. That will create a platform for negotiations. Earlier too, the negotiations were deadlocked for 20 days, but it was broken. I’m sure the talks will happen again.Farmers have taken a repeal-or-nothing stand. How will such an extreme position help create the negotiating space?Tikait: Obstinacy is on the part of the government. It is against the repeal of the laws and legal back-up for minimum support price (MSP). For us, these are the big issues.Rajewal: The government should fulfil its duty and invite us (farm unions). The government is not expected to sit silent and do nothing. Unhone ik baat ki zidd pakad li aur baat cheet ke table par aana nahin. Such a stubborn attitude will not help resolve the issue.Tikait: It’s possible that we may go to the first meeting to just put across our views and then come back to discuss it with our committee. But that would open the door for talks.So, you want the Centre to send an invite?Tikait: Let there be an invitation. Then, things will move forward. Talks are stalled since January 11. Our farmers are in jail, many are missing, and more than 400 tractors have been damaged. The government has put multi-layered barricades and spikes on roads leading to Delhi. People are inconvenienced. Sooner they (the Centre) respond the better. Otherwise, we will be holding meetings across the country. We will launch the second phase of the agitation from Saturday, and it will go on till October 2.The government says the farmers’ movement is based on misinformation that land will be snatched, and corporates will take over agriculture and the MSP will be discontinued.Rajewal: The government is creating such misgivings. In the meetings so far, farms laws were discussed clause by clause. We proved that these are wrong.How have the January 26 events changed the movement?Tikait: Three lakh tractors and 20 lakh people came to Delhi. Such a massive crowd could have done anything. But our agitation was peaceful except the wrong acts of certain elements, who infiltrated our agitation and did all in complicity with the authorities to defame and discredit our movement.The Prime Minister said the country was saddened by the insult to the national flag at Red Fort.Tikait: Will the PM tell us why Red Fort, which is the country’s pride, has been leased to private players? The national flag atop the ramparts was not touched. We even took out sadbhavna marches with the national flag. No one knows and upholds the honour of the Tricolour better than a farmer whose son is a jawan serving on the country’s borders. Before coming to power, the BJP never unfurled the national flag at its offices. The RSS never hoisted the national flag at its headquarters in Nagpur. How can they teach us the izzat of the national flag?The government says the stir is getting support from forces that aim to weaken the country.Rajewal: Who are these forces? Ek aadhi kaa naam batao (Tell us their names). We will deal with such forces. Agar koi desh ko kamzor kar raha hain, uska ilaaz tau hum hi kar denge (If they try to weaken the country, we will sort them out). We have not seen the tent of any such forces at our protest sites. All you see here are farmers from villages who bring their own food material and run community kitchens.As leaders of the movement, what lessons have you learnt from the January 26 episode?Tikait: We have been doing agitations for 35 years. Whosoever is in the Opposition raises slogans and lays siege to Parliament. But, in reality, the protests happen at Jantar Mantar. Has any agitator ever entered Parliament in all these years? On Republic Day, people who declared on the eve of our tractor march that their intention was to reach Red Fort were put up front by the police and given a free run to inner Delhi. The police and the authorities were complicit in this.But, is not it a fact that a section of protesters went out of your control?Tikait: What happened on December 6, 1992, in Ayodhya? All top BJP leaders were there, and the party was in power. Was the Babri mosque structure demolished intentionally? Their affidavits said it was done by a crowd that turned unruly.Many believe that the government’s proposal to stay the implementation of the laws for 18 months and set up a committee with the involvement of farm groups is a reasonable offer; it amounts, for all practical purposes, to the government retreating because this version of the law will be pulled back; it buys enough time to come up with a new framework. Why don’t you accept the offer?Rajewal: These laws are basically wrong and were rammed through Parliament in a high-handed manner. These have been enacted for trading, not agriculture. A farmer doesn’t trade; he takes his crop for marketing. These laws are not meant for farmers. Secondly, in the Constitution’s 7th Schedule, agriculture is a state subject, but they have taken the concurrent list route in which Schedule 33 is on food stuff. Farmers produce foodgrains, not food stuff. So, these laws cheat farmers. Nor do they pass the constitutional test.The farmers’ number has swelled at protest sites of late. There’s a law and order concern. How much control do you have on the crowds?Tikait: We have full control. Anyone who has joined the agitation and protests under some ideology other than the farmers’ cause can go back. We will shun such elements. Anyone involved in the breach of law and our protocol will be responsible for his own actions.As the face of the agitation, what role do you see for yourself to resolve the situation?Tikait: It’s a collective responsibility. Rajewal ji is our key leader. Let the government initiate talks. We also want resolution.The government says the farmers’ view on the laws and the MSP are based on fear and not on facts.Tikait: Even today, farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan sell foodgrains in Punjab and Haryana, which are the only states with MSP. Once there is a law-backed MSP, traders in the entire country will not dare to buy crop at lower than the MSP.Rajewal: Except Punjab and Haryana, the government has not put in place a marketing system in other states. We want a similar marketing system all over by opening 48,000 mandis so that all farmers benefit from the MSP.But there is wide consensus that the country urgently needs agri reforms to improve the farmers’ incomes and modernise agriculture.Rajewal: Of course, we need reforms. But we don’t want corporate agriculture. Reforms should not solely benefit traders at the cost of farmers.Tikait: In the reforms that this government is pushing, traders are trying to invade agriculture.The government has said MSP will continue.Rajewal: On MSP, the government says the existing system will continue. But that doesn’t apply to farmers except in Punjab and Haryana. We want a uniform legally guaranteed MSP for farmers of all states. They want to save the trader, not the farmer.The government at the highest level has repeatedly said that the laws are for benefit of farmers. Why don’t you trust that?Tikait: Farmers see through everything. The problem is that even the existing farmer-related laws are not implemented. Look at the Sugarcane Act that binds sugar mills and the government to pay the farmers’ due within 15 days of procurement, but the farmers get paid after up to two years. And the government do nothing. But these are dangerous laws, and these (farm laws) will be implemented. How can farmers trust the government?There is a trust deficit between Union leaders and the Centre?Tikait: We have full trust in the central government, but it is hell bent on dhokhe baazi (deception). Look at how they have levelled allegations against our movement to break it up by all means. Farmers are being labelled Khalistanis. They say we are getting funds from abroad. Attempts are on to divide us and entangle us on the lines of big versus small farmers and Punjab versus Haryana. This agitation will not break up. The government will have come to the table and talk.Would you talk to the Supreme Court-appointed expert panel?Tikait: We have already rejected that. If someone is studying Kannada, can he solve a question paper in Hindi?The government believes that farm leaders want to find a compromise but buckle under pressure of the radical mood of protesters. You fear being seen as too soft or selling out to the government? Is there a problem of radical competitiveness within the movement?Tikait: We have not backtracked from talks. But come what may, we can’t betray the trust farmers have reposed in us. We are standing for their rights.Rajewal: The constituents of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha are free to give their opinion, but there are no pressures from any quarter. Ours is a collective decision. The government is floating the radical angle to discredit us. It is a ploy to avoid talks.It is Parliament’s prerogative to pass laws. Why should the government repeal the farm laws meant for all states?Tikait: Because the farmers for whom these laws have been made don’t want it.But protests are confined to Punjab, Haryana and western UP?Tikait: The protests are happening in Gujarat, too. More than 100 farmers there have been detained and their families don’t know their whereabouts.Rajewal: The protest sites around Delhi have farmers from Karnataka, Orissa and Chhattisgarh. In that sense, it is a pan-India agitation now.How challenging is it for you to steer an agitation of 32 ideologically diverse organisations?Tikait: If Atal Bihari Vajpayee could run a coalition government of so many parties, why can’t we manage this?Would you give an assurance that during the chakka jam on February 6, there will be no violence?Rajewal: Our agitation was peaceful, is peaceful and will remain so in future. It will be 100% peaceful tomorrow (on Saturday). We have full control over our farmers.In Punjab, there are apprehensions that the agitation may disturb peace and communal harmony. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh says Pakistan may exploit the surcharged atmosphere in the border state.Tikait: We won’t let that happen at any cost.Rajewal: Communal harmony will remain intact in Punjab. I can guarantee that.There is brewing local disenchantment because of the disruption caused by the protests. Is there a possibility of clashes with local communities in urban areas because of your prolonged sit-in?Tikait: We have not blocked the road. The police have barricaded them.Rajewal: Initially, the local people were apprehensive for a few days. But now they have opened their homes for farmers. They are supporting us fully.If no talks happen in the near future, how long will you be able sustain the agitation?Tikait: Second phase will last till October 2. We will decide the course after that.The government believes that the union leaders have a different agenda.Tikait: We are not tricksters. We have no hidden agenda. Our only agenda is that farmers’ ‘roti-roji’ (livelihood and income) should not go into traders’ ‘tijori’ (safes).The government says the opposition parties rallying behind farmers had supported the agri reforms when they were in power.Tikait: Political leaders have their own way when in power. But we are espousing farmers’ interests. We will fight anyone going against that.What will be the political fallout of the agitation?Tikait: We are not doing anything for votes or politics. Anyone who wants to exploit it politically can do it on his own.Rajewal: Voters will get educated and understand how to deal with politicians.What’s your relationship with the BJP now?Tikait: I have relations with all parties. We go by the government’s policies. If they are against farmers, we will oppose that to any extent no matter who is in power.Are there any back channels with the government?Tikait: Our manch (platform) and panch (representatives) will remain the same. Whatever talks happen will only be through them. Singhu will remain our platform.There is a view that the global outpouring of solidarity for farmers’ protest has hurt India’s image.Tikait: Then, let them repeal the laws. What comes first: The country or traders?What is your next course of action?Tikait: The next target is to involve 40 lakh tractors. From Saturday, farmers will bring soil and water from their villages from all over the country. While the government is putting spikes around the protest sites, we will sow flowers here. That will connect our agitation with rural India.The tractor will be the symbol of our agitation and gaon ki mitti and paani (soil and water from villages) will be its devta (presiding deity).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmer-leaders-ready-for-talks-with-centre-but-without-any-condition-101612586014640.html
06-02-2021||Patna||'Nothing new': Bihar defends barring people with criminal antecedents from getting jobs||The Bihar government on Friday clarified that there is nothing new in barring those charged with creating a public nuisance, blocking roads, and destroying public property from getting government jobs or contracts. It added this is a part of the tendering process.Additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani and police chief S K Singhal said the main objective was to prevent people with criminal antecedents from getting government contracts or jobs. They insisted it is mandated by the government orders of 2006 and 2020.On January 21, the state government made it mandatory for contractors to have character certificates from the police. A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting chaired by chief secretary Deepak Kumar. Subhani and Singhal also attended the meeting.“Police verification report (PVR) for character certificate is still a requirement for those applying for government tenders. The Supreme Court has also given directives in this regard. For government jobs, PVR is a necessity before joining. Even those taking sub-contracts have to mandatorily get character certificates from police and that needs to be fully enforced. For those taking sub-contracts for public utilities would also need to get their credentials verified by the police and get an identity card issued,” said Subhani.He said such checks and balances would help clean the system and restore public faith in it. “Public liberty will always be respected as it is of utmost importance for the government. The democratic rights of nobody will be affected in any way. This is not what the government wants. But unscrupulous elements will not be allowed to take advantage of it."Subhani said the police chief had only spoken about further strengthening PVR to ensure people with criminal antecedents do not get into the tendering process. “Even for jobs... [the police chief] has said it should be completed in a time-bound manner so that those joining government service do not face any hassles. If anyone has been convicted or charge-sheeted in any cognizable offence that also needs to be included in the PVR,” he said.Additional police director-general Jitendra Kumar said the PVR order does not bar anybody from getting a government job. “[The government order] no way impinges upon the right of a citizen to take part in any demonstration or procession, which is his or her democratic right." He added the order has referred to a person’s involvement in an activity that might be against the law. “We will be giving no opinions about a person in the PVR.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nothing-new-bihar-defends-barring-people-with-criminal-antecedents-from-getting-jobs-101612583648123.html

The order issued by the department of personnel cited more than 48-hours in police custody as a ground for Agrawal’s suspension.Agrawal, who had taken charge as the commandant of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) in Jaipur last month, was arrested from his office on Tuesday in a case of extortion racket, allegedly run by senior state government officials. Currently, he is in judicial custody.Earlier on January 14, two sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) Pinky Meena (Bandikui) and Pushkar Mittal (Dausa) and one Neeraj Meena, an alleged middleman employed by Manish Agrawal, were arrested in the same case.During investigation, it was found that the IPS officer was allegedly involved in a bid to extort money from a road construction contractor, in connivance with the SDMs named above and the middleman.

06-02-2021||Kolkata||Prashant Kishor backs welfare schemes to help TMC sail through Bengal elections||The Swasthya Sathi health insurance policy and other social welfare schemes of the Bengal government will help the Trinamool Congress (TMC) sail through the coming assembly election as long as its leaders stay focused and united, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s election strategist Prashant Kishor told the party’s Kolkata civic body councillors on Friday evening.Some of those who attended the meeting, held behind the closed doors of a south Kolkata auditorium, told HT that Kishor asked specific questions regarding the party’s organisation in some zones and asked if anyone needed any support from his team or the leadership.There are 144 civic administration wards under the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). Of these, 125 are controlled by the TMC. There are two Lok Sabha constituencies and 11 assembly seats in Kolkata and all were won by the ruling party in the last elections.Debasish Kumar, the TMC’s Kolkata district president and a member of the mayor-in-council of the KMC and Firhad Hakim, the city’s outgoing mayor and urban development minister, told the councillors to be vigilant about campaign strategies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said a TMC councillor who did not want to be named.Also Read: Mamata announces job creation, hike in farm aid ahead of elections“We were asked to be careful about what we say in public. The leadership does not want any sign of dissent to surface,” said the councillor from south Kolkata.Though the BJP could not win in Kolkata in the Lok Sabha poll in 2019, when it bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats, the TMC lost votes in several civic wards in the city. One of these wards is in the Bhawanipore assembly segment won by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Though BJP’s Chandra Kumar Bose, a grandnephew of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose lost the contest, he was ahead in one ward.The BJP has made Kolkata’s former mayor Sovan Chatterjee its election observer for the Kolkata zone. Chatterjee, who was once one of Banerjee’s closest aides, joined the BJP in August 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/prashant-kishor-backs-welfare-schemes-to-help-tmc-sail-through-bengal-elections-101612575479659.html
06-02-2021||Delhi||Light rain chases away pollution, AQI moderate in Delhi||A day after the light rain on Thursday, when the minimum temperature in the city had climbed to 12.4 degrees Celsius, the mercury dropped once again on Friday to a minimum of 6.8 degrees Celsius -- two degrees below the season’s normal.India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said the drop was primarily due to the cold, dry winds blowing in from the snow-clad western Himalayas. The city had recorded 2.1mm rainfall on Thursday under the influence of a western disturbance, which also led to widespread snowfall in the hilly regions.The Safdarjung observatory, which provides the representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6.8 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, on Friday as against 12.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The maximum temperature was 23 degrees Celsius.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said with the passing of the western disturbance, the wind direction over Delhi has changed to north-westerly.“Cold, dry winds from the mountains have started blowing over the plains, resulting in a dip in the minimum temperature,” an IMD official said, wishing not to be named.He said the temperature is likely to fall further over the weekend and settle at around 5-6 degrees Celsius. However, by February 8, the temperature will rise again.“There is another western disturbance that is likely to impact the Himalayas. Its impact on the plains will be a slight rise in the minimum and maximum temperature,” Srivastava said.Meanwhile, the light rain on Thursday, coupled with strong winds, improved the city’s air quality significantly. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi on Friday was 133, in the ”moderate” zone. On Thursday, the average AQI was 316, in the ”very poor” category.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said isolated rain observed under the influence of a western disturbance and high winds contributed to the improvement in AQI.“Surface winds are low in the morning but forecasted to improve during daytime. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and remain in the “moderate” or “poor” category Saturday. “Poor” to “very poor” AQI is forecasted for February 7 and February 8,” Safar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/light-rain-chases-away-pollution-aqi-moderate-indelhi-101612559552380.html
06-02-2021||Delhi||All 184 centres now open for front-line workers to get Covid-19 vaccine||Front-line workers who have registered for the Covid-19 vaccination in Delhi can now go to any of the 184 vaccination centres and get a shot, senior government officials announced on Friday.On Thursday and Friday, several vaccination centres were opened to front-line workers on a trial basis and from Saturday, all existing centres will be opened to them, said officials.Delhi on Friday vaccinated 9,216 of a targeted 18,400 beneficiaries, reflecting a turnout of around 50% -- which is two percentage points lower than the previous day’s, shows data shared by the government.Friday’s 9,216 beneficiaries included both health workers and front-line workers but the government did not share the numbers for each category separately.On Friday, 12 cases of adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI) were recorded but, senior government officials said, none of them was severe in nature.Health workers are the first priority group in the vaccination drive that was rolled out across the country on January 16. In Delhi, around 240,000 health workers have registered for the vaccination.Next on the priority list are front-line workers, which include police personnel, fire personnel, municipal staff, sanitation workers, school teachers and staff across all departments and agencies that are engaged in Covid-19 management.“I request all front-line workers to come forward and take the vaccine at the earliest,” said Pankaj Kumar, district magistrate (north-east Delhi), who took the shot on Friday.Jaidrath Chauhan, a police constable who took the shot on Friday, said, “I had no adverse reactions. I urge people to come forward and take the vaccine. Our job involves a lot of transmission risk. We should get ourselves immunised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-184-centres-now-open-for-front-line-workers-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-101612557999824.html
06-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt reduces circle rates by 20% for next six months||The Delhi government on Friday reduced circle rates, the minimum price at which a property can be bought, for all categories of properties for the next six months, a move that experts said will boost the real estate market and boost revenue for the government.The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Friday. It was decided to reduce the circle rates by 20% for residential, commercial and industrial properties across all categories of localities.“… This decision is expected to make it substantially cheaper for people to do property transactions, revive the real estate sector which has been hit severely by the coronavirus pandemic and create new jobs,” the chief minister’s office said in a statement.The statement further read, “A reduction of 20% in the circle rate would have an impact close to reduction by 1% in the stamp duty or registration charges… The economy by and large at the national level, in general, and the real estate sector, in particular, have witnessed huge slump due to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. Lakhs of construction workers have lost their jobs. While the Kejriwal government has already provided direct monetary relief of ₹10,000 for construction workers of Delhi, there was a need to revive the real estate sector and get the lost jobs back. Today’s decision of the Delhi cabinet will help begin the long-term recovery in the real estate sector.”Circle rate is the minimum designated price per square metre or square feet for land or property fixed for a certain category of locality, at which transactions have to be registered. It varies with each state and is revised from time to time depending on demand, supply and other development indicators pertaining to the concerned area.Delhi broadly has eight categories of localities – from A to H. Category A being the most affluent ones and H being the most economically weaker ones. The circle rates are proportionate. For instance, in an A category locality, circle rate for a residential property so far was ₹7,74,000 per square metre and for one in an H category locality was ₹23,280.Neighbourhoods such as Golf Links, Vasant Vihar and Jor Bagh come under A category, those like Greater Kailash, Defence Colony and Safdarjung Enclave come under B and those in Tagore Garden and Subhash Nagar come under C. Categories D and E mostly have localities that were notified as regularised in the past, some old areas where low-income and mid-income flats were developed and resettlement colonies. Categories F, G and H comprise mostly of unauthorised colonies in which residents have recently availed the opportunity – through a central government scheme – to get their properties registered.For registration, there is a stamp fee on the transaction value – which is 6% for men and 4% for women – to be paid by the buyers. “In property transactions, people tend to keep the transaction value less on paper and essentially pay the registry fee on more or less the circle rate, which is the base rate for property transactions in a concerned area,” said a senior official in the government’s revenue department who did not wish to be identified.In 2018-19, the Delhi government earned around ₹4,459 crore through property registries. For 2019-20, the revised estimate was ₹4,897 crore and for 2020-21, the budget estimate was ₹5,297 crore, showed budget documents of the government.However, a senior official in the finance department said that between April 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020, the Delhi government earned ₹1,860.57 crore, against ₹3,258.47 crore for the corresponding period in the previous financial year.Mudassir Zaidi, executive director of real estate consultant group Knight Frank, said: “The real estate sector in Delhi was already witnessing a slump for several years now. The demonetisation in November 2016 came as a major blow. And then Covid-19 happened. The market is now showing slow signs of recovery. This decision by the Delhi government would significantly contribute to the market’s revival by boosting the volume of transactions, especially in the most affluent colonies in Delhi where market rates of properties had dropped below circle rates. The government’s decision is capable of rectifying such anomalies in the system.”Ritesh Mehta, senior director and head (west India) residential services at JLL India, said: “It is a positive move and will encourage the fence sitters to take the plunge. The cost of a house may not be directly impacted by the move as the cost is a function of many other factors like demand and supply but will give a positive push to the real estate market. In the residential segment, it will impact more in Category A which is categorised as posh and high-end, where typically the market rates are lower than the circle rate. It will boost luxury transactions as the monetary impact would be high.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-reduces-circle-rates-by-20-for-next-six-months-101612556086823.html
06-02-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt forms GoM under Sisodia to draw up new excise policy||The Delhi cabinet on Friday appointed a group of ministers (GoM) to finalise a new excise policy for the national capital.The GoM, under deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, will deliberate on a report submitted to the government by a committee of experts that was set up by Sisodia last year to augment the excise revenue of the city-state.HT had earlier reported on these recommendations, the primary ones being that restaurants, clubs and pubs be allowed to stay open until 3 am daily, instead of 1am; that these outlets be allowed to serve full bottles at the table; and that they be given permission to serve liquor in open areas such as rooftops and balconies.The committee has also said anyone over the age of 21 years should be able to get a drink at the bar or hotel. In Delhi, at least on paper, the minimum age to be served liquor at an establishment is 25.The same committee had also recommended that the number of dry days in the capital be reduced from 21, on average, to just three a year, and norms be relaxed for department stores to avail of licences for selling wine and beer.Other than Sisodia, who also holds the finance and excise portfolios in Delhi, the GoM will have as members health minister Satyendar Jain and revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, the Delhi government said.“The new excise policy of the Delhi government will ensure transparency, ease of doing business for taxpayers and business sector too, and ensure steady growth of government revenues… The group of ministers will examine all aspects of the current system -- of excise duty administration; the report submitted by the expert committee and its suggestions; and feedback and comments received from stakeholders and general public -- before making a final policy decision in the coming weeks,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-forms-gom-under-sisodia-to-draw-up-new-excise-policy-101612555742995.html
06-02-2021||Delhi||Govt floats tender to select agency for setting up 100 e-charging points||A day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a campaign to promote electric vehicles (EV) in the capital city, the Delhi government on Friday floated a tender to hire an agency for setting up 500 e-vehicle charging points across 100 locations within a year, informed power minister Satyendar Jain.Jain said the charging stations will be for both two-wheelers and four-wheelers, both private and commercial. Most of the chosen sites are located outside Metro stations and at bus depots in the city, he said.Jain further said, “This is the largest tender for public charging in India… We are working relentlessly towards the vision of making Delhi the EV capital of India. For the charging station project, the full power infrastructure cost will be borne by the Delhi government. Some of these charging stations will also double up as battery swapping stations. At least 20% of them will have the slower variety of chargers and 10% will have the faster variety in order to cater to all kinds of e-vehicles,” said Jain at a press conference on Friday.In a press statement, the Dialogue and Development Commission, a think tank of the Delhi government, said, “The ‘Switch Delhi’ campaign launched by CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday is a mass awareness campaign to sensitise each and every Delhi resident about the benefits of switching to e-vehicles. Under the policy, the government has offered multiple financial and non-financial incentives to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the capital. Industry leaders continue to hail the campaign and they have shown tremendous support to CM Arvind Kejriwal’s appeal.”While launching the campaign on Thursday, Kejriwal had said that his government will, in the next six months, change its policy to lease only electric cars as part of an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric cars in the city.The government launched the campaign to inform, encourage and motivate every person in Delhi to switch from polluting vehicles to zero-emission EVs. All the hired cars being engaged by various departments of the Delhi government will switch to EVs within six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-floats-tender-to-select-agency-for-setting-up-100-e-charging-points-101612555505574.html
06-02-2021||Other||BJP, Shiv Sena trade barbs against each other over power bills, fuel price rise||Former allies, Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), staged protests against each other’s governments in the state and Centre. While BJP leaders took to the streets to protest against the inflated power bills issued by the state power distribution company, the Sena staged protests against the Centre over the hike in fuel and cooking gas prices. After backing the farmers’ stir in Delhi earlier this week, the Sena has now decided to take up issues that touch the lives of its core constituency: the middle-class. Sena leaders led the protests at Dadar, Byculla, Goregaon, Thane and Mira-Bhayander areas against the “loot of common man” by the Union government. Party legislators also staged protests and bullock-cart and cycle rallies in Pune, Aurangabad and Nashik districts. Protesters in Mumbai and other cities raised slogans against the Narendra Modi-government. At Mira-Bhayander, Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik led the protests, while legislators Sunil Prabhu and Ravindra Waikar were in the forefront of the agitation at Goregaon and Jogeshwari. Sena vibhag pramukh (division head) Ashish Chemburkar, who was leading protest at Byculla, said the fuel prices have been hiked since the lockdown was lifted, and soon, the petrol prices will reach Rs100 per litre. “The Centre has been looting the citizens for months by increasing the fuel prices and LPG cylinder prices. This has to stop. Sena will intensify protests if the Centre does not arrest the price rise,” Chemburkar said. Responding to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s attack on the state government to reduce its share of tax on fuel, Chemburkar said, “The price of petrol would be Rs92 [per litre] after reducing the state tax. Do the ones who seek the state’s tax believe that the price of fuel at Rs92 is less?” Ambadas Danve, Sena Member of the Legislative Council and party district chief of Aurangabad said the fuel price rise over the past few months have been “crushing” the common citizens. “Households are bearing the brunt of cylinder price rise. Cylinders that used to cost Rs300-400 some years earlier now cost double. The Centre has launched many schemes but they have not reached the common citizens,” he said. Former parliamentarian Chandrakant Khaire cited “corruption at the highest levels” as the reason behind the fuel price rise. “I have been on the committees in the Centre. I know how things work. The crude oil prices are at an all-time low, and yet, fuel [petrol] is Rs94 [per litre].” Meanwhile, BJP staged protests outside the regional offices of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) to oppose the disconnection of power over pending bills. The party has accused the state-owned firm of having sent inflated bills to consumers during the Covid-19 lockdown last year. In Nagpur, former state energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule led the protest march, while at Nashik, it was headed by legislator Devyani Farande. In Kolhapur, clashes broke out between BJP workers and the police as the protestors tried to lock the regional office of MSEDCL as part of their ‘Tala Thoko’ protest. At Mumbai, legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar led a protest march outside Adani Power’s Kandivli office over the inflated bills’ issue. Party’s former MP Kirit Somaiya and other workers were arrested by police after they tried to lock MSEDCL office at Bhandup. “The Thackeray government had announced to waive off the inflated bills issued during lockdown. The government did not keep its word, and has on the contrary has sent notices to 7.5 million consumers warning the disconnection of the supply for non-payments. Most of the bills are inflated and fake. The citizens are not in a position of paying these bills owing to the job and income loss during the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government has been ruthlessly taking action against the citizens. We will continue our protest until the bills are waived off,” said Bawankule. Meanwhile, the Mumbai unit and BJP’s minority cell also staged a protest outside the party’s Nariman Point office, demanding the immediate arrest Sharjeel Usmani for his alleged provocative speech at the Elgaar Parishad conclave last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-shiv-sena-trade-barbs-against-each-other-over-power-bills-fuel-price-rise-101612553250576.html
06-02-2021||Other||Firefighter injured in major blaze at Mumbai godown||A major fire was reported in a godown at Kurla scrap compound in the Mandala area at Mankhurd (East) on Friday at 2.44pm. The Mumbai Fire Brigade pressed 13 fire engines, 11 jumbo tankers, a quick response vehicle and an ambulance for the dousing operations, which were going on till late on Friday night. No civilian injuries have been reported in the blaze but a 40-year-old firefighter, identified as station officer Harish Naskar, suffered minor injuries during the dousing operations. He was rushed to Shatabdi hospital and his condition is said to be stable. The fire increased in intensity and was declared a level-3 blaze at 2.47pm. Following this, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started three water-filling points at Chheda Nagar, Deonar abattoir and Ghatkopar Yard for jumbo tankers to refill. Ajit Narwade, assistant commissioner of the M-East ward, under whose jurisdiction the area lies, said, “The fire was reported in a scrap godown. The godown contained oil barrels and hence, it is taking longer to douse the fire. The fire did not break out near the Deonar dumping ground but around the creek. Fortunately, the spot is not close to any residential area, and all the nearby structures are also godowns.” Mayor Kishori Pednekar had visited the spot on Friday afternoon. Narwade said, “The collector will verify if the godowns were storing scrap material legally, as this is land owned by the Mumbai Suburban collector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/firefighter-injured-in-major-blaze-at-mumbai-godown-101612552830196.html
06-02-2021||Mumbai||Amit Shah to inaugurate Narayan Rane’s medical college in Maharashtra||Union home minister Amit Shah is slated to inaugurate the SSPM Medical College at Kudal, in Sindhudurg, founded by a trust chaired by the former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Narayan Rane on Sunday. The inauguration assumes significance as the tussle between Shiv Sena and BJP over the political control in the district is at its peak.After the multi-speciality hospital was inaugurated by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in 2017, the medical college attached to it will be inaugurated by Shah on Sunday.The inauguration, which was originally scheduled for Saturday was postponed due to the nationwide chakka jam agitation announced by the farmers protesting against farm bills on the borders of Delhi.According to the BJP leaders in the state, Shah’s presence at the inaugural function is assumed significant in the backdrop party’s endeavour in resting control in coastal districts. “Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by Uddhav Thackeray has been focusing on Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg since it has assumed the power for obvious regions. This has led to the stern political friction between Sena and BJP, who are fighting to wrest control over the region. Amit Shah’s maiden visit to Sindhudurg will help party strengthen its base,” said a BJP leader from Konkan requesting anonymity.Thackeray government recently announced a new government medical college at Oras in Sindhudurg. The move was reportedly to give Rane a tough time as the proposed medical college is just a few kilometres away.Rane said, “All the key party leaders from state and Amitji Shah are attending the inauguration function on Sunday. Our hospital and medical college is the state of the art structure with all facilities. Hospital has over 650 beds, while college has 150 seats.”When asked about the state government’s announcement of setting up a medical college at Oras, Rane said, “The government has not been able to run its existing hospitals, and have announced a new one for Sindhudurg. But we are ready to face the competition.”Rane built his pollical career in Shiv Sena and became chief minister for a brief stint of nine months in 1999. He joined Congress in 2005 and remained a minister in successive Congress-NCP governments. He lost the Assembly elections to the Sena in 2014. He quit Congress in September 2017 and floated his own outfit only to merge it with BJP in a few months. The BJP made him Rajya Sabha member of Parliament (MP) in 2018.Rane has been bete noire of Shiv Sena since his expulsion from the party in 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amit-shah-to-inaugurate-narayan-rane-s-medical-college-in-maharashtra-101612552530562.html
06-02-2021||Lucknow||UP govt asks lawmakers to buy iPads to facilitate paperless budget session||The Uttar Pradesh government has asked all state legislators to buy Apple iPads ahead of the state budget session that would begin on February 18. The move appears to be aimed at presenting a paperless budget for 2021-22. A sum of ₹50,000 each will be reimbursed to the lawmakers for buying the iPads.“Yes, the state government has asked the legislators to buy an Apple iPad before the budget session of the state legislature commencing on February 18, 2021. A sum of ₹50,000 will be reimbursed to them for buying the iPad,” finance minister Suresh Khanna said.Khanna said centralised procurement and distribution of the device would have taken more time and hence a decision to allow the legislators to buy the Apple iPad, which was found most useful for them, had been taken.As the state assembly would have to buy about 403 iPads for MLAs (members of legislative assembly) and about an additional 100 iPads for MLCs (members of legislative council), the state government would have required over ₹2.5 crore for the procurement. It may have to incur additional expenditure to buy the equipment for the staff of the two houses of the legislature.Also read: 4G Mubarak! tweets Abdullah with mobile internet services being restored in J-KKhanna parried a question about how the state government proposed to provide funds for the purpose. He also refused to answer questions about restoring the Vidhayak Nidhi (legislators’ fund like the MPLAD fund for MPs) before the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.The state government has also proposed a special training session for the legislators from February 11 to 13, 2021 to enable them to learn the use of iPad.“Besides lessons in the use of iPad, experts from the National Informatics Centre will also impart training to legislators in paperless proceedings of the House and submitting questions and other notices online,” said an official.“Yes, we have received a letter from the Vidhan Parishad secretariat. This is all about dual standards. The BJP used to oppose when former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was bringing information technology. It’s now coming in handy for everybody. The state government could have found a permanent solution to the issue of having paperless proceedings by setting up permanent (work)stations for the legislators instead of giving them just iPads,” said Congress MLC Deepak Singh.SK Dwivedi, former head of political science department at Lucknow University, said, “Digitisation in every sector is a welcome move. The legislators should, however, be properly trained to make them comfortable in the use of technology. As far as the Congress' reaction to the move is concerned, it’s not healthy. Instead of reacting as the opposition, all the parties should join hands to welcome the move, a major step towards good governance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-asks-lawmakers-to-buy-ipads-to-facilitate-paperless-budget-session-101612552352098.html

06-02-2021||Kolkata||Nadda’s Bengal ‘rath yatra’ may run into TMC’s motorcycle rally; traffic chaos||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) first ‘rath yatra’ in West Bengal ahead of the upcoming assembly polls is likely to witness chaos in Nadia district on Saturday because the youth wing of ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) will also launch its biggest rally in the district with 10,000 two-wheelers and tableaus.BJP national president JP Nadda will launch the two-day roadshow, which the party has named 'paribartan yatra' (journey for change), at Nabadwip, one of the most sacred places for Hindu pilgrims, at 3.30 pm. The roadshow will pass through all 15 assembly constitutes in Nadia in two days. The TMC’s motorcycle rally, which has been named 'janasamarthan yatra' (journey for mass support), will pass through eight constituencies during the same period.A district police official, who did not wish to be named, said, “With so many people travelling from different parts of Nadia and possibly adjoining districts as well to take part in these two programmes, movement of traffic may be hit in several parts. We are especially worried about NH-34.”The BJP will take out four similar roadshows in other parts of the Bengal. Union home minister Amit Shah is scheduled to attend the last roadshow later this month.Also read: Mamata Banerjee showers SOPs in budget ahead of crucial assembly pollsJayanta Saha, the youth wing president of the TMC’s Krishnanagar organizational zone in Nadia, said the route of the BJP’s 'paribartan yatra' may crisscross the one to be followed by his party’s rally.“Our programme was planned and announced in January. We took permission from the authorities long ago. It is the BJP which is following us. They informed the authorities a couple of days ago,” he told HT.“We announced this programme in January and carried out our 'samanyay yatra' (journey for unity) at Krishnanagar on January 14. On that day, we declared that on February 6 we will launch the 'janasamarthan yatra' across all eight assembly segments in the TMC’s Krishnanagar organisational zone. The BJP is following us, although it does not have mass support,” Saha said.Incidentally, the BJP wrested the district’s Ranaghat Lok Sabha seat in 2019.“The motorcycle rally will start at 10 am and 10,000 motorcycles and tableaus, carrying placards on the performance of the government, will start from Chapra and pass through eight constituencies in two days. This is going to be a historic event. Nadda is an outsider. Mamata Banerjee or senior state leaders need not come here. The youth workers of the TMC have enough strength to counter him,” said Saha.Asked whether the TMC's motorcyclists would change their route if they crossed the path of the BJP's roadshow, Saha said, "We believe that in a democracy, all parties have the right to carry out roadshows. Our rally will be gigantic. The BJP can always follow us."The TMC and BJP exchanged allegations for three days over police permission for Nadda’s roadshow. The matter even reached the Kolkata high court where a lawyer filed a petition which will be heard on February 9. The controversy started after the state government asked the BJP to seek permission from authorities in the districts where roadshows will be held. The Nadia district authorities gave it a nod on Thursday.The TMC said on Twitter that the state government did not deny permission to the roadshow but the BJP started a “malicious propaganda.”"GoWB has not denied permission to any Yatra, as claimed by @BJP4Bengal. They are indulging in malicious propaganda with neither substance nor truth. BJP must show material evidence of GoWB denying permission to their Yatra. This is BJP's attempt to claim victimhood," the TMC tweeted on Friday.The superintendents of Krishnanagar and Ranaghat districts in Nadia could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the Bengal BJP, said the onus will be on the district authorities if there is any trouble during Nadda’s roadshow.Some cars in Nadda’s convoy were stoned at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas on January 10 and the Centre and the state locked horns over alleged lapses in police arrangement since the BJP president is provided with Z-category security cover.“Let me first clarify that we did not seek any permission for our 'paribartan yatra'. We sent an intimation to the Nadia district authorities. Secondly, the TMC’s motorcycle rally is part of Mamata Banerjee’s recent reactive politics. Having realised that the BJP is coming to power, she has gone into a reactive mode and imitating everything that we are doing. The biggest example of this is her decision to contest from Nandigram from where Suvendu Adhikari was elected,” said Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/naddas-bengal-rath-yatra-may-run-into-tmc-s-motorcycle-rally-traffic-chaos-101612551904553.html

06-02-2021||Mumbai||Congress appoints Nana Patole as chief of its Maharashtra unit||The All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Friday appointed Nana Patole, 56, its four-term legislator from Sakoli in Bhandara district, as its Maharashtra unit chief. The party also appointed six working presidents -- former ministers Shivajirao Moghe, Chandrakant Handore, Arif Naseem Khan, Basavraj Patil and young MLAs Praniti Sushilkumar Shinde and Kunal Rohidas Patil – instead of the existing five, most of whom have been accommodated in the state cabinet. Patole resigned as the Assembly speaker on Thursday evening. The party is now considering senior legislators KC Padvi, Sangram Thopate and Suresh Varpudkar for the post. The AICC has also appointed 10 new vice-presidents, including Ramesh Bagwe, Hussain Dalwai, Shirish Chaudhari and Mohan Joshi, among others. The party has replaced its parliamentary board under the new state president. The 37-member board comprises former chief ministers Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan, former cabinet ministers Shivraj Patil Chakurkar, Milind Deora, Mukul Wasnik, Vilas Muttemwar. Keeping an eye on the ensuing Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections, the party has appointed two working presidents from Mumbai. Khan is the party’s Muslim face, while Handore is a prominent Dalit leader. Moghe is a tribal leader from Vidarbha, while Basavraj Patil, a Lingayat, has been appointed to represent Marathwada. He is the only working president from the outgoing team of five to be retained. Praniti, the daughter of Sushilkumar Shinde, and Kunal, son of former minister Rohidas Patil, represent western and north Maharashtra. Konkan has, however, been not given any representation. Patole said, “My aim is to take the party to the top position in the state. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government is stable and enjoys a thumping majority. There are no differences within the ruling parties. We have taken key Shiv Sena and NCP leaders into confidence while making the changes. Soniaji spoke to Sena chief Uddhavji Thackeray and NCP president Sharad Pawarsaheb.” Pawar on Thursday said the decision over the new speaker of the Assembly should be taken by the three ruling parties. This led to speculation over the other two parties staking claim to the post. The Congress has, however, asserted that the next speaker will be from the Congress. Congress’s former state unit chief Manikrao Thakre even said then the party should demand for the post of deputy chief minister. Patole, however, said: “It is his personal opinion.” Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said there was no question of the post going to any other ruling party. Among the frontrunners for the post, Padvi is the tribal development minister, while Varpudkar is a senior legislator and former minister from Marathwada. Thopte is elected from Pune district and is considered as a staunch rival of Pawar. Patole is seen as an aggressive leader from Vidarbha, an erstwhile stronghold where the party now faces strong competition from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He has influence in the peasant Kunbi community. In several parts of the region, the community supported the Congress in the 2019 Assembly elections. Patole began as a Congress leader and later shifted to the BJP. He was elected as a BJP MP in 2014 from the Bhandara-Gondia constituency, but in December 2017, he quit the party by criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and returned to the Congress. He was elected to the state Assembly in 2019 and was made Speaker when the MVA formed the government.Political analyst Pratap Asbe said Patole’s organisational skills are yet to be proved, but he enjoys mass support in parts of Vidarbha. “Not being part of the state Cabinet, unlike incumbent chief Balasaheb Thorat, will help him in asserting the party position on political issues.” According to a Congress leader, the new appointments have struck regional and caste balance and have given due representation to new and old leaders. “Leaders like Moghe, Khan and Basavraj Patil have been elevated after they lost the elections in 2019,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-appoints-nana-patole-as-chief-of-its-maharashtra-unit-101612552170005.html

The corporation has not allocated any budget for several ambitious projects like the waterfront development, Personal Rapid Transit System (PRTS), water transport and sports complex at Mental Hospital among others.The TMC chief, Dr. Vipin Sharma, informed that the budget was only allocated for important projects this fiscal year.Read more: Thane civic body budget ₹1.3K-cr less than last yearSharma said, “We have not allotted any budget to projects that are not immediately important or are still in the primary stage. We have, instead, shortlisted those projects that are halfway or 70 per cent to 80 per cent complete, and the work was delayed during lockdown. These mainly include flyovers, Rail Over Bridges or other transport projects that impact the residents. In the next six months, if we get enough revenue for these projects, we will allot it.”The corporation had earlier proposed ₹2154.02Cr for capital expenditure, which was cut down to ₹1,057.36Cr this year. The waterfront development and water transport were some of the ambitious projects of the corporation along with the PRTS.Read more: Thane corporators demand status of earlier budget, create ruckusSharma informed that some of the projects that will be taken up includes the third Kalwa Creek Bridge, Kharegaon ROB, Diva ROB, extended Thane station at Mental Hospital, Thane East Satis, Subways, Coastal Road, Road widening and Light Rail Transit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-budget-ambitious-projects-kept-on-hold-for-now-says-tmc-chief-101612551930122.html
06-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC suspends sentence of man convicted of raping minor cousin||The Bombay high court (HC), while observing that as the minor in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act case has resiled from her statement in the first information report (FIR), and as the forensic lab report to prove sexual assault was not available till the conclusion of the trial, has suspended the sentence and allowed bail to a 19-year-old man who was convicted for sexually assaulting his 15-year-old cousin who was staying at his home. The court observed that consensual sex with a minor has been in a legal grey area because the consent given by a minor is not considered to be valid in the eyes of law. It also considered that as the survivor had retracted her statement and her mother had also been unfriendly during the trial, the issues would be decided in the hearing of the appeal against the conviction. Till then, the sentence of the man would remain suspended and granted him bail. A bench of justice SK Shinde, while hearing an interim application in an appeal which challenged the conviction of the 19-year-old Sanpada resident, was informed by senior advocate MS Mohite that the statement made by the survivor of the sexual assault had been retracted and hence, the sentence should be suspended till the appeal against the conviction was heard. The court said that the contention of the prosecution that there was presumption of culpability and mental state of the convict while committing the offence, the same would have to be dealt with in the appeal and allowed the man to be released on bail. According to the complaint lodged by the teacher of the survivor in March 2018, the minor seemed depressed and disclosed to the teacher that her cousin had sexually assaulted her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-suspends-sentence-of-man-convicted-of-raping-minor-cousin-101612551870067.html
06-02-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee showers SOPs in budget ahead of crucial assembly polls||With an eye on the crucial assembly elections ahead, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, while presenting the state’s the vote-on-account in the legislative assembly on Friday, showered SOPs and made a series of announcements.The list included generating 1.5 crore new employment opportunities, hiking farmer’s aid, free ration and cooked food from common kitchen for the poor and pension for senior citizens and widows, among others.“With the permission of the Speaker, I propose a budget of ₹299,688 crore (net) for the year 2021-22 on behalf of the state government,” Banerjee read from the interim annual financial statement.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been targeting the ruling TMC over lack of employment in the state and depriving the state’s farmers from getting the financial benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana.“The state should publish a white paper and initiate a probe on all contractual jobs done till date. It should make public the number of people employed through such contracts, when were they recruited and how. The entire process is shady and corrupt,” said Shamik Bhattacharya, BJP’s state spokesperson.Also read: Delhi Police write to Google, seek data on toolkit shared by Greta ThunbergThis was the last budget presentation during the second term of the Trinamool Congress-government which first came to power in 2011 and for the second term in 2016. Assembly elections could be held in March–April this year.Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls where the party won 18 of the 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-seated legislative assembly.The chief minister, even in the financial statement, attacked the BJP-led Centre saying, “Had the Central government provided some financial relief in this hour (cyclone Amphan, Covid-19 pandemic and the economic depression) of crisis, it would have helped us in meeting the challenges.”In the Union budget, the Centre had allocated ₹25,000 for road infrastructure development and renovation of roads. In a counter, Banerjee announced construction of 46,000 kilometres of rural roads and several other roads and flyovers and allocated nearly 3000 kilometres for the next financial year.With the crucial assembly elections just around the corner, the BJP and the TMC are virtually engaged in a tug-o-war over Bengal’s icons. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which is hoping to unseat the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in the state, and the TMC have both laid claim to Bengali icons Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. In the budget, Banerjee stated that the state would construct Azad Hind Monument in respect of Netaji.As the CM read out the statement, BJP legislators trooped into the well of the assembly, demanding that Mitra, and not Banerjee, should be reading out the vote-on-account. Later, they walked out of the House. They staged a walkout and shouted ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans while going out of the assembly. Left Front and Congress MLAs also boycotted the session.Usually, the finance minister reads out the budget statement. But this year, state finance minister Amit Mitra could not attend the assembly due to health issues.Although the budget announces a plan for the full year, this year because of the assembly elections, the expenditure approval will be sought over the next three months in the form of a 'vote on account'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-showers-sops-in-budget-ahead-of-crucial-assembly-polls-101612551609629.html
06-02-2021||Mumbai||Fresh differences in MVA over making BMC single planning authority||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is facing a fresh round of differences over making the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) a single planning authority for Mumbai. The Shiv Sena, which is ruling the civic body, has supported the idea on the grounds that it would help in the development of the city. However, its ruling partners —the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress — have opposed it. They are of the view that it would create issues among various government agencies and could hamper city’s development. They also suspect that the Sena wants to take complete control of the city through the move. The Sena has been ruling BMC, one of the richest civic bodies in Asia, since over two decades. While presenting the budget for 2021-22, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said they wanted BMC to be made a single planning authority for the city and a proposal has been sent to the state government accordingly.Currently, the city has multiple planning authorities such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT). These bodies have jurisdiction over certain areas in the city where BMC is not the planning authority. For example, MMRDA is the planning authority for parts of Bandra Reclamation, Bandra-Kurla Complex and Nariman Point; many areas along the east coast of Mumbai are with MbPT, Andheri East is in the possession of MIDC; SRA is the planning authority for all slums in the city from Dahisar to Colaba; and there are 156 layouts of Mhada across the city.“It appears that the Sena wants to take complete control of the city by giving all the powers to BMC, but it would create a mess in the city if anything of this sort happens. The problem is how the municipal commissioner can take such a decision of mentioning it in the budget book without any political deliberations. It is a coalition government and any policy decision must be deliberated among the ruling partners beforehand,” said a senior NCP minister, requesting anonymity.Citing the example of the structure of the state government, he said, “Going by the argument pushed by the Shiv Sena, why does the state need other ministers in the government when all the decisions have to be approved only by the chief minister as the head of the government. “The argument of the gap in coordination makes no sense,” he further said.State transport minister and senior Sena leader Anil Parab said they are of the same view as BMC as it would be in the interest of the city, but added that the decision would be taken only after holding deliberations with the ruling allies. “There should be only one planning authority for the city and it is our (Sena) stand. There are 16 different authorities in the city at present, some are related to the state government while others are associated with the Centre; hence lack of coordination create hurdles in city’s development works,” Parab said.Citing an example, he said, “The layout of 56 colonies of Mhada has to be prepared for redevelopment. BMC has enough manpower for the work, but they (Mhada) do not have enough manpower, which is delaying the redevelopment work. Similarly, works such as cleaning of drainages get delayed because of lack of coordination among many of these authorities.”He also clarified that no decision has been taken yet. “We will be taking a decision only after deliberating it with the allies,” Parab said.However, state housing minister Jitendra Awhad, who hails from NCP, strongly opposed the move on Friday. He said, “It was morally wrong on the part of the municipal commissioner to make such a demand without any sort of political deliberations. The issue is not limited to Mhada but also SRA and MMRDA which have played an important part in the development of Mumbai. Mhada is now constructing houses across the state. Decentralisation also helps in speedy implementation of development works.”Deputy chief minister and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar was cautious while making a comment. “The Sena has a clear majority in BMC and they are ruling the civic body for more than two decades. The decision of the civic body has been made by the mayor, deputy mayor, standing committee chief, leader of the house; and the municipal commissioner implements the decision. Why would he want it to be done? The president of the party (Sena), which is leading the corporation, is also the chief minister. Every decision has to be approved by him. Can Chahal say anything without his approval?” Pawar told reporters in Pune.The Congress has openly opposed the concept with Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap saying that the contribution of other agencies in the development of the city cannot be overlooked. “The Congress is opposed to the idea of making BMC the single planning authority in the city. Other agencies such as MMRDA and Mhada have also significantly contributed to the development of the city and their rights should not be taken away. A detailed discussion was held before the formation of these authorities; it is not like the decisions were taken following someone’s whims and fancies. We will not let this happen,” Jagtap said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fresh-differences-in-mva-over-making-bmc-single-planning-authority-101612551750171.html
06-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body’s income from investments likely to drop by half this year||In the backdrop of Covid-19 lockdown the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is taking every measure to increase its revenue, but the falling income from investments parked in banks in the form of fixed deposits remains to be an area of concern. According to estimates made by BMC in the 2021-22 budget, it expects to earn over ₹975 crore as income from investments, which is half of what it estimated in 2020-21 ( ₹1,828 crore). BMC has maintained that falling interest rate and repo rate since five years have been affecting its income from its own reserves.In terms of exact quantum, BMC presently has ₹50,953.27 crore in reserves which are linked to various infrastructure projects and ₹26,682.95 crore locked in for pensions, provident funds and gratuity of its staff. The major sources of revenue for 2021-22 for BMC include grant-in-aid on account of compensation in lieu of octroi at ₹10,583.08 crore, income from property tax at ₹7,000 crore, income from development plan department at ₹2,000 crore followed by income from interest on investments at ₹975.56 crore, income from water and sewerage charges at ₹1598.08 crore. Overall, BMC expects a revenue income of ₹27,811.57 crore, which is ₹636.73 crore less than the budget of 2020-21.Commenting on dip in BMC’s revenue from investments, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal in his budget speech said, “Repo rate is consistently reducing. In January 2015, it was 7.75% which reduced to 4% in December 2020. Consequently, the average interest rate on investment in term deposit is reduced, which has resulted in decrease in income from interest.”Explaining why the revenue from investments is going down drastically this year, Chahal said, “The falling repo rate is something that is happening countrywide, and this loss of revenue cannot be attributed to anything considering the rate is falling for all. Another reason we have to understand is that whatever revenue we get in the form of investments is not realised entirely. There is 42% tax to be paid to income tax department, and what we will get after taxation this year is around ₹975 crore. This is our estimate. If we get more, it will go into BMC’s kitty.”A BMC official from finance department said, “A part of the income from investments is diverted towards provident fund, gratuity. Considering all those factors, we have prepared an estimation of over ₹900 crore. According to BMC officials, another reason for income from investments going down is because the annual growth rate of the money parked in fixed deposits grew by 15% to 17% in the past, but it has come down to 6% and 3% in the past two years. Also, the income in the form of interest from fixed deposits has been varying year-on-year as BMC has in the past withdrawn funds from its reserves for completion of infrastructure projects and providing other civic amenities. BMC in this year’s budget has proposed several measures to increase revenue including introducing scrutiny fees for Mumbai Fire Brigade, a fee regulatory authority to review taxes relating to BMC from time to time. However, these are measures that will yield results in the long-term.Milind Mhaske from NGO Praja Foundation said, “The basic problem, if I may point out, is the practice to raise money from reserves. This year, in the form of internal loan, we are touching the principal amount that BMC has with it. In layman’s terms, BMC should stop this practice of taking money from the reserves and ensure taking steps where income from investments is increased rather than going down.”Commenting on the same, Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party (SP) corporator and group leader in BMC, said, “ BMC should give a proper explanation on why there is going to be drastic fall in revenue from investments as I feel it is not only due to falling interest rates. Apart from falling interest rate, what I understand is that BMC may also withdraw money from its reserves, leading to fall in its principal amount. This trend of withdrawing money from reserves should be stopped, considering it not only results in principal amount going down, but also results in income from investments going down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-s-income-from-investments-likely-to-drop-by-half-this-year-101612551511141.html

This wall, which is supposed to help the needy, is filled with clothes and no one has picked them up.The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has set up several such walls with racks across the city since the last month, where one can drop wearable clothes or any other items for the needy, and those in need can simply pick up any of their choice anytime.“This is a great initiative by the civic body but the one which is kept backside of the auditorium is of no use as it cannot be seen. Only if it is placed at a proper place can one make use of it. The clothes which are dropped by people are yet to be taken away,” Sanket Joshi, 38, who lives nearby.Presently, the racks are overflowing with clothes and they are not picked by anyone. KDMC initiated the Wall of Humanity with the help of Helping Hands, a Kalyan-based NGO. The wall at Karnik Road, Syndicate, Kalyan (W) has got good response from the needy as the wall is visible and several needy reach there to pick the clothes or other items.Read more: ‘Wall of Humanity’ set up to help needy in KalyanRamdas Kokre, deputy commissioner of KDMC, said, ”What we can do is change the location of this wall in the coming days if there is no response. Firstly, we will ask the security guard there to create awareness among people. Following this, if the situation is the same, we will change the location.”So far, the civic body has managed to set up eight such walls across Kalyan-Dombivli, with most of them having a good response.Kokre had set up such a wall in Karjat and it gained popularity. The same idea was implemented in the KMDC limits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wall-of-humanity-has-no-takers-in-kalyan-101612551510036.html
06-02-2021||Mumbai||Budget: Mumbai may not get respite from flooding at 97 spots||During this year’s monsoon, 97 flood-prone spots are likely to remain in the city, while 118 will be tackled before the season begins, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) budget for 2021. Of the 97 spots that are expected to remain, BMC plans to tackle 40 before 2022’s monsoon and 44 are not on civic-owned areas, but on government or private-owned property. The latter will be tackled in coordination with the owners. According to BMC’s budget 2021, the total number of waterlogging spots in the city has increased to 386 this year. HT had reported in June 2020 that waterlogging spots had increased to 336 during last year’s monsoon, compared to 273 spots in the monsoon of 2019. Last February, BMC had listed 273 flood-prone spots while presenting the budget and the then civic chief Praveen Pardeshi had said work on 69 spots was pending. “Micro planning of every flooding spot is carried out and various works have been completed to tackle 171 number of flooding spots. Remedial works to tackle 118 number of flooding spots are taken in hand and the same are expected to be completed before onset of monsoon 2021,” said BMC’s budget 2021. BMC also plans to install mini pumping stations at JK Chemical nullah at Sion; Kharu creek nullah in Bandra (East); and Mallet Bunder in Ferry Wharf. With these, gate pumps will be provided at outfalls to eliminate tidal effect on the stormwater drain network. A senior civic official said, “This will bring relief to waterlogging in low-lying areas where it is seen when high tide comes at a time of very heavy rainfall. In Mumbai, there is space constraint. The gate pumps can be put inside the nullah and will not need additional space.” In this way, BMC aims to eliminate land acquisition and the need to cut mangroves for pumping stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/budget-mumbai-may-not-get-respite-from-flooding-at-97-spots-101612551331182.html
06-02-2021||Mumbai||Thane civic body budget ₹1.3K-cr less than last year||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) tabled a budget estimate of ₹2,755 for the year 2021-22, a whopping ₹1,313Cr less than the revised estimate of ₹4,068Cr for 2020-21.With the corporation elections slated next year, new projects were to be expected. However, the budget has no new project this year. The civic commissioner informed that the focus was merely on improving revenue and maintaining the assets already created in the city. The budget will be reviewed mid-year when, depending on the financial and Covid-19 situation, the budget will be allotted for new projects. The budget also has no new increase in taxes as the corporation had increased the water tax the previous year.Read more: Thane corporators demand status of earlier budget, create ruckusDr. Vipin Sharma, TMC chief, has termed it a realistic budget wherein the capital expenses are cut down by over 49 per cent.Sharma said, “The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the revenue this year. We will get a clear picture on Covid situation in the next few months. As of now, the budget is tabled on the present revenue situation. There are no new projects undertaken this year. We will only focus on maintaining the assets already created and allot budget for works that are important.”The budget has allocated ₹935.37Cr for capital expenditure and ₹1,819 for revenue expenditure. The corporation has also allotted funds of ₹122.50Cr for Thane Municipal Transport (TMT). The opening balance this year is merely ₹55Cr.Sharma added that the focus will be on generating revenue in these challenging times without increasing taxes. “We have not increased taxes. Our plan is to limit expenses, increase existing income sources and plug the gaps in revenue collection by improving tax collections.”The corporation had taken a loan of ₹500Cr last year, out of which the present liability is ₹164Cr. No new loan will be taken this year while Sharma informed that 75 per cent bills of the contractors too are cleared. The state, too, has not yet paid ₹214Cr of stamp duty since 2019.Budget to be revised mid-termFor the first time, the administration has come up with the concept of mid-term review of the budget for the fiscal year 2021-22. At present, the budget has no provision for developmental works.Sharma said, “Depending on the Covid situation in the next six months, we will review our expenses and revenue generation. Most shops, malls and multiplexes have reopened, so we expect better revenue generation in the coming months. Around August-September, we will revise the budget as per the situation. If the income is more, some part will be allocated for developmental projects.”Slack in real estate hits budgetThe slowdown in real estate has hit the budget as the corporation had to face losses of more than ₹800Cr, as the revenue of the town planning department plummeted in the year 2020-21. The previous year budget estimated a revenue of ₹984Cr for the town planning department, though the revenue earned till date is merely ₹164Cr. Similarly, the revenue of fire department, which also depends on allotting fire NOCs to the new construction, decreased to ₹48Cr from the estimated ₹100Cr.No decision on property tax waiver The ruling Shiv Sena, though, has assured to waive property tax on flats less than 500sqft area, there is still no implementation of the same in the city. With elections merely a year away, the announcement was expected in this budget. However, no decision has been taken yet. Sharma said, “When the focus is on increasing revenue, the decision on waiver might not be taken soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-budget-1-3k-cr-less-than-last-year-101612551271405.html

In the 2020-2021 Union Budget, ₹295.6 crore was allocated for passenger amenities.In the 2019-2020 Budget, ₹284 crore was allocated and in the Budget of 2018-2019, ₹204 crore was allocated.The escalators and lifts will be constructed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Dadar, Ghatkopar, Kurla, Sandhurst Road, Parel, Sion, Tilak Nagar, Chembur, Mankhurd, Panvel and Nerul railway stations. “Focus on passenger amenities throughout the year will be done. Escalators and lifts will be constructed on the suburban railway network,” said Sanjeev Mittal, general manager, CR.Further, CR has stated that local train services will resume in full capacity as the number of passengers increases.“We will be operating local train services in full strength as there is an increase in passenger count,” added Mittal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stations-on-mumbai-rail-network-to-get-80-escalators-50-lifts-15-fob-101612551210003.html

The members stood on the table, gave anti-administration slogans and refused to allow the budget to be presented.The entire budget was read in this chaos after the standing committee chairman, Sanjay Bhoir, asked the commissioner to proceed despite the protests. The presentation was completed within 10 minutes.Hanumant Jagdale, NCP corporator, said, “Every year, we merely attend the budget presentation and approve it. After that, we have no clue on its implementation. The situation has been the same since 2014, wherein mega projects which make good headlines are promised. However, no one knows their status after the budget is tabled. Moreover last year, there was budget allocation for corporator’s funds. However, none of it reached us.”He was seconded by Congress corporator Vikrant Chavan, who added, “The administration has tabled a list of ₹455Cr new civic works before the committee. However, none of the work orders of the projects in the previous budget have been approved yet. We are clueless as to from where these projects have come or who decided them. We do not want any big, false promises in the budget. The administration should give us the actual estimate of revenue loss last year and status of budget implementation.”TMC chief, Dr. Vipin Sharma, refused to comment on the incident. “The allegations are administrative matters and not a part of the budget. We have been implementing the same budget, which the standing committee had approved last year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-corporators-demand-status-of-earlier-budget-create-ruckus-101612551030351.html
06-02-2021||Mumbai||Three major roads around Panvel railway station concretised||Panvel residents can now heave a sigh of relief as the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has concretised three major roads around the Panvel railway station. The civic body allocated a budget of ₹19Cr for the project.So far, 90 per cent of the work has been completed and the remaining work will be completed by March, 31, a senior officer said.Sanjay Katekar, executive engineer of PCMC, said, “These three roads have been playing a crucial role in terms of transportation to and from Panvel railway station, which is the busiest station in Navi Mumbai. However, they were in bad shape for several years. Therefore, we started concretising them early last year and have finished around 90 per cent of the work.” Katekar added that the first road that has been concretised is around 400m long. It starts from the railway station and goes towards the Panvel town behind the ST bus depot. The second road, which is around 500m long, connects the railway station to the NH 4.“The length of the third road is 1.3km. It too starts from the railway station, runs parallel to the NH4 and finally merges with it. We completed the concretisation of the main roads a few weeks ago. We are now working on the drains and the pavements along them. We are confident of finishing all the work by next month,” he said.Apart from the trains of the harbour lines, nearly sixty long-distance trains going towards Pune, Goa and the southern states pass through Panvel railway station. According to the railway sources, the station sees around one lakh footfall every day.Vishal Mane, 49, a resident of Takka area in Panvel, said, “These roads were in pathetic condition and the commuters faced a lot of trouble, especially during monsoon. From now on, they will be able to reach the railway station from Panvel city without any trouble. There are, however, several other roads in Panvel that are not in good shape. I hope PCMC will take efforts to concretise them too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/three-major-roads-around-panvel-railway-station-concretised-101612550610416.html
06-02-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to start next fiscal with ₹670-cr budget deficit||The Chandigarh municipal corporation will start the coming fiscal with a deficit of ₹670 crore. The MC General House in a special meeting on Friday approved ₹1,641 crore budget for 2021-22, even as the civic body has only ₹971 crore in its kitty.The MC budget has pegged the grant-in-aid from the Chandigarh administration at ₹1,202 crore, despite only ₹502 crore allocated in the Union Budget recently. Meanwhile, ₹469 crore is estimated to be generated by the MC on its own through property tax, water tariff and other avenues. For the current financial year, too, the MC had prepared a deficit budget of ₹650 crore, and had to depend on the administration’s aid for even paying salaries to its employees after failing to achieve the revenue targets. Against a target of ₹402 crore for 2020-2021, it will be able to garner only ₹317 crore through its own receipts. Also, this fiscal, against a demand of ₹1,073 crore in grant-in-aid, it has so far got just ₹325 crore from the administration and anticipates another ₹275 crore by March end.At ₹1,197 crore, even the revenue expenditure (recurring expenses, such as salaries) for the coming fiscal is more than the total funds that the MC estimates to get. “Capital works like upgrade of sewerage system, stormwater drainage and roads are unlikely to be taken up unless the administration releases additional funds,” said a senior MC official, not wishing to be named.During the discussion on the budget, Congress councillors questioned as to how the MC planned to bridge the gap between the receipts and planned expenditure. “The MC must ensure that civic works do not suffer due to paucity of funds, as seen in previous years,” said councillor Gurbax Rawat. “This year, there has been a meagre increase even in the administration’s own allocation by the Centre. How will it be able to help the MC?”Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said no work will be stopped for lack of funds. “We already have ₹ 971 crore. Another ₹300 crore will be released by the administration from registration and licensing authority collections. We will push for additional aid from excise collections. We have also been assured that two additional petrol pump sites will be given to us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-to-start-next-fiscal-with-670-cr-budget-deficit-101612550250035.html

Also, they are from the lower economic strata and cannot afford to spend on menstrual hygiene.The three women, and friends, Urmila Late, 32, Suvarna Thakare, 34 and Yogita Shirke, 36, do not have any political or social connection but have been helping these tribal women since the lockdown by either educating them or providing basic facilities.Late, along with her husband, operates a family business of selling and servicing inverters. She informed that the three have distributed sanitary napkins to over 680 women from twenty tribal hamlets in Murbad.Late said, “We save at least 10 per cent of our family income every month to use it for these women who are deprived of basic hygiene and education. We had distributed sanitary napkins last year to all the migrant women who walked for miles to reach their home towns. We also provided clothes to the migrant women and those in the tribal hamlets.”Thakare added that they started distributing the sanitary napkins on January 26 and made sure that the women have stock lasting up to two months.“These hamlets are 15km-20km away from the city. Women use soiled clothes during menstruation, leading to infection. We have provided them napkins for two months and will visit two months later for the next lot. Last time, when we provided them in bulk, a few men sold these napkins to earn money. So, this time we did not provide them in bulk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-women-philanthropists-help-murbad-adivasis-with-sanitary-napkins-101612550130130.html

The number of arrests made by the agency in the case has now gone up to 33.NCB had earlier arrested Sejnani and Furniturewala on January 9 in a separate case after the agency raided their residences in Khar and Bandra, respectively, and seized around 200kg of imported strains of marijuana.NCB claimed that Furniturewala was in touch with alleged drug supplier Anuj Keshwani, who was arrested in the Rajput case on September 6 last year. The agency had raided Keshwani’s house in Khar and had seized 590gm of hashish, 0.64gm of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) sheets, 304gm marijuana, ₹1.85 lakh and some foreign currency.Sejnani allegedly supplying imported strains of marijuana to Furniturewala and Keshwani, said NCB officers. He was arrested following a specific input, after NCB officers seized around 340gm of marijuana from three parcels during raids at the office of a courier company in Bandra. After arresting Sejnani, the agency also raided Furniturewala’s home and seized 5kg of marijuana. During the interrogation of Sejnani, the agency found the link to Sameer Khan, son-in-law of Maharashtra cabinet minister Nawab Malik, in connection with a drug case, and he also was arrested. NCB allegedly found Khan’s bank account transactions, in which ₹20,000 was sent to Sejnani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-drug-case-ncb-arrests-two-more-101612550009834.html

Whoever thinks it is only in Russia’s interest is wrong.”Nord Stream 2 is a gas pipeline being built under the Baltic Sea from Russia to the German coast. Led by Russia’s Gazprom PJSC, the project has been sanctioned by the U.S. and it’s sparked concerns that the direct link poses geopolitical risks by increasing German dependence on Russian energy. There’s concern in the U.S. and other countries that the link could give the Kremlin new leverage over Germany and other NATO allies.This week, Russia imprisoned opposition leader Navalny for two years and eight months, drawing condemnation from Western leaders. Kurz told Welt am Sonntag that Russia should free Navalny, calling the jail sentence he received “unacceptable.”Germany, Austria and other European countries will benefit from completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Kurz said, describing it as a “very positive project.” The EU would be in danger of weakening itself if it were to oppose the link now, Kurz was cited as saying. Still, the bloc must also protect the interests of Ukraine, which sees itself as loosing out from fewer gas flows, he said.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and France’s President Emmanuel Macron on Friday vowed to put aside differences over the pipeline ahead of talks with U.S. President Joe Biden, saying they will work together on a more unified European energy strategy and will speak with one voice on Nord Stream 2.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-shouldn-t-jeopardize-gas-pipeline-over-navalny-austrian-chancellor-says-101612630992407.html
06-02-2021||World||Key players rally behind Mario Draghi in Italy government talks||Former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Saturday wrapped up a first round of talks aimed at forming a new Italian government, hoping to drag the country out of its economic and Covid-19 crises.Summoned by President Sergio Mattarella this week after prime minister Giuseppe Conte's coalition collapsed, Draghi -- dubbed "Super Mario" for extricating the eurozone from its debt crisis early last decade -- has already rallied some political players behind him.The centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and the small Italia Viva outfit of centrist former premier Matteo Renzi -- the man behind the collapse of the last government -- had promised support, as well as Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right Forza Italia (FI).On Saturday, the far-right League led by Matteo Salvini -- one of two heavyweight anti-establishment parties alongside the Five Star Movement (M5S) -- signalled its readiness for the economist to form Italy's 67th government since World War II."We stand ready. We are the biggest political force in the country, we are a force that should be in government... unlike some, we don't think we can get ahead by always saying no," Salvini said after meeting Draghi."I prefer to be on the inside and in control," he said.While he did not reveal any conditions for joining a government, the former interior minister said his final decision would come after a second round of talks next week.'Confidence of Europe'Time is ticking as Italy must present plans for how it will spend around 200 billion euros ($241 billion) from the EU's pandemic recovery fund -- the largest share for any single country -- by the end of April.Draghi "already has the confidence of Europe and the markets. Soon he will receive parliament's confidence," daily Il Corriere della Sera predicted.Wolfango Piccoli of consulting firm Teneo agreed."The question has somewhat shifted from 'if' Draghi could form a government to 'how' this government will be constituted, meaning which parties will be part of the coalition."Draghi's final weekend meeting was with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), which had backed Conte to the hilt with its roughly one-third of MPs and senators.But saying he had always worked "for the good of the country," Conte on Thursday promised not to be an "obstacle" to Draghi and wished him "good luck!"The League will have to overcome its reluctance to work with the PD and possible reservations about Draghi personally.The former central banker personifies a European elite that the nationalist, anti-immigration party and its counterparts across the bloc love to hate.Pandemic havocAfter finishing his first round of talks with politicians Saturday, Draghi will meet civil society groups like unions on Monday before tackling the political parties again later next week.While the wrangling goes on, the European Union's third-largest economy is ailing from the effects of coronavirus after shrinking 8.9 percent last year -- one of the sharpest drops in the eurozone single-currency area.A harsh lockdown in March and April brought activity to a near-standstill after Italy became the first European nation to suffer a coronavirus wave.So far Italy has recorded more than 90,000 Covid-19 deaths -- the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain -- and 2.6 million cases.The more contagious British coronavirus variant has also been detected in some people testing positive.If Draghi fails to secure a parliamentary majority or loses MPs' backing after taking office, Italy could hold early elections, probably in June.But Mattarella, who would make such a call, said Tuesday that he wanted to avoid going to the polls while the country suffers through its health and economic shocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-players-rally-behind-mario-draghi-in-italy-government-talks-101612630177185.html
06-02-2021||World||Biden's dilemma in virus aid fight: Go big or go bipartisan||President Joe Biden's push for a USD 1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill is forcing an internal reckoning that pits his instincts to work toward a bipartisan deal against the demands of an urgent crisis and his desire to deliver for those who helped elect him.His bipartisan bona fides have been a defining feature of his political career, first as a Senate deal-maker, later as he led legislative negotiations for the Obama administration when vice president and finally during his successful 2020 campaign.But the scope of the multiple crises confronting the nation now, along with the lessons Democrats learned from four years of Republican obstructionism during Barack Obama presidency, seem to be pushing Biden toward quick action on the coronavirus aid bill, even if Republicans get left behind.“I have told both Republicans and Democrats that's my preference: to work together. But if I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly and getting bogged down in a lengthy negotiation or compromising on a bill that's up to the crisis, that's an easy choice,” Biden said Friday. “I'm going to help the American people who are hurting now.”So far, the administration has proceeded on two parallel tracks.One featured a public show of trying to reach across the political aisle, with bipartisan rhetoric and a White House invitation for Republican senators. Their housewarming gift was a proposal more than $1 trillion short of what Biden wanted.At the same time, Biden has insisted on the need for a sizable package to address the deadly pandemic. The administration has encouraged Democratic senators to be prepared to go it alone, to ready a plan that combines money to address the virus and vaccines with money to fulfill a progressive agenda that includes a higher federal minimum wage.Not out of the realm of possibility is a third option — having even one or two Republicans sign on to the bigger bill, giving it a veneer of bipartisanship. But it's more likely that the White House will need to choose between the two extremes.That could send a clear signal about Biden's governing priorities and potentially set a template for how he will navigate a deeply polarized Washington going forward.“President Biden's got some pretty big tests in front of him when it comes to domestic policy. He is someone who prides himself on his deal-making skills and yet he may have to take a page out of the LBJ-style playbook and jam some things through both the House and the Senate to get anything done,” said Jim Manley, a longtime aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.For Biden, working with Republicans is as much a point of personal pride as it is good politics.He is known for his love of schmoozing and personal outreach to lawmakers after 36 years in the Senate and eight more working with Capitol Hill as vice president. He frequently spoke about bipartisanship during the campaign, and that political brand helped him win 62% of moderates and 8% of Republican voters in November, according to data from AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide.If Biden loses that moderate profile — and the goodwill from Republicans who've known him in the past as an honest deal-maker — there's a risk, Manley said, that “it's going to poison the well for the future.”GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, one of the lawmakers invited to meet with Biden at the White House, warned as much during a floor speech this past week.“If we can't come together as Republicans and Democrats, as we have proven we can, time and time again over the last year, what can we come together on?” Portman asked. "Wouldn't it make it harder for us then to find that common ground on things like infrastructure investments, on things like retirement security?”But Democrats say they have learned some key lessons from Obama's first term about bipartisanship in the face of crisis.Biden was tasked with steering the White House's overtures to Congress in dealing with the financial meltdown. For months, Biden focused his efforts on his former GOP colleagues, in the end to get the backing of just three Republicans.The process of securing the $787 billion package — aid broadly credited for helping boost an economy in free fall — left a bad taste for the Obama-Biden White House. The package drew withering criticism from most on the right for being too big. Many in the Democratic Party have come to believe it was too small, a missed opportunity to not just help the economy but reinvent it.“The lesson from the Great Recession is that without sustained economic relief, the recovery will take longer, unemployed workers will experience more pain, and already historic levels of inequality will worsen,” said Chris Lu, a deputy labor secretary under Obama.Democrats also say they will not be burned again by expectations for bipartisanship that proved to be naive during the Obama years.Austan Goolsbee, a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, said one of the other lessons of those negotiations was that “Republicans are going to argue against Joe Biden if he does anything at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-dilemma-in-virus-aid-fight-go-big-or-go-bipartisan-101612628635358.html
06-02-2021||World||Unwilling to wait, poorer countries seek their own coronavirus vaccines||With coronavirus cases still climbing, Honduras got tired of waiting to get vaccines through a United Nations program, so the small Central American country struck out on its own, securing the shots through a private deal.Honduras “cannot wait on bureaucratic processes or misguided decisions" to give citizens “the peace of mind” offered by the COVID-19 vaccine, said Juan Carlos Sikaffy, president of the Honduran Private Business Council, which helped complete the purchase by providing a bank guarantee.Other nations are getting impatient too. Unlike past disease outbreaks, where less wealthy countries have generally waited for vaccines to be delivered by the U.N. and other organizations, many are now taking matters into their own hands. Experts are increasingly concerned that these go-it-alone efforts could undermine a U.N.-backed program to get COVID-19 shots to the neediest people worldwide.Countries including Serbia, Bangladesh and Mexico recently began vaccinating citizens through donations or commercial deals — an approach that could leave even fewer vaccines for the program known as COVAX, since rich countries have already snapped up the majority of this year's supply.Led by the World Health Organization, a coalition for epidemic preparedness known as CEPI and a vaccine alliance called GAVI, COVAX was created to distribute COVID-19 vaccines fairly. Countries can join either to buy vaccines or to get donated shots.Mustaqeem De Gama, a diplomat at the South African mission in Geneva, cited “a level of desperation” fueled by spreading virus variants and “the uncertainty of when any COVAX vaccines might arrive.” He doubted that countries that signed up for COVAX ”will even get 10% of what they require.”Even if the effort succeeds, COVAX’s stated goal is to vaccinate less than 30% of people in poor countries, meaning that governments must seek other sources to obtain enough shots to achieve herd immunity.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said his country was forced to cut its own deals after watching rich countries scramble for the scarce shots. He criticized nations that, he said, bought more doses than they needed.“It’s as if they intend to vaccinate all their cats and dogs,” he said.Although Serbia paid 4 million euros to COVAX last year, it has not yet received any shots and last month began its immunization campaign with vaccines from Pfizer, China's Sinopharm and Russia.Recent manufacturing delays in Europe raise concerns about whether drugmakers will be able to fulfill the multiplying orders.“There are so many deals being signed that I think it’s hard to see how the numbers could possibly add up for all the doses ordered to actually be produced in the foreseeable future,” said Amanda Glassman, a public health expert and executive vice-president of the Center for Global Development.Last week, the African Union completed a deal for 400 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, to be produced by the Serum Institute of India. That’s on top of a previously negotiated African Union deal for 270 million doses from several pharmaceutical companies and in addition to the 600 million doses Africa expects to receive from COVAX.Some experts warn that these new deals could move COVAX further to the back of the line, especially if some countries are willing to pay a premium for speed.To ensure South Africans got doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine quickly, government officials reluctantly agreed to pay a higher price per shot than Europe or North America. The first shipments arrived this week.COVAX hopes to start sending its first vaccine batches to Africa later this month, but those plans are subject to change depending on manufacturers' production capacities and countries' immunization plans.Mexico began vaccinating health workers in December because of a direct purchase agreement with Pfizer, but progress has been slow. In recent weeks, the country gave emergency approval to Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine but said the first batches weren't due until sometime later this month.Kate Elder, senior vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders, said developing countries should not be criticized for securing private vaccine deals since that is precisely what rich countries did last year.“Every country is just doing what it feels it needs to do to protect their people,” she said, but the ability of poor countries and regions to get vaccine faster than COVAX could hurt future U.N. efforts.“If countries are getting vaccines on their own, then how are WHO and GAVI delivering for them?” she asked.Although India is contracted to provide COVAX with several hundred million doses of vaccine, the shots have not yet been authorized by the WHO, meaning India cannot release them for the U.N. program. In the meantime, India has already gifted neighbors, including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, with more than 5 million doses.Dr. Haritha Aluthge of Sri Lanka’s Government Medical Officers’ Association, called for the WHO to intervene amid the intense competition for vaccines and the failure of COVAX to deliver.“Not a single dose (from COVAX) has been received,” Aluthge said.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned recently that the world is on the brink of a “catastrophic moral failure” if COVID-19 vaccines are not distributed fairly, but the agency has no authority to force rich countries to share.Its entreaties for countries to act in solidarity have mostly been ignored.Norway is the only country that said it would send vaccines to developing countries as its own citizens are immunized, but it has not specified how many would be donated. Britain said it would not divert any vaccines until it finishes its own immunization program. Australia, which has mostly stamped out COVID-19, has no timeline for when it might share vaccines with its poorer neighbors in southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.The unrelenting pressure on the world’s vaccine supplies might only lift when more shots prove successful, said Krishna Udayakumar, director of the Duke Global Health Institute.“COVAX is the only global, multilateral platform to enable something close to global access and equity, and yet, it has access to a relatively small amount of vaccines,” he said. “The only way out is to have more vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unwilling-to-wait-poorer-countries-seek-their-own-coronavirus-vaccines-101612628149627.html

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.During the registration period, prospective petitioners and representatives will be able to fill out petitioner and beneficiary information and submit their registrations, the USCS said.The agency said if it receives enough registrations by March 25, it will randomly select registrations and send selection notifications by March 31.The successful applicants would be able to join their new jobs in the US on October 1, when the American fiscal year starts.As mandated by the Congress, USCIS can issue a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas in a year. It can also issue another 20,000 H-1B visas to foreign students who have completed higher studies from a US university in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects.The quick announcement by USCIS on the next year’s H-1B registration process comes a day after it said that it is delaying the implementation of the Trump administration policy of allocation of H-1B through a wage and skilled based process.The Trump era rule was scheduled to go into effect on March 9.On January 7, the USCIS announced to do away with the traditional lottery system in deciding the successful applicants for the H-1B visas.The USCIS had said it would prioritise wages to protect the economic interests of American workers, and better ensure that the most highly skilled foreign workers benefit from the temporary employment programme.In a statement on Thursday, the USCIS, however, said that it is delaying the rule’s effective date until December 31, 2021.The USCIS can issue a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas in a year. It can also issue another 20,000 H-1B visas to foreign students who have completed higher studies from a US university in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h1b-visa-registration-for-2022-to-begin-on-march-9-lottery-results-on-march-31-101612627302661.html
06-02-2021||World||Calls grow for United States to rely on rapid tests to fight Covid-19 pandemic||When a Halloween party sparked a COVID-19 outbreak at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, school officials conducted rapid screening on more than 1,000 students in a week, including many who didn’t have symptoms.Although such asymptomatic screening isn’t approved by regulators and the 15-minute tests aren’t as sensitive as the genetic one that can take days to yield results, the testing director at the historically Black college credits the approach with quickly containing the infections and allowing the campus to remain open.“Within the span of a week, we had crushed the spread. If we had had to stick with the PCR test, we would have been dead in the water,” said Dr. Robert Doolittle, referring to the polymerase chain reaction test that is considered the gold standard by many doctors and Food and Drug Administration regulators.With President Joe Biden vowing to get elementary and middle school students back to the classroom by spring and the country’s testing system still unable to keep pace with the spread of COVID-19, some experts see an opportunity to refocus U.S. testing less on medical precision than on mass screening that they believe could save hundreds of thousands of lives. As vaccines slowly roll out, they say the nation could suppress the outbreak and reopen much of the economy by easing regulatory hurdles to allow millions more rapid tests that, while technically less accurate, may actually be better at identifying sick people when they are most contagious.“Our whole testing approach, which has failed, has tried to tackle this pandemic as though it’s a bunch of little medical problems,” said Dr. Michael Mina, a Harvard University testing specialist. “Instead, we need to take a big step back and say, ‘Wait, this isn’t a lot of medical problems, it’s an epidemic. And if we resolve the epidemic, we resolve the medical problems.’”The U.S. reports about 2 million tests per day, the vast majority of which are the slower, PCR variety. The initial tests developed to detect COVID-19 all used the cutting-edge technique, which quickly became the standard at U.S. hospitals and labs. It also became the benchmark for accuracy at the FDA, which has greenlighted more than 230 PCR tests but only about a dozen rapid tests. Priced as low as $5, the quick tests look for viral proteins, which are generally considered a less rigorous measure of infection.The FDA said in a statement it supports “innovation in testing” and “has not hesitated” to make rapid tests available.But most experts agree that the current U.S. system, which relies heavily on lab testing, is still incapable of containing the virus that is killing more than 3,000 Americans per day and has pushed the country’s death toll to nearly 460,000.Compounding the problem is that an estimated 40% of people infected don’t develop symptoms. It’s among these silent spreaders that Mina says rapid tests have the clear advantage over lab tests. With its medical precision, he argues that the PCR test continues to detect COVID-19 in many people who have already fought off the virus and are no longer contagious. The rapid test, while less sensitive, is better at quickly catching the virus during the critical early days of infection when it can spread explosively through communities.“This isn’t a clinical test — it’s a public health screening test,” Mina said.The case for widescale rapid testing is getting a boost from universities and school systems that have used the approach to stay open through the latest waves of the pandemic. And proponents point to apparent success stories like the small European nation of Slovakia, which saw infections drop after screening two-thirds of its roughly 5 million people with the tests.But many lab specialists worry about vastly expanding the use of rapid tests, which are more prone to false results, and have never been used at the massive scale being proposed.“There’s a lot of people trying to portray things as black and white, and there’s a lot of gray here, unfortunately,” says Susan Butler-Wu, of the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine.She points out that testing campaigns in Slovakia, the U.K. and elsewhere have been paired with strict lockdown orders. Without such measures in the U.S., critics say there is no way to predict whether people who test positive will self-isolate.That’s a particular worry with proposals from Mina and others to blanket the U.S. in millions of rapid, home tests that would allow people to regularly screen themselves without medical supervision.“I want to believe in people making good decisions when left to their own devices,” said Butler-Wu. “But the fact that we are where we are right now really shows you people don’t make good decisions when left to their own devices.”One area where consensus may be emerging is in public schools, where many parents and districts are eager for a return to in-person instruction. Biden has proposed spending $50 billion to vastly expand rapid testing as part of his push to return most K-8 students to classes within his first 100 days.One of his first executive orders called for using the Defense Production Act to scale up supplies needed for rapid tests. And key members of his administration, including the new surgeon general and head of the Centers for Diseases and Control and Prevention, vigorously support a revamped testing strategy focused on such screening. This week, the White House said it enlisted six manufacturers to mass produce the tests, with the goal of providing 60 million by the end of the summer.Biden’s team has been in discussions with the nonprofit Rockefeller Foundation, which has outlined a plan to use 300 million tests per month to return most U.S. students to the classroom beginning in March.The initial results from a new pilot study in six city school systems give an early glimpse of the potential opportunity and pitfalls.Weekly screening of teachers, students and staff appeared to reduce infections by 50%, according to the study commissioned by the foundation, which is coordinating the effort. That's a bigger impact than requiring students and teachers to wear masks when not eating but less effective than enforcing social distancing, the study found.It also flagged major logistical challenges, including schools that faced difficulty providing the staff, technical expertise and community outreach needed to roll out their testing programs.“People are doing it and it’s possible, but it’s not easy,” said Andrew Sweet, a managing director with the foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/calls-grow-for-united-to-rely-on-rapid-tests-to-fight-covid-19-pandemic-101612627854879.html

President Joe Biden has called China the “most serious competitor” and said in a speech earlier this week, “We’ll confront China’s economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China’s attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance.”Blinken’s conversation with Yang was the first contact between the new US administration with Chinese officials at the top level. President Biden and President Xi Jinping have not spoken yet. Xi did call to leave a congratulatory message for Biden on his election win.Blinken told Yang “the United States will continue to stand up for human rights and democratic values, including in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, and pressed China to join the international community in condemning the military coup in Burma (Myanmar)”, said the US state department.Blinken went on to reaffirm the US will “work together with its allies and partners in defence of our shared values and interests to hold the PRC (People’s Republic of China) accountable for its efforts to threaten stability in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait, and its undermining of the rules-based international system”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-raises-xinjiang-tibet-hong-kong-in-his-first-call-with-china-s-yang-jiechi-101612627478535.html
06-02-2021||World||No need for Donald Trump to get intelligence briefings, says Joe Biden||US President Joe Biden has said there was “no need” for his predecessor Donald Trump to receive intelligence briefings - which are traditionally given to former presidents - because of his “erratic behaviour”.It wasn’t immediately clear if Trump wanted the briefings at all.“I think not,” Biden said in an interview to CBS on Friday when asked if Trump should receive intelligence briefings as a former president. The full interview airs on Sunday.“Because of his erratic behaviour unrelated to the insurrection,” Biden said when asked why not. He was referring to the January 6 storming of the US Capitol that Trump had incited, for which he was impeached and is facing a Senate trial.“I’d rather not speculate out loud,” Biden said when the interviewer pressed him further. “I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings. What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?”Former presidents are given intelligence briefings partly as a courtesy and partly to keep them updated should the sitting president reach out to them for advice, The New York Times reported. Former US presidents Jimmy Carter, George W Bush and Barack Obama continue to receive regular briefings.But concerns about Trump’s past handling of classified information was a cause for early concern for the White House, Democrats and the intelligence community. Early in his presidency, Trump had reportedly shared with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and then ambassador Sergey Kislyak classified information on the Islamic State that the Americans had received from Israel. It had happened during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.Susan Gordon, a former principal deputy director of national intelligence, had argued against giving Trump intelligence briefings after he left office in an opinion piece in The Washington Post on January 15, saying, “These briefings have been a matter of respectful convention and were granted by the new president to the old. But convention left the premises a long time ago with President Trump.”She had raised concerns citing Trump’s plans to continue to be an active player in politics, unlike his predecessors, who “embraced the muted responsibilities of being a former”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-need-for-donald-trump-to-get-intelligence-briefings-says-joe-biden-101612626458868.html
06-02-2021||World||German finance minister angry at Covid vaccine rollout, which EU chief defends||German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Saturday he was angry that more COVID-19 vaccines were not ordered last year as EU chief executive Ursula von der Leyen renewed her defence of the European Commission's record on rolling them out.EU countries have so far given first doses to just under 4% of their populations, compared with 11% for the United States and almost 17% for Britain, according to Our World in Data. Von der Leyen has been under fire for the EU's slow rollout."I'm angry about some of the decisions that were taken last year," Scholz told BBC radio's Today programme. "I think there had been the opportunity to order more of the vaccines."Asked about von der Leyen's responsibility for the slow rollout, Scholz, speaking in English, replied: "I think it is necessary that anyone learns the lesson, and this is also (true) for Europe. I think the European Union is strong."Scholz, a Social Democrat, and von der Leyen, a Christian Democrat, served together in Germany's ruling coalition until 2019, when she quit to take over as European Commission president.In an opinion piece to run in Sunday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, von der Leyen said it was misleading to say that sealing vaccine contracts earlier would have speeded up their delivery."The bottleneck lies elsewhere. Producing a new vaccine is an incredibly complex business," she wrote, adding that "among the hundreds of components needed, important ingredients are in short supply worldwide".Describing the fight against the virus as "not a sprint, it is a marathon", von der Leyen added that "mutations worry us"."We need to prepare today for a scenario in which the virus can no longer be sufficiently suppressed with current vaccines," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-finance-minister-angry-at-covid-vaccine-rollout-which-eu-chief-defends-101612621678639.html
06-02-2021||World||How Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will work||Former President Donald Trump's historic second impeachment trial begins Tuesday, forcing the Senate to decide whether to convict him of incitement of insurrection after a violent mob of his supporters laid siege to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.While Trump’s acquittal is expected, all 100 senators will first have to sit at their desks and listen to hours of graphic testimony from House Democrats about the riots, which left five people dead. The House impeached Trump on Jan. 13, one week after the violence.A look at the basics of the upcoming impeachment trial:HOW DOES THE TRIAL WORK?The Constitution says the House has the sole power of impeachment while the Senate has the sole power to try the individual on the charges. The person being impeached — who can be the president, the vice president or any civil officer of the United States — can be convicted by two-thirds of the senators present.The House appoints managers as prosecutors who set up on the Senate floor, along with the defendant’s lawyers, to present their case. The prosecutors and Trump's defense team will have a set amount of time to make arguments, and then senators can ask questions in writing before a final vote.The chief justice of the United States normally presides over the trial of a president, but because Trump has left office, the presiding officer will be Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who is the ceremonial head of the Senate as the longest-serving member of the majority party.Once the senators reach a final vote on the impeachment charge — this time there is just one, incitement of insurrection — each lawmaker will stand up and cast their vote: guilty or not guilty.HOW LONG WILL THE TRIAL LAST?Unclear. The Senate has to agree to the rules of the trial, and party leaders are still working out the details.Trump's first impeachment trial, in which he was acquitted on charges that he abused power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate now-President Joe Biden, lasted almost three weeks. But this one is expected to be shorter, as the case is less complicated and the senators know many of the details already, having been in the Capitol during the insurrection.And while the Democrats want to ensure they have enough time to make their case, they do not want to tie up the Senate for long. The Senate cannot confirm Biden's Cabinet nominees and move forward with their legislative priorities, such as COVID-19 relief, until the trial is complete.WHY TRY TRUMP WHEN HE IS OUT OF OFFICE?Republicans and Trump’s lawyers argue that the trial is unnecessary, and even unconstitutional, because Trump is no longer president and cannot be removed from office. Democrats disagree, pointing to opinions of many legal scholars and the impeachment of a former secretary of war, William Belknap, who resigned in 1876 just hours before he was impeached over a kickback scheme.While Belknap was eventually acquitted, the Senate held a full trial. And this time, the House impeached Trump while he was still president, seven days before Biden’s inauguration.If Trump were convicted, the Senate could take a second vote to bar him from holding office again. Democrats feel that would be an appropriate punishment after he told the angry mob of his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat.Democrats also argue that there should not be a “January exception” for presidents who commit impeachable offenses just before they leave office. They say the trial is necessary not only to hold Trump properly accountable but also so they can deal with what happened and move forward.“You cannot go forward until you have justice,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week. “If we were not to follow up with this, we might as well remove any penalty from the Constitution of impeachment.”HOW IS THIS TRIAL DIFFERENT FROM TRUMP’S FIRST TRIAL?Trump’s first trial was based on evidence uncovered over several months by the House about a private phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, as well as closed-door meetings that happened before and afterward. Democrats held a lengthy investigation and then compiled a report of their findings.In contrast, the second trial will be based almost entirely on the visceral experience of a riot that targeted the senators themselves, in the Capitol building. The insurrectionists even breached the Senate chamber, where the trial will be held.The fresh memories of Jan. 6 could make it easier for the House impeachment managers to make their case, but it doesn't mean the outcome will be any different. Trump was acquitted in his first trial a year ago Friday with only one Republican, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, voting to convict, and there may not be many more guilty votes this time around.In a test vote Jan. 26, only five Senate Republicans voted against an effort to dismiss the trial — an early indication that Trump is likely to be acquitted again.WHAT WILL TRUMP'S LAWYERS ARGUE?Beyond the constitutionality of the trial, Trump’s lawyers say that he did not incite his supporters to violence and that he did nothing wrong. “It is denied that President Trump ever endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,” they wrote in a brief for the trial. “It is denied he threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch Government.”Trump's lawyers also say he was protected by the First Amendment to “express his belief that the election results were suspect.”There was no widespread fraud in the election, as Trump claimed falsely over several months and again to his supporters just before the insurrection. Election officials across the country, and even former Attorney General William Barr, contradicted his claims, and dozens of legal challenges to the election put forth by Trump and his allies were dismissed.WHAT WOULD ACQUITTAL MEAN FOR TRUMP?A second impeachment acquittal by the Senate would be a victory for Trump — and would prove he retains considerable sway over his party, despite his efforts to subvert democracy and widespread condemnation from his GOP colleagues after Jan. 6.Still, acquittal may not be the end of attempts to hold him accountable. Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, floated a censure resolution after last month’s vote made clear that Trump was unlikely to be convicted.While they haven’t said yet if they will push for a censure vote after the impeachment trial, Kaine said this week that “the idea is out there on the table and it may become a useful idea down the road."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-donald-trump-s-second-impeachment-trial-will-work-101612619505684.html
06-02-2021||World||Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu vows to fight 'anti-Semitic' ICC ruling||Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday angrily rejected an International Criminal Court's ruling that paves the way for a war crimes probe into the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, condemning it as "pure anti-Semitism"."As prime minister of Israel, I can assure you this: we will fight this perversion of justice with all our might," Netanyahu said in a statement."This is pure anti-Semitism."On Friday, the ICC ruled that it has jurisdiction over the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, paving the way for the tribunal to open a war crimes investigation.ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda had asked the court for its legal opinion on whether its reach extended to areas occupied by Israel, after announcing in December 2019 that she wanted to start a full probe.The ICC said its judges had "decided, by majority, that the Court's territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine... extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem".Palestine is a state party to the court, having joined in 2015, but Israel is not a member.Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War of 1967, and later annexed mostly Arab east Jerusalem.Today they are home to at least five million Palestinians defined by the United Nations as living under Israeli occupation. The Gaza Strip is blockade by Israel and ruled by the Islamist Hamas group.Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Shtayyeh praised the ICC ruling as "a victory for justice and humanity, for the values of truth, fairness and freedom, and for the blood of the victims and their families".The Islamist movement Hamas, which rules Gaza and has fought three wars against Israel, said "the most important step... is to bring the Zionist criminals of war before international courts and hold them responsible".But Netanyahu cried foul against any bid by the ICC to investigate "fake war crimes"."The court, established to prevent atrocities like the Nazi Holocaust against the Jewish people, is now targeting the one state of the Jewish people," he said."First, it outrageously claims that when Jews live in our homeland, this is a war crime."Second, it claims that when democratic Israel defends itself against terrorists who murder our children and rocket our cities, we are committing another war crime," he added.He said the ICC should be investigating "brutal dictatorships like Iran and Syria who commit horrific atrocities almost daily".The US State Department said it has "serious concerns" about the ICC ruling, adding that Israel should not be bound by the court as it was not a member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-vows-to-fight-anti-semitic-icc-ruling-101612620604076.html

06-02-2021||World||China flags Taiwan as core issue, asks US to rectify 'mistakes' of Donald Trump administration's aggressive policies||In its first contact with the Biden administration, China on Saturday asked the US to rectify the "mistakes" of former President Donald Trump’s aggressive policies towards Beijing and flagged Taiwan as the most important and sensitive core issue for it.China resents US support for Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rebel province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force.During his tenure, Trump pushed aggressively on all aspects of US-China ties, including with his relentless trade war, challenging China's military hold on the disputed South China Sea, its constant threats to Taiwan, the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, branding coronavirus as "China virus" after it emerged from Wuhan in December 2019 as well as Xinjiang and Tibet issues.Newly-appointed US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi on Saturday held what observers here say as blunt and outspoken conversation over the phone during which both sides sought to highlight the issues of concerns that will shape the ties between the top two economies of the world in the next four years.Yang, a member of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party of China and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC, is Beijing’s point man for Washington.While Blinken told Yang that the Biden administration will hold China accountable for its abuses of the international system and raised with him the issue of human rights violations in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong and Myanmar, the Chinese diplomat said both sides should respect each other's core interests and choices of political system.Yang said the US "should rectify its mistakes made over a period of time," in an apparent reference to hardline policies pursued by the Trump administration towards China, pushing the ties between the two countries to a new low.He said the US should work with China to uphold the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.The Taiwan question, the most important and sensitive core issue in China-US relations, bears on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Yang as telling Blinken.China considers Taiwan as part of its mainland and apprehends that the US is stepping its engagement with Taipei with military and political assistance.The US should strictly abide by the one-China principle, Yang said, adding that Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet-related affairs are all China's internal affairs and allow no interference by any external forces.Any attempt to slander and smear China will not succeed, and China will continue to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, Yang said.He urged the US to play a constructive role in promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region involving the disputed South China Sea, where America looks to step up its engagement with allies to contain Beijing.China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square-mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.On the Myanmar coup, Blinken and Yang presented different views.While Blinken condemned the military coup in Myanmar and threatened sanctions against the military government, Yang stressed that the international community should create an enabling external environment for the proper settlement of the Myanmar issue.Yang pointed out that all countries in the world should safeguard the international system with the United Nations at its core and not pursue a rules-based international order championed by a few countries.On Thursday, Biden in his first foreign policy speech flagged a twin policy approach of confrontation with Beijing on challenges it posed and cooperation to further American interests.Biden described China as the “most serious competitor” to the US and vowed to confront Beijing on various fronts, including human rights, intellectual property and economic policy."But we are ready to work with Beijing when it is in America's interest to do so,” he said.Commenting on Biden’s speech, a report in the state-run Global Times said, “Chinese scholars found the speech a little bland with no new eye-catching expressions.”“Biden conveyed a clearer perspective on certain issues other than on China issues, proving that the new administration is still unready to make a clear China policy,” it said.Biden mentioned China or Beijing six times in his speech but only one sentence about cooperation, with the rest all about competition and threat, the report said.From the speech we can understand the “most serious competitor” is a basic and common consensus regarding China among US decision-makers, and US concerns over China are much greater and clearer than intentions to cooperate, the report quoted Diao Daming, an expert on US studies at the Renmin University of China, as saying.

However, the military and some political parties disputed the results, alleging that the polls were marred by irregularities.Days after the coup by Myanmar military, the police on Wednesday charged San Suu Kyi for "illegally" importing at least 10 walkie-talkies.The New York Times reported an official from the NLD party as confirming that the leader has been charged with an obscure infraction: having illegally imported at least 10 walkie-talkies.According to media reports, the detentions started in the early hours of Monday (local time), with political leaders held in Yangon and other cities across Myanmar, and soldiers said to be out on the streets and at prominent landmarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/around-300-myanmar-lawmakers-sign-declaration-rejecting-junta-rule-101612618989464.html

A white paper will be published this month, outlining potential reforms through April 2022.The move would reverse changes initiated by former health minister Andrew Lansley in 2012, which saw much day-to-day control of the service handed to bosses at NHS England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-ministers-seek-more-control-over-national-health-service-101612614057177.html
06-02-2021||World||Myanmar military detains Australian in first known foreigner arrest since coup||Sean Turnell, an Australian economic adviser to Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, said in a message to Reuters on Saturday he was being detained, the first known arrest of a foreign national since the Feb. 1 military coup that overthrew the government."I guess you will soon hear of it, but I am being detained," Turnell said. "Being charged with something, but not sure what. I am fine and strong, and not guilty of anything," he said, with a smile emoji.It was not subsequently possible to contact him.Myanmar army generals, who seized power alleging fraud in a Nov. 8 election that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide, shut down the internet on Saturday as thousands took to the streets of Yangon to denounce this week's coup.Australia's foreign ministry said in a statement late on Saturday that it was "deeply concerned about reports of Australian and other foreign nationals being detained arbitrarily in Myanmar."The ministry did not name Turnell or provide further details on other foreign nationals being detained. It said it had particular concerns about an Australian who was detained at a police station."The Australian Embassy in Yangon continues to contact Australians in Myanmar to ascertain their safety, to the extent that communications allow," the ministry said.Turnell is a professor of economics at Macquarie University in Sydney and has been advising Suu Kyi on economic policy for several years.On Saturday, several thousand protesters gathered in Australia's second-largest city of Melbourne denouncing the coup and demanding the release of Suu Kyi.Television and social media footage showed people wearing the red colour of the NLD, carrying portraits of Suu Kyi and singing "We Won't Be Satisfied Until The End Of The World", the Burmese language anthem from the country’s 1988 pro-democracy uprising, brutally put down by the military government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-military-detains-australian-in-first-known-foreigner-arrest-since-coup-101612609069360.html
06-02-2021||World||Japan conveys 'strong concerns' to China over new coast guard law||Japan conveyed its 'strong concerns' to China over Beijing's new law that allows its coast guard to use military force in waters the country claims, during a video meeting on maritime issues on Wednesday, reported the Japan Times.China must not use the legislation, which went into force Monday, in a way that goes against international law, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference.In the high-level consultation on maritime affairs involving senior bureaucrats from the two countries, Japan "firmly urged" China to exercise restraint in its actions, said Kato, the government's top spokesman.The new controversial law permits the China Coast Guard to use weapons when foreign ships involved in illegal activities in waters claimed by the country fail to obey orders. The new legislation also allows it to demolish buildings constructed in those areas by foreign organizations or individuals.The legislation passed by China on January 22 has become a thorny issue in already strained Japan-China ties.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, in order to prepare Japan's defences against the Chinese aggression, made a call to the US President Joe Biden last month wherein it was agreed that Article 5 of the Japan-US security treaty covers the Senkakus, meaning that the United States would defend Japan in the event of a conflict there, reported the Japan Times.Beijing immediately lambasted the declaration by the two leaders, arguing the islets are "China's inherent territory."Beijing claims that the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which are administered by Tokyo, are part of its territory. The new law could be used to target Japanese vessels navigating around the uninhabited islets that China calls Diaoyu, reported the Japan Times.In the early 2010s, China and Japan were mired in a territorial row over the Senkakus. Beijing has rapidly built up artificial islands with military infrastructure in the region, claiming sovereignty over almost the entire maritime region.Moreover, China has conflicting territorial claims with four of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam -- as well as Taiwan in the South China Sea.Meanwhile, US warships carried out freedom of navigation operations in an apparent bid to challenge Chinese claims and actions in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-conveys-strong-concerns-to-china-over-new-coast-guard-law-101612608403437.html
06-02-2021||World||China approves second domestic Covid-19 vaccine for public use||A Chinese pharma company on Saturday said its Covid-19 vaccine has been approved for public use by China’s top medical products regulator. Sinovac Biotech’s announcement marked it as the second locally-made coronavirus cleared for mass inoculations.The first vaccine was developed by a Beijing institute affiliated to state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), and approved in December. In June 2020, the Sinovac vaccine was the first to be approved for emergency use in China, and since July, emergency use has been launched in China for specific groups of people.Since then - and before prior approvals - both vaccines have already been used in China’s vaccination programme.Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and Laos have granted emergency use authorisations for the CoronaVac vaccine developed by Sinovac Life Sciences, Sinovac said in a news release. The basic immunisation programme of the vaccine comprises two doses with an interval of 14 to 28 days.In January, researchers in Brazil had reported that CoronaVac was 50.4% effective at preventing severe and mild Covid-19 in late-stage trials, much lower than the 90% efficacies of some of the leading vaccines.“The CoronaVac figures were much lower than those from early trials of the same vaccine in Turkey and Indonesia, and below the efficacy first reported by the Brazil trial team last week,” Nature magazine reported in January.Nature reported that Butantan Institute in São Paulo had announced on January 7 that the vaccine’s efficacy was 78% at preventing the disease - but revealed later that the figure was based on the narrow criteria of people needing medical attention.Until February 3, China had administered 31.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to key groups of people, Mi Feng, national health commission (NHC) spokesperson, said on Thursday.China aims to vaccinate 50 million people before the start of the Lunar New Year in the second week of February when millions are expected to travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-second-domestic-covid-19-vaccine-for-public-use-101612608997688.html

06-02-2021||World||AstraZeneca shots start to arrive in EU after vaccination chaos||AstraZeneca Plc’s coronavirus vaccine is finally arriving in European Union countries as the bloc tries to speed up its inoculation campaign and put a crisis-ridden period behind it.France will use it beginning Saturday, with a priority for healthcare workers, after its first batch arrived Friday evening. Germany, Ireland, Spain and Austria will also start offering the shot, while Portugal will receive deliveries early next week.The doses are transported mostly by truck via hubs across the continent, and their arrival is a welcome development for the EU, which has spent the past few weeks in a public row with Astra over vaccine targets. That ultimately spilled over into a back-and-forth blame game, threats of protectionism and huge political errors that threatened the Brexit deal between the UK and the EU.Even with the rollout improving, governments remain worried about delays given thousands are still dying daily. They’re also sticking with lockdowns to control the spread of the virus, particularly as new variants emerge.Germany is likely to extend its Covid-19 restrictions for another two weeks when Chancellor Angela Merkel and state government leaders meet next week, people familiar with the discussions said. Greece on Friday tightened restrictions on movement and shopping.Also read| Russia's Sputnik V vaccine now favorite in pandemic fightAccording to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker, the EU’s vaccination progress is so far lagging far behind the UK and the USDespite the slow start, the European Commission is sticking to a plan to have 70% of the adult population vaccinated by late summer. It expects that the pace will pick up rapidly in the coming months, with deliveries of at least 300 million doses in the second quarter.Amid ongoing worry about delays, a group of EU leaders urged European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen to swiftly conclude talks with other vaccine developers, such as Novovax and Valneva. They also highlighted risks surrounding the decision of Johnson & Johnson to ship vaccines to the U.S. for packaging.The J&J product “may be a potential game changer due to easier storage and transport as well as requirement of only one dose,” the leaders said in the letter obtained by Bloomberg.Astra’s shot is the third to be cleared by the EU’s drug regulator. It approved BioNTech SE and Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine in December, and Moderna Inc.’s last month.Also read| Healthy people infected with Covid for sake of science should be paid: ExpertsMany countries have been cautious on the Astra jab, only recommending it for those under the age of 65. But governments are still counting on it to speed up the inoculation effort.German Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday it will allow the country to double vaccinations in February versus what would have been possible with only Pfizer and Moderna. The Astra shot will initially be applied primarily to health care workers aged 64 and younger, allowing those above 65 to be more quickly vaccinated with the other two.Austria is also ramping up. In Vienna, the additional supply means the city can administer 28,600 doses next week, twice as many as in the week of Feb. 1.As governments try to move on from the vaccine debacle, they also want to prevent the high-profile blunders from undermining public confidence. Spahn emphasized that point on Friday, saying all approved products are equally good for under-65s.“We have with all three vaccines effective tools to fight this pandemic,” he said in Berlin. “We hope and expect that even more will soon follow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-shots-start-to-arrive-in-eu-after-vaccination-chaos-101612593217486.html

06-02-2021||World||Federal executions likely a Covid super-spreader||As the Trump administration was nearing the end of an unprecedented string of executions, 70 per cent of death row inmates were sick with Covid-19. Guards were ill.Travelling prisons staff on the execution team had the virus. So did media witnesses, who may have unknowingly infected others when they returned home because they were never told about the spreading cases.Records obtained by The Associated Press show employees at the Indiana prison complex where the 13 executions were carried out over six months had contact with inmates and other people infected with the coronavirus, but were able to refuse testing and declined to participate in contact tracing efforts and were still permitted to return to their work assignments.Other staff members, including those brought in to help with executions, also spread tips to their colleagues about how they could avoid quarantines and skirt public health guidance from the federal government and Indiana health officials.The executions at the end of Donald Trump's presidency, completed in a short window over a few weeks, likely acted as a superspreader event, according to the records reviewed by AP. It was something health experts warned could happen when the Justice Department insisted on resuming executions during a pandemic.Also read| No indication that India has given up extradition of Headley: Ranas' attorneyIt's impossible to know precisely who introduced the infections and how they started to spread, in part because prisons officials didn't consistently do contact tracing and haven't been fully transparent about the number of cases. But medical experts say it's likely the executioners and support staff, many of whom travelled from prisons in other states with their own virus outbreaks, triggered or contributed both in the Terre Haute penitentiary and beyond the prison walls.Of the 47 people on death row, 33 tested positive between December 16 and December 20, becoming infected soon after the executions of Alfred Bourgeois on December 11, and Brandon Bernard on December 10, according to Colorado-based attorney Madeline Cohen, who compiled the names of those who tested positive by reaching out to other federal death row lawyers. Other lawyers, as well as activists in contact with death row inmates, also told AP they were told a large numbers of death row inmates tested positive in mid-December.In addition, at least a dozen other people, including execution team members, media witnesses and a spiritual adviser, tested positive within the incubation period of the virus, meeting the criteria of a superspreader event, in which one or more individuals trigger an outbreak that spreads to many others outside their circle of acquaintances. The tally could be far higher, but without contact tracing it's impossible to be sure.The Bureau of Prisons has repeatedly refused to say how many other people have tested positive for the coronavirus after the last three federal executions last month. And the agency would not answer questions about the specific reasoning for withholding the information from the public, instead directing the AP to file a public records request.Also read| UN human rights agency calls for 'maximum restraint' by farmers and authoritiesAn analysis of public health data shows the virus was raging at peak levels in Indiana's Vigo County — home to the Terre Haute prison — as the federal government carried out an execution in November, essentially sending dozens of Bureau of Prisons staff members, witnesses and others into a virus hot zone, leaving them susceptible to being sickened and spreading the disease back to their home prisons and hometowns.In response to questions from the AP, the Bureau of Prisons said staff members who don't experience symptoms “are clear to work” and that they have their temperatures taken and are asked about symptoms before reporting for duty. (The AP has previously reported that staff members at other prisons were cleared with normal temperatures even when thermometers showed hypothermic readings.)The agency said it also conducts contact training in accordance with federal guidance and that “if staff are circumventing this guidance, we are not aware.”Officials said staff members were required to participate in contact tracing “if they met the criteria for it” and agency officials couldn't compel employees to be tested.“We cannot force staff members to take tests, nor does the CDC recommend testing of asymptomatic individuals,” an agency spokesperson said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The union for Terre Haute employees declined to comment, saying it did not want to “get into the public fray of this whole issue.”Elsewhere, union officials have long complained about the spread of the coronavirus through the federal prison system, as well as a lack of personal protective equipment and room to isolate infected inmates. Some of those issues have been alleviated, but containing the virus continues to be a concern at many facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-executions-likely-a-covid-superspreader-101612600376384.html
06-02-2021||World||Wuhan residents remember Covid whistleblower Dr Wenliang, a year after his death||A year after his death from COVID-19, residents in the Chinese city of Wuhan say they remain grateful to the "whistleblower" doctor who first sounded the alarm about the outbreak before it received official recognition.Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at a hospital in the city, became one of the most visible figures in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan when he tried to sound the alarm about its appearance, but was reprimanded by police for "spreading rumours."The 34-year-old's death from the virus on Feb. 7 led to an outpouring of public mourning and rare expressions of anger online.Several days later Zhong Nanshan, a renowned epidemiologist, shed tears for Li in an interview with Reuters, calling him a "hero of China."But when President Xi Jinping honoured the "heroes" of the "people's war" against the virus in September, there was no mention of Li's contribution.While people on the streets around Li's hospital say life in the city has mostly returned to its usual rhythm, they still revere Li for his actions.As Reuters journalists visited the area around the hospital on Saturday they were followed by two men in plainclothes who identified themselves as "hospital parking security," and local guards blocked a cameraman from filming the hospital entrance."He was the first to tell us about the virus," said Li Pan, 24, who owns an online store."He must have considered the impact would be huge, but he still raised the alarm. That was really brave," Li said.Ji Penghui, a 34 year-old designer, said he heard about Li's warning in the early days and rushed to stock up on masks before the officials spoke openly about the virus."The public strongly acknowledges him, and personally, I think he should receive more official honours, rather than being treated as what he did is already in the past" Ji said.Ji said the government made mistakes in the early stages, but it has handled it well since.A World Health Organization team is currently in Wuhan researching the early stages of the outbreak, and is preparing to present its findings, team member Dominic Dwyer told Reuters on Friday.The team visited the sprawling Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, thought to be where the virus first became an outbreak, which led to a pandemic that has infected over 105 million people and killed nearly 3 million worldwide.The market site has been shut to the public since the beginning of last year.The origins of the virus have become highly politicised, and some Chinese diplomats and state media have thrown support behind theories that the virus potentially originated in another country.While 80-year-old Qian Wende said he does not know where the virus came from, he regards Li as a hero."We should be commemorating his contribution to fighting the pandemic," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-residents-remember-covid-whistleblower-dr-wenliang-a-year-after-his-death-101612601709713.html
06-02-2021||World||United Nations kicks off selection of next secretary-general||The United Nations kicked off the selection of its next secretary-general on Friday, asking the 193 U.N. member states to submit candidates to be the world organization’s chief diplomat and operating officer.The process officially began with a joint letter signed virtually by General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir and Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward, this month’s president of the Security Council opening the nomination of candidates.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, whose current term expires on Dec. 31, announced last month that he is seeking a second five-year term.Honduras’ U.N. Ambassador Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake also sent a letter to all U.N. member nations saying there has never been a female secretary-general and asking them to “present women candidates.”“I am writing this communication from a place of conviction, where standing for equal rights makes a difference in creating a fair and equitable organization, and opening opportunities for women all over the world," Flores Flake said.A 2015 General Assembly resolution, which was adopted by consensus, changed the previously largely secretive selection of the secretary-general to a more open and transparent process. It allowed the world body’s member states for the first time to see basic information about all candidates, including their resumes, and to meet and question them at open sessions.Just before Christmas, a group of 25 nations from all regions called the Accountability Coherence and Transparency group wrote to the General Assembly and Security Council urging that the selection process for the next secretary-general meets “at a minimum” the 2015 standards of transparency and involvement of the 193 U.N. member nations.Guterres’ election was a disappointment to women, who had hoped to break the all-male hold on the post, and to East Europeans who have never had a secretary-general from the region. It was supposed to be next in the informal geographical rotation for U.N. chief when Guterres, a Portuguese, was elected.The General Assembly elects the secretary-general on the recommendation of the 15-member Security Council where the five permanent members -- the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France -- have veto power, so their support is crucial.In the 2016 race, there were 13 candidates vying to be secretary-general, seven women and six men, and the General Assembly held open interviews for each of them, where ambassadors from all countries could ask questions. Six straw polls were held in the Security Council between July and October, and Guterres led in all of them.The current election is the first under the 2015 resolution where an incumbent is seeking reelection. Whether any candidates are put forward to challenge him remains to be seen.In their joint letter, Woodward and Bozkir said “the position of the secretary-general is one of great importance that requires the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and a firm commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.” It stressed that candidates should have “proven leadership and managerial abilities, extensive experience in international relations, and strong diplomatic, communication and multilingual skills.”The letter states that Guterres “indicated his readiness to meet the expectations of the membership regarding transparency and inclusivity with the submission of a vision statement and participation in an informal dialogue with member states.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already endorsed Guterres for a second term.Woodward and Bozkir said informal dialogues with candidates will take place before the Security Council begins the selection process by May or June.Woodward tweeted that the Security Council and General Assembly presidents have worked “kick-starting the process of selecting and appointing the U.N. secretary-general.”“We look forward to contributing to an open process over the coming months,” Woodward said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-nations-kicks-off-selection-of-next-secretarygeneral-101612601136794.html

06-02-2021||World||Russia's Sputnik V vaccine now favorite in pandemic fight||President Vladimir Putin’s announcement in August that Russia had cleared the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine for use before it even completed safety trials sparked skepticism worldwide. Now he may reap diplomatic dividends as Russia basks in arguably its biggest scientific breakthrough since the Soviet era.Countries are lining up for supplies of Sputnik V after peer-reviewed results published in The Lancet medical journal this week showed the Russian vaccine protects against the deadly virus about as well as US and European shots, and far more effectively than Chinese rivals.At least 19 countries have approved the inoculation for use, including European Union member state Hungary, while key markets such as Brazil and India are close to authorizing it. Now Russia’s setting its sights on the prized EU market as the bloc struggles with its vaccination program amid supply shortages.In the global battle to defeat a pandemic that’s claimed 2.3 million lives in little more than a year, the race to obtain vaccines has assumed geopolitical significance as governments seek to emerge from the huge social and economic damage caused by lockdowns imposed to limit the spread of the virus. That’s giving Russia an edge as one of a handful of countries where scientists have produced an effective defense.Its decision to name Sputnik V after the world’s first satellite whose 1957 launch gave the Soviet Union a stunning triumph against the US to start the space race only underlined the scale of the significance Moscow attached to the achievement. Results from the late-stage trials of 20,000 participants reviewed in The Lancet showed that the vaccine has a 91.6% success rate.“This is a watershed moment for us,” Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, which backed Sputnik V’s development and is in charge of its international roll-out, said in an interview.While it’s too early to gauge the political gains for Putin, Russia’s already making much of the soft-power impact of the vaccine on its image after years of international condemnation over election meddling and targeting of political opponents at home and abroad. State television reports extensively on deliveries to other nations.Sputnik’s success won’t change hostility toward Putin among Western governments, though it could strengthen Russia’s geopolitical clout in regions such as Latin America, according to Oksana Antonenko, a director at Control Risks consultancy.“With this vaccine, it’s proven itself capable of producing something new that’s in demand around the world,” she said.Production constraints are the biggest challenge facing all manufacturers as global demand far outpaces supply. Russia, pledging free shots for its 146 million population, began output last year and the vaccine is currently being manufactured in countries including India, South Korea and Brazil.This week, it emerged a close ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed an agreement to produce Sputnik V in Turkey, even as the nation has deals to buy 50 million doses of China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s CoronaVac vaccine and 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE shot.Despite Russia’s success, domestic demand remains lukewarm so far, driven by public suspicion of the authorities. Putin, 68, fueled the skepticism in December when he said he was waiting to get the inoculation until it had been cleared for people his age.He still hasn’t said whether he’s been vaccinated, but other nations aren’t waiting to find out. The day after announcing he’d contracted Covid-19, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said January 25 he’d thanked a “genuinely affectionate” Putin for pledging 24 million doses of Sputnik V in the coming two months. Three days later, Bolivian President Luis Arce personally took delivery of a batch at La Paz airport.Latin America is proving fertile territory. Argentina, which has struggled to obtain vaccine supplies, started its mass inoculation program after taking delivery of more than half a million Sputnik V doses by January. It’s been joined by Nicaragua, Paraguay and Venezuela. In Brazil, the region’s biggest market, a decision announced February 3 to scrap the requirement for phase three trials for emergency use may speed up approval.Guinea became the first African nation to start dispensing Sputnik V in December with Moscow-friendly President Alpha Conde and several ministers taking the vaccine. It expects to get 1.6 million doses this year and is also in talks on acquiring Chinese vaccines, along with AstraZeneca Plc’s shot. Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic and Ivory Coast are among other potential customers for Russia.“We’re not in a position where we can say no to any vaccine. We’ve opted for the Pfizer vaccine, but we’re looking at other vaccines as well,” said Professor Joseph Benie, head of the National Institute of Public Hygiene in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. “There’s an urgency now to start inoculating.”Unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Sputnik V can be stored in a fridge rather than a freezer, making it easier to transport and distribute in poorer and hotter countries. At around $20 for a two-shot vaccination, it’s also cheaper than most Western alternatives. While more expensive than AstraZeneca, the Russian inoculation has shown higher efficacy than the UK vaccine.For some nations such as Iran, which received the first batch of a promised 2 million doses this week, Russia offers a more palatable political alternative than Western suppliers. But Russia is also making inroads into countries such as the United Arab Emirates, which is traditionally close to the US and has approved Sputnik V for use.China, whose inoculations are as low as 50% effective in the case of Sinovac Biotech, retains a lead in Asia. Only a handful of countries have opted for Sputnik V, including the Philippines, which is in talks for 25 million doses.Chinese developers may now team up with Russia. The RDIF struck a preliminary deal to test a combined regimen of shots from Sputnik V and China’s CanSino Biologics to boost effectiveness against Covid-19, people with knowledge of the matter said Friday.In what could represent the Kremlin’s biggest potential breakthrough, European regulators are starting to examine a request for authorization of Sputnik V after Germany promised to help expedite the process. With top EU officials still smarting over a sluggish vaccine roll-out, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday the Russian shot could be used to protect people in the 27-member bloc as long as it was approved by the European Medicines Agency.Hungary has already granted emergency approval, signing a deal for 2 million doses of Sputnik V with the first 40,000 shots delivered Tuesday. “The vaccine cannot be a political question,” Prime Minister Viktor Orban told state radio Jan. 29. “One can only choose between western and eastern vaccines when you have enough.”European approval may take several months because of the need to submit detailed data, The Lancet’s Editor-in-Chief Richard Horton told Bloomberg’s QuickTake. “I do think this Russian vaccine will come on tap,” but “not quickly,” he said.While Russia says it expects the vaccine to be available to 700 million people this year, it’s facing production bottlenecks. “We have to be realistic. Given our other commitments, we will not be able to supply to Europe before May, other than Hungary,” said RDIF’s Dmitriev.Still, the vaccine is paying dividends for Putin. Even as he visited Moscow Friday to confront Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexey Navalny, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell took time to congratulate Russia on developing Sputnik V.“It’s good news for the whole mankind,” Borrell said. “It means that we are going to have more tools to face the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-sputnik-v-vaccine-now-favorite-in-pandemic-fight-101612593900451.html
06-02-2021||World||Turkey's procurement of Russian missile; threat to NATO alliance||US President Joe Biden's administration said Friday it wants Turkey to renounce a major Russian missile defense system it controversially bought in 2019, holding the line set by Donald Trump's government, which imposed rare sanctions on the NATO ally."Our position has not changed," Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. "We urge Turkey not to retain the S-400 system."Turkey turned to Russia after failing to agree terms with Barack Obama's administration about the purchase of US Patriots - the air defense system of choice for most NATO member states.It took delivery of the $2.5 billion S-400 system in defiance of warnings that such military cooperation was incompatible with NATO and would let Russia improve its targeting of Western planes.In retaliation, Washington banned all US export licenses and loan credits for Turkey's military procurement agency, the Presidency of Defense Industries.Earlier it had also evicted Turkey from joint efforts in developing the F-35 fighter-jet."Turkey is a longstanding and valued NATO ally, but their decision to purchase the S-400 is inconsistent with Turkey's commitments as a US and NATO ally," Kirby continued during a press briefing."Turkey had multiple opportunities over the last decade to purchase the Patriot defense system from the United States and instead chose to purchase the S-400, which provides Russia revenue, access and influence," he noted.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had expressed the hope in January of reaching a compromise with Biden that would allow Ankara to be reintegrated into the F-35 fighter aircraft program, but contacts between the new American administration and Turkey have been limited.While Ankara said on Tuesday that Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin and US national security advisor Jake Sullivan had expressed wishes for greater cooperation, on Friday Biden still had not yet spoken with Erdogan since becoming president.Also Watch: US threat to India-Russia missile system deal?

06-02-2021||World||How a ‘mind-blowing’ blunder created a dangerous Brexit standoff||Thirty years ago, during Northern Ireland’s long-running sectarian conflict, gunmen botched an attempt to assassinate a young academic in Belfast.Adrian Guelke survived, still lives in the city and, last week, watched with astonishment as the European Union stirred up the tensions which almost cost him his life by threatening the part of the Brexit agreement that aims to protect the fragile peace in the region.Now emeritus professor of politics at Queen’s University Belfast, Guelke described the bloc’s threat to control the flow of coronavirus vaccines into Northern Ireland as a “mind-blowing” blunder.“Pandora’s box was opened,” he said in a telephone interview.The EU may have retreated, but it has inadvertently allowed Northern Ireland’s unionists, who want to remain part of the UK, to revive a separate and far bigger controversy that Brexit was supposed to have settled for good: the status of the border with mainland Britain.The row threatens not only to sour the EU’s fragile post-Brexit relationship with the UK, but also to turn into a flashpoint for the simmering discontent among unionists about the deal Boris Johnson signed despite their opposition.Biden WarningWhile there are few signs that the crisis will immediately reignite the full-blown conflict between Northern Ireland’s protestant Unionists, the minority Catholic Nationalists, who want it to be united with the Republic of Ireland, and British troops, history shows how events in the province can quickly spiral out of control.How Johnson, the EU, and Northern Ireland’s unionists respond in the coming days and months could tip the balance. US President Joe Biden has already warned that the peace process in Northern Ireland has to be protected.“There are unquestionably people running around seeing an opportunity to get some paramilitary activity going again,” said Reg Empey, a former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. “It only takes one lunatic.”Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland effectively remained in the EU’s customs union and single market after Brexit -- a crucial concession Johnson made to the bloc in order to secure Britain’s orderly departure.By keeping the land border with Ireland free of checkpoints, both sides hoped to prevent a return to the era of the Troubles. But it came at a price: Goods arriving from the rest of the UK would be subject to checks and extra paperwork as they crossed the Irish Sea from mainland Britain.Border DelaysThe Democratic Unionist Party, Northern Ireland’s biggest political party, was opposed to the so-called Protocol because it treats the province differently from the rest of the UK But it has had to deal with the consequences: delays and disruption at the border, which are proving unpopular with voters.Retailers such as John Lewis have halted sales to the region. Marks & Spencer Group Plc withdrew about 300 of its products from its Northern Irish stores, and images of empty food shelves have flooded social media.Under mounting pressure from even more hard-line loyalists, the DUP had already been pushing the British prime minister to scrap the Protocol. Initially, Johnson brushed off the DUP, dismissing the delays and shortages as teething problems.BlindsidedThat all changed late on January 29, when Northern Ireland was caught up in the EU’s vaccine crisis. Suddenly, the bloc raised -- however faintly -- the prospect of controls returning to the 310-mile (500-kilometer) frontier running from near Derry in the north to Dundalk in the south.“They pulled the rug out from under the Protocol’s defenders,” said Guelke, who was shot by loyalist paramilitaries who mistakenly believed he had links to the Irish republican movement.Officials in London were blindsided. A person with knowledge of the situation said they were horrified that the EU hadn’t appreciated the sensitivities surrounding the Protocol and the peace it was designed to protect.The following day, ministers including the Cabinet Office’s Michael Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis held crisis talks with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. During the video call, they agreed they needed an emergency meeting with the EU to ram home the dangers of the Commission’s actions. In the meantime, ministers played down the gravity of the situation in public.Johnson ThreatOn Wednesday, Johnson was confronted in Parliament by a member of the DUP who demanded he prove his commitment to the United Kingdom. The premier threatened to suspend parts of the Brexit deal in the same way as the EU had done, if that’s what it would take to end checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.That evening, Gove, Lewis, and the leaders of the DUP, as well as their political opponents Sinn Fein, put their cases directly to Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic.The conversation, on another Zoom call, was described as direct by one person familiar with the matter. Gove demanded the EU delay implementing full checks on food, medicines and parcels until 2023 to help ease delays at the border -- but Sefcovic demurred.Based on that meeting, British officials say they doubt whether the Commission really understands the extent to which it is playing with fire in Northern Ireland.‘Dangerous Place’Privately, EU officials, who freely concede the bloc blundered badly, suspect Johnson is using the vaccine crisis as an opportunity to win concessions on the operation of the Protocol. Few expect him to try and drop the deal outright.There are tensions, too, on the British side. While unionists want the entire protocol to be scrapped, Johnson and his team have given the EU no deadline to comply with the UK’s demands. They simply want the bloc to take seriously the need to address the problems with the protocol and hope the row over vaccines will serve as a wake-up call to Brussels. That may disappoint the DUP.“We are in a dangerous place right now,” said Edward Burke, assistant professor of International Relations at Nottingham University, who is researching the effect of Brexit on the British-Irish security relationship.“Unionists and loyalists don’t feel as if London or Dublin are listening to their concerns,” he said. “And the template in Northern Ireland in recent decades is, sadly, that violence or the threat of violence wins attention and money from both governments.”‘Menacing Behavior’Days after the EU’s misstep, local and European authorities withdrew their inspectors from Larne and Belfast ports after what the local municipality said was “an upsurge in sinister and menacing behavior.”Police, however, stress there is no evidence that organized loyalist paramilitary groups are behind those threats, and they remain unconvinced about how seriously to take them.The risk is events in Northern Ireland have a habit of escalating. In 2013, for example, a decision by Belfast city hall to stop flying the British flag fueled unrest that was then amplified by the annual marches of Protestant groups. That in turned triggered the worst sectarian violence since the 1990s, paralyzing Belfast for much of that summer.“If it wasn’t for the pandemic, I think we’d be seeing major demonstrations here,” Empey said. “The move by Brussels last week -- I couldn’t tell you how bad a mistake that was.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-a-mind-blowing-blunder-created-a-dangerous-brexit-standoff-101612592710381.html
06-02-2021||World||Biden mulls ways to ease Iran's financial pains without lifting key sanctions||The Biden administration is weighing ways to ease Iran’s financial pain without lifting crushing economic sanctions -- including on oil sales -- as a step toward reviving the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by former President Donald Trump.Some options US officials are debating include providing backing for International Monetary Fund lending to Tehran for coronavirus relief and easing up on sanctions that have stymied international coronavirus aid from getting into Iran, according to four people familiar with the administration’s thinking. Such moves could be justified on humanitarian grounds.President Joe Biden could also sign an executive order reversing Trump’s decision to quit the multinational deal, according to the people. But issuing sanctions waivers to allow Iran to sell oil on the international market isn’t currently under serious consideration, according to the people.“Over recent months there’s been a lot of thinking in both Europe and the Democratic camp on a number of immediate measures the U.S. can realistically take,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. She described the ideas under consideration as measures that “can still give Iran tangible relief.”Reviving the Iran deal has emerged as one of the Biden administration’s highest-profile foreign policy challenges, part of a slew of actions meant to halt or reverse initiatives championed by Trump’s national security team. That includes freezing a planned troop drawdown in Germany, withdrawing support for offensive actions supporting Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen and reviewing the previous administration’s outreach to North Korea.Biden’s National Security Council held a meeting on Mideast issues Friday that was believed to focus on Iran, but White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Twitter that “no pending policy announcements” were expected from the gathering.Biden has long criticized Trump’s decision to quit the Iran accord, saying it reduced the “breakout period” Tehran needs to build a nuclear weapon, but getting back into the deal is also fraught. Iran’s leaders are demanding an end to U.S. sanctions and have since breached the agreement by enriching uranium beyond levels permitted by the accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.The Biden administration insists that Iran return to compliance with the JCPOA before the US goes further, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said any full return is still a “long ways off.” But Iran says the US needs to make the first move, and President Hassan Rouhani’s government is taking a series of steps aimed at increasing pressure on the US for a speedy deal.Robert Malley, the State Department’s new envoy for Iran negotiations, declined to comment. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US wants to consult with European allies that were part of the deal before allowing coronavirus aid or any other relief. Those nations were infuriated when Trump quit the accord and reimposed a raft of economic sanctions.“Before we announce any changes in policy along those lines we would want to make sure we’ve undertaken those consultations, and we’re in the process of doing those now,” Price said.Those talks began on Friday, according to UK Foreign Minister Dominic Raab.Yet it’s still early days for the Biden administration. Malley was appointed only last week and Wendy Sherman, an architect of the nuclear deal who is Biden’s pick to be deputy secretary of state, has yet to have her Senate confirmation hearing.Iran’s key demand for a return to compliance is for the removal of crippling restrictions the US put on the country’s ability to sell oil. In a sign that the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign is losing effectiveness, the country’s oil exports have risen steadily in recent months, though they remain far below historic levels.Skeptics fear that easing oil sanctions now would deny the US a key source of leverage and make Iran less likely to go back into the deal. At the same time, oil analysts at Rapidan Energy group foresee an additional 500,000 Iranian barrels of oil coming back on the market in the next two to three months, possibly with US approval.“To do a deal reset that requires compliance for compliance, the Biden administration recognizes they’ve got to allow those barrels back on the water,” said Scott Modell, managing director at Rapidan. “The final pathway hasn’t been paved yet, but I think they’re working on it.”One of the biggest challenges the new administration faces is the wave of sanctions Trump imposed late in his administration targeting Iran over its sponsorship of terrorism. That includes the decision to impose terrorism-related sanctions on Iran’s Central Bank. Any sanctions relief -- even on humanitarian grounds -- could fail to deliver if the terror designation remains because the central bank oversees virtually all the country’s financial activity.“Unless Iran’s central bank is going to be allowed to freely operate in the international banking system, Iran is not going to accept returning to compliance with the JCPOA,” Kenneth Katzman, a senior analyst on Middle East issues at the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, told an Atlantic Council event last week. “The central bank is the hub of Iran’s international banking activity.”There are a few signs of movement. South Korea is in the final stages of talks with the US about unfreezing some of the billions of dollars of Iranian money trapped in the Asian country due to sanctions, the Yonhap News Agency reported. That came after Iran released the crew of a South Korean-flagged ship that was seized in the Persian Gulf on January 4.The U.S. Treasury Department could also issue licenses allowing limited trade with Iran, or offer assurances that trade via a humanitarian channel set up by European nations known as Instex won’t be affected. Although the Trump administration insisted humanitarian trade with Iran was allowed, many participants felt they didn’t get the safeguards they needed to go ahead.Coming CrisisYet as much as the Biden team would like to move carefully and in lockstep with Europe, Iran and the US are heading toward a crisis at the end of February that’s likely to make reviving the deal even harder. On February 21, Iran has threatened to stop abiding by what’s known as the Additional Protocol -- a series of voluntary measures that allow for snap nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.One IAEA diplomat, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations, described the sides as sleepwalking into conflict. On February 1 and February 2, the IAEA circulated restricted documents to diplomats confirming fresh breaches to the accord, and Iran is moving forward with higher levels of uranium enrichment at both its Fordow and Natanz facilities.“The United States needs to come back into compliance and Iran will be ready immediately to respond,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN this week. “The timing is not the issue, the issue is whether the United States, the new administration, wants to follow the failed policies of the Trump administration or not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-mulls-ways-to-ease-iran-s-financial-pains-without-lifting-key-sanctions-101612588692801.html

Some are descendents of Nationalist troops trapped in Myanmar at the end of China's civil war in 1949 and others have come more recently, fleeing repression and anti-Chinese sentiment.Dressed in red, the colour of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, holding pictures of her and signs in Chinese, English and Burmese condemning the coup, around 300 people marched down the streets around Taipei's Little Burma.Finishing up in a plaza outside an apartment block they sang "We Won't Be Satisfied Until The End Of The World", the Burmese language anthem from the country's 1988 pro-democracy uprising, brutally put down by the military government.Ko Ko Thu, 54, who fled to Taiwan after those protests were suppressed and helped organise the rally, told Reuters he took inspiration from democratic Taiwan."Taiwan is a very democratic country. I hope that in the future, even if I am dead, that Myanmar can be democratic like Taiwan," added Ko Ko Thu, who unlike most the other participants is not ethnically Chinese.Ethnic Chinese in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, have historically faced discrimination, especially under the rule of General Ne Win who seized power in 1962.He barred ethnic Chinese and other foreigners from owning land, banned Chinese-language education and stoked anti-Chinese violence. Bloody anti-Chinese riots erupted in 1967.Yee, an ethnic Chinese woman who asked to be identified by her Burmese name, also came to Taiwan after the 1988 protests, and said it was important to show their opposition to the coup."We have had more than 30 years of repression from the military government. We don't want to go back to that," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinoburmese-residents-in-taiwan-rally-against-myanmar-coup-101612588149591.html

CanSino has carried out Phase 3 trials in Mexico with 14,425 volunteers enrolled. But the results of that trial and the estimated efficacy rate has not yet been revealed. Mexico would presumably require those figures for approval.Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard wrote that the vaccine had been “applied successfully” in the trials, but did not release specific data.Mexico has been promised 8 million doses of the CanSino vaccine by March, and is particularly upbeat about the Chinese shot because it is relatively easy to handle, and will be finished and bottled at a plant in Mexico.Mexico also recently approved Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, but won’t get that, or more doses of the Pfizer vaccine, until later this month.Mexico has received only about 760,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and has only about 60,000 of those left, many of which are earmarked for second shots.

06-02-2021||World||White House says working to speed early production of J&J's Covid-19 vaccine||The Biden administration is exploring every option for increasing manufacturing of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, which is under regulatory review, and said on Friday that currently expected levels of early doses were less than hoped.The White House has invoked the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer Inc ramp up Covid-19 vaccine production and that "every option" was on the table to produce more Johnson & Johnson vaccine should it be authorized.It will also use the wartime powers to increase at-home Covid-19 tests, and make more surgical gloves in the United States, officials said at a Friday media briefing."As is the case with other vaccines, we have not found that the level of manufacturing allows us to have as much vaccine as we think we need coming out of the gate," said Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House’s Covid-19 response team, referring to the J&J vaccine.J&J applied on Thursday for US. emergency use authorization. It expects to have some vaccine ready for distribution as soon as authorized but has not said how much.Emergent Biosolutions' Chief Executive Robert Kramer said in an interview on Friday that the company currently is making bulk drug substance for J&J "at large scale." Emergent is only producing bulk vaccine, which is then filled into syringes or vials and packaged for shipment by another contractor.Kramer said they were on track to make enough product for hundreds of millions of doses a year. It remains unclear what other supply bottlenecks may be. Kramer said his company had already benefited from the Defense Production Act under the Trump Administration, which helped the company get to the point where it's ready to go.Under the authority of the Defense Production Act, the government will give priority ratings to two components important to Pfizer’s vaccine production - filling pumps and tangential flow filtration units, the officials said.“We told you that when we heard of a bottleneck on needed equipment, supplies, or technology related to vaccine supply that we would step in and help, and we were doing just that,” said Tim Manning, the supply chain coordinator for the national Covid-19 response.The government will also invoke its powers under the Defense Production Act to increase at-home Covid-19 tests with six, unnamed manufacturers, aiming to produce 61 million tests by the summer, Manning said.It will also invoke its powers to increase the nation’s supply of surgical gloves, which are made almost exclusively overseas.Manning said the government will build factories that make the raw materials for surgical gloves and help build plants in the United States to make the gloves.By the end of the year, he said, the United States would be able to produce a billion gloves a month.Officials have said that once J&J's vaccine is authorized, it would mean that millions more doses would be available to states. The vaccine is one-shot, as opposed to Pfizer's and Moderna Inc's two-dose vaccines, and can be stored in a refrigerator.Officials have hoped that the ease of giving the J&J vaccine will mean that states will be able to more quickly immunize residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-working-to-speed-early-production-of-j-j-s-covid-19-vaccine-101612584558798.html
06-02-2021||World||IMF chief warns of 'lost generation' if low-income countries don't get more help||The head of the IMF on Friday urged advanced economies to provide more resources to low-income countries, warning of an emerging "Great Divergence" in global growth that could risk stability and trigger social unrest for years to come.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters that 50% of developing countries were at risk of falling further behind, which raised concerns about stability and social unrest.Click here for latest updates on Covid-19 To avert bigger problems, she said rich countries and international institutions should chip in more. She also urged heavily indebted countries to seek debt restructuring sooner rather than later, and to boost conditions for growth. "Last year the main focus was on the 'Great Lockdown.' This year we face the risk of 'Great Divergence,'" Georgieva told reporters during a videoconference. "We estimate that developing countries that have been for decades converging in income levels will be in a very tough place this time around."Setbacks for living standards in developing countries would make it much more difficult to achieve stability and security for the rest of the world, she said."What is the risk? Social unrest. You can call it a lost decade. It may be a lost generation," she said.Georgieva said advanced economies had spent about 24% of GDP on average on support measures during the pandemic, compared to 6% in emerging markets and 2% in low-income countries.A former top World Bank executive, Georgieva said vaccination efforts were uneven, with poor countries facing "tremendous difficulties" even as official development funds were going down.Only one country in Africa - Morocco - had begun vaccinating its citizens, she said, citing grave concerns about increased mortality in many African countries."We must do everything in our power to reverse this dangerous divergence," she said, noting developing countries could also miss out on a major shift underway in rich countries to more digital and green economies.She said accelerating vaccinations could add $9 trillion to the global economy by 2025, with 60% of benefits going to developing countries.Georgieva said she was still working with IMF shareholders to win support for a new allocation of the IMF's own currency, or Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), which could provide resources to poorer countries.Former US President Donald Trump had blocked such a move, akin to a central bank printing money. Support from the United States, the IMF's dominant shareholder, is more likely under President Joe Biden whose administration is open to a new allocation, according to sources familiar with their views. The Biden administration has not addressed the issue publicly.Georgieva said an SDR allocation of $250 billion in 2009 had helped stabilize the global economy during the global financial crisis, and the current situation was more grave.She said the IMF was completing a periodic review of long-term liquidity needs that might justify a new SDR allocation, but gave no further details.Group of Seven finance officials will discuss a possible new SDR allocation when they meet on Feb. 12, the sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-chief-warns-of-lost-generation-if-low-income-countries-don-t-get-more-help-101612584217724.html
06-02-2021||World||Joe Biden back in Delaware with moving on his weekend to-do list||On President Joe Biden's weekend to-do list? Moving.Biden flew aboard Air Force One for the first time as president on Friday, but not on a trip to sell his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan or to confer with a US ally.He just went home, to Delaware, to help his wife, Jill, figure out what other “stuff” they need to bring with them when they return to their “other house,” meaning the White House.’It’s a great honor," Biden said of flying aboard Air Force One as president. "But I didn’t think about it, to tell you the truth. I was reading the paper.”He said he went to his home near Wilmington for the weekend "to see my grandchildren and to hang out with Jill to get the rest of the stuff we have to move from our house to the other house.” Biden's son Hunter also turned 51 on Thursday.Biden flew even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that Americans avoid travel because of the coronavirus pandemic.The White House said the trip would be far less risky for Biden, who is at higher risk because he is 78, than the sort of commercial travel that people are being urged to put on hold.“Any president of the United States, Democrat or Republican, obviously takes Air Force One, a private plane, when they travel,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said hours before Biden's inaugural flight.Biden told reporters shortly after landing in Delaware that the plane was much like the one he flew as vice president for eight years, “only it’s much nicer.”Biden has made controlling the pandemic the central focus of the early work of his presidency. His team has repeatedly emphasized that he will model safe behavior for the nation.Any time the president travels, an entourage of support staff, security personnel and media travels with him.The CDC's guidance notes that “travel increases your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19" and that the agency “recommends that you do not travel at this time." But it says people who must travel should first complete their Covid-19 vaccinations, if they're eligible, and wait two weeks after getting the second dose before embarking on travel.Biden got his second dose of the coronavirus vaccine more than three weeks ago.Biden and his aides have been meticulous about how they go about their business as they try to reduce the chances of infection among White House staffers. Mask wearing is mandatory throughout the White House complex, much of the administration is working remotely and the duration and size of meetings has been limited.Biden also has made few appearances outside the White House complex during the first weeks of his presidency — all for official business or to attend church.The trip for Biden, who spent decades in the Senate and eight years as vice president, marked his first time on Air Force One in more than 20 years. He flew to South America with President Bill Clinton in 2000 as Clinton announced $1.3 billion in aid to help Colombia battle drug traffickers.For security reasons, the vice president travels separately from the president and relies on the more modest Air Force Two aircraft for out-of-town travel.For the 25-minute flight from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to the New Castle Air National Guard Base, Biden flew on the smaller C-32 model from the Air Force’s fleet.It is a specially configured version of the Boeing 757-200 commercial intercontinental airliner, compared to the iconic VC-25A, which is a modified Boeing 747.Biden's predecessor, former President Donald Trump, didn't hide his affection for Air Force One, perhaps the greatest perk of the job.But Trump was not a fan of the Kennedy-era blue and white color scheme that is known the world over.

The Taliban were made to commit to only one thing, that they would enter intra-Afghan talks, not that they would agree to peace,” Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani Ambassador to the US, said on Friday during a virtual event “The Afghan Peace Process: Progress or Peril?” organised by the Hudson Institute think-tank.The Trump administration signed the peace deal with Taliban in February last year in Doha. The accord drew up plans for withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgent group. As part of the deal, the US committed to withdraw its 12,000 troops within 14 months. There are currently only 2,500 American troops left in the country.The Taliban committed to prevent other groups, including al Qaeda, from using Afghan soil to recruit, train or fund raise toward activities that threaten the US or its allies.Haqqani said the definition of peace for the Taliban is very different from the US."Taliban’s definition of peace is very different from that of the US or the Afghan government. The Taliban believes that once their Islamic Emirate is restored, peace is restored,” said Haqqani, who currently is Director for South and Central Asia at Hudson Institute.Also read| Donald Trump impeachment trial confronts memories of Capitol siegeThe Afghan government and the people of the country would welcome the predictability and discipline that might come with change of administration in the US, he noted.“When state actors and non-state actors negotiate, usually there is a ceasefire as part of the deal. That hasn't been done in Afghanistan? I don’t understand what reduction in violence is, does it mean 2 people instead of 10 being killed or 10 instead of 20?” he asked.Bill Roggio, a senior fellow and editor of The Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Long War Journal, observed that to understand what Taliban wants one needs to read their statements.“The only acceptable outcome is the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. They have not fought all these years to take a silly ministerial post. What Taliban has been doing in the meantime is hollowing out Afghan civil society. All signs that Taliban is using these talks to run out the clock. It is not going to agree to give up violence,” he said.“The Taliban promised before 9/11 that they will not host Al Qaeda and they lied. Why should we believe them today?” Roggio asked.Javid Ahmad, Afghanistan’s Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and a Senior Fellow (non-resident) at the Atlantic Council, noted that Afghanistan at the end of the day is complicated.Also read| Joe Biden says Donald Trump should not receive intelligence briefingsThe US presence has now effectively become a part of the Afghan power dynamics. Probably remain so for foreseeable future,” he said.“There is a need for clarity in purpose, policy, and approach. We need clarity not just on Afghanistan’s future but also America’s future in Afghanistan. Previous administration drew a moral equivalence between Taliban and Afghan government and so outcome was one big mess,” Ahmad said.Responding to a question, Roggio said that the Taliban survives because of Pakistan.“The Taliban may be small minority, but you only need a fervent minority. They have control in many rural areas. Taliban are still indoctrinating people,” he said.According to Ahmad, Pakistan wants to dictate the talks and in the process bypass the Afghan government.“Pakistan’s main audience has been Washington not Kabul. So difficult to come to terms with them on any bilateral agreement. The terms they are pushing for is a direct say in Afghanistan’s foreign and security policy and so Pakistan has traditionally treated us as a half state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ustaliban-agreement-has-no-element-of-peace-says-haqqani-101612577133421.html
06-02-2021||World||Top diplomats of US, UK, France, Germany hold virtual talks||The top diplomats of Britain, France, Germany and the United States met Friday for the first time in almost three years as the European allies welcome America’s return to center stage in world affairs under President Joe Biden.Britain’s Foreign Office and the US State Department said the foreign ministers of the three European nations and the US secretary of state held virtual talks on topics that included Iran, China, Russia, Myanmar, climate change and the coronavirus pandemic.The last time the top foreign affairs officials from the four countries met as a quartet was in April 2018.The meeting of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian came a day after Biden told US diplomats at the State Department: “America is back. Diplomacy is back.”US State Department spokesman Ned Price said the ministers had “affirmed the centrality of the Transatlantic relationship in dealing with security, climate, economic, health, and other challenges the world faces.” He added that Blinken “underscored the US commitment to coordinated action to overcome global challenges." The statement offered no other details.Biden has turned sharply away from the “America first” policies of his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, on issues such as climate change and Russia. One of Biden's first acts as president was reversing Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the 2015 Paris climate accord.Biden said Thursday that the days of the US “rolling over” to Russian President Vladimir Putin were over. He committed to reversing Trump’s order to withdraw US troops stationed in Germany and ending support for Saudi Arabia’s military offensive in Yemen.Britain, which is heading the G-7 group of industrialized nations this year and is set to host a global climate conference in November, has welcomed the United States’ renewed focus on engaging with its allies around the world.The UK is also seeking new ways to exert influence now that it has left the European Union, such as working with small groups of like-minded countries on major issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-diplomats-of-us-uk-france-germany-hold-virtual-talks-101612573861788.html
06-02-2021||World||Donald Trump impeachment trial confronts memories of Capitol siege||The impeachment trial of Donald Trump is more than an effort to convict the former president of inciting an insurrection. It's a chance for a public accounting and remembrance of the worst attack on the US Capitol in 200 years.In the month since the Jan. 6 siege by a pro-Trump mob, encouraged by his call to “fight like hell” to overturn the election, defenders of the former president say it’s time to move on.Trump is long gone, ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago club, and Democrat Joe Biden is the new president in the White House. With the trial set to begin Tuesday, and a supermajority of senators unlikely to convict him on the single charge, the question arises: Why bother?Yet for many lawmakers who were witnesses, onlookers and survivors of that bloody day, it’s not over.One by one, lawmakers have begun sharing personal accounts of their experiences of that harrowing afternoon. Some were in the Capitol fleeing for safety, while others watched in disbelief from adjacent offices. They tell of hiding behind doors, arming themselves with office supplies and fearing for their lives as the rioters stalked the halls, pursued political leaders and trashed the domed icon of democracy.“I never imagined what was coming,” said Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., recounted in a speech on the House floor.Memory is a powerful tool, and their remembrances, alongside the impeachment proceedings, will preserve a public record of the attack for the Congressional Record. Five people died and more than 100 people have been arrested in a nationwide FBI roundup of alleged ringleaders and participants, a dragnet unlike many in recent times. While that is sufficient for some, assured the perpetrators will be brought to justice, others say the trial will force Congress, and the country, to consider accountability.Todd Shaw, an associate professor at University of South Carolina, said the founders envisioned a check on the presidency and the trial provides a moment that will demarcate whether American democracy makes a course correction and says “things have gone too far” — or not, he said.“We’re in a period where a lot of Americans are very aware of that question,” he said.Defenders of the former president are casting doubt over the legality of the impeachment trial, the rationale for punishing an elected official no longer in office and the political fallout of preventing him from being elected again.Even Republican critics of Trump, who watched in horror as he encouraged a rally mob outside the White House to make its way to the Capitol, have cooled their outrage with the passage of time and as the reality of Trump’s enduring hold on the party takes shape.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was among those leading Trump's charge to challenge Biden’s election, mocked the Senate impeachment case as a “show trial” and waste of time. “It’s time to move on,” he said.But Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a former prosecutor, said a trial can have a lasting effect of informing the public, regardless of the verdict or outcome."A public trial serves a vital purpose," he said. “What Donald Trump mobilized and emboldened and incited is an expression of domestic terrorism that the public needs to see and understand.”Several lawmakers stood before the House late Thursday and shared their remembrances: seeing the crowds gather outside the Capitol grounds and hearing the taunts, screams and glass breaking down the halls.And then “the feeling,” as Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., put it, “of being trapped.”The House and Senate had been tallying the Electoral College vote certifying Biden’s election victory when Trump, who had refused to concede, his supporters to head to the Capitol.Phillips said that, as he heard the screams inside the building, he realized a pencil was about all he had for defense. He thought about moving over to the Republican side of the House chamber “so we could blend in.” He and others believed the rioters would “spare us if they simply mistook us for Republicans.”Then, he said, he realized something — for his colleagues who are not white like he is, “blending in was not an option.”Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said the thousands of personal stories from that day, one “just as valid and important as the other,” need to be told at a time when some are trying to minimize what happened. She herself faced detractors who criticized her account as exaggerated.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked lawmakers to consider compiling their experiences in essays.Pelosi led Democrats in impeaching Trump, the only president twice impeached, and the first in history to face trial after leaving office.“Why bother? Why bother?” Pelosi asked. “Ask our founders why bother. Ask those who wrote the Constitution. Ask Abraham Lincoln.”Pelosi said the House impeachment managers will make their case and “we’ll see if it’s going to be a Senate of courage or cowardice.”Walking into the Capitol, it’s a changed place. Outside, razor wire tops tall fences surrounding an extended perimeter, even blocking off the nation’s bookshelves at the Library of Congress.Inside, National Guards troops armed with long rifles patrol the marbled halls day and night, some stopping to snap photos of the ornate statues and symbols of the nation's history.While the building hums with familiar sights and sounds, the coffee brewing in the basement cafeteria, there is also a new normal. Broken glass remains on some windows, which some want preserved as a reminder. Posters and handwritten notes thanking Capitol Police officers adorn a basement tunnel.Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., said in a speech that the attack against the Capitol was an attack on the constituents the lawmakers represent.“We are their voices here,” he said. “We must not sweep this under the rug.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-confronts-memories-of-capitol-siege-101612572598853.html

But I do think that we should have a minimum wage, stand by itself, $15 an hour," Biden said in an interview with the CBS Evening News.Increasing the minimum wage may run afoul of Senate rules on reconciliation, a tool Democrats plan to use to pass Biden's coronavirus relief bill without Republican support in the closely divided Senate.Biden said he would be prepared to negotiate the wage rise separately and the increase could be phased in."No one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage. And if you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage," Biden said.The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-he-does-not-expect-minimum-wage-hike-to-be-in-covid-19-relief-bill-101612572364588.html
06-02-2021||World||Joe Biden says Donald Trump should not receive intelligence briefings||President Joe Biden said his predecessor, Donald Trump, should not receive the intelligence briefings that are typically given to former presidents because of his “erratic behavior.”“I think not,” Biden said when asked during an interview with CBS News if Trump should still be briefed. “Because of his erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection,” he added, referring to Trump’s supporters who stormed the Capitol last month.Former presidents in the past have been given routine intelligence briefings and access to classified materials. But Biden has faced pressure from Democrats and former national security officials to bar Trump from receiving the briefings because it might raise security risks.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this week the matter was “under review.”Biden said he believes there is “no need” for Trump, whose second impeachment trial gets underway next week, to be made privy to sensitive material or given routine briefings.“What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?” the president said in the interview, which was broadcast on Friday evening.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff last month said Trump should be denied access to classified material during his post-presidency.“There’s no circumstance in which this president should get another intelligence briefing,” Schiff said Jan. 17 during an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I don’t think he can be trusted with it now, and in the future.”Sue Gordon, who served as principal deputy director of national intelligence under Trump, wrote that the former president’s intentions to remain in the political arena, combined with his foreign business entanglements, make his “security profile” as a private citizen “daunting.”“My recommendation, as a 30-plus-year veteran of the intelligence community, is not to provide him any briefings after Jan. 20,” Gordon wrote last month in a Washington Post op-ed. “With this simple act — which is solely the new president’s prerogative — Joe Biden can mitigate one aspect of the potential national security risk posed by Donald Trump, private citizen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-donald-trump-should-not-receive-intelligence-briefings-101612571884116.html

The Open Internet is increasingly under threat around the world. We will continue to advocate to end destructive government-led shutdowns," a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business.Also Read: Former Suu Kyi ally says no betrayal in taking Myanmar junta jobIn a statement, a spokesperson from Facebook said: "Telecom providers in Myanmar have been ordered to permanently block Instagram.

06-02-2021||World||Biden administration expects Saudi Arabia to improve human rights: White House||The United States expects Saudi Arabia to improve its human rights record, including releasing women's rights activists and other political prisoners, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Friday.Pskai's comments underscored US President Joe Biden's intention to make human right a key issue in US-Saudi relations, which he pledged during the 2020 campaign to reassess.Biden on Thursday unveiled a first step in taking a firmer line with the kingdom, announcing an end to US support for offensive operations by the Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen.Psaki side-stepped a question at a White House briefing on whether the administration would impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia for the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.Calling Khashoggi's death a "horrific crime," she reiterated the administration's intention to declassify a US intelligence report on the murder, which the CIA assessed was approved - and possibly ordered - by defacto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The prince denied ordering the murder."We, of course, expect Saudi Arabia to improve its record on human rights," Psaki continued. "That includes releasing political prisoners such as women's rights advocates from Saudi jails."One of the most prominent of those advocates is Loujain al-Hathloul, 31, the leader of a campaign to allow Saudi women to drive, who was arrested in 2018.Riyadh drew international criticism in December when, according to her family, she was sentenced by a court to nearly six years in prison.Psaki said the administration was "encouraged" by the release on Thursday of two dual Saudi-US citizens pending their trials.Bader al-Ibrahim, an epidemiologist and journalist, and Salah al-Haidar, a media commentator whose mother Aziza al-Yousef is a women’s rights campaigner, were arrested in 2019 on terrorism-related charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-expects-saudi-arabia-to-improve-human-rights-white-house-101612567045233.html

06-02-2021||World||Biden administration to survey schools on Covid-19 impact||The Biden administration will soon begin collecting data from thousands of US schools to find out how they have been affected by the pandemic, including how many have returned to in-person instruction, officials said Friday.Led by the Education Department, the effort will collect monthly data from 7,000 schools on a range of topics related to Covid-19. It’s the first federal effort to gather data on the pandemic’s impact on education.President Joe Biden called for the data in a Jan. 21 executive order on school reopening. The Trump administration declined to collect data on the subject, saying it wasn’t the role of the federal government to do so.Chief among its purposes, the data will provide a national look at schools’ operating status, including how many are offering remote learning. It will help answer a simple but previously elusive question: How many schools have reopened?Answering that question is important for state and local officials working to reopen, and it will help measure Biden’s progress on his goal to have most of the nation’s K-8 schools opened within his first 100 days in office.The survey results will also help officials understand and address education disparities that have worsened amid the pandemic, said Ian Rosenblum, an acting assistant secretary of the Education Department.“To do that, we need more information about how students are learning during this pandemic — and we simply don’t have it right now,” he said in a statement.Along with information about schools, the survey will ask how many individual students are being taught online and how many are learning online, along with their attendance rates.It also asks for breakdowns by demographic characteristics including race, socioeconomic status and whether they have disabilities.That could shed further light on disparities that have emerged during the pandemic, including findings that school districts in which the vast majority of students are white have been far more likely to have some level of in-person instruction.Researchers and school officials have been calling on the federal government to gather information on the pandemic’s effect, saying it would provide evidence to guide schools as they navigate outbreaks. Many states collect their own data, and some researchers have attempted national databases, but there has been no federal collection effort.In a letter to Congress this month, a coalition of education groups emphasized the need for new data and urged lawmakers to boost federal funding to the Education Department unit that collects data.“If our nation is to effectively address the unprecedented educational challenges brought about by the pandemic, we will need objective, accurate and timely data to inform policy and decision-making at the local, state, and national levels,” the coalition wrote.The new survey will collect data from 3,500 schools that enroll fourth graders, and 3,500 schools that enroll eight graders. It will be made available to the public on a monthly basis through June, with collections starting later this month.The Education Department says it will be a nationally representative survey, using the existing data collection system used for the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as The Nation’s Report Card.The survey is one part of Biden's wider school reopening plan, which also calls for $130 billion in relief funding for K-12 schools, and expanded virus testing for teachers and students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-survey-schools-on-covid-19-impact-101612566689204.html
06-02-2021||World||Oxford says Covid-19 vaccine with AstraZeneca works against UK variant||AstraZeneca and Oxford University's Covid-19 vaccine has similar efficacy against the British coronavirus variant as it does to the previously circulating variants, the university said on Friday.The variant, first identified in Kent, southern England, is more easily transmissible, prompting many countries to restrict travel to Britain. It also led to a spike in infections that forced a new national lockdown in England last month.That lockdown came as Britain started rolling out the AstraZeneca vaccine. Over 10 million people have received a first dose of either AstraZeneca or Pfizer's shot.Britain had said that it believed the vaccines were effective against variants that are circulating in the UK."Data from our trials of the ChAdOx1 vaccine in the United Kingdom indicate that the vaccine not only protects against the original pandemic virus, but also protects against the novel variant, B.1.1.7, which caused the surge in disease from the end of 2020 across the UK," said Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial.Sarah Gilbert, co-developer of the vaccine, said that, although the vaccine had efficacy against the UK variant, it might need to be adapted for a future variant."We are working with AstraZeneca to optimise the pipeline required for a strain change should one become necessary," Gilbert said.The findings, released in a preprint paper and not peer-reviewed, also detailed recent analysis showing that vaccination with the shot results in a reduction in the duration of shedding and viral load, which may translate into a reduced transmission of the disease, Oxford University said.(Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Michael Holden and Kate Holton)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-says-covid-19-vaccine-with-astrazeneca-works-against-uk-variant-101612566543584.html
06-02-2021||World||Joe Biden heading to Delaware despite CDC's 'avoid travel' suggestion||President Joe Biden was heading back to his home in Delaware on Friday to spend the weekend with his wife and family, even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans forgo travel because of the coronavirus pandemic.The White House officials said the trip by Biden, his first aboard Air Force One as president, is far less risky than the sort of commercial travel that Americans are being urged to avoid.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the key was “ensuring that people don't take steps to make others vulnerable.” She said Biden planned to watch the Super Bowl during his weekend at home but didn't offer further details about how he would spend his time in Delaware. The trip also comes a day after his son Hunter Biden marked his 51st birthday.“Any president of the United States, Democrat or Republican, obviously takes Air Force One, a private plane, when they travel,” Psaki said hours before Biden departed Washington.Biden, who has a home outside Wilmington, Delaware, has made getting the pandemic under control the central focus of the early weeks of his presidency. His team has repeatedly emphasized that the president will model safe behavior for the nation.Any time the president travels, an entourage of support and security personnel and media travel with him.The CDC's guidance notes that “travel increases your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19" and that the agency “recommends that you do not travel at this time."Biden will avoid many of the risks of travel associated with commercial flights or traveling by bus or train. He also got his second dose of the coronavirus vaccine more than three weeks ago.The CDC recommends that individuals who must travel first complete their vaccinations — if they're eligible to receive them — and then wait two weeks after the second dose before departing.Biden and his aides have been meticulous about how they go about their business as they try to reduce the chances of infection among White House staffers. Mask wearing is mandatory throughout the White House complex, much of the administration is working remotely and the duration and size of meetings has been limited.Biden also has made few appearances outside the White House complex during the first weeks of his presidency — all for official business or to attend church.The Friday trip for Biden, who spent decades in the Senate and eight years as vice president, marks his first time on Air Force One in more than 20 years. He flew to Colombia with President Bill Clinton in 2000 as the president announced $1.3 billion in aid to help the South American country battle narcotics traffickers.For his quick flight to New Castle Air National Guard Base, Biden was flying on the smaller C-32 model from the Air Force’s fleet. The aircraft is a specially configured version of the Boeing 757-200 commercial intercontinental airliner, compared to the iconic VC-25A, which is a modified Boeing 747.For security reasons, the vice president is not allowed to travel with the president and instead relies on the more modest Air Force Two for out-of-town travel.Biden's predecessor, former President Donald Trump, didn't hide his affection for Air Force One, perhaps the greatest perk that comes with the job.But Trump was not a fan of the Kennedy-era blue and white color scheme that is known the world over.

But Alphabet Inc-owned Google delayed plans when Canberra moved to make it a legal requirement for Google and Facebook to pay Australian media companies for content, unprecedented anywhere else in the world.The tech firm, still lobbying the Australian government in private meetings, has previously said was the legislation was “unworkable” and would force it to pull out of the country altogether if implemented.With the legislation now before a parliamentary inquiry, the launch of News Showcase in Australia will see it pay seven domestic outlets, including the Canberra Times, to use their content. Financial details of the deals weren’t disclosed.Google said in a statement on Friday it looked forward to striking agreements with more publishers, whose position has been bolstered by Canberra’s push back. reuters||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-opens-paid-for-news-platform-in-australia-101612555279264.html

With this, Nepal will become the second country in the neighbourhood to receive Chinese doses as a grant.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi announced the donation during a telephone conversation with his Nepalese counterpart Pradeep Gyawali on Friday evening, according to a brief readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry.Wang also said China “would accord priority to Nepal in vaccine cooperation” and Gyawali thanked the Chinese government for the “support of Covid-19 vaccine and appreciated China’s stance to make it global public goods," the readout said.On February 1, China donated 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine – which is yet to be fully approved by Chinese health authorities – to Pakistan. The vaccines were promised by Wang during a phone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart esShah Mahmood Qureshi last month.Nepal has already rolled out its inoculation drive, using one million doses of the Covishield vaccine provided by India as a grant on January 21. Nepal is looking for more doses as it plans to inoculate 430,000 people, including health and frontline workers, security personnel, senior citizens in old age homes and prisoners, in the initial stages of its vaccination drive.Also read: 4G Mubarak! tweets Abdullah with mobile internet services being restored in J-KIt also intends to cover six million people in the first phase of the drive and is engaged in talks with India for commercial supplies of more vaccines. Nepal also expects to receive millions of doses from Gavi or the Vaccine Alliance through the COVAX facility.The Nepalese government had requested the supply of Indian-made Covid vaccines last year and the request was reiterated during a recent visit to India by Gyawali. As a close neighbour, Nepal was one of the first countries to receive vaccine grants under the Indian government’s “Neighbourhood First” policy.India also helped train Nepal’s health workers, doctors and professionals for effective management of Covid-19, immunisation and cold chain management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-announces-500-000-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-for-nepal-101612552545161.html

06-02-2021||India||Culture ministry frames heritage bylaws for Puri’s Jagannath Temple||Even as the outrage over demolition of heritage structures around the 11th century Lingaraj Temple continues, the National Monument Authority under the Union Ministry of Culture has come up with heritage bylaws for the Sri Jagannath Temple in Puri, as well as two temples in Bhubaneswar proposing that a 100 metre area around the shrine be declared as ‘prohibited area’ where no constructions either by government or private agencies, can be undertaken.The NMA released the draft bylaws under The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act (AMASR), 2010, for Jagannath Temple and its subsidiary shrines, defining various zones for their conservation and periphery development. As per the draft bylaws, an area of 100 metre (buffer zone) around Jagannath Temple would be declared as ‘prohibited area’, where no new construction of any kind, either by government or private agencies, would be permitted.A further 200 metre in all directions would be ‘regulated area’ where construction is not prohibited, but must be approved by the NMA. While the temple site of 9.7 acre is protected area, the prohibited area is 37.061 acre along Meghanad pacheri (boundary wall) and regulated area is 138.385 acre. Currently, all four sides of the temple are mainly used for commercial and residential purposes. The draft bylaws have been prepared by a heritage expert committee including INTACH.As per the proposed bylaw, height of all buildings in the regulated area of the monument will be restricted to 9 metre while the façade designs should match the monument. Modern materials such as aluminium cladding, glass bricks, and any other synthetic tiles or materials will not be permitted for exterior finishes.The exterior colour must be of a neutral tone in harmony with the monuments. French doors and large glass façades along the front street or along staircase shafts will not be permitted. LED or digital signs, plastic fibre glass or any other highly reflective synthetic material would not be used for signage in the heritage area. Banners would not be permitted, but for special events/fair etc. it may not be put up for more than 3 days. No advertisements in the form of hoardings, bills within the heritage zone will be permitted.Signages should be placed in such a way that they do not block the view of any heritage structure or monument and are oriented towards a pedestrian. Hawkers and vendors may not be allowed on the periphery of the monument.Similar heritage bylaws have been drafted for two temples in Bhubaneswar – the 13th century Vaishnava temple of Ananta Basudev and Shiva temple of Brahmeswar, both in the Ekamra Kshetra heritage site. The NMA released the draft bylaws on January 18 this year and has invited objections and suggestions on them till February 18.The proposed heritage bylaw for Jagannath Temple has come about a year and half after the state government demolished several historic monuments around the structure in the name of aesthetic development of the area around the temple. Since August 2019, the state government has razed Languli Mutt, Emar Mutt, a 900-year-old monastery, Mangu Mutt and Bada Akhada Mutt, a 600-year-old monastery triggering howls of protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/culture-ministry-frames-heritage-bylaws-for-puri-s-jagannath-temple-101612634847129.html

There is a possibility that more officers are involved in the scandal as CBI investigations are monitored at various levels and documents are usually kept in respective branches. It is to be seen how Singh was leaking the documents without anyone’s knowledge,” a CBI officer, who didn’t want to be named, had told HT last month.The CBI is investigating the magnitude of the racket, as it could be much bigger considering the large number of bank fraud cases under investigation.In the last two years alone, bank fraud cases worth ₹90,000 crore have been registered by the agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-suspends-two-cbi-dsps-who-ran-bribe-for-relief-racket-in-agency-101612634968073.html
06-02-2021||India||Medical tourism to India on the up as Covid impact ebbs||New Delhi Twenty-one end-stage kidney, liver and heart patients from Myanmar arrived at New Delhi’s Apollo Hospital on Friday in a chartered flight arranged by the hospital, as medical tourism that was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic has started picking up again.Most of these patients are lined up to undergo organ transplants, and had been waiting for months for travel restrictions due to the pandemic to ease as transplant surgeries are not widely done in their country.“With initial lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed worldwide due to Covid-19, the condition of these patients had deteriorated to such an extent that a transplant was the only way out. These patients were chronic cases of kidney, liver and cardiovascular diseases and have been waiting for organ transplants for over six months now,” the hospital said in a statement.“Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals along with the Indian embassy has arranged for a special chartered flight to get these patients to India for immediate kidney/liver transplants and expedite treatment for patients requiring attention for cardiovascular ailments,” it added.The ministry of external affairs (MEA), government of India, did not officially comment on the arrival of these patients; however, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that special permission was given for airlifting the 21 ill persons on humanitarian grounds.Medical tourism in India had been steadily growing over the past few years. The government data for 2019 and 2018 showed at least 6% of the overall tourist flow to India was of people arriving for treatment. Foreign tourist arrivals for medical reasons in 2019 were 697,453 — 6.4% of the total; for 2018, the number was 644,036, 6.1% of the total tourist inflow.While the ministry of tourism is yet to make public data on international patients who arrived for treatment to India in 2020, most hospitals that had 10-15% of their patient rush from overseas said they did not see the usual rush of international patients last year because of the pandemic.“The percentage of international patients dropped substantially last year; it is picking up this year but very gradually. The normal rush is still not there. In our hospital we would see about 10-15% foreign patients annually, which is now as low as 2-3%, but patients have started coming in,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, Institute of Critical Care & Anesthesiology, Medanta hospital.Also, patients who travel to India for treatment currently are largely those needing critical care.“These are all patients suffering from chronic conditions that can be life-threatening such as organ failure, cancers or brain tumor. For the initial few months there were absolutely no patients from the overseas. By July critical patients started trickling in. Travel for elective procedures such as putting orthpaedic implants, etc, however, has vanished completely,” said Dr Sibal.Dr Mehta says, “Also, no patients are coming from countries that are called bubble safe such as the UK or the US. Most patients are from Asian or African countries. It will take some time before things actually get back to normal. After all, not everyone can afford to charter a flight.” Apollo Hospital has an information centre at Yangon, Myanmar, and on the request of patients, a special flight was arranged to fly them to India. “The Indian mission in Myanmar was of great help in transporting these patients. They had been waiting for a while, some even for over six months, to get treated. These are all critically ill patients who were on regular follow-up but couldn’t travel for treatment. We tried to treat them optimally through virtual consultations, but now they needed surgery,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-tourism-to-india-on-the-up-as-covid-impact-ebbs-101612634859407.html

Officials of the Indore Central Jail, where Faruqui has been lodged for at least a month, said the 32-year-old was not released as they had not received an order from the Prayagraj court, which had also issued a production warrant against the comedian for allegedly offending religious feelings through his jokes. The top court had also restrained UP police from arresting him. “Faruqui was not released from Indore Central Jail as the jail administration didn’t receive any order from the Prayagraj trial court for staying the production warrant,” said LKS Bhadoriya, additional superintendent, Indore central Jail. Faruqui’s advocate Anshuman Srivastava said, “The Supreme Court certified copy has not been uploaded yet so the jail authorities didn’t receive the order. We have approached the district court in Indore and also the trial court in Prayagraj. ”Faruqui’s cousin Zaid Pathan, who reached Indore on Saturday morning, said the jail authorities were not giving them proper answers. “We have been waiting here since morning but the jail administration is not giving any satisfactory answer. Even after the apex court granted him bail, the authorities are not ready to free him,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/munawar-release-halted-as-jail-doesn-t-get-order-101612634799343.html
06-02-2021||India||Relief, anger as Valley gets back 4G net after 18 months||Srinagar: The residents of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday expressed relief over the restoration of high-speed mobile internet services in the region but maintained that it wasn’t a cause of celebration as they deserved an apology from authorities for denying them, what they called “their basic right”, for 18 months. Authorities suspended 4G mobile internet services in J&K on August 4, 2019, a day before the central government nullified the Constitution’s Article 370, which accorded special privileges to the region, and bifurcated it into two UTs — J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. The government also suspended landline and internet services, fearing widespread protests in the restive region. The UT has moved several steps towards normalcy since then, with the gradual restoration of communication lines.In an order issued on Saturday, Shaleen Kabra, principal secretary (home), ordered restoration of 4 services in the region and directed inspectors general of police in Jammu and Kashmir divisions to ensure compliance and “closely monitor the impact of lifting of restrictions”. Tariq Ahmad, a 19-year-old college student from Srinagar, welcomed the move but said it was too little too late. “It is alright that they have restored the internet because it was the need of the hour but I don’t think there is any excitement as people are aware that they have lost a lot in these one and a half years. We lost our dignity, our statehood and most importantly our special status,” he said. Political analyst and author, Gowhar Geelani, said the authorities had not done them any favour by restoring 4G mobile services. “After having snatched your right to high-speed internet service for 18-long months, restoring internet is not something to celebrate about. It is actually a moment to reflect how compensation can be sought from the cellular companies who took money for the services they have failed to provide for so long,” he said.In August 2020, high-speed internet was restored in two districts of J&K — Ganderbal and Udhampur districts — based on the parameters laid down by the special committee, which recommended that the areas, where high-speed services are allowed, should have low intensity of terrorist activities. Anuradha Bhasin, the executive editor of a local daily, said she didn’t see any reason to thank the government for the move. “I actually see some going out of their way to thank govt [government] functionaries for 4G restoration. They’re not offering us charity. We should be asking for compensation for our deprivation and losses,” she said in a tweet.“It is better late than never. The government has realised how much losses our economy has suffered. This move will give a boost to the economic recovery now,” president, Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Sheikh Aashiq told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relief-anger-as-valley-gets-back-4g-net-after-18-months-101612634739975.html
06-02-2021||India||SC judge hails Modi as ‘most loved Prime Minister’||Supreme Court judge MR Shah on Saturday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the “most popular, loved, vibrant and visionary leader” at a virtual public function to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Gujarat high court.“I am glad and feel proud and privileged to participate in this important function of release of commemorative stamp of Gujarat HC on completion of 60 years and that too by our most popular, loved, vibrant and visionary leader, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendrabhai Modi,” said justice Shah at the beginning of the function, which had the Prime Minister as its chief guest.As the sitting Supreme Court judge was about to conclude his address, justice Shah, who hails from Gujarat, once again referred to Modi as the “most loved Prime Minister” at the virtual event, which also had Gujarat high court chief justice Vikram Nath, Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta in attendance.The remarks by justice Shah left some former judges of the Supreme Court divided on whether it was proper for a sitting judge of a constitutional court to express himself in such a manner at a public function. Former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha told HT that such comments by a Supreme Court judge at a public event should be avoided. “These things are absolutely avoidable. As a famous quote goes, restraint is the better part of valour,” he said.Justice Lodha added that he belonged to a different school of thought and practised restraint in his personal as well as judicial life, which was also bound by a code of conduct.Another former judge of the top court, justice Gopala Gowda said that he was “astonished” to see a sitting apex court judge showering praise on the PM when the government was the biggest litigant in the SC and had the highest stakes in policy matters.“Releasing of a commemorative stamp by the PM is a most welcome thing. But for a sitting Supreme Court judge, who is a constitutional functionary, to compliment the Prime Minister with such adjectives is unwarranted and uncalled for. The tremendous confidence of people in the judiciary will be eroded if Supreme Court judges start praising executives in this fashion,” he said.Justice Gowda said that when a judge of a constitutional court speaks, they must remember that the credibility of the institution is at stake and people’s faith must not be shaken by their remarks.However, justice BP Singh, another retired judge of the top court, did not find justice Shah’s remarks inappropriate. “He has not commented on any case in the Supreme Court. These could be his (justice Shah’s) personal views and he may genuinely feel like that for the Prime Minister. Why should it create any doubt? I don’t think it should become an issue,” said justice Singh. Last year, Supreme Court judge justice Arun Mishra (now retired) courted controversy by saying that “PM Modi was a versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally”. The Supreme Court Bar Association had passed a resolution criticising justice Mishra’s comments as “reflecting poorly on judicial independence”.A Code of Conduct for the Supreme Court and high court judges called ‘Re-instatement of Values in Judicial Life’, was resolved in the chief justices’ conference of 1999. The 15-point code primarily recommends that a serving judge maintain an air of “aloofness” in their official and personal life.Point number 6 of the Code of Conduct lays down that a judge should practise a degree of aloofness consistent with the dignity of their office.

Senior Telugu Desam Party legislator from Visakhapatnam (North) Ganta Srinivasa Rao resigned from his assembly membership in the afternoon in protest against the proposed privatisation of the steel plant.In a late evening letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jagan said the decision to privatise the RINL has created a lot of concern among the people of the state. He said the RINL, the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, was the largest public sector industrial unit in the state creating employment opportunities for nearly 20000 people directly and many other indirect employment opportunities.He said the steel plant was established after a decade-long agitation in which 32 people laid down their lives. The plant had performed well between 2002 to 2015 earning profits, making a turnaround after it was referred to the BIFR as a sick company. “The company has around 19700 acres of land currently and the valuation of these lands alone could exceed one lakh crore rupees due to the location of the plant in the urban area,” he pointed out.The chief minister further said the RINL with a production capacity of 7.3 million tonnes, had taken up plant modernisation and capacity expansion recently which led to the plant borrowing from banks to take up the expansion. Due to a slump in the steel market, the company had been making losses since 2015 and was finding it difficult to service the debt.One of the major structural issues that also led to high cost of production is the absence of a captive mine thereby affecting the profitability. The plant will again become a profitable venture given some support from the Centre such as allotting captive iron ore mines to bring down the input costs, swapping high-cost debt with low-cost debt, and converting debt into equity through equity conversion, Jagan said.“I assure you that the state government will closely work with the Centre in turning around the company and together, we can revive the plant for unlocking greater value to the society,” he requested the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-writes-to-pm-modi-requests-him-to-drop-plan-to-privatise-vizag-steel-101612633376783.html

Sharing an interesting anecdote, Agarwal said during last year's locust attack, PM Modi called all over the world to find a solution. He had insisted on airlifting machines from the UK so that the deliveries can be made first, Agarwal recounted.He had sleepless nights & called all over the world to find a solution. He insisted on airlifting the machines so that the deliveries of the machines from UK could be fast-tracked. He did not rest till a solution was found."Our PM Shri @narendramodi has greatest priority for the farmers and is always thinking about how he can help them. I remember an incident during the locust attack last year," Vedanta chairman wrote on Twitter."He had sleepless nights & called all over the world to find a solution. He insisted on airlifting the machines so that the deliveries of the machines from UK could be fast-tracked. He did not rest till a solution was found," he added.Northern and northwestern states of India witnessed a massive locust attack in March 2020. The ministry of agriculture signed a contract with the UK's Micron to modify two Mi-17 helicopters for spraying atomised pesticide which can arrest locust breeding. But the firm said it would be able to supply only from September 2020 because of Covid-19. Later, the Indian Air Force undertook the task of indigenously designing and developing an airborne locust control system for Mi-17 helicopters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-did-not-rest-till-solution-was-found-vedanta-resources-chairman-101612632608558.html

After an independent candidate extended his support to the party, it also has a majority in Reasi district where it had got seven seats on its own.The election to elect the chairperson and vice chairperson for DDC Jammu and Kathua in the first phase saw BJP leaders -- Bharat Bhushan (chairman) and Suraj Singh (vice chairman) (Jammu) and Col (Retd) Mann Singh (chairman) and Raghunandan Singh (vice chairman) (Kathua) -- getting elected unopposed.“We will live to the expectations of the people and will try our best to speed up the development of our district,” Bhushan, who was elected chairman of the DDC Jammu, told reporters outside the BJP headquarters here after his supporters took out a victory march in the city.He said his party has expressed faith in him and he will live to the expectations and would make all out efforts to address the issues of the public like strengthening the water supply network and road connectivity.“All round development is our priority,” he said.Three districts in the valley -- Srinagar, Shopian and Kulgam -- also elected their DDC chairpersons and vice chairpersons in the first phase.While J-K Apni party led by former finance minister Altaf Bukhari has won the elections to the post of chairperson of Srinagar and Shopian, the PAGD which among others include the National Conference and the PDP won Kulgam district.The PAGD has got a clear majority in six districts and has also got an edge in five other districts as it is just short of one or two seats for the majority.Independent candidates have won 50 seats and their support will be crucial for parties eyeing for DDC chairmen and vice chairmen posts in a number of districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-elected-ddc-chairmen-in-jammu-kathua-districts-101612632546741.html
06-02-2021||India||Uttarakhand forest department to buy 'smart sticks' for patrolling jungles||The Uttarakhand forest department has decided to buy “smart sticks” from New Delhi to do “smart” patrolling in the jungles of the state. These especially designed smart sticks have many safety and other useful features, which will help the department staff in day and night patrolling.Kundan Kumar, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Haldwani said, “Forest rangers including foresters and forest guards’ patrol through the dense forests while putting their life at risk with simple bamboo sticks. They frequently encounter dangerous wild animals like elephants, tigers, leopards and bear as well as forest smugglers and in many cases these encounters turn lethal.”“So we have decided to equip our staff with these sticks especially to tackle such situations. Hence, we are purchasing ‘smart sticks’ for patrolling,” said Kumar.He informed that the smart sticks have been specially designed for forest patrolling. They have stun guns along with three zone lighting, a panic button, in-built rechargeable battery and are equipped with basic wilderness survival kit and other features.“The stun gun in it can shock even the strongest of wild animal momentarily, leaving them confused and giving sufficient time to the staff to escape or call for help. This shock will only temporarily immobilize the animal and will not cause any permanent damage,” he said.Built with a robust aluminium body, the stick's design makes it easy to carry it even for longer hours. Also, its strong build makes it reliable and fit for rough use. Its three zone lighting includes spot light, throbbing light and pathway light, to help staff to patrol at night.“The panic button of the smart stick will help repel the wild animal in case of a dangerous encounter. When the staff presses the panic button, it will trigger a loud hooter and bright flash light to keep the wild animal away. Apart from this, the basic wilderness survival kit in it offers bandage, cotton box, antiseptic and rope,” said Kumar.“We have ordered four smart sticks which will reach us by next week. These will be used in the Nandhaur, Danda and Chakata forest ranges. If this is successful then all the patrolling staff in the division will be given smart sticks for patrolling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-forest-department-to-buy-smart-sticks-for-patrolling-jungles-101612631071327.html

But today's nationwide 'chakka jam' once again proved that farmers across the country are united against these laws.

Ayurveda practitioners are not as well trained as MBBS doctors, who go on to complete their post-graduation before performing surgeries.

The minister said some poor countries are being supplied the vaccine on a grant basis while some nations wanted it on par with the price that the Indian Government pays to the vaccine makers. Some countries have directcontractswith the Indian vaccine producing companies and have negotiated commercially, he said. The Centre has already given the nod for two Covid-19 vaccines-- Covaxin of city-based Bharat Biotech and Covishield of Oxford, being manufactured by Serum Institute of India in Pune, which are being administered to frontline workers from January 16, under Emergency Use Authorisation. Drug maker Dr Reddys recently said it will approach the Drug Regulator for the EUA for Russian vaccine Sputnik V in March. Jaishankar said Prime Minister Narendra Modis idea was to establish the country as the "Pharmacy of the World", taking advantage of the domestic capabilities and the way India emerged as IT leader during the Y2K issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-countries-in-queue-for-made-in-india-vaccine-says-s-jaishankar-101612622085552.html

Stating that he was tendering his resignation from the MLA’s post as a protest against the privatisation of RINL, he requested the speaker to accept it immediately.On Wednesday, the secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) Tuhin Kanta Pandey tweeted that the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA), in its meeting on January 27, had cleared 100 per cent strategic disinvestment in RINL by completely privatising it.Within hours, Rao, who represents Visakhapatnam (north) assembly constituency, reacted strongly on the social media platform, opposing the privatisation of Vizag Steel, which has sentimental value for the four crore Telugu people.He announced that he would soon form a non-political joint action committee to launch a massive agitation demanding that the Centre revoke its decision to privatise the steel plant.Stating that he would fight tooth and nail to see that the steel plant did not go into the hands of private parties, the TDP leader demanded that all the MLAs and MPs of the state, cutting across the party lines, also resign from their posts to fight for the steel plant.TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said it was the responsibility of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to save the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. He accused the chief minister of sealing the mouths of his party MPs to prevent them from speaking against the privatisation of steel plant.Naidu recalled that Visakhapatnam Steel Plant was established after a prolonged battle by the Telugus. “Over 30 people laid down their lives for this cause. Amaravati resident Amrita Rao's fast-unto-death had eventually won the steel plant back for AP in that landmark agitation. Lakhs of AP people had taken part in the steel plant agitation for several years,” he said.Terming Visakha Steel as an everlasting right of Andhras, the TDP leader suspected that Jagan Reddy may be trying to take over the steel plant through backdoor means at a cheaper rate.Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur, talking to the media in Hyderabad, defended the Centre’s decision to privatise the Vizag Steel Plant. “The decision was taken on the recommendations of NITI-Aayog. The government won’t disinvest in every public sector undertaking, but only in loss-making PSUs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ganta-srinivasa-rao-quits-as-mla-in-protest-against-privatisation-of-vizag-steel-101612619813084.html

The incident took place at 3.44pm on Friday at Panvel station in Navi Mumbai.The 28-second clip — which went viral on social media — showed the man was trying to board the running train while a fellow passenger was helping him to get inside the compartment. However, the man lost his balance and was about to fall under the train when the RPF personnel came and pulled him back on time.Taking to Twitter, the RPF warned to never attempt to board a running train with the hashtags #SafetyFirst and #JaanHaiTohJahaanHai.Union railways minister Piyush Goyal too tweeted the video and said that attempting to climb on a moving train can be fatal and urged people to follow all rules and be safe.“The vigilance and quick action of RPF security personnel in Panvel, Mumbai saved a disabled passenger from getting hit by a train. Attempting to climb on a moving train can prove fatal for you. Your life is priceless, I urge you to follow the rules, and be safe,” Goyal’s tweet, roughly translated from Hindi, read.The Railway Protection Force was created by the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957. It falls under the authority of the Union railways ministry.

It has already attached properties close to worth ₹8 crore belonging to Watali so far.In its charge sheet in 2018, the NIA had claimed that a former Pakistani prime minister (without naming) wrote a letter to Watali, which was recovered from the latter’s residence during the raids. Not just that, it said that the NIA had recovered from his place a list of ISI officials.Both the NIA and the ED have claimed in their official court documents, reviewed by HT, that Hafiz Saeed, another UN listed terrorist, Syed Salahuddin (Hizbul Mujahideen chief), Pakistan and its agencies provided funds via Dubai route by using bogus transactions carried out in several companies for terror activities in J-K.Subsequently, funds came through legitimate transfers from bank accounts of certain individuals, hawala, LoC (Line of Control) barter trade by under-invoicing of goods and bogus companies floated abroad, it stated.The NIA has said, “a threadbare scrutiny and analysis of documents and digital devices seized by it established that the Hurriyat leaders, terrorists and stone-pelters were carrying out terrorist attacks, orchestrating violence, stone pelting and other subversive and secessionist activities in the state as part of a well-planned criminal conspiracy hatched with the active support, connivance and funding from terrorist organisations based in Pakistan and its agencies to achieve their objective of secession of the state of Jammu and Kashmir by waging war against the Government of India”.“The secessionist leaders belonging to All Parties Hurriyat Conference have established a network of cadres throughout Kashmir valley who incite the youth to attack all symbols of Indian sovereignty, especially Indian security forces. Acting under the overall guidance of and instructions from Hafiz Saeed and Salahuddin and their ‘Pakistani handlers’, the separatists form strategies and action plans to launch violent protests and communicate the same to the masses in the form of ‘protest calendars’, released through newspapers, social media and religious leaders, creating an “atmosphere of terror and fear in J-K,” it added.HT could not locate the legal representatives of Watali and other accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-issues-non-bailable-warrant-against-hafiz-saeed-for-money-laundering-101612618120278.html
06-02-2021||India||No favour: J-K people demand compensation, apology after 4G internet restoration||By Friday midnight, many people in Jammu and Kashmir were glued to their mobile sets as the 4G internet was slowly restored by the authorities. Although there were usual teething problems with the restoration on Saturday as well, many youngsters were eager to experience unhindered streaming of videos and digital data after 18 months.While people were relieved over the restoration of what has become an important part of modern-day life, many in the region demanded apologies and compensation from the government and cellular companies for denying their right for so long.“It is alright that they have restored the internet because it was the need of the hour but I don’t think there isn't any excitement as people are aware that they have lost a lot in these one and a half years. We lost our dignity, our statehood and most importantly, our special status,” said Tariq Ahmad, 19, a college student of Srinagar.Also read: HT Interview - IAF chief RKS Bhadauria says indigenisation key to military mightAuthorities suspended 4G mobile internet services on August 4, 2019, a day before the central government abrogated Article 370, which accorded special privileges to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated it into two Union territories — J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. The government also imposed restrictions on movement of people, suspended landline and mobile calling services, fearing widespread protests in the restive region.While the restrictions were lifted after a few months, the postpaid mobile services buzzed back to life on October 14, 2019. Short messaging service (SMS) on all mobile phones and broadband internet services in government-run hospitals were restored on January 1, 2020.Political analyst and author, Gowhar Geelani said that the restoration of 4G was ‘no favour’. “After having snatched your right to high-speed Internet service for 18-long months (550+ days)—besides suspending all civil liberties— restoring internet (allegedly) is not something to celebrate about. It is actually a moment to reflect how compensation can be sought from the cellular companies who took money for the services they have failed to provide for so long,” he said.Habeel Iqbal, lawyer from south Kashmir’s Shopian district, said, the authorities should redress the wrong done due to ban on internet. “Kashmir demands ‘reparation’ which in legal terms is the process and result of remedying the damage or harm caused by an unlawful act. There are five forms of reparations which includes compensation as well as a guarantee that this should not be repeated,” he said.Senior journalist Riyaz Masroor said that a sincere apology was due while restoring 4G in Kashmir. “Fundamental right shouldn’t be billed as an incentive or concession,” he Twitted.The Jammu and Kashmir administration restored low-speed (2G) mobile internet and fixed-line connectivity in all districts with access to just a whitelist of around 301 websites in January 2020 following Supreme Court’s January 10 directive to review the ban on internet services in the UT every week. The move came after a petition by executive editor of a local daily, Anuradha Bhasin in August 2019.Bhasin had said that the government was not offering people charity. “I actually see some going out of their way to thank govt functionaries for 4G restoration. They're not offering us charity. We should be asking for compensation for our deprivation and losses,” she said in a tweet.“Why do I have this uncanny feeling that this 4G restoration is less about J&K people and more about international image due to farmer's protest,” she said.In August 2020, high-speed (4G) internet was restored in two districts of J&K — Ganderbal and Udhampur — based on the parameters laid down by a special committee after the central government told the Supreme Court that restrictions on high-speed mobile internet services will be relaxed in one district each of Jammu and Kashmir divisions of the UT after August 15 on a trial basis.The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by Foundation for Media Professionals, a non-government organisation, last June, seeking the initiation of contempt proceedings against the Centre and J-K administration for the failure to comply with the top court’s May 11 directions to review restrictions on mobile internet speed in the Union territory.Guftar Ahmad, a political activist from Jammu division who works for the welfare of tribals and nomads, said that after 4G restoration, now the government should also restore Article 370. “After creating history of 18 months shutdown Govt has restored 4g Internet in J&K. Last time on 4 August 2019 J&K accessed high-speed Internet. In last 18 months economy of J&K witnessed massive damage.GOI should also restore Special status of J&K, Article 370. #Kashmir #Internet,” he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-favour-j-k-people-demand-compensation-apology-after-4g-internet-restoration-101612615529425.html

Wipe out the traitors who have sold the emotions of Midnapore to the bosses in Delhi,” Banerjee said, while sharpening his attack against Adhikari.In May 2019, the bust of Vidyasagar, a 19th-century educationist and social reformer was vandalised in Kolkata during a Lok Sabha campaign rally led by Amit Shah. It had become a raging issue in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Vidyasagar was born in Midnapore district. The BJP had, however, refuted the charges.“The TMC will get more than 250 seats and come to power for the third time. You vote for the TMC and I am taking the responsibility to make them (BJP) politically bankrupt within three months of winning the elections,” he said.Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had announced a few days ago that she would contest the crucial assembly polls from Nandigram in East Midnapore. A day after that Adhikari had challenged the TMC chief that she would lose by 50,000 votes.On Saturday, Abhishek Banerjee in a counter challenge to Adhikari said: “Suvendu Adhikari will lose by 50,000 votes if he contests from any seat of Midnapore. East Midnapore will give Bengal its next chief minister.”East Midnapore district has often been said to be a stronghold of the Adhikari family. The district’s Kanthi and Tamluk Lok Sabha seats are represented by Suvendu’s father Sisir Adhikari and his elder brother Dibyendu Adhikari. Both have distanced themselves from the party. Suvendu and his brother Soumendu have already joined the BJP.“Go and tell your father that I am standing within five kilometres from your house. Do whatever you can. Do you have the guts? I am challenging you on your home turf. I have come today and in the next two months I will be here multiple times,” he added, as the crowd, comprising a few thousand people, cheered and applauded.The BJP leadership has been frequently attacking Abhishek Banerjee referring to him as Bhaipo (nephew).“He (Adhikari) is suffering from nephew-terror. Everywhere he sees nephew and speaks about nephew during most of his speeches. And now they are targeting my wife,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-s-nephew-abhishek-challenges-suvendu-adhikari-on-latter-s-home-turf-101612612897818.html

Many state and national highways were blocked, except in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as decided earlier. Security was stepped up in Delhi, Haryana so that a rerun of what happened on Republic Day does not take place. The symbolic protest ended with Bharatiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait saying that the protests will continue until the demands are met. He said that the government has "time" till October to repeal the laws, implying that the protesters are planning to camp t Delhi borders till October.Here is what happened in the 3-hour chakka jam:> Before 'chakka jam' began, the entry and exit facilities of 10 Delhi Metro stations were closed. They remained closed for several hours until 'chakka jam' ended around 3pm. After that, the gates were opened.> The blockade was not observed inside the Capital. Highways leading to Delhi were also free from blockade so that farmers can come to the protest sites.

Marla, a traditional unit of area used in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, is considered as equal to 272.25 square feet or 25.2929 square metres.However, the owner, Haji Lal Muhammad, said he would demand ₹25 crore from the provincial government for the property as and when approached by the Peshawar administration.Muhammad said he had purchased the property in 2005 for ₹51 lakh after completing all formalities required for transfer of the land and possesses all the documents of the house.He said it is unjust on part of the government to fix the rate at ₹80.56 lakh for the property after 16 years.The property is very expensive in Mohallah Khudadad qissa Khwani bazar where the rate of one Marla land is above ₹5 crore, he said, adding that he would demand ₹25 crore through his lawyer from the authorities for the house."How can a four marla property be sold in the said area for ₹80 lakh?" he asked.Earlier, the owner of the ancestral house of Bollywood actor Raj Kapoor demanded ₹200 crore for the six marla (151.75 square metre) property in Peshawar. The government had fixed the rate of the property at ₹1.50 crore.Raj Kapoor's ancestral home, known as Kapoor Haveli, is situated in the fabled Qissa Khwani Bazar. It was built between 1918 and 1922 by the legendary actor's grandfather Dewan Basheswarnath Kapoor.Raj Kapoor and his uncle Trilok Kapoor were born here. The building, which is in shambles, has been declared a national heritage by the provincial government.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister's special assistant on information Kamran Bangash said last month that he is hopeful that the provincial government would reach an amicable settlement with the owners of both the buildings for their purchase to convert them into archaeological museums as both structures have already been declared as national heritage buildings.In January, the provincial government approved the release of ₹2.35 crore to purchase the ancestral houses of the two legendary actors located in the heart of this city.The owners of the two buildings have made several attempts in the past to demolish them for constructing commercial plazas in view of their prime location but all such moves were stopped as the archaeology department wanted to preserve them, keeping in view their historic importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/owner-of-actor-dilip-kumar-s-ancestral-house-in-pakistan-refuses-to-sell-it-101612612113383.html

06-02-2021||India||Centre’s notification on eco-sensitive zone triggers protests in Wayanad||The Union Environment Ministry’s draft notification on an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) in Wayanad (north Kerala) which runs around the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary has triggered a fresh round of protest with the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) calling a shutdown on Monday in the district.People living in fringe areas of the forest say many human settlements will come under the zone and the new announcement will cripple their lives. Workers of the ruling Left Democratic Front and UDF have burnt copies of the draft notification and staged demonstrations in the district on Friday. The Diocese of Sultan Bathery also threatened to hit the streets—since a majority of people living in the fringe areas are Christians.Congress leaders said they had informed who represents the parliamentary constituency, about the simmering unrest. With assembly elections just two months away, the issue has given enough fodder to parties and they are busy chalking out their strategies to exploit the situation.According to the draft notification published by the ministry last week, the ESZ will cover an area of 118.59 km which includes 8.89 km of the Tirunelly reserve forest of north Wayanad and 17.67 km of Chedelaythu range in south Wayanad. Rich in biodiversity, the 344 sq km Wayanad wildlife sanctuary is a favourite habitat of elephants and tigers. Green activists have been questioning the fast depleting canopy of Wayanad, also a favourite get-away. Last month a tourist who was staying in a tent put up by a resort inside the forest was trampled by an elephant.“If the notification is approved at least 30 per cent of Wayanad’s total area will come under the ESZ. Where will people go? Thousands of people will be displaced. We need forests but at the same time people should also be allowed to live,” said district Congress leader N D Appachan. He said the state government’s indifferent attitude led to the notification. But the government has denied this.State forest minister K Raju, who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19, said the government would study the latest notification in detail and there is no need of any apprehension now. Last year the government had asked the Union Environment Ministry to amend ESZ provisions while fixing buffer zones around sanctuaries and excluding human habitat.Wayanad district collector Adeela Abdullah also said it was only a draft and the final notification will be issued after several rounds of discussions and revisions. But green activists have welcomed the notification. “It will help curtail human incursions into wildlife habitat and lessen man-animal conflict and preserve endemic flora and fauna,” said Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti, a prominent group of environmentalists and nature lovers.According to the Union Environment Ministry, the draft will be taken up for consideration after 60 days and the public can send their comments and suggestions during this period to the secretary of the ministry. The state had witnessed violent protest in 2012 against two expert committee reports, Gadgil and Kasturirangan, aimed at protecting the fragile ecology of the Western Ghats.In Kerala, the Catholic Church was in the forefront of the agitation because a majority of the ecologically sensitive areas come under the Christian belt. When the country was facing acute food shortage after independence, Christian settlers were encouraged to move to forest areas under the ‘Grow more food campaign’. Now the church fears that believers would be evicted in the name of ecology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-notification-on-eco-sensitive-zone-triggers-protests-in-wayanad-101612608816004.html

The political parties who have been rejected by the people or who apprehend of being rendered useless in future, they are making it an issue and are spreading confusion like they had with the citizenship law amendment."He said The central government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is committed to the welfare of farmers and doubling their income.On the Union Budget for 2021-22, Shekhawat said, "The budget was presented from the point of view of making the country self-reliant. And whenever the history of 'aatmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India) will be written, this budget will prove to be a milestone. The budget was presented to transform adversity to opportunity."The Union minister said that in the budget, the Centre has launched the Jal Jeevan Mission for urban areas, and Uttar Pradesh will gain the most from it.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-people-are-spreading-confusion-among-farmers-about-msp-shekhawat-101612607469427.html

Out of 20 crore total tests the country has conducted 7,40,794 tests in the past 24 hours, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare informed.Progressive countrywide expansion in testing infrastructure has played a crucial role in the steep rise of testing numbers, an official statement by the ministry said."With 2,369 testing labs in the country including 1,214 government laboratories and 1,155 private laboratories, the daily testing capacity has got a substantial boost. The cumulative positivity rate is also declining and presently pegged at 5.39 per cent," it said.High level of comprehensive testing on a sustained basis has also resulted in bringing down the national positivity rate. The higher daily testing combined with low daily cases have resulted in low positivity rate.However, the country's total active caseload continued to follow a consistent downward slope. It has dropped to less than 1.5 lakh (1,48,590) today and is the lowest in eight months.The present active caseload now consists of just 1.37 per cent of India's total positive cases. The country has seen less than 100 fatalities (95) in the past 24 hours.A total number of vaccinated beneficiaries surpassed 54 lakhs (54,16,849) under the countrywide Covid-19 vaccination exercise, as per today's record till 8 am.The number of beneficiaries being vaccinated every day has shown a consistent and progressive increase.The ministry said India is the fastest country to reach the five million mark in Covid-19 vaccination.

The AKTU had asked technical institutes to submit ideas and technical solutions to help boost ‘one district one product’ project. The university received 157 entries from different institutes. Vaishya also sent his and it easily made it to the top six.“I felt jaggery producers don’t get the right price and are left with little choice, have to sell for one-fourth (of the price),” said Vaishya.The app could expand their market and bring the producers and big buyers together at one place, he said. “They can easily market their produce, something they haven’t been able to do and get better prices that they will control,” he said.The app that is in advance stages would also illustrate the technique to make flavoured jaggery.Chocolate, vanilla and ice cream flavoured jaggery was in vogue and anyone could learn the recipe using the app, Vaishya said.Also Read: Schools for Classes 6-8 to reopen from Feb 10 in UPDifferently-abled since birth, Vaishya cannot hold anything with his hands or walk on his own.

The first phase of polling will be held on Tuesday.The SEC directed that during the period of confinement to his house, the minister would not be given access to media to ensure that “he would not make possible inciteful utterances that will have an adverse impact on the ongoing elections to the local bodies as well as on the general law and order situation in Chittoor and elsewhere.”The SEC said the minister, however, could get access to medical aid and such other exigencies warranting inevitable movement as deemed reasonable. “He can also discharge his duties as a minister, have access to all official records and papers and can dispose of the matters,” the SEC said.At a press conference in Tirupati on Friday, the minister threatened to blacklist the collectors and returning officers of various districts, if they did not declare the results of the gram panchayats where unanimous elections were held.Ramachandra Reddy asked the collectors and returning officers not to obey the instructions of the SEC. “If any officials follow the SEC’s instructions not to declare the unanimous elections, serious action will be taken against them and they will be blacklisted,” he warned.He also pointed out that the present SEC would be there in the post only till March 31, 2021, but the YSRC government would continue beyond it. He asked the returning officers to ignore the SEC directions and declare all unanimous elections. “The people of the state are behind us and unanimous elections shall continue," he said.Also Read: Andhra Pradesh to set up 3 concept cities for IT related industriesKumar said the minister’s statement had created fear psychosis among the voters in the local bodies. “It amounts to not only interference with the election process, but also subversion of democratic election process to the local bodies underway,” he said.Describing Kumar’s orders for his house arrest as atrocious, Ramachandra Reddy said there was no need to follow Kumar’s orders. “He should first understand whether his orders would be implemented at all. It is evident that the SEC was acting under the directions of Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu,” he alleged and asked the officials not to follow the orders of the SEC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-poll-panel-chief-orders-minister-s-house-arrest-for-threatening-officials-101612603192286.html

"The disengagement talks, because it is a very complicated issue, because it depends on troops, you have to know the geography (like) which position and what is happening, this is being done by the military commanders," he said.The minister was replying to a query on whether there would be any ministerial level talks between both the countries on skirmishes between troops of the Asian giants. China and India are locked in a military standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 5 last.The two countries have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks to resolve the face-off, but no significant headway has been made so far. "So, military commanders have held nine rounds of meetings so far. We believe some progress has been made, but it is not, in a kind of situation where there is a visible expression of that on the ground," he said.Referring to the parleys he and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held with their respective chinese counterparts last year in Moscow, Jaishanakar said it was agreed that there should be disengagement in some points. "Right now the military commanders are talking and they will continue to talk," he said.On the recent union budget, he said there has been a significant additional outlay for the Defence, both in the financial year as well as capital expenditure. The minister said there is an 18 per cent increase in the capital expenditure which, according to him, is the highest during the past 15 years.During the Covid-19 induced lockdown last year, Jaishankar noted that as many as four million Indians stranded abroad were brought back by operating 17,000 flights. The workers who came back from gulf countries during the Covid-19 pandemic have now started returning, which is a good sign, he added.Explaining the salient features of the budget, he said it indicates the way between the "Covid-19 recovery and Economic recovery".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-rounds-of-military-talks-held-with-china-talks-to-continue-s-jaishankar-101612602256872.html

The issue for us is between corona recovery and economic recovery. What is the future direction we should be going? This time, it was clearly indicated by the budget,” he told ANI. In her budget speech on February 1, Union finance minister Sitharaman said that the fiscal deficit for the current financial year is pegged at 9.5% and that there will be a borrowing of ₹80,000 crore in the next two months. She added that the fiscal deficit in 2021-22 is expected to be 6.8% of the GDP and the borrowing from the market next year will be ₹12 lakh crore.

For us today, health and wellbeing have become important and that is the reason why in the budget, the government has given such a big priority to the health and wellbeing sector,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Jaishankar also addressed the border standoff with China in the Ladakh area during his interaction with the media. He said that Indian military commanders have held nine rounds of talks with their Chinese counterparts during the past one year and they will continue in future. The minister had earlier made it clear that the only way forward for the two countries is for their armies to go back to their permanent bases along the 1597-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in east Ladakh as they existed in April 2020.Jaishankar said three so-called “mutuals” – mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests – are determining factors for the bilateral relationship and cannot be brushed aside as the two countries try to resolve the nine-month-long standoff on the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expect-double-digit-11-plus-growth-in-the-coming-year-says-s-jaishankar-101612595401165.html

06-02-2021||India||Farmers' agitation: Normal vehicular movement in Delhi ahead of chakka jam||The vehicular movement in the national capital has been normal but slower on Saturday at border points, where the police have intensified checking of vehicles because of the nationwide traffic blockade call given by farm unions between 12 pm and 3 pm, the Delhi traffic police said. Security arrangements have been enhanced even as no untoward incident has been reported from anywhere in the city.Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur border points, where thousands of farmers have been camping against the three farm laws for 73 days, continue to remain closed. The traffic between Delhi-Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-Haryana was being diverted to the alternate routes. The other border points closed because of the farmers' agitation are Piau Maniyari, Saboli, and Auchandi, all connecting Delhi with Haryana.Lampur, Safiabad, Singhu School, and Palla border points are open for traffic between Delhi and Haryana. The traffic police have advised motorists to avoid Outer Ring Road, GT Karnal Road, and NH-44 to avoid traffic congestion.All the six carriageways of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, NH-9 and NH-24 are blocked at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border. Motorists coming from Ghaziabad are entering Delhi through alternate border points such as Anand Vihar, EDM Mall, Surya Nagar, Apsara, Bhopra, Loni, Kondli, and through Noida where they are being diverted to DND, Chilla, New Ashok Nagar, and Dallupura."Traffic is normal across the city and we have so far not received any call regarding traffic jams from anywhere in the city," an official from the traffic police control room said at 10.30 am.Farmer leaders have announced that there will be no blockade, or chakka jam, in Delhi and the protesting farmers will not enter the city. But around 50,000 traffic and security personnel, including those from the paramilitary forces, have been deployed. The police are also using drone cameras for aerial surveillance.One of the groups from the Ghazipur protest site deviated from their agreed-upon route during the January 26 tractor rally, reached ITO and ran riot there. Another group from Singhu border stormed the Red Fort, where one of the protesters climbed a flag post and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs. A violent clash followed as policemen tried to disperse the protesters.The farmer protest sites at Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur borders are being heavily patrolled ahead of the three-hour-long chakka jam called to intensify the protest against the farm laws.The Delhi Police on Friday reiterated that no permission has been granted to protesters for holding the chakka jam or any other demonstration in the city and legal action will be taken against those found disrupting the city’s traffic and law and order.The protest sites are under multi-layered barricading with barbed wiring on top, concrete walls, trenches, nails boards drilled onto roads, and netting to stop pelted stones.These measures, the police said, were to keep the farmers from entering the national capital on Saturday.The police were also monitoring content on social media to keep a watch on those spreading rumours or instigating people against the government and the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-agitation-normal-vehicular-movement-in-delhi-ahead-of-chakka-jam-101612592351770.html

Farmers have also blocked Panipat-Rohtak highway near Panipat, Hisar-Chandigarh highway at Kaithal and Pehowa, Karnal-Jind highway near Assandh.Haryana police have diverted the traffic from NH 44 to alternative routes to avoid traffic jams. The protestors said that the highway blockade will continue for three hours till 3pm. However, they said they had made arrangements for food and water for commuters stuck in traffic jams on one of the busiest highways of the country, which caters to around 40,000 vehicles daily. Earlier heavy police deployment was made around Chandigarh-Delhi national highway 44.The authorities tried to convince the protesting farmers not to block NH 44, which connects three states of Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh and three union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Chandigarh with the national capital of Delhi, but the union leaders insisted on the blockade of all major national and Haryana state highways, forcing the authorities to divert the traffic from NH 44 to link roads.Rakesh Bains, national spokesperson of BKU (Charuni) said block level coordination committees have finalised the locations for protests.He said instructions have been issued to local farmers to ensure protests remain peaceful and the movement of ambulances, marriage parties and media persons were allowed.Following the vehicle-blockade call, Haryana ADGP Law and Order Navdeep Virk has asked all district superintendents of police to make necessary security arrangements at all traffic junctions and important roads.The district administrations have made arrangements to avoid any face-off with the farmers, who have identified hundreds of locations, including 11 in Karnal district alone, to block the highways.Also Read: Farmers' stir: Security tightened, many metro stations shut ahead of chakka jamKarnal Superintendent of police, Ganga Ram Punia, said that police deployment has been made to prevent traffic jams and apart from release of a traffic advisory, arrangements have been made to divert the traffic on the link roads when the highways are blocked.The traffic from NH 44 is being diverted from Bastara toll plaza to Kutail and Gharaunda.

06-02-2021||India||No alimony when man not of marriageable age||He could not legally marry because he was only 20. But he was still ordered to pay alimony to a girl for a “deemed” marriage.The bizarre situation had Supreme Court judges in a quandary on Friday, and they decided to delve deeper to untangle the legal riddle.A Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, was left amused when advocate Rachitta Priyanka Rai unfolded the facts of her case.Rai’s client was 20 when he eloped with a woman, 18, from the same village in Jharkhand’s East Singhbhum district in March 2006.The couple went to Jamshedpur where they lived together for around a week. When they came back to their village, the petition stated, the panchayat tried to get them married, but a ruckus followed and the wedding never took place.Subsequently, the woman filed two cases against the man – one alleging cruelty, and another demanding maintenance on the ground that their live-in relationship had to be treated as a relationship in the nature of a marriage.The trial court, as per the petition filed through Lexolve Partners, sentenced the man to one year in jail under the charge of cruelty. He was also ordered to pay ₹5,000 to the woman every month as maintenance.When the man filed appeals against these orders, the Jharkhand High Court dropped the criminal case, holding that since they never got married, the charge of cruelty under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code was not made out. But the order to pay maintenance was upheld.On Friday, Rai commenced her arguments before the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, highlighting the legal conundrum that surfaced due to the alimony order. She referred to her client’s educational certificate to show he was only 20 at the time of this relationship.“The law is clear that valid age for a man to marry is 21. When a man cannot enter into a valid wedlock because of the prohibition of age under the law, how can any relationship be treated as a ‘deemed’ marriage if the man is less than 21? How can my client be asked to pay maintenance when he was not even in the legal age to marry?” she questioned.The lawyer added that the high court also erred in treating this as a “domestic” relationship while the couple fled the village, was hiding at different places in Jamshedpur, and lived together only for a week.“Staying together for just a week cannot be a period good enough to consider this as a proper relationship, let alone treat this as a ‘domestic’ relationship under the law,” Rai contended.At first, the bench was of the view that Rai’s client should pay at least half of the sum ordered as maintenance but the lawyer convinced the judges that the high court order was wrong on several aspects.Rai’s persuasion made the court stay the order to pay maintenance, while the CJI added: “You may succeed in your case eventually.”Former additional solicitor general Pinky Anand and senior advocate told HT: “The high court seems to have committed a gross error in allowing maintenance in this case. It was at best a short live-in affair.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-alimony-when-man-not-of-marriageable-age-101612590808713.html

06-02-2021||India||Centre fielded Tendulkar to counter global support for farmers: RJD leader||RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari on Friday alleged that the Union government "fielded" Sachin Tendulkar to "counter" international personalities who recently commented on the ongoing farmers' protests, and said it was an insult to the nation. The RJD's national vice-president asked whether the Centre wants the world to turn a blind eye to the farmer's stir by "getting statements issued by people like Tendulkar".Cricketers like Tendulkar, Ravi Shastri, Virat Kohli, on Wednesday joined Bollywood superstars Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn to support the Centre's call on standing against "propaganda" against the Indian government and its policies after international personalities like Rihanna and Greta Thunberg extended their support towards farmer's protest.Also read: Sena flays Tiwari for questioning Bharat Ratna to SachinAlso read: Kangana asked about her credentials, replies ‘I am the best person to lead'"India's sovereignty cannot be compromised. External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Lets remain united as a nation," Tendulkar had tweeted on February 3, 2021 with hashtag #IndiaTogether #IndiaAgainstPropaganda."Farmers do not know about Twitter. This Twitter politics has started recently and everyone is doing it. What do the farmers know about Greta Thunberg or Rihanna? And you have fielded Sachin Tendulkar against them," the RJD leader said.Climate and environmental activist Greta Thunberg had come out in support of the farmers' protest at Delhi's borders against the Centre's new agri laws."We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India," she had tweeted soon after singer Rihanna shared a news article highlighting the Centre's crackdown on the farmers by cutting off internet services in many regions."Why aren't we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest," Rihanna had tweeted.Tiwari's remark came in for sharp criticism from the ruling BJP and its ally JD(U) which demanded an apology from him.However, the RJD distanced itself from the remark, terming it as Tiwari's "personal opinion".Condemning the RJD leaders statement, the BJP and the JD(U), describing it as "absurd and uncalled for"."Nowadays Shivanand Tiwari is representing a group of frustrated opposition leaders, crazy to grab headlines. His statement on Sachin Tendulkar is absurd and uncalled for. Shivanandji should apologise to the people of the country."The RJD is free to express grievances and demand Bharat Ratna for anybody but Shivanandji doesn't have the right to abuse anyone who is conferred with Bharat Ratna. We seriously condemn the statement and demand that Tejashwi Yadav should come up with a clarification on his party leader," Bihar BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said.Echoing similar sentiments, Bihar JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, "Showing respect for foreign celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna and insulting legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, who is loved and admired by millions of people, can only be expected from a leader of the RJD". If Tiwari does not apologise, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav should take stern action against him, Prasad said.Bihar RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwary said, "It is his (Shivanand Tiwaris) personal opinion which he may have given considering the conditions and sufferings of the protesting farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-fielded-tendulkar-to-counter-global-support-for-farmers-rjd-leader-101612581819224.html

06-02-2021||India||Farmers call for 3-hour ‘chakka jam’, say Delhi won’t be impacted||Farm unions have called for a three-hour nationwide highway blockade on Saturday afternoon to mark their protest against internet bans near demonstration sites and their alleged harassment at the hands of authorities among other issues. The protesting farmers, who have been agitating against the Centre's agricultural laws for the past two and a half months, will block roads and highways from 12pm to 3pm. Follow latest updates on farm stir hereThe protesters have assured that no disruptions will be caused in the national capital and that emergency and essential services such as ambulances and school buses will not be stopped during the blockade. However, the Delhi Police on Friday reiterated that they have not granted any permission to hold the ‘chakka jam’ in the city and have warned that legal action will be taken against those found disrupting the city’s traffic and law and order. Security at the farmers’ protest sites at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders have been stepped up with multilayered barricading using barbed wiring on top, concrete walls, trenches, nails boards drilled onto roads and netting to stop pelted stones. Heavy deployment of security personnel armed with anti-riot gear has also been done to stop the agitators from entering the Capital. Nearly 15,000 personnel of the paramilitary forces of Rapid Action Force (RAF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) – all armed with anti-riot equipment – will be on duty along with thousands of Delhi Police personnel to maintain law and order during the ‘chakka jam’, officers told HT. Officials said that the police are also keeping a tab on social media to keep a watch on those spreading rumours or instigating people against the government and the police. The move comes after farmers’ proposed tractor rally on Republic Day took a violent turn and clashes broke out between the protesters and security personnel. While one farmer died during the chaos, many participants on both sides suffered injuries. Following the clashes, internet services were also restricted in several districts of Haryana. Police said they have intelligence inputs that protesters may deflate tyres of vehicles to cause jams on roads, all the police stations have been asked to keep air pumps with them for filling up deflated tyres. “Cranes have also been arranged to remove such vehicles and clear the traffic. Videographers and photographers will also be present for capturing the activities of protesters. We will also be using drones for aerial surveillance,” said an officer.Workers of various political parties and student organisations have also planned a foot march from Shaheed Park near Delhi Gate to ITO during the ‘chakka jam’, according to intelligence inputs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-call-for-3-hour-chakka-jam-say-delhi-won-t-be-impacted-101612579205428.html
06-02-2021||India||Danger to secularism: Madras HC tells evangelist who derided Hinduism, junks FIR||While quashing FIRs against evangelist Mohan C Lazarus who apologised unconditionally for his statements against Hindu temples, the Madras high court on Friday came down strongly on religious leaders preaching superiority of their religion over others.“Spewing venom against another religious faith and developing hatred among the followers of a particular religion against another, defies the very purpose of religion, which is meant to help a human being evolve towards higher truths,” the court said.The case, which came up before a single judge bench of justice N Anand Venkatesh, brought focus on values of liberty, secularism and tolerance. “The responsibility lies more with persons who are involved in the propagation of religions,” the court said. “... Every word uttered by any person holding an influential status in their respective religion has the potential to make or mar the inner development of a person,” the court observed adding that the petitioner “is not involved in some competitive business” and if millions of his followers blindly follow what he propagates “it will only sow seeds of hatred among people across religious faiths.”The court added that it cannot be “at the cost of injuring the sentiments and rights” of fellow citizens who are “part of the rich culture and value system that our nation embodies”. The court warned, “If this is not followed, it will spell danger to the secular fabric of this country. It may even lead to eroding one of the basic structures of our Constitution.”While pointing out that it was faced with a “triangular issue of freedom of expression, secularism and tolerance”, the court found it relevant and “call aloud that we as a society have fallen and are falling into the hands of misconceptions and extremities in the name of securing and practicing our respective religious beliefs. These extremities have always known to incite hatred, violence, bloodshed and bitterness across history.”The court made a distinction between secularism in the West as emphasising on the separation between state and religion but in India “secularism stresses the equal tolerance of all religions.” The court said it deemed fit to express its mind towards all people placed in the position of the petitioner irrespective of their religious identities. Without taking names, the justice also made an oral observation about a BJP functionary, R Kalyanaraman, who was charged recently for making a hate speech against Islam in Coimbatore district. “Indian secularism is not one that is anti-religious but one that gives to all its citizens, equal freedom of conscience and religion,” the court said.Also Read: SC junks petition seeking stay on ‘love jihad’ lawsThe de facto complainants in the case also wanted to bring a ‘graceful end’ to the matter with an assurance from the petitioner that he will not make such statements in the future. While quashing the numerous FIRs filed to initiate criminal proceedings against the petitioner, the court also quoted Jesus Christ “that the religion or its ideals do not intend to, under any circumstances, incite its followers to judge or demean another religion for the purpose of its own growth and propagation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/danger-to-secularism-madras-hc-tells-evangelist-who-derided-hinduism-junks-fir-101612578374349.html
06-02-2021||India||UN human rights agency calls for 'maximum restraint' by farmers and authorities||The UN human rights agency on Friday called on both protesting farmers and authorities in India to exercise “maximum restraint” and to find “equitable solutions” that show respect for human rights.The UN office of the high commissioner for human rights joined lawmakers, organisations and governments from around the world that have weighed in on the farmers’ protest that began last November against the three farm laws. A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had earlier said it was important to respect peaceful protests, freedom of assembly and non-violence.“#India: We call on the authorities and protesters to exercise maximum restraint in ongoing #FarmersProtests,” the UN human rights agency led by high commissioner Michelle Bachelet said on its official Twitter handle on Friday night.“The rights to peaceful assembly & expression should be protected both offline & online. It's crucial to find equitable solutions with due respect to #HumanRights for all,” it added.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the UN human rights agency’s comments.On Thursday, the US had called for a dialogue to address the farmers’ protest and backed peaceful demonstrations and freedom of expression. It also offered support for reforms that improve and open up India’s markets to attract private investments.These were the first public comments by the Biden administration on the farmers’ protest, and the external affairs ministry responded by saying the protest must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos. The ministry also sought to make a comparison between violence at a farmers’ rally on January 26 and the chaos during the siege of the US Capitol on January 6.The ministry has also pushed back against support for the farmers’ protest by foreign celebrities, describing the agitation as an internal matter.

All the suggestions and comments received on the proposed draft rules were also published on Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology website in February, 2019," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-blocked-296-mobile-apps-since-2014-centre-tells-rajya-sabha-101612576809769.html
06-02-2021||India||No indication that India has given up extradition of Headley: Ranas' attorney||There is no indication that India has given up on the extradition of David Coleman Headley, the Mumbai terror attack accused, attorney of his co-accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana has told a US court.Rana, 59, a childhood friend of Headley, is facing extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. Rana, who has been declared a fugitive by India, is opposing his extradition.In a submission early this week before the US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chelonian, opposing his extradition the attorney of Rana claimed that as of now there is no indication in the record that India has agreed to forgo Headley’s extradition to India.“India presumably could have agreed to forgo Headley's extradition in return for his assistance to the United States, but there is no indication in the record that it did so,” the court submission told the court."In fact, the opinion of the Indian prosecutor serving as the government's expert states: "The present opinion is specific to the extradition request in respect of fugitive Tahawwur Hussain Rana. This opinion may not be construed in any manner to indicate that the various extradition requests pending with different sovereign nations in respect of the above-mentioned case which includes the case in respect of Accused No. 1, David Coleman Headley, is either being given up or not being pursued vigorously," said the motion filed by his attorneys. Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.Also read| Mossad team joins NIA in embassy blast probeRana’s attorneys said that the Court should not lightly assume (as the government appears to suggest) that the government circumvented its treaty obligation to India through “a sham interpretation” of Article 6 of the India-US Extradition Treaty as part of its deal with Headley.The government's conclusion in Headley's plea agreement that Article 6 defines offenses in terms of conduct rather than elements and thus bars Headley's extradition must be taken as its good-faith interpretation of the Treaty's terms, it said.Rana, in the court filing, describe his childhood friend Headley as a liar.Headley lied to federal agents, judges, and presumably prosecutors in relation to these cases. After his first heroin sentence (reduced because of his cooperation), he went back to dealing heroin despite promising that he would not.“He disregarded the agents' instructions regarding his dealings with targets and travelled to Pakistan without permission. After his second heroin conviction, he used his status as a DEA cooperator to deflect government scrutiny of his activities with Lashkar and his statements supporting jihad,” his lawyers alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-indication-that-india-has-given-up-extradition-of-headley-ranas-attorney-101612575273956.html

06-02-2021||India||Congress extends support to 'chakka jam' called by farmer unions||The Congress on Friday extended support to the countrywide 'chakka jam' called by farmer unions on February 6, saying party workers will stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers in their protest.The Congress also hit out at Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who defended the three new farm laws and criticised the Opposition while speaking in Rajya Sabha.Whatever the agriculture minister said was "not only totally bereft of facts" but also "grossly objectionable", the party claimed.Farmer unions on Monday had announced 'chakka jam' on February 6 when they would block national and state highways for three hours in protest against the internet ban in areas near their agitation sites, harassment allegedly meted out to them by authorities, and other issues.Also Read | Chakka jam: Barricades, thousands of policemen on watch todayCongress general secretary (organisation), K C Venugopal, said the party fully supports the farmers' movement and appeals to the government to climb down from the "high horse of false and misplaced pride", and accede to the justified demands of the farmers by repealing the three farm laws.On February 6, when the farmer organisations will hold a three-hour nationwide 'chakka jam' from 12 pm to 3 pm in a non-violent and peaceful manner on the national and state highways, the Congress will extend its full support to farmer groups, Venugopal said in a statement.Congress workers in solidarity with the protesting farmers will stand shoulder to shoulder in this "symbolic and Gandhian" way of protest, he said.Farmers' organisations have already exempted emergency and essential services from this protest, Venugopal noted."Joining in the spirit, Congress workers will take full care that the ambulance services, school bus, elderly, patients and women and children are not inconvenienced due to the bandh call," he said.Venugopal said that this farmers' movement, which is being steadfastly supported by the poor, farm labour, SCs, STs, OBCs as well as every "right- minded Indian", is not only aimed at protecting agriculture and farming but also saving the public distribution system."However, the power drunk Modi government is trying every mean trick of the trade to tire out and defame the protesting millions. Even today, the Union Agriculture Minister (Narendra Singh Tomar), while speaking in the Parliament, blatantly tried to mislead the House and the nation," Venugopal alleged.It is public knowledge that the farmers' organisations have held eleven rounds of talks with the government during which they provided point-wise detail of the deficiencies and lacunae in the three laws, "consequent to which even the government has openly agreed to bring about as many as 18 amendments to the said laws", he said."In the light of this, whatever the agriculture minister said today in Parliament is not only totally bereft of facts but is grossly objectionable," Venugopal said.Intervening in the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President's Address, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar alleged that farmers were being misled by the Opposition and the agitation was only in one state.Hitting out at the government, Venugopal alleged, "Driven by the sole motive of benefiting its corporate cronies and steamrolling the laws by the brute force of parliamentary arithimatical majority, the government neither consulted the opposition parties nor took any farmers organisation in confidence, before enacting the laws."Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-extends-support-to-chakka-jam-called-by-farmer-unions-101612571880071.html

06-02-2021||India||17 months on, 4G internet services restored in Jammu and Kashmir||The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Friday issued an order allowing the restoration of high-speed mobile internet services in the region, a move that came more than 17 months after 4G facilities were snapped ahead of the Centre’s controversial decision to withdraw the erstwhile state’s special status.The order by Shaleen Kabra, principal secretary (home), directed inspectors general of police in Jammu and Kashmir divisions to ensure compliance and “closely monitor the impact of lifting of restrictions”. Though the two-page order did not specify any timeline, officials who did not want to be named said services could be restored as early as midnight Friday.The order added that high-speed internet facility on prepaid SIM card holders would be provided “only after verification as per the norms applicable for post-paid connections”.The news broke earlier in the evening, cheering residents of the Union Territory (UT). “4G mobile internet services being restored in entire J&K,” government spokesman Rohit Kansal tweeted.Moments later, National Conference (NC) vice-president and former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: “4G Mubarak! For the first time since Aug 2019 all of J&K will have 4G mobile data. Better late than never.”The order said an “objective assessment of the prevailing circumstances” was done by a special committee constituted on the directions of the Supreme Court order of May 11, 2020.On the Raj Bhavan’s Twitter account, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for “acceding to our request and restoring 4G services...” “The move will fulfil the aspirations of the people, especially the youth,” the tweet said.Authorities suspended 4G mobile internet services on August 4, 2019, a day before the central government nullified Article 370, which accorded special privileges to J&K, and bifurcated it into two UTs — J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. The government also suspended landline and internet services, fearing widespread protests in the restive region.The UT has moved several steps towards normalcy since then, with the gradual restoration of communication lines.Landlines were restored between mid-August and September 2019. Then postpaid mobile services buzzed back to life on October 14, 2019. Short messaging service (SMS) on all mobile phones and broadband internet services in government-run hospitals were restored on January 1, 2020.2G mobile internet services were restored on January 25, 2020. In August 2020, high-speed internet was restored in two districts of J&K — Ganderbal and Udhampur districts — based on the parameters laid down by the special committee, which recommended that the areas, where high-speed services are allowed, should have low intensity of terrorist activities.That move came days after the central government told the Supreme Court that restrictions on high-speed mobile internet services will be relaxed in one district each of Jammu and Kashmir divisions of the UT after August 15 on a trial basis.The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by Foundation for Media Professionals, a non-government organisation, last June, seeking the initiation of contempt proceedings against the Centre and J&K administration for the failure to comply with the top court’s May 11 directions to review restrictions on mobile internet speed in the Union territory.The demand for restoration of high-speed mobile internet had been growing in J&K for the past few months with political parties joining the chorus.While Bharatiya Janata Party leaders such as Altaf Thakur joined the bandwagon, Apni Party leader Altaf Bukhari and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah, too, were vocal for the restoration of 4G services.After Friday’s order, Srinagar mayor Junaid Azim Mattu tweeted: “The restoration of 4G Mobile Internet in Jammu & Kashmir is a welcome move and will ease out issues faced by students, the tourism industry and people at large.”In a statement, Apni Party president Bukhari thanked PM Modi for restoring 4G services, terming it a positive development for students and the youth.Basit Ahmad Dar, who is in Class 12, said students faced several hardships due to the suspension of high-speed internet. “We missed many online classes due to low internet speed. Once the internet is restored, life will become easy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-months-on-4g-internet-services-restored-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101612564917419.html
06-02-2021||India||Row erupts after TN guv declines to take a call on convict’s plea||Opposition parties in Tamil Nadu have criticised the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and its ally in the upcoming assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party, after Governor Banwarilal Purohit avoided taking a decision on the clemency plea of one of the convicts serving a sentence for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, and said President of India was the right person to rule on this.The clemency plea predates Purohit’s appointment in late 2017; it was filed by AG Perarivalan alias Arivu in 2015.The Supreme Court was told by the Centre on Thursday that Purohit, on January 25, said that the decision would have to be taken by the President.The Centre’s admission of this in court on Thursday has put the AIADMK in a spot. The release of Arivu and the other convicts in this case is an emotive issue in the state. It was widely believed that the AIADMK and the BJP would engineer the release ahead of the assembly elections in the state. The seven convicts have spent around 30 years in jail.The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which has for long pressed for the release of the convicts didn’t lose any time. “This will find a solution only if (MK) Stalin becomes chief minister; these people (AIADMK) aren’t courageous,” said DMK organising secretary R S Bharathy on Friday.In a statement, DMK president MK Stalin said, “Even if the chief minister (Edapaddi Palaniswami) is going to meet the President on their release, the DMK MPs are ready to come with him.”MDMK chief Vaiko, an ally of the DMK also called the whole affair a sham. An ally of the DMK, the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Party (formerly Dalit Panthers), said the state must send a fresh resolution to the Governor and requested that the seven convicts are given immediate and indefinite parole.The AIADMK’s only response was that it would consult lawyers on a permanent solution on the release of all seven convicts.The ruling party, and especially chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami have also been embarrassed by the clear lack of communication between the CM and the Governor that is evident in the Centre’s admission on Thursday.Perarivalan’s mercy petition has been pending with the Tamil Nadu governor since December 30, 2015. Retired justice of the Madras HC, K Chandru said, “...I haven’t seen a case where the Governor has disagreed with the cabinet. The Governor can only act on the advice of the cabinet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-erupts-after-tn-guv-declines-to-take-a-call-on-convict-s-plea-101612564692994.html

India began the drive with health care workers on January 16, and from the first week of February, shots are now being given to front line services staff such as police and firefighters.“In the first phase, the target was to vaccinate about ten million health care workers both in the public and private sector, which is progressing quite fast. In the second phase, an estimated 20 million frontline workers were to be vaccinated, and that has also begun this week on February 2 at many places in the country. After completion of the first and second phase, the third phase will begin wherein everyone above 50 will be vaccinated. It may not be possible to provide an exact date but it is likely that the process will begin anytime in the second, third or fourth week of March,” said Harsh Vardhan.The minister said the government “has sufficient doses” for the on-going phase and existing cold storage facilities under Universal Immunization Programme have been strengthened and are being used for storing vaccines. As on February 1, more than 20 million vaccine doses have been provided to all States and UTs.Hospitalizations related to adverse event following immunisation is also one of the lowest in India, the minister said. So far, 27 people have been hospitalized due to adverse reaction related to Covid-19 vaccination, taking the percentage to a miniscule 0.0005%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-for-general-public-likely-to-begin-in-march-2nd-half-says-minister-101612564147585.html

But the application was pending, with several adjournments in the interim even as the regulator cleared two others that applied much later.“Pfizer will continue to engage with the authority and resubmit its approval request with additional information as it becomes available in the near future. Pfizer remains committed to making its vaccine available for use by the Government in India and to pursuing the requisite pathway for emergency use authorisation that enables the availability of this vaccine for any future deployment,” the company said in a statement.The decision appeared to come after the CDSCO’s subject expert committee (SEC) did not recommend granting approval for want of more data in a meeting on February 3. “The committee noted that that the incidents of palsy, anaphylaxis and severe adverse events have been reported during post marketing and the causality of the events with the vaccine is being investigated. Further, the firm has not proposed any plan to generate safety and immunogenicity data in Indian population. After detailed deliberation, the committee has not recommended for grant of permission for emergency use in the country at this stage,” according to the minutes of February 3 meeting made public by CDSCO.An official in CDSCO, in the know of things, confirmed the development, and said that the main point of contention was that the company wanted waiver of local trials.“Their data is robust but it is always good to know how the product will work or behave in the local population, for which the regulatory authorities ask for bridging studies. So far, no foreign product has been allowed for import and to be marketed in India without a local study. It doesn’t have to be a large study, just a small study. But it is important,” said one of the officials requesting, not to be identified.Pfizer-BioNTech’s is a two-dose mRNA vaccine to be given 21 days apart and requires superfreezing temperatures to store and move, a factor that many see as making it a difficult option for India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-drops-emergency-use-application-in-india-101612563938347.html
06-02-2021||India||Supreme Court grants Munawar Faruqui interim bail, stays UP police warrant||The Supreme Court on Friday took less than a minute to order interim bail for stand-up comic Munawar Faruqui, who had been in jail for 35 days on the charge of hurting religious sentiments during a public show staged in Indore on January 1.“The petitioner (Faruqui) is released on ad-interim bail on conditions to the satisfaction of the trial court,” said a bench of justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai. The bench seemed to be in agreement with Faruqui’s advocate Saurabh Kirpal, who argued that Indore police did not follow the procedure laid out by the SC in its 2014 order in the Arnesh Kumar case on the process of police probe.Staying the Madhya Pradesh high court judgment that declined bail to Faruqui, the apex court issued notices to the state police as well as to the complainant in the case, Hindu Rakshak Sangathan convener Eklavya Singh Gaud, son of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Malini Singh Gaud.The bench also restrained the Uttar Pradesh police from arresting Faruqui in a separate case registered against him at Prayagraj for allegedly offending religious feelings through his jokes.Kirpal asked for an interim order to ensure Faruqui was not shifted to a jail in UP on account of the second FIR against him at Prayagraj. “Production warrant (by a trial court in Prayagraj) has been issued for my client. Please pass an interim order against any coercive process.” Acceding to the request, the bench stayed the production warrant.Commenting on the HC’s order, senior advocate Vivek Tankha, who represented Faruqui in HC, said: “Citizens salute the apex court for speedy justice. This case was followed with immense concern internationally.” The SC, on Friday, took up two petitions by Faruqui, seeking quashing of the FIRs against him, and also seeking interim bail on the ground that the Indore police violated the guidelines laid down in the Arnesh Kumar judgment by not conducting any preliminary investigation before arresting him.The 2014 Supreme Court judgment required the police to conduct a preliminary probe before making arrest where offences were punishable with imprisonment for less than seven years. Faruqui has been booked by the Indore police under charges of hurting religious sentiments and violating Covid-19 protocol, and these offences are punishable with a maximum jail term of only three years. As soon as Kirpal commenced his argument, justice Nariman asked him if it was correct that the apex court’s guidelines on arrest were not followed by the Indore police.“If Arnesh Kumar (judgment) has not been followed, it is good enough. You don’t need to show anything more,” the judge told Kirpal, who submitted that non-compliance with the SC judgment was one of the main grounds to challenge Faruqui’s arrest in Indore on January 1.The case is likely to come up next on March 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-munawar-faruqui-interim-bail-stays-up-police-warrant-101612563464059.html
06-02-2021||India||Repeal farm laws, drop cases filed: Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Friday attended a ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ in Dausa, where a resolution, asking the Centre to repeal the three farm laws and withdraw cases filed against farmers for the violence during tractor rally on Republic Day, was passed.The resolution has also sought a compensation for the families of the farmers who have died during the protests, which started in November last year.Addressing the event, Pilot said, “While making these laws none of the state governments or farmers’ organisations were consulted. These laws were passed in Parliament in haste and imposed on the country. The government of India claims these farm laws are in the interest of the farmers but are being opposed across the country.”“The farmers are protesting in a Gandhian manner but the way barricades have been put up, and electricity and water supply discontinued, is unjustified,” Pilot said, adding that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and leader Rahul Gandhi have supported the farmers throughout the stir.The event, held under the banner of Sanyukt Kisan Sangathan, submitted a memorandum to district collector seeking repeal of the laws. “We will not step back, till these demands are met,” he said. Condemning the violence at tractor parade, Pilot said, “The opposition parties are supporting the farmers. The issue is not of a party or leader but of the farmers.”Hitting back, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said, “Congress itself made such promises in the manifesto. The GoI is continuously is holding dialogue with the farmers and committed to resolve it on a positive note.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-farm-laws-drop-cases-filed-sachin-pilot-in-rajasthan-101612562875200.html
06-02-2021||India||India seeks Canada’s assistance in ‘toolkit’ probe||India may ask the Canadian government to assist in investigating the antecedents of individuals and groups it alleges were responsible for creating a “toolkit” for those supporting agitations against the farm laws, especially if it is linked to violence that occurred on Republic Day in New Delhi.Senior Indian officials told HT that if the Delhi Police is to charge-sheet persons based in Canada, such a request is tenable under the mutual legal assistance treaty New Delhi has with Ottawa. “We will take it up with the Canadian Government when we need cooperation of law enforcement agencies in Canada,” an official said.The toolkit, which was tweeted by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, and then deleted before she posted an updated version, is being linked by Delhi Police to a Vancouver-based organisation, Poetic Justice Foundation (PFJ). HT reached out to the founder of PJF Mo Dhaliwal, who agreed to an interview but then said he would issue a statement instead.The toolkit is in support of the farmers’ agitation, and ostensibly meant to raise its profile internationally. PJF has also worked in coordination with the World Sikh Organisation or WSO, which has been critical of India, regardless of the government in charge, for several years, and, as per the Canadian Encyclopedia, wanted to “create an independent nation, Khalistan” when it was founded.PFJ’s co-founder Anita Lal joined WSO as its Director of Community Development on February 1. The two organisations, along with two others, issued a press statement criticising the actions of the Indian government following the violence on January 26.According to an interview with a campus journal, Dhaliwal is an alumnus of the University of Fraser Valley in British Columbia, and worked briefly in Silicon Valley before returning to Vancouver. He also founded the Vancouver International Bhangra Celebration Society, and was director of strategy at Skyrocket, a branding a web design agency based in Vancouver.In an interview on January 26 to the Canadian network Global TV, Dhaliwal said the #AskIndiaWhy campaign was launched to “create awareness so that with the world’s eyes on India”, the government is “less likely” to undertake “any extreme violence” against the farmers. Such “scrutiny”, he said, was required so that “India does not massacre the protestors standing against these laws.”The updated toolkit posted by Thunberg gave a brief description of the ongoing farmers’ agitation and called upon people to participate or organise on-ground protests, post tweets supporting the agitation, contact legal representatives, and sign petitions. To be sure, it did not appear to be out of the ordinary as guidelines for online protest campaigns go.PFJ’s website appears to be temporarily down, but the AskIndiaWhy site displays a Sikh Sovereignty section, with its page linking to publications from the Khalistan Centre. The Centre’s web presence, at Khalistan.org, prominently says, “Mobilising the Khalsa panth to effectively achieve Khalsa Jee De Bol Baalay through the establishment of an independent Khalistan.”Dhaliwal, described as community activist, was also the moderator for a panel discussion last year titled Khalistan, a conversation on trauma, racism and sovereignty, organised by PFJ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seeks-canada-s-assistance-in-toolkit-probe-101612562648933.html
06-02-2021||India||UN human rights agency urges farmers and authorities to show restraint||The UN human rights agency on Friday called on both protesting farmers and authorities in India to exercise “maximum restraint” and to find “equitable solutions” that show respect for human rights.The UN office of the high commissioner for human rights joined lawmakers, organisations and governments from around the world that have weighed in on the farmers’ protest that began last November against three farm laws. A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had earlier said it was important to respect peaceful protests, freedom of assembly and non-violence.“#India: We call on the authorities and protesters to exercise maximum restraint in ongoing #FarmersProtests,” the UN human rights agency led by high commissioner Michelle Bachelet said on its official Twitter handle on Friday night.“The rights to peaceful assembly & expression should be protected both offline & online. It’s crucial to find equitable solutions with due respect to #HumanRights for all,” it added.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the agency’s comments.On Thursday, the US had called for dialogue to address the farmers’ protest and backed peaceful demonstrations and freedom of expression. It also offered support for reforms that improve and open up India’s markets to attract private investments.These were the first public comments by the Biden administration on the farmers’ protest, and the external affairs ministry responded by saying the protest must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos.The ministry also sought to make a comparison between violence at a farmers’ rally on January 26 and the chaos during the siege of the US Capitol on January 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-human-rights-agency-urges-farmers-and-authorities-to-show-restraint-101612562301741.html
06-02-2021||India||Thousands defy police orders to throng UP mahapanchayat||Defying the district administration’s orders, thousands of farmers attended a a kisan mahapanchayat at Bhainswal village in western Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli district on Friday to extend support to the ongoing protests against three agriculture laws.Farmers from Shamli, Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat rode into the venue on their tractors with the Tricolour held high. Slogans of “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” rent the air. The meet was attended by Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Jayant Choudhary, Samajwadi Party leader Sudhir Panwar and representatives of 12 khaps, or clan-based bodies.“The three contentious bills will destroy farming and was brought only to benefit the corporate,” RLD leader Choudhury said, asking farmers to think of their next generation and stay united. He also thanked people for coming in such large numbers.The Shamli administration had denied permission for the gathering on Thursday, citing restrictions, Covid-19 protocol and law and order problems.This was the fifth mahapanchayat in western UP after Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait’S emotional appeal for support last week drew thousands to protest sites outside Delhi. The first mahapanchayat was organised in Muzaffarnagar on January 29 followed by similar events at Banjna in Mathura, Baraut in Baghpat and Bijnor.Pawar said the mahapanchayat was different from previous editions as representatives of 12 khaps, including those from the influential Jat community, shared the dais. “The dais today symbolised the concept of village Swaraj in a true sense, which was once conceptualized by leaders like Chaudhary Charan Singh,” said Pawar and added that presence of khaps indicated that the farming community backed the movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thousands-defy-police-orders-to-throng-up-mahapanchayat-101612562076075.html
06-02-2021||India||HT interview: Tikait, Rajewal say Centre should give up insistence on no-repeal||Into its third month, the dogged farmer protests, centred on the three contentious central farm laws, have dramatically gathered a new momentum in the last one week following a surge in support from the Jatlands of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.In the post-January 26 churn, Rakesh Tikait, 52, a cop-turned-farmer leader, and Balbir Singh Rajewal, 73, a veteran Bhartiya Kisan Union leader from Punjab, have emerged as the pre-eminent face of the agitation that has laid siege to Delhi’s key entry points, garnered international attention and put the Narendra Modi government to a severe test. While Tikait, the son of a tall farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, is the prime mobiliser, Rajewal stands out as a moderate voice of reason among ideologically disparate farm outfits from the border state.On Friday, a day before its nationwide ‘chakka jam (road blockade)’, Tikait and Rajewal dropped a conciliatory signal for resumption of talks with the Centre, while steadfastly swearing by their demand for the repeal of the three farm laws and a legally backed minimum support price. In an exclusive joint interview with HT Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak at the Ghazipur border protest site, the two leaders announced the second phase of their stir up to October 2 and spoke about the protests, the negotiations, the January 26 tractor march, the chances of resuming talks with the government, and the way forward for the agitation. Edited excerpts:Prime Minister Narendra Modi underlined his intent to resolve the farmers’ agitation by committing at the January 30 all-party meeting that the proposal to suspend the three farm laws and set up a committee still stands. What’s your response?Tikait: This is not acceptable to us. We will not talk with conditions. What the government offered after 11 rounds of talks has fallen flat. Now if they offer a new proposal, we will consider starting fresh talks.Which conditions are you referring to?Tikait: The one on the 18-month moratorium. If we take this and enter into talks, that will mean our acceptance of their formula. If they want to go beyond this, the doors to talks can open.What should the Centre do to bring the farmer unions back to the negotiating table?Tikait: They should give up their insistence that there will be no repeal of the three laws and say that there will be talks. Then, we will also vouch for talks. That will create a platform for negotiations. Earlier too, the negotiations were deadlocked for 20 days, but it was broken. I’m sure the talks will happen again.Farmers have taken a repeal-or-nothing stand. How will such an extreme position help create the negotiating space?Tikait: Obstinacy is on the part of the government. It is against the repeal of the laws and legal back-up for minimum support price (MSP). For us, these are the big issues.Rajewal: The government should fulfil its duty and invite us (farm unions). The government is not expected to sit silent and do nothing. Unhone ik baat ki zidd pakad li aur baat cheet ke table par aana nahin. Such a stubborn attitude will not help resolve the issue.Tikait: It’s possible that we may go to the first meeting to just put across our views and then come back to discuss it with our committee. But that would open the door for talks.So, you want the Centre to send an invite?Tikait: Let there be an invitation. Then, things will move forward. Talks are stalled since January 11. Our farmers are in jail, many are missing, and more than 400 tractors have been damaged. The government has put multi-layered barricades and spikes on roads leading to Delhi. People are inconvenienced. Sooner they (the Centre) respond the better. Otherwise, we will be holding meetings across the country. We will launch the second phase of the agitation from Saturday, and it will go on till October 2.The government says the farmers’ movement is based on misinformation that land will be snatched, and corporates will take over agriculture and the MSP will be discontinued.Rajewal: The government is creating such misgivings. In the meetings so far, farms laws were discussed clause by clause. We proved that these are wrong.How have the January 26 events changed the movement?Tikait: Three lakh tractors and 20 lakh people came to Delhi. Such a massive crowd could have done anything. But our agitation was peaceful except the wrong acts of certain elements, who infiltrated our agitation and did all in complicity with the authorities to defame and discredit our movement.The Prime Minister said the country was saddened by the insult to the national flag at Red Fort.Tikait: Will the PM tell us why Red Fort, which is the country’s pride, has been leased to private players? The national flag atop the ramparts was not touched. We even took out sadbhavna marches with the national flag. No one knows and upholds the honour of the Tricolour better than a farmer whose son is a jawan serving on the country’s borders. Before coming to power, the BJP never unfurled the national flag at its offices. The RSS never hoisted the national flag at its headquarters in Nagpur. How can they teach us the izzat of the national flag?The government says the stir is getting support from forces that aim to weaken the country.Rajewal: Who are these forces? Ek aadhi kaa naam batao (Tell us their names). We will deal with such forces. Agar koi desh ko kamzor kar raha hain, uska ilaaz tau hum hi kar denge (If they try to weaken the country, we will sort them out). We have not seen the tent of any such forces at our protest sites. All you see here are farmers from villages who bring their own food material and run community kitchens.As leaders of the movement, what lessons have you learnt from the January 26 episode?Tikait: We have been doing agitations for 35 years. Whosoever is in the Opposition raises slogans and lays siege to Parliament. But, in reality, the protests happen at Jantar Mantar. Has any agitator ever entered Parliament in all these years? On Republic Day, people who declared on the eve of our tractor march that their intention was to reach Red Fort were put up front by the police and given a free run to inner Delhi. The police and the authorities were complicit in this.But, is not it a fact that a section of protesters went out of your control?Tikait: What happened on December 6, 1992, in Ayodhya? All top BJP leaders were there, and the party was in power. Was the Babri mosque structure demolished intentionally? Their affidavits said it was done by a crowd that turned unruly.Many believe that the government’s proposal to stay the implementation of the laws for 18 months and set up a committee with the involvement of farm groups is a reasonable offer; it amounts, for all practical purposes, to the government retreating because this version of the law will be pulled back; it buys enough time to come up with a new framework. Why don’t you accept the offer?Rajewal: These laws are basically wrong and were rammed through Parliament in a high-handed manner. These have been enacted for trading, not agriculture. A farmer doesn’t trade; he takes his crop for marketing. These laws are not meant for farmers. Secondly, in the Constitution’s 7th Schedule, agriculture is a state subject, but they have taken the concurrent list route in which Schedule 33 is on food stuff. Farmers produce foodgrains, not food stuff. So, these laws cheat farmers. Nor do they pass the constitutional test.The farmers’ number has swelled at protest sites of late. There’s a law and order concern. How much control do you have on the crowds?Tikait: We have full control. Anyone who has joined the agitation and protests under some ideology other than the farmers’ cause can go back. We will shun such elements. Anyone involved in the breach of law and our protocol will be responsible for his own actions.As the face of the agitation, what role do you see for yourself to resolve the situation?Tikait: It’s a collective responsibility. Rajewal ji is our key leader. Let the government initiate talks. We also want resolution.The government says the farmers’ view on the laws and the MSP are based on fear and not on facts.Tikait: Even today, farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan sell foodgrains in Punjab and Haryana, which are the only states with MSP. Once there is a law-backed MSP, traders in the entire country will not dare to buy crop at lower than the MSP.Rajewal: Except Punjab and Haryana, the government has not put in place a marketing system in other states. We want a similar marketing system all over by opening 48,000 mandis so that all farmers benefit from the MSP.But there is wide consensus that the country urgently needs agri reforms to improve the farmers’ incomes and modernise agriculture.Rajewal: Of course, we need reforms. But we don’t want corporate agriculture. Reforms should not solely benefit traders at the cost of farmers.Tikait: In the reforms that this government is pushing, traders are trying to invade agriculture.The government has said MSP will continue.Rajewal: On MSP, the government says the existing system will continue. But that doesn’t apply to farmers except in Punjab and Haryana. We want a uniform legally guaranteed MSP for farmers of all states. They want to save the trader, not the farmer.The government at the highest level has repeatedly said that the laws are for benefit of farmers. Why don’t you trust that?Tikait: Farmers see through everything. The problem is that even the existing farmer-related laws are not implemented. Look at the Sugarcane Act that binds sugar mills and the government to pay the farmers’ due within 15 days of procurement, but the farmers get paid after up to two years. And the government do nothing. But these are dangerous laws, and these (farm laws) will be implemented. How can farmers trust the government?There is a trust deficit between Union leaders and the Centre?Tikait: We have full trust in the central government, but it is hell bent on dhokhe baazi (deception). Look at how they have levelled allegations against our movement to break it up by all means. Farmers are being labelled Khalistanis. They say we are getting funds from abroad. Attempts are on to divide us and entangle us on the lines of big versus small farmers and Punjab versus Haryana. This agitation will not break up. The government will have come to the table and talk.Would you talk to the Supreme Court-appointed expert panel?Tikait: We have already rejected that. If someone is studying Kannada, can he solve a question paper in Hindi?The government believes that farm leaders want to find a compromise but buckle under pressure of the radical mood of protesters. You fear being seen as too soft or selling out to the government? Is there a problem of radical competitiveness within the movement?Tikait: We have not backtracked from talks. But come what may, we can’t betray the trust farmers have reposed in us. We are standing for their rights.Rajewal: The constituents of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha are free to give their opinion, but there are no pressures from any quarter. Ours is a collective decision. The government is floating the radical angle to discredit us. It is a ploy to avoid talks.It is Parliament’s prerogative to pass laws. Why should the government repeal the farm laws meant for all states?Tikait: Because the farmers for whom these laws have been made don’t want it.But protests are confined to Punjab, Haryana and western UP?Tikait: The protests are happening in Gujarat, too. More than 100 farmers there have been detained and their families don’t know their whereabouts.Rajewal: The protest sites around Delhi have farmers from Karnataka, Orissa and Chhattisgarh. In that sense, it is a pan-India agitation now.How challenging is it for you to steer an agitation of 32 ideologically diverse organisations?Tikait: If Atal Bihari Vajpayee could run a coalition government of so many parties, why can’t we manage this?Would you give an assurance that during the chakka jam on February 6, there will be no violence?Rajewal: Our agitation was peaceful, is peaceful and will remain so in future. It will be 100% peaceful tomorrow (on Saturday). We have full control over our farmers.In Punjab, there are apprehensions that the agitation may disturb peace and communal harmony. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh says Pakistan may exploit the surcharged atmosphere in the border state.Tikait: We won’t let that happen at any cost.Rajewal: Communal harmony will remain intact in Punjab. I can guarantee that.There is brewing local disenchantment because of the disruption caused by the protests. Is there a possibility of clashes with local communities in urban areas because of your prolonged sit-in?Tikait: We have not blocked the road. The police have barricaded them.Rajewal: Initially, the local people were apprehensive for a few days. But now they have opened their homes for farmers. They are supporting us fully.If no talks happen in the near future, how long will you be able sustain the agitation?Tikait: Second phase will last till October 2. We will decide the course after that.The government believes that the union leaders have a different agenda.Tikait: We are not tricksters. We have no hidden agenda. Our only agenda is that farmers’ ‘roti-roji’ (livelihood and income) should not go into traders’ ‘tijori’ (safes).The government says the opposition parties rallying behind farmers had supported the agri reforms when they were in power.Tikait: Political leaders have their own way when in power. But we are espousing farmers’ interests. We will fight anyone going against that.What will be the political fallout of the agitation?Tikait: We are not doing anything for votes or politics. Anyone who wants to exploit it politically can do it on his own.Rajewal: Voters will get educated and understand how to deal with politicians.What’s your relationship with the BJP now?Tikait: I have relations with all parties. We go by the government’s policies. If they are against farmers, we will oppose that to any extent no matter who is in power.Are there any back channels with the government?Tikait: Our manch (platform) and panch (representatives) will remain the same. Whatever talks happen will only be through them. Singhu will remain our platform.There is a view that the global outpouring of solidarity for farmers’ protest has hurt India’s image.Tikait: Then, let them repeal the laws. What comes first: The country or traders?What is your next course of action?Tikait: The next target is to involve 40 lakh tractors. From Saturday, farmers will bring soil and water from their villages from all over the country. While the government is putting spikes around the protest sites, we will sow flowers here. That will connect our agitation with rural India.The tractor will be the symbol of our agitation and gaon ki mitti and paani (soil and water from villages) will be its devta (presiding deity).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-interview-tikait-rajewal-say-centre-should-give-up-insistence-on-norepeal-101612561440776.html
06-02-2021||India||Oppn unable to point out flaws in farm laws: Tomar||Protests against three farm laws are limited to “one state” where cultivators are misguided by Opposition parties and the government’s offer to amend provisions doesn’t mean the reform legislation were flawed, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Friday, as the 15-hour debate on agriculture issues in the Rajya Sabha concluded.Speaking in the Upper House, Tomar said the Opposition labelled the three laws as “black law” but couldn’t find a single shortcoming in the legislation. “Opposition is continuously saying this is a black law and should be repealed. I am holding meetings with farmers unions for the last several months. I’m asking the same question to them also, what are the black provisions in these bills? Till now, I’m waiting for their reply,” he said.The 15 hour-long discussion in Rajya Sabha on the motion of thanks to the President’s address concluded on Friday. As many as 50 speakers from 25 parties participated in the debate, including 18 from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), five from Congress, and 27 from other parties.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to reply to the debate on Monday, even as no discussions have taken place in the Lok Sabha because of disruptions by the Opposition. Modi, who customarily addresses Lok Sabha first, was scheduled to speak in the LS on Friday.Tomar said the government’s offer to amend some provisions were meant to assuage farmer sentiments and did not mean the laws had any flaws. He also said the protests were limited to only one state. “People in a particular state are misinformed. Farmers are being misled that others would occupy their land if these laws are implemented. Let me know if there is a single provision in contract farming law which allows any trader to snatch away the land of any farmer,” he said, in a clear reference to Punjab though he did not name any state.To be sure, while farmers from Punjab started the agitation, protests have spread in Haryana, western UP and Rajasthan, and mahapanchayats called by farm leaders in these states have seen massive crowds.The minister said the government wanted to double farmer incomes and expand the contribution of agriculture to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). “These agriculture laws are also an important step in this direction. I want to tell this House and farmers that PM Modi is committed towards welfare of farmers,” he added.For 72 days, farm unions have camped outside Delhi against the three laws that cultivators say favour big corporations. The government has refuted the concerns, and offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but talks are currently locked in a stalemate. Opposition parties — including the Congress, Shiv Sena, Shiromani Akali Dal, Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party and Left parties — attacked the Centre.Sena MP Sanjay Raut criticised the government for dubbing the protests “anti-national”. “When the farmers are uniting and fighting for their rights, you see anti-national acts. They are not anti-nationals or Khalistanis,” he said.Congress MP Pratap Singh Bajwa accused the Centre of passing farm laws amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Today we have cut electricity, water supply, internet supply of our own farmers.”His party colleague Anand Sharma criticised the violence on Republic Day. “We have become internet shutdown capital of the world. It is time to mend ways, especially during this Parliament session,” he said, referring to the snapping of internet at protest sites.Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge accused the Centre of lying about MSP. “They (Centre) lie regarding MSP. Modi ji never stops saying that Congress did not increase MSP, [the] reality is in Congress’ time MSP increased by 219%, they only increased a little over 40%,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-unable-to-point-out-flaws-in-farm-laws-tomar-101612561262771.html

Across the years, the couple have been to over a 100 destinations in 20 states on trains and buses but never on the plane, returning frequently to their “base camp” in DLF Phase 3.

06-02-2021||India||‘Kerala lobby’ stamp on Congress Lok Sabha strategy||lFor long, the Kerala lobby was synonymous with hardliners in the CPI(M). Over the past three days, the Congress has witnessed the emergence of its own Kerala lobby.These are the hardliners who have played, and continue to play, a key role in deciding the party’s floor strategy in the budget session of Lok Sabha. Two party leaders said many party MPs from other states too, have sided with the dominant views of party which also got backing of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi in a meeting of Opposition leaders on Thursday. Fifteen out of 51 seats of the Congress in the Lok Sabha are from Kerala.At the core of this disruption is the Opposition’s demand for a separate debate in the Lok Sabha on the farmers’ issue; in the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition has agreed to extend the debate on the President’s speech by five hours and incorporating the debate on the farm stir into it.According to at least five Congress MPs, even as MPs such as Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor were in favour of the debate, many Kerala MPs, especially those elected for the first time, along with their Punjab and Tamil Nadu counterparts, preferred to continue protests for a separate debate on the farm stir.On Wednesday, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha leadership of the Congress received a missive from Rahul Gandhi: the party should continue to protest if the government did not accept the Opposition’s demand for a separate debate on farmers’ issues.But minutes later, the RS leadership of the Congress, along with other Opposition parties, negotiated with the government’s floor managers to extend the time for debate on the President’s speech by five hours.Congress leaders in the LS, however, took a different tactical line and continued to disrupt the Lower House asking for a separate debate on farm issues. Now, party leaders of the two Houses are blaming each other, widening the fissures within the party.Gandhi has signalled his approval for the party’s stand in the LS, asserting that a separate discussion is “absolutely essential”. “We could have found a solution to the impasse and a debate would have also helped us to put forward our views. But many in the party believed that we must continue the protests,” said a senior Congress MP, asking not to be named.Another Congress MP said: “Some of our colleagues argued that since the elections are due in Kerala and Tamil Nadu in April-May, such protests would help the party.” Some RS leaders of the Congress, however, maintained that their stand was “correct” and that their Lok Sabha counterparts were too rigid. “Parliament is for debate not fighting. We have made the same points in our debate. Rajya Sabha leaders did the right thing. We found a solution. Neither before nor after the president’s speech but during the debate,” said a senior Congress leader in RS who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-lobby-stamp-on-congress-lok-sabha-strategy-101612560522993.html
06-02-2021||India||Modi may reply to debate on President speech only in Rajya Sabha||With Opposition protests showing no sign of relenting in the Lok Sabha, the ongoing budget session could mark a new event in India’s parliamentary history — the Prime Minister replying to the debate on the President’s speech only in the Upper House.Prime Ministers have not participated in the debate on the President’s address in the Lower House only twice — in 1999 and 2009. But on both occasions, the PMs —Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the first instance and Manmohan Singh in the second — didn’t speak in the Rajya Sabha either.In 1999, then deputy PM LK Advani replied to the motion of thanks on the President’s speech in the Lok Sabha and Union minister Jaswant Singh, the leader of the Rajya Sabha, spoke in the Upper House. In 2009, Union minister and leader of Lok Sabha Pranab Mukherjee replied in both Houses. There are, however, four instances of the PM not addressing the Upper House but speaking only in the LS.The Lok Sabha is yet to approve the motion on the President’s speech, a signal that the government is still hopeful of ending this impasse. Prime Minister Modi was scheduled to reply in the Lok Sabha on Friday, but disruptions washed out three consecutive days of proceedings. Now, the PM is scheduled to speak in the Rajya Sabha at 10.30 am on Monday, and if he does, it will be uncharted territory in India’s parliamentary history.To be sure, there is still a chance that the PM may not speak in the Rajya Sabha and get a senior Union minister, such as Rajnath Singh, to address the RS instead.A senior Congress and a Trinamool leader said they “might walk out of the Rajya Sabha during the PM’s reply”. They both asked not to be named. Another Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha said that “protests and disruptions will return in the Rajya Sabha if the PM says nothing substantial on the farmers’ issues”.A senior minister said, “Talks are not yet over with the Opposition. That’s why we have delayed seeking the Lok Sabha’s approval for the motion on the President speech. If there is an agreement, we can still discuss the speech in the next week.”The opposition parties are, meanwhile, looking to recalibrate their Lok Sabha tactics next week. A meeting of more than 17 opposition parties will be called on Monday to review their strategy in the Lower House and to take a call on whether the Opposition will continue to disrupt through the budget debate too, or allow the debate on general budget to continue.Some non-Congress parties are keen to participate in the budget debate as it will be the last major debate in Parliament before the assembly elections in April-May. “We are hopeful that a solution would be arrived at. Let’s see.”Some Opposition parties have not ruled out the possibility of resuming the Presidential debate in the LS next week. “But for that, the Congress needs to recalibrate its stand,” said a non-UPA leader.On Friday, too, LS Speaker Om Birla continued discussions with different parties but the logjam persisted as the government emissaries remained non-committal on the demand to allow an exclusive discussion on farm issues before the budget debate.Former secretary general P Sreedharan said, “Usually, such an impasse is resolved at a higher level and not in discussions with floor leaders. It is unfortunate that the PM was not given a chance to speak on the President’s speech. But there’s still hope as the motion on the speech has not been approved in the LS yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modimay-reply-to-debate-on-president-speech-only-in-rajya-sabha-101612560265857.html
06-02-2021||India||Mossad team joins NIA in embassy blast probe||A team from Israel’s spy agency, Mossad, on Wednesday met the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to exchange leads gathered so far in the bomb blast outside former’s embassy in New Delhi on January 29, which, according to initial investigation, points to an Iranian hand, people familiar with the development said.A Mossad team specially flew in from Tel Aviv earlier this week to assist Indian agencies in the probe. Sleuths from both countries are coordinating to identify Iranian suspects who could be behind the attack as well as technical data being gathered from several social media accounts. Israel’s Ambassador to India, Dr Ron Malka said after the blast that his country would cooperate with India to investigate the case.Investigations have revealed that the low intensity blast neat Israeli Embassy and Jindal House on Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Road has no connection with a suspicious package found outside the Israeli embassy in Paris on the same day.Subsequently, forensic experts have ruled out any traces of PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) in the Improvised Explosive Device (IED), which was fitted in a beverage can and attached to a tiny timer before it was placed near a palm tree on the pavement at Abdul Kalam Road. “Experts have said that the PETN, even in small amount, would have caused much bigger impact at the blast site,” said an officer involved in the investigations, requesting anonymity.Unfortunately for agencies, there is no eyewitness who saw anyone placing the IED near the pavement and the CCTV cameras on the stretch have not provided any leads.In its First Information Report (FIR), reviewed by HT, NIA has said “the blast caused a crater near the palm tree”.According to the FIR : “Information was received at 5.20 pm in the office of Special Cell (Delhi Police) that a blast has occurred nearby. On visit of Special Cell Inspector, a post blast crime scene was found near Jindal House, Bungalow Number 5, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road. A crater due to IED blast was found near the palm tree on the pavement. Due to the impact of the explosion, windows of three cars (Hyundai Creta, Ford Ecosport and Maruti WagonR), which were parked on the opposite side of the road, were found shattered.”It added : “Several IED components were found scattered nearby the explosion spot. An envelope folded inside a closed poly pack was also found at the spot”.HT has previously reported that a letter addressed to Malka by the perpetrators of the attack was found at the spot.The government termed the blast a terrorist act and handed over the probe to NIA due to its “international implications”.A second officer familiar with the matter said there is strong reason to suspect an Iranian involvement.“29th anniversary of India-Israel’s diplomatic relation; letter left at the site seeking to avenge the killings Iran Quds Commander Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mehdhi Al Muhandis, who were killed in a US drone attack in January 2020, and Iranian nuclear physicist Dr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who died in a car bomb attack in Iran in November 2020; and the bitter relationship between Iran and Israel known bitter relations, “ this person added.The Iranian embassy could not be contacted for a comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mossad-team-joins-nia-in-embassy-blast-probe-101612559319622.html
06-02-2021||India||Chakka jam: Barricades, thousands of policemen on watch today||The farmer protest sites at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders have been hemmed in with multilayered barricading and are being heavily patrolled ahead of Saturday’s three-hour long nationwide highway blockade, “the chakka jam”, called by farmers to intensify their protest against the new farm laws.The Delhi Police on Friday reiterated that no permission has been granted to protesters for holding the chakka jam or any other demonstration in the city and legal action will be taken against those found disrupting the city’s traffic and law and order.The protest sites are under multilayered barricading with barbed wiring on top, concrete walls, trenches, nails boards drilled onto roads and netting to stop pelted stones, besides a heavy contingent of security personnel armed with anti-riot gear. These measures, the police said, were to keep the farmers from entering the national capital on Saturday.The police have also started monitoring content on social media to keep a watch on those spreading rumours or instigating people against the government and the police, senior officers said.Even though the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farm unions that are part of the ongoing agitation against the three contentious agriculture laws, has announced that “there will be no chakka jam inside Delhi”, police said they have tightened the security arrangements, especially on all borders connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, keeping in view the January 26 violence during the farmers’ tractor rally.Officers said checking of vehicles at the city border points has been intensified since Friday evening to ensure that protesters or antisocial elements were not entering the city for Saturday’s traffic blockade.Apart from thousands of Delhi Police personnel, nearly 15,000 personnel from the paramilitary forces of Rapid Action Force (RAF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) – all armed with anti-riot equipment – will be on duty to maintain Delhi’s law and order during the chakka jam, officers in the know of Saturday’s security arrangements said.“A full-scale police deployment will be in place at all borders and on streets across the city on Saturday. Traffic police personnel will also be deployed in full strength to regulate traffic. While our prime focus will be on maintaining traffic as well as law and order, those attempting to disturb these will be dealt with strongly as per law. We are in touch with the police force of other states as well,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.On Friday morning, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava held a meeting with senior police officers and reviewed security arrangements. Shrivastava, on Thursday, had attended a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah at the Parliament complex to review the security situation in Delhi-NCR ahead of the chakka jam. National security advisor Ajit Doval was also present at that meeting.Farmer unions on Monday had announced a countrywide “peaceful and non-violent” chakka jam on February 6 when they would block national and state highways for three hours (between noon and 3pm) in protest against the internet ban in areas near their agitation sites; harassment allegedly meted out to them by authorities; and other issues. They have declared that all emergency and essential services such as ambulances and school buses will not be stopped.Elaborating on the security arrangements, a senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said police personnel who will be on duty Saturday have been asked to report to their area of deployment by 7am. Every police station has been asked to keep ready for action at least one sub-inspector and four to five constables along with buses in which arrested or detained persons can be moved away.Police said they have intelligence inputs that protesters may deflate tyres of vehicles to cause jams on roads, all the police stations have been asked to keep air pumps with them for filling up deflated tyres. “Cranes have also been arranged to remove such vehicles and clear the traffic. Videographers and photographers will also be present for capturing the activities of protesters. We will also be using drones for aerial surveillance,” said the officer.According to the intelligence inputs, workers of various political parties and student organisations have planned a foot march from Shaheed Park near Delhi Gate to ITO during the chakka jam. “Anticipating that protesters may incite a confrontation with security personnel, we have asked our staff to remain calm and not get provoked in any manner,” a second police officer said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chakka-jam-barricades-thousands-of-policemen-on-watch-today-101612558361363.html
06-02-2021||India||Police seek Google’s help in ‘toolkit’ probe||The Delhi Police on Friday said they have approached Google, seeking assistance in identifying the author/creator of the “toolkit” or document, that allegedly detailed an action plan for online and offline protests associated with the ongoing farmers’ agitation.The police registered an FIR in to probe the “tookit”, which was tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, on Thursday. In her tweet, Thunberg supported the protest by the farmers against the three farm laws passed by the Parliament in September.In their letter to Google, police have sought details of the IP address and details of two e-mail accounts through which the document was created. Police have also asked for the dates and identity of the person, IP addresses, who made changes to the original document after it was created, said a senior police officer who declined to be named.“Since the toolkit was drafted using Google Docs, we have sent a letter to Google and have asked for details of the person who drafted its content and circulated it on social media platforms. It will help us trace the author’s location and the chain involved in the circulation of the toolkit. What happened in Delhi was a copy-cat version of what is mentioned in the tool kit. Tracing the owner of the tool will help us understand his/her role in the conspiracy and links to other people or groups involved in fueling the violence,” the officer said.Separately, police are also trying to get details of the Instagram account mentioned on the original toolkit, through which a live session was screened.On Friday morning, police commissioner SN Shrivastava chaired a meeting with top officials of the cyber cell. During the meeting, the officers discussed the line of investigation and on the steps to follow, as the investigation involves people and companies outside India.“In the days leading to the violence on Republic Day, we identified the source of the many Twitter handles and found them to be outside India. They started using specific hashtags and uploaded fake photographs to create unrest. The toolkit was a blueprint of what was to happen. Fake news was being circulated on the social media, which fanned the tension. Take these things holistically and you will release that it was a conspiracy right from the start,” said an officer of the cyber cell.Police take out photos of suspects in R-Day caseDelhi police have said they have acquired photographs of over 70 suspects after analysing video clips available with them. Of the 70-plus suspects, many were masked, carried sticks and metal rods, and were involved in the clashes with security personnel,“We are in the process of identifying these suspects. Their photographs are being shared with police stations in Delhi and the adjoining states,” said an investigator who did not want to be named.So far, the city police have arrested 124 persons while two minor boys have been apprehended in connection with the incidents of January 26 and 29 (stone-pelting between a group of men claiming to be locals and farmers). The last person arrested was Dharmendra Singh Harman, a taxi-operator, from his home south Delhi’s Arjun Nagar on Wednesday for the vandalism and violence at Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day.Police have already announced a reward of ₹6 lakh reward on eight suspects, including Punjab actor Deep Sidhu and Jugraj Singh, identified by the police as the one who hoisted a religious flag at the Red Fort during the Republic Day violence.“All of them are absconding and the last location of their cellphones were in Sonepat on the day of the violence,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-seek-google-s-help-in-toolkit-probe-101612557751574.html
06-02-2021||India||Delhi not to be impacted by ‘chakka jam’, say farmer leaders||The three-hour ’chakka jam’ on Saturday afternoon to protest against the three farm laws will not impact Delhi and the national capital region (NCR), Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers unions which is spearheading the agitation, said on Friday. Farm leader Rakesh Tikait also said on Friday that there will be no blockade in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“Only national and state highways across the country will be jammed from 12 noon to 3 pm. Emergency and essential services like ambulance, school bus, etc. will not be stopped... All roads for entering into Delhi will remain open except where farmers’ protest sites are already located,” said a statement issued by Darshan Pal, a leader of SKM.The chakka jam will be a part of a series of events scheduled by the farmers’ groups to press their demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws passed by the Parliament in September to deregulate agricultural trade. On January 7, the farmers protesting at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and others took out a tractor march on the eastern and western peripheral expressways which form a ring around the national capital.On January 26, the protesters took out a tractor parade and barged into the city deviating from the routes approved by the police by breaking barriers and clashed with the cops at several points. Hundreds of farmers also reached Red Fort and vandalised the monument.Even though the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has assured that the event will remain peaceful, police have made extensive arrangements to meet any eventuality.Tikait said farmers in UP and Uttarakhand will only submit memorandums to the administration. He said they will be on “standby” in case they are needed to rush to Delhi’s borders at a short notice. “They (farmers in UP and Uttarakhand) can be called to Delhi (borders) anytime and they need to be on standby,” Tikait told a news channel.Tikait’s associate, Arjun Balyan Tikait, said the decision to keep UP and Uttarakhand was also taken in view of the sugarcane cultivation season.The statement issued by the SKM did not mention Tikait’s claim. While Darshan Pal remained unavailable for queries, one of his team members said that there was no conflict.“The farmers in some parts will not be involved in chakka jam because they are busy harvesting sugarcane. In some states, on the other hand, the chakka jam will be much more intense as farmers there will block internal roads as well,” said SKM media coordinator, Harinder, who goes by a single name.The chakka jam will take place between 12noon and 3pm and it will be “completely peaceful and non-violent”, SKM said.“Protesters are asked to not to indulge in any confrontation with the government officials or ordinary citizens,” said SKM leader Darshan Pal.The event will conclude with farmers honking from their vehicles continuously and simultaneously for one minute when the clock strikes 3pm.PREPARATIONS ON AT DELHI’S BORDERSWhile no specific activity has been planned for Delhi the three border points where farmers are protesting, the police as well as farmers were busy preparing for the event on Friday.At the Singhu Border, the police on Friday added yet another layer of barbed barricading, several hundred metres away from the main stage. At Tikri border too, the police set up an extra layer of barriers using concrete barricades and iron nails. They also installed layers of nets in anticipation of stone pelting by the protesters.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said in the backdrop of the Republic Day violence adequate security arrangements have been made at all border points. The police are also monitoring social media to curb rumours and coordinating with their counterparts in neighbouring states, Biswal said.Farm leaders urged their supporters in Delhi not to disrupt normal life in the city had a word of advice for office-goers in the NCR. “While we won’t be causing any trouble to commuters, and our chakka jam in NCR towns will be limited to the highways on the city periphery, we urge the public to reach their workplaces before noon and leave after the event ends at 3pm,” said Gurmeet Singh Bhattiwal, vice president of Bharatiya Kisan Union Ekta (Dakonda).“To avoid hassle, they should take internal routes because our focus will be on highways only,” Bhattiwal added.The protesters have also chosen some volunteers to explain the drawbacks of the three farm laws to those who will be stuck on the highways. “If someone gets stuck on the road, our farmers will offer them snacks and lunch and explain to them the problems with the farm laws,” said Mukesh Chander, senior vice-president of Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee.Farmer volunteers have also been instructed to ensure no disturbance to the shared and private vehicles plying along the protest routes. “They threw open their personal bathrooms to us and provided us water at a time when we needed it the most in the early days of our protest. The locals have sacrificed a lot for us and we will do all we can to reduce their troubles,” said Amandeep Singh, a farmer from Amritsar who is a volunteer at Singhu Border.Farmers appealed to their families and friends in the villages to ensure the success of ‘chakka jam’.“Our brothers and sisters in Punjab, Haryana and other states will be blocking roads leading to Delhi with tractors. We have requested for maximum participation,” said Sahil Kamboj from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha at Tikri Border.Rajinder Pal, from Baghpat, who joined the protest at Ghazipur after Republic Day, said it was time for the government to accept the demands of farmers. “We are only here to place one demand which is the withdrawal of the farm laws. We will make sure that none of our men get into any confrontation that may lead to violence during chakka jam. It will be a peaceful demonstration,” Pal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-not-to-be-impacted-by-chakka-jam-say-farmer-leaders-101612557284075.html
06-02-2021||India||HT Interview: IAF chief RKS Bhadauria says indigenisation key to military might||Bengaluru From plans to deploy a locally produced stealth fighter to the focus on indigenisation and the current situation in the Ladakh sector, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria spoke to Rahul Singh on a wide range of issues on the sidelines of Aero India-2021.Edited excerpts:What is the status of India’s fifth-generation fighter programme -- the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA)?I am hopeful that the government approval for the project will come this financial year. I must tell you that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has set a very aggressive timeline for the AMCA. They are looking at a timeline of 2027 to 2030 to put the stealth fighter into production. If that materialises, the fighter should be operationally available to IAF as a squadron by 2032.Will the AMCA have some sixth-generation technologies (more advanced than those in any fighter jet currently in service globally)?A lot of sixth-generation technologies are already being talked about. It is possible for us to look at some of those technologies for the AMCA. While the platform will have fifth-generation stealth design features, a lot more can happen with the sensors, weapons, overall reach, and the aircraft’s capability. There is a possibility of equipping it with directed energy weapons, superior anti-missile systems, advanced missile approach warning systems, and teaming it with unmanned systems. These are some of the areas that will get looked into. It’s critical we start working on those sixth-generation technologies and bring them into the AMCA wherever we are successful. There’s no looking back on the AMCA.What are your thoughts on the ₹48,000-crore LCA-Mk1A project and its future?It’s an advanced indigenous aircraft, and it’s a matter of pride for us to fly our own aircraft. We have graduated from the basic LCA to a much higher level now. In placing the order for the LCA Mk-1A, we have looked at what our requirements will be over the next decade. It will have superior weapons, radar, fully integrated electronic warfare systems and a level of sensor fusion that is going to be relevant in the next decade. The LCA Mk-1A brings a lot to the table in terms of capability. It’s no longer just an indigenous project that we must support but it’s something that will give IAF a strong capability enhancement.What do you think of LCA Mk-1A’s export potential?Quality, cost competitiveness and timely deliveries are important factors for the aircraft’s export potential to finally materialise. These are issues that the industry must take care of as we expand further. Orders will come and we will have to demonstrate that the Indian industry will supply the right stuff in good time and also be cost competitive.The last of the 83 LCA Mk-1A’s ordered will be inducted into the IAF in 2030. Any concerns about technology getting outdated?Some of those aspects were factored when the order was placed in terms of the level of IAF’s specifications. So it will not get outdated, but in another 10 years there will surely be better sensors and weapons around. But the best part of having indigenous technology is that whatever upgrades take place in sensors, weapons, electronics and avionics hereafter, we will be able to integrate them into the aircraft as we have the intellectual property rights, the methodology, and the capability. Then we will also have the LCA Mk-2 that will be a further development of Mk-1A. It will fill the gap between Mk-1A and AMCA.The border row with China saw India make some last-minute critical weapon imports. How do you see that in the context of the focus of indigenisation?When you look at the long-term picture, indigenisation is the most important aspect we need to concentrate on. If we have to be a strong military power, it has to be on indigenous defence capability. And that is our focus.What is the situation in the Ladakh sector?China has continued to strengthen its defences during the last three to four months. They have been making efforts to strengthen their deployments and upgrade their infrastructure. There has been no change in our deployment, and we are very much there. If the talks go well and there is disengagement and de-escalation, then we will take a view on changing our deployments. Currently, our deployments match theirs. If status quo does not change, we will take action on the basis of the real situation on the ground.Is the IAF happy with the budget given to it?Despite the effect of the pandemic on the economy, we have got a good allocation under the capital head. Our capital budget is 20% more than last year’s. It will help us to continue with our modernisation and also to look at building important combat capability in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-interview-iaf-chief-rks-bhadauria-says-indigenisation-key-to-military-might-101612554840166.html
06-02-2021||India||Maratha quota law: Supreme Court to hear appeals from March 8||The Supreme Court (SC) will start hearing appeals challenging quotas for the Maratha community in jobs and education from March 8, a five-judge bench said on Friday, fixing a schedule for the significant case that can shape India’s caste-based reservation policy.The Constitution Bench examining the 2018 Maharashtra law, which granted quotas to the community, said it was open to hearings either virtually or in person, if physical hearings resume in the top court by then.“The learned counsels submit that there is already consideration of starting physical hearing in the month of March 2021 in this court in a limited manner. Be that as it may, the hearing in these matters will start from March 8 by physical or virtual mode… We propose to start the hearing on March 8 and complete by March 18,” said the bench comprising justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhatt.The bench also said it was open to hearing arguments challenging the SC’s 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment that fixed a cap of 50% on caste-based reservation. The 2018 law breached the 50% reservation threshold.The schedule was decided with the consent of Maharashtra government, the petitioners, the intervenors and attorney general KK Venugopal, who was asked to assist the court.The SC asked petitioners challenged the law to open arguments on March 8 and conclude by March 10. The state was allotted three days – March 12, 15, 16 to respond to the petitions. One day –March 17 – was kept for private parties and intervenors, and on the final day – March 18 -- the court would hear Venugopal.On two previous occasions, Maharashtra government, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, sought an adjournment on the grounds that a case of this nature would require physical hearing.On Friday, the bench told Rohatgi, “If you press for physical hearing, you need to be present.” The SC also asked the parties to submit a brief note of their arguments by the end of February.The 2018 law originally provided 16% reservation to Marathas and came after years of protests by the community.In June 2019, the Bombay high court trimmed the quantum of the quota to 12% in education and 13% in jobs. In its order, the high court said the 50% cap could be breached in exceptional circumstances. Soon after, petitioners moved the top court and contended that the law breached the 50% reservation threshold. As the Indra Sawhney case was decided by a bench of nine judges, various parties sought reference of the case to a bench of 11 judges to conclusively settle the issue.On September 9, 2020, a three-judge SC bench referred petitions challenging the Maratha quota law to a five-judge Constitution Bench and stayed the operation of the law for the current year.On Friday, Rohatgi informed the five-judge bench that in a separate case, another bench of the Supreme Court opined in August 2020 that the Indra Sawhney judgment needed a re-look. This question is pending consideration before a seven-judge bench. “It’s not that Indra Sawhney is cast in stone,” Rohatgi said. The bench replied, “We are bound by the Indra Sawhney judgment.

06-02-2021||India||UPSC aspirants to get another chance: Govt||The government offered to provide an extra chance for civil services aspirants to appear for the exam conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), as long as they have age on their side, a move that could benefit around 3,300 candidates.Currently, candidates in the general category can appear up to six times in the exam, with an age limit of 32 years; for those belonging to the scheduled castes and tribes, there is no limit on the number of attempts and the age limit is 37 years.The government’s offer, explained in a note submitted to the Supreme Court, which is hearing a case on this issue, is to allow a seventh attempt, as a one-off, in 2021, to those who have exhausted all their shots at the exam, and are not over the age limit.At least 100 candidates approached the Supreme Court seeking an extra chance citing the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of the petitioners were frontline workers, and contended they did not get sufficient time to prepare. Some of the petitioners were from far flung areas who claimed they could not access study material due to poor internet connectivity. Every year, around 400,000 aspirants appear for the civil services examinations, which is the route into India’s government services.Adopting a compassionate view, a bench of the apex court headed by justice AM Khanwilkar, on January 22, asked the Centre and UPSC to take a considerate approach and grant an extra chance to the petitioners as a one-time exception.On January 25, the government came back with a reply that it was not inclined to grant an extra chance since this would amount to extending “differential treatment” to similarly placed candidates. But the bench, which also included justice Dinesh Maheshwari, was not satisfied with the response.The court had asked additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju, who represented the Centre, that when extra attempts had been given in the past in certain exceptional circumstances, the government should consider it this time too.On Friday, the ASG submitted before the bench that the initial decision has been revised.He submitted a one-page note, which read: “The Union of India is agreeable for the following ex-gratia, one-time, restricted relaxation to be granted to the prospective candidates, subject to the same being part of a consent order, disposing off the petition.”It added: “Relaxation, only to the extent of providing one extra attempt for Civil Service Examination (CSE), specifically limited to CSE-2021, may be granted to only those candidates who appeared for CSE-2020 as their last permissible attempt and are otherwise not age-barred from appearing in CSE-2021.”The note, filed on behalf of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), further stated: “No relaxation shall be granted for CSE-2021 to those candidates who have not exhausted their permissible number of attempts or to those candidates who are otherwise age-barred from appearing in CSE-2021 as per the prescribed age limits of different categories.”ASG Raju also emphasised that the relaxation shall not be treated as a precedent for the future.The bench asked the Centre to circulate the note to all the lawyers appearing in the matter to enable them to respond to the proposal. The case will be heard next on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upsc-aspirants-to-get-another-chance-govt-101612551514123.html
06-02-2021||India||Infection curve down at long last: Is the Covid-19 pandemic ebbing?||The global onslaught of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has started receding for the first time ever, with daily new infections seeing a steady drop for nearly a month – something that has never happened in the 14 months of the pandemic’s run across the world.At a time when the world’s biggest vaccination campaign in history is underway with nearly 120 million doses delivered in 67 countries, a recession such as this may well mark the beginning of the end of a virus outbreak that has changed the world.At least 105 million people have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 across the world and nearly 2.3 million people have died since the end of 2019 – both likely underestimates according to experts.The seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases across the world touched 745,837 on January 11, the highest ever witnessed for the disease. In the 24 days since, the trajectory has changed. This number (also referred to as the daily case trajectory) has dropped every single day and currently stands at 485,005 for the week ending Thursday – a drop of 35% from the peak. This has never happened for such a prolonged period in global cases. There was a week-long drop in infections between December 22 and 29, and that too caused most likely by delayed tests and counts on account of the holiday season.This has meant that the world’s doubling rate of total infections – the number of days it takes for the total number of infections to double – has seen a drastic improvement over the past month. On Thursday, it stood at 148 days, as against 83 days on January 11.This massive turnaround in new infections is fuelled largely by a reversal in trajectory in regions which were so far the biggest Covid-19 hot spots – particularly the US and Europe – and are also regions that have seen the largest roll-out of vaccines so far.In the US, which is the world’s worst-hit country (and by a huge margin) with 27 million cases and 467,000 deaths, the seven-day average of cases has dropped from a peak of 255,125 on January 4 to 129,894 in the last seven days – a fall of 49%. The US, which began its inoculation programme on December 14, has administered at least 35 million doses of Covid vaccine as of Wednesday – the most in the world, according to data maintained by Our World in Data.This turnaround is even more evident in Europe.In the UK and France, the daily case rate in the past week has been 21,246 and 20,568 respectively. At its peak, the UK was reporting 59,344 cases a day on average (for the week ending January 1), while France was reporting 56,378 a day for week ending October 31. This means both have seen a 64% drop from their peak case levels.They are the countries that have been responsible for the fifth and sixth most infections, respectively. Till Thursday, the UK had administered 11 million vaccines doses, while France has given out 1.8 million doses.Similarly, cases in Italy have dropped 67% from their early November peak, while in Germany infections are down 61% from the mid-December peak.India’s turnaround has been by far the most prominent with an 87% drop from peak infection rate. But it has been happening for a far longer period (the only Indian wave peaked on September 16, 2020) to have greatly influenced the recent drop in global infections. When the world trajectory touched 745,837 on January 11, India was reporting just 17,479 daily cases – this means it was only contributing 2% to the world’s infections at the time.To be sure, most of these nations (other than India) have seen two or three distinct waves of infections, so cases have dropped within all these countries before as well — for example, in the UK and France, cases dropped 93% and 97% from their first peaks before rising again, ultimately hitting new records.The situation across the world now is very different. As many as 67 nations have kicked off vaccination drives of varying intensity, and, experts say the Western world, in particular, may just be months away from inoculating enough people to actually manage to bring the infections under control for good.But a new threat has been looming on the horizon: variants of the virus have taken hold in multiple countries, making the Sars-CoV-2 not only spread more rapidly (consequently leading to a higher disease burden) but also give it the capability to resist vaccines (and immunity from past infections) at least in some manner. Averting the next wave will depend on how well the world can scale up the vaccination drive while keeping the virus at bay.Experts said that while numbers are going down, virus mutations remain a big threat.“While any significant drop in infections is a good sign, it is still too early to rule out a yet another resurgence because of a mutation. Two new variants of the virus – from the UK and South Africa – have both caused surges recently. Already the South African variant is appearing to show some resistance to vaccines. We haven’t seen that variant in India yet, but with more than 10 million domestic confirmed cases, we may not need an imported variant at all,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University.“It’s very hard to predict if we will see resurgence of cases. People need to avoid falling in the trap of getting lax about the disease because of case numbers or seroprevalence numbers. The UK is an example of how dynamics regarding the disease can flip quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infection-curve-down-at-long-last-is-the-covid-19-pandemic-ebbing-101612551104019.html

This remark of the Morcha comes after several leaders visited border points in Delhi such as Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and others to offer their support to the farmers, who have been protesting against the laws for 72 days.The farmer groups also announced that none of the protesters would enter the national capital during the ‘chakka jam’- which is a three-hour nationwide highway blockade set to take place tomorrow. “Farmers would provide food and water to the people who will be stuck due to ‘chakka jam’,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait told reporters on Thursday adding that the highway blockade would take place everywhere outside Delhi.Several opposition leaders met Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla on Thursday and demanded a separate discussion on the motion of thanks to the President’s address and the farm laws. “We talked to the speaker for one hour. We want a separate discussion on farmers and do not want the matter of farm laws to be clubbed with the Motion of thanks to the President’s Address. Speaker has no problem with it,” Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Roy had said.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police filed an FIR against the creators of toolkit- a document which detailed an action plan for online and offline protests linked to the farm stir.

06-02-2021||Today's||How not to respond to Greta, Meena, Rihanna||There is a reason that truth is so much more dramatic than fiction could ever hope to. This week has offered a ringside view to the theatre of the absurd. To watch our nation, the world largest democracy, be hysterically rattled by a clutch of tweets on the farm protests, has been utterly embarrassing.That we have such little self-confidence and such narrow shoulders that we could not shrug off a woke, possibly even surface-level intervention by Rihanna, the international pop sensation, says way more about us than it does about her or even about what can often be the western world’s orientalist, saviour complex.So, it doesn’t really matter whether Rihanna’s Umbrella cover for India’s farmers was rooted in any real understanding of the new farm law legislation. Or if Greta Thunberg’s “toolkit” for activism was somewhat formulaic and superficial. Or whether Rupi Kaur, the minimalist poet from Canada, did a short quick verse on a complex issue. Or whether Meena Harris, niece of the United States (US) Vice-President Kamala Harris, was clambering on a liberal bandwagon because it was the trendy cause celebre of the time.None of this is the point.In this case, it barely matters whether you support the farm protests or not. Or which side of the divide you are on about the options before the police after the fracas on Republic Day.Governments should be responding to other governments, if at all. And unless Rihanna is now a republic, the stodgy, fuming intervention by the ministry of external affairs was unnecessary. It catapulted the issue into the global headlines. As Hannah Ellis Petersen, South Asia correspondent for The Guardian, told me, “If the government had not responded, Rihanna’s tweet would have been just one line in my piece.”Even more cringeworthy was the coordinated celebrity endorsement from India’s most iconic cricketing and Bollywood stars, as if patriotism and standing with India are now the same as peddling soap or soda. Yes, that is what we reduced Indian pride to, as we saw the silly spectacle of similarly worded tweets lambasting outside interference in internal matters. This came from many of the same folks who freely commented on the George Floyd murder in the US and the Black Lives Matter movement because it was fashionable to do so. The obvious absence of spontaneity in this orchestrated chorus only makes it strike a false note. And this from folks who never take a public position on any contentious issue in India, ever.Worst of all, the same people who want “foreigners” to mind their own business are now parsing the US state department statement on the farm laws and latching onto the bits that strengthen the government’s stand. How can we play this out both ways — resist foreign commentary, but selectively hold on to it as well?Since their tweets, posters of Meena Harris, Greta Thunberg and Rihanna have been burnt. Our television channels have lived up to their reputation for dangerous mindlessness by running character assassination campaigns. The police have registered a case, like they don’t have the actual issue of the farm protests in the real world to deal with.And the full force of vile, ugly misogyny has been unleashed against these and other women, in language that is both vile and violent. Some of us live with this every day on Twitter and are almost numbed by this bootcamp version of coarse sexism. But as Meena Harris tweets passionately about not being intimidated — and rightly so — what was just a kerfuffle is becoming a full-blown diplomatic fracas.In any case, if you build barricades of cement, snap internet lines, place iron rods, nails and spikes at the sites where a majority of farmers have been protesting peacefully, it is inevitably going to get global attention. This is where the government’s attention should have been instead of going all churlish and petty over a handful of tweets.There are complex questions that could have been posed to Greta Thunberg, as the excellent economist Shruti Rajagopalan did, in seeking to know why the climate activist backed crops that used up so much water. There are many fair counters to the broad strokes in which India’s police have been painted, especially given that close to 400 police personnel have been injured.We do not have to be trapped in the simple-minded binaries of the western world.But when we respond in this manner, we have just gone and proven their point.As we sought to stand against propaganda, we end up looking like we are teaching the class on propaganda.And not very smartly at that.Barkha Dutt is an award-winning journalist and author The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-not-to-respond-to-greta-meena-rihanna-101612532430228.html
06-02-2021||Today's||Recognising housework: Is paying the only way?||In January, the Supreme Court directed an insurance company to pay a higher claim amount by taking into account the unpaid work performed by a deceased homemaker. This was a welcome step, but the question is: How do we measure women’s unpaid work? Certainly, monetary value can be associated with the domestic and caregiving roles performed by women.When women put in the time to provide care or perform domestic chores, it takes them away from paid work, restricts their participation in social and political activities, and reduces their leisure time. Additionally, evidence from community-based organisations from around the world suggests that the burden of managing these responsibilities forces women to either take up low-quality jobs in the informal economy because they are part-time and allow them flexibility, or forces them to engage younger adolescents in such work — in India, various estimates suggest that approximately 94% women work in the informal, unorganised sector. Either way, unpaid work performed by women and girls fundamentally alters their life opportunities.However, there are at least five challenges to compensating women for their unpaid work. First, how does one accord value to such work? One option is to use an imputed cost approach to capture value, based on market rates provided for such work, as the United Nations Human Development Report did in 1995. But this ignores the emotions that go behind providing such work. How, for instance, can we assign a market wage to the care provided by a mother to her child? There is additional labour that goes into planning, supervising and budgeting for household tasks, which might be missed during such valuations.Second, while time-use surveys (TUS; measures time spent by individuals in different activities) carried out in India in 1998-99, and then in 2019, have tried to make visible this unpaid productive work, some of these activities are not reported by women themselves as they do not think of it as work (since it is not paid).Third, there is a continuum between unpaid and paid work that applies to women. The (often) unpaid hours put in as family labour overlap intermittently with other household work — there are no neat divisions. Think of a woman taking care of her child while curing fish which can be sold by her husband in the haat. She would not be able to distinguish between the two when a TUS enumerator asks her.Fourth, there is a problem with announcing housework as a woman’s job. It runs the risk of stereotyping women as home-workers and men as breadwinners. In a situation where one of the most important policy concerns is the disappearance of women from the labour force, institutionalising such patriarchal constructs may not help.Data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey indicates that less than a quarter of women in India are available for work or are working, and if the latest Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy estimates are to be believed, more may have dropped off after the pandemic.Finally, there is the question of who should compensate for unpaid housework. A decade ago, there was a demand in a similar vein asking husbands to pay wages to their wives for the housework that they do. This was rejected by the ministry of women and child development then due to its infeasibility. A simple transfer of money from husband to wife within the household may not work; rather, a more carefully formed State-supported policy announcement may have to be thought of.So what can be done?The first step is to think of methods to assign appropriate values to domestic and care work as a way of reclaiming women’s dignity of work. One way to do this is to use time as a valuing measure, and TUS can be used to assign market wages to the number of hours of work put in by women. This can help produce extended labour statistics, account for the millions of missing women in the labour force, help formulate labour market policies especially for women, and help the government account for the non-market household economy. Investments in data systems to enable regular time use surveys will help complement the labour force surveys and make women’s work visible.A State-supported gender-neutral income transfer at the household level should also be considered. Such an announcement, however, needs to be bereft of stereotyping women into specific roles within the household.Indian women face an immense burden of care work, and they will not be able to move away from it unless India universalises maternity entitlements and childcare as a public good. While it is a welcome attempt to provide worth to housework, steps to reduce and redistribute such work are perhaps more important than asking for women’s unpaid work to be monetised, even notionally. They are important to ensure women’s rights and a sense of social justice.Soumya Kapoor Mehta is head and Sona Mitra is principal economist, Initiative for What Works to Advance Women and Girls in the Economy, associated with LEAD at Krea UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/recognising-housework-is-paying-the-only-way-101612532127348.html
06-02-2021||Today's||The trinity of patriarchy, poverty and the pandemic||Growing up in a village in Rajasthan’s Ajmer district, Kamini (not her real name) dreamed of joining the police. But the daughter of a daily wage labourer had to drop out after completing the eighth grade — the high school was too far away and, moreover, she had to do the household chores.Growing up in a village in Rajasthan’s Ajmer district, Kamini (not her real name) dreamed of joining the police. But the daughter of a daily-wage labourer had to drop out after completing Class 8 — the high school was too far away and, moreover, she had to do the household chores.An intervention by Educate Girls, a non-governmental organisation, led her to rejoin school, eventually reaching the 12th grade. Then the pandemic hit. Schools were shut, exams postponed and links with the outside world snapped.When the dust had cleared, Naresh, a social worker who uses one name, took a headcount. Three girls, including the 17-year-old Kamini, had gone missing. Like many girls in their village, they had been married off as children. But custom dictated that their gauna — when they would join their matrimonial homes — would take place years later. Now, they had been abruptly dispatched.An unholy trinity of the pandemic, poverty and patriarchy has led to a surge in child marriage, say activists.India is home to the world’s largest number of child brides with 1.5 billion girls below 18 being married, according to Unicef. Until the pandemic hit, we had been making progress. Thanks largely to rising school enrolment of girls, under-18 marriages had come down from 47% in 2005-06 to 27% in 2015-16. There is a link between keeping girls in school and delaying marriage. “When a girl is sitting at home, the whole village says ‘get her married’,” one girl in her first year of college told me.We are in danger of losing this gain due to the pandemic. As this newspaper reported, 166,000 students, girls and boys, in Delhi government and municipal schools have fallen off the grid as a result of education moving online. One can only speculate on how many will eventually return to school, and whether some have already joined the labour force or been married off.Given the unusual disruption, a government proposal to raise the minimum age of marriage for women to 21 is mistimed and misplaced. The priority is not to tinker with a globally acceptable age for marriage and the age of adulthood for most matters, including voting, in this country but to figure out how to keep girls in school.If the issue is removing gender discrimination, then reduce the minimum age of marriage for men to 18.Raising the age from 18 to 21 for women, fears lawyer Madhu Mehra, will extend parental control in a country where “love” marriages are frowned upon. “A high number of elopement cases are prosecuted by families. If you increase the age, our courts will be clogged and the harm to young people will be enormous,” she warns.Child and adolescent marriage is a consequence of girls dropping out of school, not a cause. One way to delay marriage is to get girls to remain in school. Enable dreams and aspirations, and the problem of child marriage will take care of itself.Namita Bhandare writes on gender The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-trinity-of-patriarchy-poverty-and-the-pandemic-101612529066759.html
06-02-2021||Editorials||Reconsider the Seventh Schedule||The sharing of financial resources between the Union and states, and inter se, among states, is key in any federal democracy. The Constitution, through Article 280 to 281, provides for a unique mechanism in the form of finance commissions for devolution of resources. The final report of the 15th Finance Commission (2021-26) is now public. The first thing most states, for whom the finance commission award is a lifeline, look to is the devolution formula. This has been maintained at 41%, which is a slight downward adjustment because of the creation of two new Union Territories.Each successive finance commission has offered unique recommendations. The 10th Finance Commission, for instance, suggested all central taxes be shared with the states. The 14th Finance Commission was a watershed, having increased the share of states in net proceeds of Union tax revenues to 42% from 32%. There are many forward-looking recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission too. But beyond the report, there is one suggestion articulated by its chairman, NK Singh, that stands out. In an interview, he somewhat provocatively asked if the Seventh Schedule has outlived its utility. This newspaper, like Mr Singh, believes it has.The Seventh Schedule divides subjects under the exclusive domain of the Union, states and common Centre-state jurisdiction, classifying them into the Union, State and Concurrent List. Over time, the Union has transgressed into subjects assigned to states for various reasons, including the fact some of these are national priorities and the Centre has obligations going beyond the Schedule. Subjects such as employment and education, for instance, are under the domain of states. Yet, India has justiciable legislation on employment (the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) and education (the Right to Education Act), to name a few. The advent of centrally sponsored schemes has necessitated central outlays in other areas, falling within the State List such as agriculture. A thorough legislative appraisal of the Seventh Schedule to keep pace with changing fiscal priorities is overdue. An expansion of the Concurrent List, for instance, could be considered. But this must be managed democratically and consultatively, while keeping the spirit of federalism intact. It must not become an exercise in greater power-accumulation by the Centre, but an exercise in greater burden-sharing. States will be more willing to come on board only if financial obligations are more evenly shouldered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/reconsider-the-seventh-schedule-101612532487329.html
