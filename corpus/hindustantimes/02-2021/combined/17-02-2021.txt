Because they became IAS (officers), they’ll run fertiliser factories, because they are IAS, they will run chemical factories... even fly planes... What is this big power we have created?” PM Modi asked, questioning the traditional wisdom of vesting all power in the hands of the bureaucracy.“What is this big power we have created? What are we going to achieve by handing the reins of the nation to babus? Just as our babus belong to the country so do the Indian youth,” he said while making it clear that the country was proud of its wealth creators.While PM Modi’s remarks may have been impromptu in Lok Sabha, the idea behind it possibly emanated from a PRAGATI meeting held in January to review key delayed projects in the country. PM Modi’s top aides including his principal secretary PK Mishra and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba were also present at the meeting attended by top secretaries to the Government of India and the state chief secretaries.It is understood that at the meeting, Prime Minister Modi questioned the slow decision-making process within the bureaucracy and pointed to 10-year delays in implementation of railway and highway projects. PM Modi said that he was not concerned by the cost overruns alone but the opportunity lost in terms of economic growth, jobs and the future of people due to these delays. Everyone heard the PM in stunned silence.It was quite evident that PM Modi was very concerned about the bureaucratic decision making in the country. Despite PM Modi making it clear that he will support any bureaucratic decision taken in the interest of the country at a DGP conference in Gujarat in 2018, India's bureaucracy hasn’t made the changes to how it operates and is still process-driven, not result-oriented.That is when they are not protecting their turfs. Officials from premier civil services such as the Indian Foreign Service (IFS), the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), the Indian Police Service (IPS) and the Indian Forest Service (IFoS), have earned a reputation of trying to block anyone from beyond their respective services as if it was their personal fiefdom.This has resulted in the foreign ministry being controlled by IFS, the secretariat in Delhi and state capitals being controlled by IAS and intelligence services and police controlled by IPS with hardly any space left for technical experts from outside the bureaucracy’s mathematical Venn diagram.The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that the Indian armed forces have also been bureaucratised with seniority, not merit, being the yardstick for selection of top commanders. The Indian Army, Air Force and Navy all protect their silos to such an extent that the tri-service joint manship is under threat despite PM Modi taking the path-breaking decision of appointing the first Chief of Defence Staff. Fearing that the kingdom of chiefs will be under threat once the theatre command system takes over, the three services tend to think in isolation though there are costly weapons and equipment overlap. The same bureaucratic rules also apply in DRDO, which is now the bed-rock of Atmanirbhar Bharat in the defence sector. The Indian armed forces are interested in creating more verticals so that more vacancies for generals, admirals and air marshals are created.It is not that India does not need bureaucracy or more officers, particularly in foreign service if the country has global aspirations. With a cadre of just 600 officers, India does not have enough diplomats to pitch the country on bilateral and multilateral platforms. However, thanks to ad-hoc decision making, the foreign secretary in the not-so-distant past decided to reduce the intake of officers rather than do the opposite.The question that one needs to ask is why only IPS suited for intelligence or enforcement jobs, IAS for secretary jobs and IFS for ambassadorial assignment. Why can’t officers from other civil services or technical experts be used for populating these positions on the basis of sheer merit? The cross-fertilization of new ideas with institutionalised frameworks will not only bring innovation but also more energy and synergy.While the PM wants faster decision-making and innovation, the Indian bureaucracy also creates hurdles by dragging its feet on the removal of deadwood. It is this deadwood that in turn plays the spoiler. The socialist model of the past where all private players were out to rob the nation and only IAS babus were the flag-bearers of the nation was and is a flawed model, and has dragged the nation down. This is common knowledge and not rocket science.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/behind-pm-modi-s-stinging-critique-of-bureaucracy-a-jan-meeting-holds-the-clue-101613466487000.html

I have sustained burn injuries on both my hands.”“MSEDCL authorities have promised financial compensation,” he said.Area residents blamed the MSEDCL authorities for its failure and said shoddy work was being carried. The high tension wires must be underground, but in the said area, there are open and pose a serious threat to the lives of commuters and area residents.Dilip Arundekar, a resident, said, “ The wires must be underground, but are lying into open and pose a serious threat to the lives of commuters and area residents.”“Sectional engineer of Sahakarnagar has been asked to conduct an inquiry in the case. The protruding wires came out as there are drainage pipes beneath the two high tension wires which led to sparking. We have completed the work on the same day,” said Rajendra Yedake, additional executive engineer, Market Yard.An electric inspector visited the spot on Wednesday after which a police complaint was lodged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/youth-suffers-burn-injuries-in-minor-explosion-due-to-high-tension-wires-101613586182575.html

The PMC standing committee approved ₹1.4 lakh to develop a 2.5km cycle track from the University chowk to the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) gate. Under the central government’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), the PMC got ₹9.45 crore to initiate different works, such as creating a green buffer, cycle track development, sprinklers, and public awareness activity. Dinkar Gojare, superintendent engineer of the PMC’s road department, said, “There is no cycle track on Pashan road. There was an issue of trees along the roadside. It is a 2.5km stretch which starts from Modern college to the NCL gate. We have designed a track to keep the greenery as it is. The work will be completed within six months.” In 2017, PMC prepared a comprehensive bicycle plan and launched a bicycle sharing scheme in various parts of the city, including at the SPPU, under the Pune Smart City Development Company Limited (PSCDCL). After two years, all three private bicycle companies had withdrawn from the scheme due to lack of response and vandalism of bicycles. Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar has noww allocated around ₹20 crore in the PMC draft budget of 2021-22 to develop a new 10km cycle track as well as revamp existing cycle tracks in the city. As per PMC statistics, there is 98km of existing cycle tracks in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-build-cycle-track-on-pashan-road-101613586063336.html
17-02-2021||Pune||SPPU completes fire and electrical audit for entire campus||After the tragic fire incident of Bhandara district hospital last month, the state government ordered to conduct a safety audit of all the hospitals across Maharashtra and government buildings. Accordingly, the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) conducted a structural and electrical audit of its entire campus, all the departments and hostels. The audit was done by a private agency, with few changes and replacements to be done the audit was done carefully and further work has started. “Basically, after the Bhandara fire incident, the state government had made it mandatory that at least we should go for a structural and electrical audit of the residing facilities mostly the hostels as such. Accordingly, it has been communicated to the colleges affiliated with SPPU and they can get it done from a private agency. On one side we have to take care of students’ safety and therefore it is a welcome decision,” said SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar. “At the SPPU university campus, we have done it for the entire infrastructure that exists. In fact, barring the hostels, most of the departments were open during the Covid period. As research and other things were ongoing, students were not there but teachers came in regularly. Therefore, barring hostels rest all the things are in place and especially for the hostels the audit has been done. We are taking due care of sanitization and other safety measures, perhaps we would soon formulate the process like there should be a person looking after the opening of the campus.” added Karmalkar. While giving the details of the audit done at the university campus, SPPU registrar Prafulla Pawar said, “We have done a complete audit of university campus from an independent electrical and fire consultant in the last one month. They conducted the audit and checked all the closed hostels, departments and accordingly gave the correction report to the university. It includes minor changes at the hostel buildings. There are around 60 buildings which include the various teaching departments and the hostel buildings, all of these buildings went through the audit.” According to Pawar, from February 15, the university began offline lectures, but the student response has been on the lower side. “But we are hoping that gradually students will start coming to the university campus. For hostels to be allocated to the students we are following UGC guidelines, and it will be given in a phase-wise manner. For research students, a single seated room is given and then PhD hostels will be opened from February 22. Only then will the process for new hostel admissions start,” added Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-completes-fire-and-electrical-audit-for-entire-campus-101613586063881.html
17-02-2021||Pune||Consumer forum pulls up builder, orders ₹7lakh compensation||The additional district consumer redressal forum has directed real estate developer and three of his associates to pay ₹7 lakh compensation to a consumer with 10 per cent interest within 45 days of the issuance of the order. The forum further stated that in case of noncompliance, the developer will have to pay the compensation at 12 per cent interest. Besides this, it has also directed to pay an additional ₹50,000 as compensation along with ₹5,000 as expenses towards filing the complaint. Prafulla Chandrakant Salunke, a resident of Yerawada filed a complaint with the consumer court against Messrs SS Developers and Builders, Pradeep Bhagwandas Shah, Sunit Nitin Mehta and GRP associates and Gravity International ( Proprietor Prabhakar Menon ) on Feb 25, 2019, seeking either custody of the flat he had booked in their project or compensation from the proprietors of the project. According to the consumer court order, Messrs SS Developers and Builders is a real estate development company while the others are partners in the said project. The complainant had booked a flat in Atharva Plaza project of the company in Kondhwe Dhawade in Survey No 423 and booked flat number 401 and 402 in the project at a total consideration of ₹22.65 lakh. He paid a booking amount of ₹1 lakh on April 9, 2011. He paid another ₹1 lakh through a cheque dated Nov 6, 2011, and on various occasions paid money wherein the total consideration was ₹7.20 lakh. He requested the developers to register the said agreement and was assured by them that it would be done in the next few days. Despite repeated requests, the builders failed to execute the property registration and also did not complete the project. Salunke sent a legal notice to the developers dated July 30, 2018, but no action was taken by them. The complainant then moved the consumer forum seeking either refund of the advance paid or compensation in lieu of the payments made to the builder, the order stated. The order further said “Despite issuing notice, the developers failed to present themselves before the forum and an exparte order was passed in the case. From the complaint, it can be deduced that the complainant has paid ₹7 lakh to the builders. The papers prove that the promise behind seeking money from the complainant was not fulfilled. The forum is of the view that the complainant deserves compensation on the ground of mental harassment and deficiency of the service. The complaint is accepted and the order is passed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/consumer-forum-pulls-up-builder-orders-rs-7lakh-compensation-101613586062529.html

The deputy director of education, Pune, released the statistics on Wednesday. The admission process can only be extended if the state government allows a further extension. Of the total vacant seats, 8,007 seats are from Arts stream, 12,813 seats from the Commerce stream, 12,571 seats from the Science stream and 2,168 seats from the vocational stream. This year due to the Covid-19 outbreak the FYJC admission was delayed and went on till the beginning of February. Now that admissions are complete, college administrations are worried about completing the syllabus. This year, a total of 72,820 students were eligible in the first round of admissions to 304 colleges in Pune and Pimpri -Chinchwad. Due to an interim stay given by the Supreme Court (SC) on the implementation of the quota for the Maratha community in jobs and education, the state education department stopped the admission process on September 9. It resumed on November 26. “The admission process of FYJC admissions is complete after the two rounds and in Pune division 35,559 seats have remained vacant. Despite the Covid-19 outbreak and entire online admission process, our staff has worked hard.

17-02-2021||Pune||Hasty police action against gangsters, court grants bail to Mohol, Marne||The Pune police crime branch has spurred into hasty action after the release of two notorious gangsters Sharad Mohol (38) and Gajanan Marne (55) in the past month. As a direct result of their action against their release, the Pune, as well as Pimpri-Chinchwad police, slapped multiple cases on them on Tuesday. However, while Mohol and four co-accused were released on bail, Marne was remanded to judicial custody and later granted bail, both by local courts in Pune. Marne was represented by advocate Vijaisinh Thombre in the court of Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) RK Bafna-Balghat, while Mohol was represented by Advocate Amol Dhamale in the court of JMFC MA Shaikh. The paranoia of police officials was evidently not unfounded - Sharad Mohol, who was released in the month of January after spending years in jail over accusation of murder was found at a public event organised by a local organisation called Patit Pavan Sanstha in Guruwar peth. In a case registered against him under Sections 143, 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC); Section 37(1)with135 of Maharashtra Police Act; Section 51(b) of Disaster Management Act; and Section 11 of Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations at Khadak police station, Mohol was arrested along with four others and produced in a local court. He was later released on bail as the police were denied custody of him. “It was a public and annual Satyanarayan pooja that we hold in different locations every year. This time it was in Guruwar peth. It’s an open event and anyone can come. As the police claim, if someone was inconvenienced or scared, why did nobody from the crowd complain? Why could the police not find even one person to lodge a complaint?” asked advocate Manish Padekar representing Patit Pavan Sanstha. The Gajanan Marne gang returned into major limelight after years of being in judicial custody when a rally was organised between Taloja jail and his house in Kothrud, Pune to “celebrate” his release. “There are three factors to this - the people shooting the videos, the subsequent media trial, and the police action. The investigation officer and senior police inspector Dange called Marne’s aide while they were at Urse toll plaza and told him that he should not be able to see any rally or gathering. As per his instructions, the well-wishers who had come to meet him left,” said advocate Virendrasinh Thombre representing Marne. Responding to Thombre’s argument, public prosecutor Sanjay Dikshit and Sr PI Dange told the court that they needed physical custody of Marne and others in order to recover CCTV footage of the toll plaza and identify others who were with Marne and that he was bound to not co-operate. Marne’s lawyer argued that the concerned CCTV has already been submitted to Talegaon Dabhade police station and that the matter was not in their jurisdiction. A case under Sections 267, 268, 270, 143, 149 of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 50(b) of Disaster Management Act, Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act, Section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act and Section 37(1)(5) with 135 of Maharashtra Police Act was registered at Kothrud police station. The case is against Marne, and around 200 others, of which eight were identified and arrested along with him. The case was registered after he performed a pooja at the Lord Ganapati temple in Hamraj Chowk in Kothrud late on Monday night after reaching Pune from Taloja jail upon his release. From the decade gone by, police have 427 members from 11 gangs on their radar including Marne and Mohol gangs. One of the major handovers of the outgoing deputy commissioner of police (DCP) of crime Bachchan Singh to his successor DCP Srinivas Ghodage was that of these gangs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hasty-police-action-against-gangsters-court-grants-bail-to-mohol-marne-101613586003087.html
17-02-2021||Pune||Fastag compulsion slows traffic during peak hours||On the second day of the FASTag compulsion being in force, slow moving traffic was observed at Talegaon toll plaza on the Pune-Mumbai expressway during peak hours. Traffic flow had gradually normalised at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening, lines of vehicles were observed in the FASTag lanes. “At the Talegaon toll plaza on the Pune-Mumbai expressway, there are fewer number of lanes. That’s why the slow moving traffic issue was faced. Our team is on the ground and there were no major disputes. Commuters on this route are habitual with FASTag rules. So as compared to other highways there were few complaints on the first day,” said Amol Pawar, sub-inspector, highway police, Vadgaon. Ninad Sonawane who travelled from Pune-Mumbai on Wednesday morning faced slow traffic movement in the FASTag lane at Talegaon toll plaza. “Lines in the FASTag lane defeat the purpose of the enforcement,” he said. From Tuesday, vehicles without FASTags have to pay a double-toll penalty. On the first day long lines of the vehicles were are at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza. “The situation was a lot better today. There were fewer arguments. Only 15% of vehicles argued about the double toll fees. A major challenge is related to recharging the tags. Not all commercial vehicles drivers carry smartphones. So there is dependency on vehicle owners to recharge. Several private vehicle owners don’t know how to recharge the FASTag,” said Amit Bhatia, regional head, west, Pune-Satara Toll Road Private Limited, Reliance Infrastructure. He manages the Khed-Shivapur and Anewadi toll plazas. At Anewadi and Khed-Shivapur toll plazas, on Monday, 900 FASTags were sold (in 24 hours). On Wednesday, till 7 pm, 761 FASTags had been sold. “FAStag traffic penetration has reached to 65% at Khed-Shivapur toll plaza,” Amit Bhatia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fastag-compulsion-slows-traffic-during-peak-hours-101613586002240.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||TopsGrup probe: ED questions actor Armaan Jain in money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday questioned actor Armaan Jain, cousin of actors Ranbir Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor, for around one-and-a-half hour in connection with Rahul Nanda’s TopsGrup Security Services Limited (TGSSL) -Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik money laundering case.Jain reached ED’s office in south Mumbai around 9.50am and left the office at 11.30am.ED officers said Jain is a close friend of Vihang Sarnaik, son of the Sena MLA, and hence wanted to question the actor about his business dealings, if any, with Vihang. Jain was summoned for questioning after ED officers came across several communications between the two. Investigators have also searched Jain’s premises in the past. But the agency later discontinued the searches after news of Jain’s uncle Rajeev Kapoor’s demise broke.The Sena MLA and his son Vihang were previously questioned by ED in the case.BG Pawar, joint commissioner of MMRDA, also visited ED’s office on Wednesday, but he left after 10-minutes as concerned officers were not present. ED had also arrested Sarnaik’s close associate Amit Chandole and TGSSL managing director M Shashidharan, claiming that TopsGrup had obtained contracts from Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in collusion with Sarnaik through illegal means.These illegal manoeuvres, the agency claimed, aimed to get undue benefit by inflating bills at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. Sarnaik used to get 50% of the profit earned of the said contract through Chandole, ED had claimed.In 2014, a contract was signed by TGSSL with MMRDA under which 350 to 500 guards were to be deployed at MMRDA sites monthly. Of this, only 70% of guards were deployed. However, the billing was done for all the guards as per the contract and the wage details were submitted to MMRDA for 100% of the contract value.Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) is also probing cross complaints of Nanda and his former employee Ramesh Iyer (the complainant in the ED’s case). Nanda has alleged that Iyer and other employees siphoned the company’s money, while Iyer claimed that Nanda, through his company, indulged in massive misconduct and financial irregularities worth ₹175 crore.On Tuesday, the agency also recorded statement of metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev in connection with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/topsgrup-probe-ed-questions-actor-armaan-jain-in-money-laundering-case-101613585822548.html
17-02-2021||Other||Police say activists were preparing a second toolkit but could not execute it||New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Wednesday said the activists involved in the creation of a social media toolkit on the ongoing farmers’ protests prepared a second document to organise a Twitter storm aimed at “creating unrest” in Delhi on February 4 and 5 with hashtags related to the violence during January 26 tractor rally, but could not execute it. Investigators said the second document was created by Nikta Jacob, Shantanu Muluk -- two activists who have been accused of creating and sharing the first document -- and and a UK-based activist Marina Patterson, who is allegedly linked with the global movement “Extinction Rebellion” also referred to as “XR”. According to its website, Extinction Rebellion is an international movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse.“The plan mentioned in the second toolkit, however, could not be executed. We suspect it happened because the toolkit was accidentally tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on February 3, the day Ravi shared it with her and coaxed her to act on it. Since the Google toolkit documents contained objectionable content, Ravi panicked, asked Greta to delete the tweet, took the admin rights and removed her name from the toolkit,” said a second senior police officer associated with the case, requesting anonymity.According to the officer, the investigating team has already written to Google seeking details of both toolkit documents to ascertain where they were actually created, who drafted and edited them, and with whom it was shared.The Delhi Police on Saturday arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi from Bengaluru on charges of sedition, intending to riot and criminal conspiracy, for editing and creating a toolkit, essentially a Google document. The police have alleged that the toolkit was created to spread misinformation and incite unrest. They have also alleged that Disha shared the document with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg who tweeted it but later removed it.Both Muluk and Jacob have been grated pre-arrest bail court.Activists from various organisations have said that creating a toolkit was standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach, and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.Protests against the arrests of the activists in the case continued on Wednesday with members of the Congress-backed National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) protesting in Delhi, and accusing the central government of using “Fascist techniques” to quell democratic protests in the country.“Only four sedition cases out of the 191 filed after this government came to power have resulted in convictions. The government uses tough laws and misuses them to silence all dissenting voices,” NSUI president Neeraj Kundan said in a statement. As per the information available with the police, the first toolkit was shared with the members of pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PFJ) by Jacob on January 23 while the other one was circulated on February 1, the officer said.On February 15, the Delhi Police said that they first came across the toolkit on February 4 and registered a first information report (FIR) the same day to probe it on charges of sedition and criminal conspiracy, though it did not name any individual. In a press briefing on that day, the police pointed to a “copycat execution of the action plan detailed in the toolkit” and alleged the document was created by pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF).Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old climate activist, was the first person arrested in the case from her home in Bengaluru on Saturday (February 13). She is now in the custody of Delhi Police. The other two suspects –Muluk and Jacob – were granted transit anticipatory bail by the Bombay High Court on Tuesday and Wednesday while Delhi police said they were looking for them.The FIR that has the mentioning of banned organization Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) and Poetic Justice Foundation” reads that during social media monitoring on February 4 it came to notice that a link of a Google document that has been accidentally shared on Twitter “contains a detailed plan of a large conspiracy to wage an economic, social, cultural, and regional war against India.”“The banned organization Sikh For Justice based in USA had declared a reward of USD 25,000 for waiving secessionist flag at the India Gate on Republic Day. After the violence that occurred on January 26, various social media handles are being used to spread rumours and fake news/videos to promote enmity between different groups wantonly give provocation with intent to commit riots and bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection towards the government of India,” the FIR read.According to the police, Jacob, Ravi and Muluk knew each other since 2019 and that Jacob and Muluk first came in touch with PFJ’s Canada-based woman member named Puneet in the first week of December through Instagram. Ravi created a WhatsApp group on December 6 while Muluk created an email ID on December 11 – all for discussing their global action plan around the farmers’ protest that was finally announced by the PFJ on January 9, the police said.On January 11, the police said, nearly 70 people including the trio and the PFJ’s members has a video conferencing meeting on Zoom where they discussed the modalities of the tooklit. Another invite for a similar meeting was sent to Muluk and Jacob by the PFJ on January 17 and the meeting happened on January 20, when the final toolkit was prepared. The toolkit was shared with the PFJ members on January 23. On January 3, Ravi shared the toolkit with Greta who accidentally posted it on Twitter, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-say-activists-were-preparing-a-second-toolkit-but-could-not-execute-it-101613584564271.html
17-02-2021||Noida||Noida authority allows subdivision of industrial plots||NOIDA: The subdivision of industrial plots has been allowed in Noida after the Uttar Pradesh government gave its green signal for it following demands from the stakeholders, authority officials said on Wednesday. “We have allowed the plot subdivision only for industrial plots following approvals from the state government. We are yet to receive the applications from the entrepreneurs,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority. The objective of the policy is to encourage entrepreneurs, who do not want to invest more in bigger plots and are in need to start business on smaller plots, officials said. The plot subdivision means a large plot can be divided into smaller ones and sold by the allottee or used for the purposes for which it has been allotted, said the officials. However, the subdivision of plots will not be allowed for either residential or commercial plots. The authority had in December last year sent a proposal in this regard to the state government. After the plot subdivision has been allowed in Noida, the Greater Noida authority may soon implement it as the state government has issued directions to all industrial development authorities in this regard, officials said. And the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) will also follow the footsteps of Noida, said the officials. It means soon the Gautam Budh Nagar district will have the facility to get the plots divided into parts in industrial sectors as the Greater Noida authority has been tasked with preparing draft guidelines for the policy, they said.“We have sought feedback from all stakeholders, including factory owners in this regard. Once their suggestions are submitted, we will form the guidelines and then get approvals from the state government,” said Shiv Pratap Shukla, officer on special duty, Greater Noida authority. Once approved, the guidelines will be implemented in Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authority areas too, said the officials. According to the officials, only 50% of the original plot area will be considered for reselling. The Greater Noida authority is also contemplating whether it will be feasible to buy back the land and offer it to the entrepreneurs or allow existing allottees to market it to the interested parties after taking some fees. According to officials of the industry department, subdivision will be considered only for allottees who have obtained functional letter after commencing operations at least five years back. The divided portion of the plot can be sold to the other entrepreneur with authority’s permission, they said. The UP government had last month asked the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority, Noida authority, Greater Noida authority and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority to prepare guidelines for the policy. There are around 13,000 industrial units in Noida, and 7,000 in Greater Noida, while many units are being set up in Yeida area, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-allows-subdivision-of-industrial-plots-101613584563653.html
17-02-2021||Other||Man who ran a YouTube news channel found shot dead in west Delhi||New Delhi: A 34-year-old man who ran a YouTube channel for local news and also worked as a housekeeper in a housing society was found shot dead in a street in west Delhi’s Bharat Vihar, close to Dwarka, in the early hours of Wednesday, the police said. Santosh Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), said prima facie it appeared to be a case of murder over personal enmity. “The crime doesn’t appear to have anything to do with his journalism,” said Meena. The case remained unsolved until Wednesday evening, the officer said, adding that multiple teams were put on the job to identify the killer. The DCP identified the dead man as Dalbir Singh, a resident of Bharat Vihar.“A little after midnight, someone noticed Singh lying injured on the road, a few metres from his home. His scooter was lying nearby,” said the officer. Believing him to be involved in a road mishap, his wife rushed him to a nearby hospital where even doctors believed he was involved in a vehicular accident. “We received a call from the hospital at 1.47 am. When we took a close look at the body, we found a gunshot wound to his left forehead. That is when we realised that it was a murder,” the officer said, adding that the autopsy report is yet to arrive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-who-ran-a-youtube-news-channel-found-shot-dead-in-west-delhi-101613584563126.html
17-02-2021||Delhi||Nursery admission process begins today||The online admission process for nearly 200,000 unreserved seats in entry-level classes -- nursery, kindergarten and class 1 -- in around 1,700 private schools in Delhi will begin on Thursday. Schools will release registration forms on their websites from early morning and the last date of submission of forms is March 4.The centralised admission process, which usually commences in November or December, has been delayed this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The websites will upload the first list of selected candidates on March 20. The second list will be released five days later (March 25), and a subsequent list, if required, will be announced on March 27. The admission process will conclude on March 31. Parents will have to pay an amount of ₹25 (non-refundable) as admission registration fee.Since admissions to entry-level classes are determined by a points system, followed by a draw of lots, most schools have allotted points to several factors such as distance, siblings in the school, alumni parents, and girl child. “Distance” remained the criterion with the most weightage points across schools. For instance, Mother’s International School has fixed 40 points for distance criterion, 30 points for siblings in school, and 10 additional points for girl child. The Indian School has fixed 60 points for the distance criteria, 20 for siblings and 20 for first-born child.Similarly, Sanskriti School has fixed 0 to 30 points for distance, 25 for siblings of already enrolled students, and 25 points for the children of alumni. In Tagore International, 50 points is given to applicants residing in areas where school transport is available, 30 to the first-born child, 10 each to siblings, and children of alumni and staff.Mount Abu Public School has fixed 85 points for distance, 10 points for siblings and five for alumni and staff. In Birla Vidya Niketan, 60 points have been fixed for distance, 20 for siblings and 10 for the children of alumni.Principals of several schools said they have not changed any admission criteria. Ashok Pandey, chairperson of Ahlcon schools, said, “Change in any criteria would have caused unnecessary inconvenience to parents at the last moment. The admission process has already been cut short this year due to the pandemic.”The Directorate of Education (DoE) has fixed the upper age limit of 4, 5, and 6 years as of March 31, 2021, for admission in nursery, kindergarten and class 1, respectively. The minimum age for admission in these classes is 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, as of March 31, 2021. The schedule for the remaining 25% seats reserved for the economically weaker section (EWS) and disadvantaged (DG) categories will be announced in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nursery-admission-process-begins-today-101613584561745.html

The AQI was recorded at 316 on Tuesday.According to official forecasts, there would not be any significant improvement in the air quality due to slow wind speeds till February 21.The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Environment Monitoring and Research Center head VK Soni said the pollution levels may reduce after February 21 following a spike in the temperature, which may lead to an increase in the vertical height at which suspended particles mix with the air.“The wind speed is expected to remain about 10 kilometres per hour, but the spike in temperatures will cause an upward movement of air and increase the ventilation index,” said Soni. The ventilation index indicates the rate of dispersion of air pollutants.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the ventilation index is likely to increase from approximately 3000 m2/s on Wednesday to 5000 m2/s on Friday.While the IMD’s Automatic Weather Station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record a minimum temperature on Wednesday, the AWS at the Palam observatory in Delhi recorded the day’s minimum temperature at 13.7° Celsius, while the maximum temperature stood at 26.9° Celsius.As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover between 28° Celsius and 13° Celsius respectively, over the next few days. Shallow to moderate fog will envelope the city in the morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-air-very-poor-situation-likely-to-persist-till-weekend-101613584506938.html
17-02-2021||Delhi||Jamia students ask varsity to resume on-campus classes||With the Delhi University (DU) and the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) restarting in-person classes for students in a phase-wise manner, the students of Jamia Millia Islamia on Wednesday demanded that the varsity also restart on-campus classes in a similar fashion.In a demonstration held on the campus, they also demanded the reopening of varsity libraries and reading rooms as well as the canteen and other facilities. The university said all stakeholders, including parents, must be consulted before a decision is taken.The students, mostly affiliated to the All India Student Association (AISA) and other student groups, questioned the university’s decision to keep the campus shut when malls, cinema halls, and even other educational institutions were reopening with Covid-19 protocols.Saud Ahmed Qureshi, a postgraduate student who attended the demonstration outside the vice-chancellor’s office on Wednesday, said marginalised students of the university were the worst affected as the prolonged lockdown has made it difficult for them to access devices needed to pursue online education.“The online mode of teaching and learning has left a vast majority of students behind,” he said, adding that the students needed to access university spaces to bridge learning gaps and resume their education as before.Ahmad Azeem, media coordinator, Jamia Millia Islamia, said, “Views of all stakeholders, including parents, will be taken into consideration before a decision on reopening the campus is taken by the executive council of the university. A large number of students and parents wrote to the university administration that at present, online teaching should continue as the environment is still not conducive for offline classes. Health concern of students in view of Covid-19 is a major issue.”The students also submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor’s office asking for the “immediate reopening” of the campus. “The decision to bring students back for on-campus instruction should be given priority as all options of online education are exclusionary and rely heavily on an unreal degree of digitisation. Classrooms should also be rearranged to allow for social distancing and better ventilation,” students said in the memorandum. Students have also demanded smartphones, laptops, and internet data packs for fellow scholars in need of these.Protesters also said since the e-library facility started by the administration had “failed miserably”, students were unable to avail of the facility and their loss in terms of learning was “unquantifiable”. They added that many were unable to access non-English reading material.“Students coming from outside the city will suffer once on-campus classes resume since they don’t have a place to stay as processing hostel applications takes considerable time. Thus, the administration must invite applications for hostel accommodation,” the memorandum said.The memorandum also urged the administration to waive fee, extend semesters and shift examination dates keeping in mind the situation wrought by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jamia-students-ask-varsity-to-resume-on-campus-classes-101613584506169.html
17-02-2021||Gurugram||Delivery of government schemes remains poor in Gurugram district||Gurugram remains a poorly performing district in the state with regard to timely delivery of services under Right to Service (RTS) Act, as over 37,000 applications related to government schemes and services are pending to be addressed by various government departments on the Antyodaya Saral e-governance platform. Due to delay in providing services, the district has slipped from 14th position in 2020 to 22nd this year, according to the state administration data. “Gurugram has not been doing been well in timely disposal of applications filed by citizens to avail of various state and central government services. In the district-level meetings held last week, it came into notice that various departments did not focus upon addressing the applications within a stipulated time due to Covid-19 duties in the previous months,” said Rakesh Gupta, additional principal secretary to the chief minister, who led the state’s flagship programme of providing all the services under a single digital platform. According to the data shared in the state-level meeting held earlier this week, Gurugram has received a total of 2,696,803 applications since September 2017, of which at least 36,778 applications remain pending, which is the highest among the state. Most of these complaints are related to key departments — Regional Transport Authority (RTA), Town and Country Planning, Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran and welfare of scheduled castes — according to the data available on the Antyodaya Saral dashboard. Based on responsiveness to on-time disposal and overdue applications, every district receives scores based on the internal mechanism devised by the state administration. In the last three months, Gurugram has remained at the bottom, with a score of 6.6, while other districts that have been doing fairly well, like Kurukshetra, Ambala and Rewari, have the highest score, of almost 8.7 to 8.8. It is, however, not the first time the district has received a low score due to pending application. Since its launch in September 2017, to provide easy access to basic services like driving licences, education certificates, birth and death certificates and more than 500 other services, Gurugram has always performed poorly compared to other districts. In 2019, Gurugram stood at 19th position, which improved to 14th in 2020 and plunged to 22nd this year. “Every day, over 650 tickets are generated through which applications are shared with different government departments. It is the highest of all 22 districts. The heavy volume of applications and their uniqueness should be considered,” said Hemant, control room officer, Saral Kendra at Mini Secretariat. Despite the poor performance, Gupta said that the implementation of Saral in Haryana has been a success story. “At least 549 schemes and services are provided through Saral. Until, four years ago, the state lacked a proper mechanism to provide easy access to services and schemes. Saral has helped to bring in transparency in the government machinery,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/delivery-of-government-schemes-remains-poor-in-gurugram-district-101613584505545.html
17-02-2021||Other||Chandni Chowk to be revamped by March-end||New Delhi: Work on the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk is likely to be completed by March 31, said officials of Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the agency which is overseeing the project.The project envisaged revamping the 1.3 km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri mosque flanked by the Chandni Chowk market on both sides by making it a pedestrian-only zone, provide broad walkways, water ATMs, toilet complexes, and street furniture mimicking the Mughal-era architecture. Senior officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) said over 90% work was complete. They said currently “finishing touches” were being given and stone work was going on near Town Hall. A toilet complex near Fountain Chowk was also nearing completion, they said. PWD minister Satyendar Jain said the officials have been directed to complete the project within the stipulated deadline.The idea of the project first came up in 2004. In 2008, the chief minister Sheila Dikshit set up the Shahjanahabad Redevelopment Corporation as a nodal agency to oversee the implementation of the project by bringing all stakeholders on a common platform. It was launched in August 2018 by the AAP government and work began in December that year. The initial deadline was fixed at March 2020, but it was revised to March 2021 due to several delaying factors such as the Covid pandemic and the legal issues in removing encroachments, including some religious structures. Garima Gupta, managing director, SRDC, said the deadline of the project has been rescheduled to March-end this year. “The work is underway in full swing and we hope to complete it within the timeline. The deadline of the project has now been revised to March 31, 2021,” Gupta said.Explaining the reasons behind the delay, a PWD official who declined to be named said even though work resumed in June this year after the government began the unlock process after the nationwide Covid-induced lockdown, progress was slow due to shortage of labour. “Now the project is inching towards completion. We have completed over 90% work, which includes major construction works such as digging and shifting of utilities. Overhead wires have also been made underground and drains in the area are being fixed and beautified. We will complete the project by March 31, 2021,” the official said.PWD engineer-in-chief Shashi Kant conducted an inspection last week to review the progress of the project. He directed the officials to expedite work and finish it within the deadline.The corridor will strictly be a “no vehicle zone” during the daytime and only non-motorised vehicles such as rickshaws and e-rickshaws will be allowed to move on the stretch. However, loading and unloading of goods will be allowed during the night, officials said.Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said it is the maintenance of the redeveloped portion, which is required as it is being spoiled by encroachment. “Stretches that have been beautified on the corridor can be seen occupied by beggars, illegal vendors. The authorities should also take care of this problem of encroachment as it will only malign the beauty of the redeveloped areas,” Bhargava said.He said besides the remaining civil work, the agencies were yet to install CCTV cameras and streetlights.AGK Menon, a consultant with Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), said the project will improve shopping experience in the area. “There were practical problems that delayed the project. It should not be delayed further. Hopefully, it will be completed by the revised deadline,” Menon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chandni-chowk-to-be-revamped-by-marchend-101613584504424.html
17-02-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: DTCP asks revenue dept not to register properties without NoC||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) wrote to the revenue department on Wednesday urging that the registration of properties that have been sealed should not be carried out till a no-objection certificate (NoC) is issued by the department.DTCP officials said they have observed that a number of property owners and dealers allegedly sell properties despite building plan violations and legal action pending against them. This, the department said, created a dicey situation as third party rights are created and the new owners are affected, despite no wrongdoing on their part. RS Bhath, the district town planner, said that they have written to the district administration, and six tehsildars and Naib tehsildars that registration deeds of properties against which legal action is pending should not be carried out till an NoC has been issued by the DTCP. “We have shared details of five properties in DLF Phase 3 and five in Suncity with the revenue department, where these houses have been sealed for building plan violations. Similar information will be shared with revenue officials regularly to prevent new owners from getting stuck,” said Bhath. DTCP officials said that when a house is sealed over plan violations, it can be de-sealed only after a penalty has been deposited and an affidavit has been submitted. “The violations have to be corrected as well, but what has been observed is that property dealers sell these properties to buyers who are not aware about the violations and legal issues. When we take action, these buyers submit pleas that they were ignorant of the matter but these arguments don’t hold legally,” said Bhath, adding that it was to avoid these issues that they have decided to conduct regular inspections and prevent sale of properties with such violations. DTCP officials said the reason dealers sell properties in this manner is that they want to sell units with excess construction. “When third party rights are created, it is difficult to take action and seal these properties,” he said. The department will also regularly inspect houses whose occupation certificates have been issued, to prevent building plan violations, they added.A revenue department official, when asked about the matter, said that they are ensuring that no property deed is registered without an NOC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-dtcp-asks-revenue-dept-not-to-register-properties-without-noc-101613584503775.html
17-02-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Notices to house owners over illegal use of property||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Wednesday issued show-cause notices to 30 house owners in Palam Vihar and Uppal Southend localities, where residential premises are allegedly being misused to run commercial establishments such as shops, boutiques, offices of property dealers, gyms and clinics. The department said property owners have been asked to stop the alleged unauthorised commercial activities as these are in violation of rules and also cause disturbance to residents in the area.RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that if the unauthorised activities are not stopped within a week then these houses will be sealed. “A large number of complaints had been received from these colonies regarding such activities, which is why the action was initiated,” he said, adding that building plan violations have also been identified in these 30 houses.Department officials added that there is a provision in DTCP policies that house owners can pay a fee and get permission to use 50 square metre of the area in their house commercially, albeit only to offer consulting services. “The department allows usage of some part of the plot for consulting services, after payment of a nominal fee of ₹50,000, for five years. The plot owners should get the permission regularly,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner.In a related development, the DTCP has chalked out a plan for demolition and sealing drives across the city from February 18 to 24, and from March 2 to 10. Officials said the drives will be carried out in DLF Phase 3, Badshahpur, Bhondsi, Manesar, Kherki Daula, Sector 53, Rajendra Park and other areas where unauthorised constructions and housing construction is being carried out.A senior official, requesting not to be named, said that they have planned “large-scale” action particularly in DLF Phase 3, where a number of houses on plots meant for economically weaker sections (EWS) have been constructed allegedly in violation of rules. “The plan has been outlined and we are preparing to take action based on it,” the official said, adding that this time teams from the power distribution and fire department will also be involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-notices-to-house-owners-over-illegal-use-of-property-101613584503073.html
17-02-2021||Delhi||All govt offices, MCDs, police to have separate toilets for transgender persons||The Delhi government has made it mandatory for all its departments, offices, district authorities, municipal corporations, state-run companies and the Delhi Police to have separate and exclusive washrooms for transgender persons.An order to this effect was issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev on Friday (February 12). “In compliance with the provisions of Section 22 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, for ensuring adequate welfare measures for transgender persons, all public buildings under all the departments, autonomous bodies, PSUs, corporations, and local bodies of Government of NCT Delhi are hereby directed to create separate identified public toilet facilities for transgender persons,” read the order.“It is also clarified that trans people shall continue to be allowed to use gender-based toilets as per their self-identified gender,” the order further stated.While activists from the field welcomed the move, they said the government should rather focus on building gender-neutral toilets and highlighted that the Supreme Court had ordered access to separate toilets for transgender individuals in public places including hospitals way back in 2014.Read more: Delhi Gymkhana to get govt administrator, rules NCLAT“The Apex Court accorded third gender status to transgender people seven years ago and the verdict also included an individual’s right to determine the gender they identify with. The problem is not just in government offices, but also in public toilets in open spaces. Rather than having separate toilets which further marginalises people from our community, the government should build gender-neutral toilets or at least give keep that as an option in all buildings. Not having access to such basic facility is a violation of the fundamental right to life and dignity,” said Amrita Sarkar, advisor, transgender wellbeing and advocacy at India HIV/AIDS Alliance.The Delhi government has given a maximum time of two years to all agencies to build these exclusive toilets. The directive will be applicable not just to all Delhi government departments, agencies, companies and institutions, but also to the three municipal corporations and the Delhi Police.“In case such facilities are not immediately possible to be created separately, for the time being, all standalone toilets meant for persons with disabilities (PwD)shall be designated for use of transgender persons as well, till separate facilities for transgender persons are created within a time period of two years from the date of issue this order,” read the directive from Dev.The chief secretary further said such toilets will display symbols for both PwDs and “T” for transgender persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-govt-offices-mcds-police-to-have-separate-toilets-for-transgender-persons-101613584502022.html
17-02-2021||Gurugram||Constructions on Aravalli land in Raisina razed||The Sohna municipal corporation on Wednesday carried out a demolition drive against at least 10 constructions on Aravalli land in Raisina village. This was done in compliance with a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order from December 2020, which instructed that all such establishments built in the Aravallis of Gurugram and Faridabad be razed by January 31. A similar drive against unlawful structures in Manesar had been conducted on January 29 by the forest department. Confirming the development, Karam Bir Malik, forest range officer, said, “Orders have been given by the court in two cases recently — one filed by plaintiff Sonia Ghosh and the other by Ram Avtar Yadav, the former sarpanch of the Manesar panchayat. In these cases, the NGT has been extremely clear that any illegal construction in Aravalli forests are to be removed. Demolitions in Sohna started early on Wednesday and will continue in the coming days.” Unlike the demolition drive in Manesar, which was directly overseen by the forest department, Malik said that the Sohna municipal corporation would be leading the ones in Raisina village, as the land is not notified under sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (1900), which gives it legal forest status and puts it under the custodianship of the forest department.Instead, the violations in Sohna are allegedly concentrated in Aravalli Retreat, a 1,200-acre complex comprising 670 privately held plots, which, until recently, were noted under the land use category of “gair mumkin farmhouse” in revenue records. The demolitions come more than six months after the Municipal Corporation of Sohna served show cause notices to over 400 farmhouses in Aravalli Retreat, on grounds that they had been constructed in violation of the MoEFCC’s notification of June 6, 2020. Following instructions laid down by the green court, the Gurugram deputy commissioner on June 11 last year ordered that the land use category of gair mumkin farmhouse be struck from revenue records and replaced with ‘gair mumkin pahad’ — the original nomenclature. Experts and environmentalists explained that the gair mumkin farmhouse category was introduced in revenue records around 1991, and has been used, over the years, by private developers to circumvent the MoEFCC’s Aravalli Notification. “There is no such term in revenue records historically. Its sudden emergence around 1991, just before the Aravalli Notification was to come into force, raises questions as to who allowed these changes to be introduced in the record books, and why,” said Sarvadaman Oberoi, a city-based legal activist.The validity of gair mumkin farmhouse as a revenue term has been previously struck down by the Punjab and Haryana high court. In a 2014 judgment, the court observed, “Concededly, the developers have got changed the kind of land from gairmumkin mountain (pahad) to gairmumkin farmhouses. If any patwari without any legal authority had made the stray entries... then such stray and illegal entries are non est, void and are not sufficient to hold that the land in litigation was gairmumkin farmhouses.” The court also said that these lands will continue to be recognised as pahad, and not as “farmhouse”.Further, in October 2018, in the case of Soniya Ghosh v/s State of Haryana, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruled that, “Any construction raised on the forest area or the area otherwise covered by the notification dated 07.05.1992 without permission of the competent authority (after the date of the said notification) has to be treated as illegal and such forest land has to be restored (sic).”As per a recent forest department survey, there are at least 100 such farmhouses built illegally on Aravalli land in Gurugram, concentrated in areas like Gwal Pahari, Gairatpur Bas, Sohna and Manesar. District forest officer, RS Dhull, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/constructions-on-aravalli-land-in-raisina-razed-101613584443536.html
17-02-2021||Gurugram||Leachate from landfill site spills outside boundary, blocks local road access||Leachate from the rear side of Bandhwari landfill site situated on Aravalli land has been spilling outside its boundary on to the adjoining road. A spot check by an HT team on Wednesday revealed that due to the spillage, a kuccha road leading to nearby villages in the area has been blocked. Workers from Ecogreen Energy, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s (MCG) concessionaire for waste management of Bandhwari landfill present at the site were seen clearing the leachate by pumping it out into tankers along with trucks and JCBs, clearing the excess waste spillage.Around 1,900 tonnes of untreated mixed municipal solid waste generated in Gurugram and Faridabad is dumped at the landfill every day.Sunil Harsana, a resident of Mangar village located in the vicinity of the landfill, who was also present at the landfill site on Wednesday, said that the Bandhwari waste plant visibly has more waste than it can accommodate, which is now spreading outside the plant.“The leachate or dirty water from the accumulated waste is now flowing into the nearby forests and a road leading to our village has also been blocked recently because of this. If this is the situation now, then what will be the condition during monsoon, when leachate usually spills out?” said Harsana.He said, “We already know that the groundwater under the landfill is completely contaminated and people from nearby villages are suffering because of it. Along with people, our fauna in and around the landfill is also feeding on the same water, affecting their health too.”Nearly 6.7 million tonnes of waste has accumulated at the landfill site over the last two decades, as per a 2019 joint committee report drafted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), IIT-Delhi and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI).Reacting to the spillage of the leachate, Dhiraj Kumar, joint commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said, “Around 15-20 days ago, the city had witnessed rainfall, which might have caused the leachate to percolate on one particular side leading to spillage. It is not a lot of spillages and our officials are working at the site to pump it out.”Kumar also said that the MCG is in the process of issuing tenders for “extending the existing boundary wall of the landfill, which will be bigger and stronger to ensure that waste does not breach into the forests.”Listing causes for spilling of waste and leachate, Sanjeev Sharma, the spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy said, “We have learnt from our official working at the site that it happened because a lot of waste was being shifted from one angle to another, due to which some of it spilled over the boundary walls, which are very old. We have started repairing the walls and it should get fixed within 10 days. Another reason is that the particular area where waste was spilled on Wednesday is on a downslope.” Sharma said that due to the downslope, freshwater shifted down the slant and that the leachate was cleared and sucked through pumps by the end of the day. Locals have been protesting demanding shifting of the landfill from Bhandwari to outside the city where there is no human habitation. In January, members of Citizens for Clean Air — a civil society group — wrote to the CPCB, drawing attention to allegations of groundwater contamination in Bandhwari and nearby villages, about 20 kilometres outside the city. In the letter to the pollution control body, the civil society group wrote, “Their (locals from the area) natural habitat got spoiled beyond recovery to accommodate the dirt of the city dwellers — the dumping of mixed solid municipal waste at the landfill site for the past several years. And their environment, including their drinking water sources, has been destroyed. Already there are reports of higher incidence of cancer and other ailments in these areas.”Experts and citizens working on the environmental issues around Bandhwari landfill said that authorities need to enforce solid waste management rules to stop the daily dumping of around 2,000 tonnes of mixed waste at the site.Neelam Ahluwalia, of the Aravalli Bachao Citizens Movement, said, “Bandhwari landfill, with more than 30 lakh (3 million) tonnes of untreated mixed waste is a violation of all rules connected with the forest and environment. For the past two years, the National Green Tribunal has been directing the MCG to remove the waste mountain following the Indore model, where a 100-acre dump site was recovered with treatment of 15 lakh (1.5 million) tonnes of waste. The same needs to be done at Bandhwari to remove this toxic monster.”She said that native Aravalli plantation needs to be done to restore the 32 acres of forest land where the landfill currently stands, as the Aravallis are the lungs and a critical water recharge zone on which life of National Capital Region depends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/leachate-from-landfill-site-spills-outside-boundary-blocks-local-road-access-101613584442933.html
17-02-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram shortlisted for second round of cycling challenge||Gurugram has progressed to the second round of India Cycles4Change challenge, to facilitate quick implementation of cycling friendly initiatives in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Gurugram is among the 25 cities to be selected for the second round of the ministry of housing and urban affairs’ programme, under the Smart Cities Mission.In all, 107 cities participated in the first round of the challenge, under which government bodies and experts had to implement and introduce low-cost changes to increase cycling infrastructure in urban spaces. Since October last year, cycling infrastructure has increased significantly in Gurugram, with cycle tracks constructed along Netaji Subhash Marg, Hamilton Court Road, Vyapar Kendra Road, and the service lane leading towards Gold Souk Mall. Cycle tracks are also under construction at the Anaath Road in Udyog Vihar and the new sector road which links Rampura Chowk on National Highway 48 with Pataudi Road.A 2020 survey by the India Programme of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), which is a knowledge partner for this challenge, predicted that cycling would increase by 50-65% as cities come out of lockdown. Last month, VS Kundu, the former chief executive officer of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), had announced that all new road projects in the city, barring a few stretches in Old Gurugram where road width is limited, will have cycling tracks as well as footpaths along each carriageway.Sudhir Rajpal, the current chief executive officer of the GMDA declined to comment on the matter. According to GMDA officials, representatives of the 25 shortlisted cities will give a presentation on the initiatives taken to increase cycling infrastructure, their effectiveness and future scale-up plans to a national-level jury. The list will then be whittled down from 25 to 11 cities, which will receive ₹1 crore award each and guidance from national and international experts for scaling up existing infrastructure. The programme will involve a compilation of shared learning from all 11 cities, so that each city can study infrastructure models of other cities to analyse ways the same can be implemented in their zones.“Around 12-14% of commuters use cycle as a mode of transport in the city, on a daily basis, by choice. At least 5% of the city’s commuters have started using cycles periodically for commuting purposes following the coronavirus outbreak. Hence, the infrastructure needed to be upgraded to not only meet the long-standing requirement but also to account for the change in the pattern of daily travel,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder of Raahgiri, a body that promotes non-motorised transport in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-shortlisted-for-second-round-of-cycling-challenge-101613584441716.html

As many as 89 police personnel were injured in violence at Red Fort. Three others have already been arrested in connection with the vandalism and violence at the Unesco World Heritage site. These include Deep Sidhu, an actor-turned-activist who was arrested on February 8, for allegedly instigating protesters at the monument and destroying property. Sidhu remains in police custody for interrogation. Sidhu was arrested after the Delhi Police announced a total reward of R6 lakh for information leading to the arrest of eight men, including Sidhu, gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana and Jugraj Singh. The latter is accused of hoisting a religious and a farmers’ body flag at the Red Fort.Police teams are continuing to carry out raids in Punjab and Haryana to arrest Sidhana and Singh.Kushwaha said Singh was “radicalised” by watching various “provocative” videos on Facebook and was “motivated” by speeches made by leaders at the Singhu border, a protest site frequented by him.“Singh motivated six other residents of Swaroop Nagar to accompany him to the tractor rally. On Republic Day, Singh and the six other men rode motorcycles along with the tractor rally from Singhu border to Red Fort. He carried his two swords with him,” said Kushwaha.The seven men and others entered the Red Fort with several other unidentified persons, said the officer. “Inside, Singh danced with his swords. The sword dance motivated the violent protesters to cause more mayhem at Red Fort,” said Kushwaha.Kushwaha also that Singh ran a sword training centre from a vacant plot near his home.Referring to the evidence against Singh, Kushwaha said there was a long video of him swinging swords at the venue in his mobile phone. The police are questioning Singh to identify others present at the monument that day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/red-fort-violence-car-ac-mechanic-held-from-delhi-101613584442314.html
17-02-2021||Delhi||Dwarka residents oppose construction of drain at the cost of 600 trees||Residents of Dwarka’s Sector 8 are opposing the construction of a stormwater drain between IGI Airport to Trunk Drain 2 (near Bharat Vandana Park, Dwarka), saying close to 600 trees will have to be felled or transplanted for the ₹70- crore project, which is being executed by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).The residents have written to the land-owning agency to rework plans to minimise the damage to the green cover. But DDA officials said there is no possible alternative route, as the road under which part of the drain will be constructed is narrow.With work on the expansion of Indira Gandhi International Airport, including a new runway, going on, DDA officials said the drain is needed to ensure that there is no waterlogging at the airport.The three-km-long drain will be constructed from the airport up to Bharat Vandana Park and further to Trunk Drain 2. A sizeable portion of the drain, which will be completely underground, will pass through a waterbody and a park in Dwarka’s Sector 8 near Bagdola village.DDA has sought approval from the Delhi government’s forest department to transplant and cut close to 600 trees. “We applied for tree felling permission in October last year. But we are yet to get the permission. The plan for the drain was prepared after careful study of all feasible options,” said a DDA official in-charge of the project.Residents of Sector 8 said the plan will destroy the green cover.Amit Kumar, a resident of Sector 8, said, “This is the only park available for Sector 8 residents, Bagdola village and Raj Nagar park-II. DDA has already done the markings on the ground and close to 600 trees, including hundreds of trees inside the park, will be damaged in the process. We have made several requests and also submitted an alternative plan to the DDA to save the trees.”DDA officials said the alternative plan suggested by the residents is not feasible as the road width is just 13 metres whereas the proposed drain is more than 20 metres wide . “They have discussed their proposal with us. The plan for the stormwater drain was prepared by experts after careful study of the area. As of now, there is no change in the plan. We have applied for permission from various departments,” said the official.The project has been in the making since 2016. According to first DDA official, “For airport’s expansion plan, DIAL (Delhi International Airport Limited) approached DDA to construct the stormwater drain. But after several rounds of deliberations with DIAL, it has been decided that a 20-22 metre wide drain will be constructed. The plan was finalised in 2018 and the work was awarded last year.”DIAL didn’t comment on the matter.Kumar, who is leading the campaign to protect the trees in the neighbourhood, said, “All the residents are against it. We have submitted an alternative plan to DDA. If they go ahead with the original plan, then we will explore other recourse.”Satish Bhardwaj, another resident of sector 8, said, “DDA should look for an alternative plan and save these trees. On the one hand, efforts are made to combat air pollution, and on the other, government agencies want to cut trees for development work.”Environmental activist Diwan Singh said, “It looks unnecessary to cut so many trees to construct the drain. The existing drain is enough to carry the excess water. If need be, recharge pits can be constructed along the proposed runway at the airport. There is plenty of land available. DDA needs to find a way to minimise the damage to the environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dwarka-residents-oppose-construction-of-drain-at-the-cost-of-600-trees-101613584381762.html

17-02-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Rates reduced for map clearances in Modinagar, Muradnagar and Loni||Ghaziabad: The officials of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) on Wednesday said that they have reduced the rates for map clearances in areas such as Loni, Modinagar and Muradnagar, which they said will pave the way for more planned development. The officials said that the decision was taken by the Uttar Pradesh cabinet earlier in February, and they have received a communication regarding the same. The officials said that the rate for clearance of maps for residential areas, as of now, is about ₹3,314 per square metre. The rates have now been reduced to ₹1,200 per square metres for areas of Modnagar, Loni and Muradnagar. “The Ghaziabad authority, earlier in 2016, had sent a proposal to the state administration for reducing the rates to ₹700 per square metres. However, the state cabinet has now decided that the rates will be ₹1,200 per square metres now for these three areas. Since the decision has been taken by the cabinet, we need not take it to the GDA board for any approval. However, the rate of ₹3,314 will continue to prevail for residential housing in city areas,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, the authority’s chief architect and town planner. The three areas have a number of unauthorised constructions, despite being part of the authority’s jurisdiction area. “It is now expected that residents will come to the authority for getting their map approvals before the construction of houses. The reduction in rates will encourage people to get prior map approvals and will also help discourage unauthorised constructions. Any residential area which is 100 square metre or above needs to have a map clearance before construction is taken up,” he added. Officials said the authority is also getting the next Master Plan up to 2031 developed as well as the zonal plans for the three areas, which will also be incorporated as part of the Master Plan. The Master Plan chalks out residential, commercial and industrial and green zones besides other facilities for the entire city, while zonal plans are specific to an area and chalk out facilities at the micro level, which need to be provided for respective localities or areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-rates-reduced-for-map-clearances-in-modinagar-muradnagar-and-loni-101613583902001.html
17-02-2021||Noida||Noida authority sends updated plan to clean Kondli drain||Noida:The Noida authority has submitted an updated plan to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to clean Kondli drain — a major source contributing to the pollution of River Yamuna.It passes through multiple residential sectors in Noida, leaving behind a trail of stink and fumes. The officials said that the work must be done on priority.The authority’s nine-point action plan asserts that it would take at least three years to completely de-silt the Kondli drain by building six artificially constructed wetlands along it. This would clean it naturally and ensure that untreated sewage is not discharged into it. Officials said the first wetland will be ready by June 2021.We have inspected 69 residential high-rises to check if their respective sewage treatment plants (STPs) are working, of which, over 30 were served show-cause notices for either defunct or improper functioning STPs, they said.Some 95 residential high-rises would be inspected to ensure that they do not leak untreated sewage into the drains. 104 public toilets and 56 community toilets have been constructed and strengthening of the existing sewage network in the city is underway.“Kondli drain is our priority, and we have expedited the work to clean it soon. We have also decided to build 7 wetlands (artificial) across 17 kilometre along the drain, of which, the first will be experimental and pilot — through which we will analyse its effectiveness by ensuring if the biochemical oxygen demand of the drain water is reduced. An MoU with the irrigation department has been signed for the same, and work for the first wetland will be done by June. If the biological oxygen demand (BOD) reduces, then we will construct more,” said RP Singh, DGM, Water and Sewer Department (Noida authority).The action plan also includes strengthening of the existing sewage network in the next two years, and channelising and connecting 30 drains with the main sewer lines — that illegally carry sewage into the Kondli drain — in three years.“The proposal of strengthening of the existing sewage network amounting to ₹19.77 crores have been submitted, and the same are to be executed on a priority basis. It might take around two years,” said the updated action plan, dated February 15.The 40-year-old and 20-kilometre-long Kondli drain originates from Delhi’s Kondli village. It enters Noida (via Ghaziabad) near Hari Darshan police post in Sector 11 and submerges into River Yamuna near Chak Mangrola in Sector 168 after travelling 17 kilometre — Sector 11, Sector 12, Sector 22, Sector 50, Sector 92 and Sector 168 — in the Noida region.Noida resident and environment activist Abhisht Kusum Gupta had initiated the legal battle to clean the Kondli drain in November 2018. “It seems that the Noida authority is finally working, and this city will soon get rid of the 40-year-old menace, which will benefit the residents and the environment,” Gupta said.According to the authority, the estimated sewage generation in Noida is 216-million-litre PER day, of which, only 152-million-litre is treated, while the remaining 64-million-litre untreated effluent flows through the Kondli drain and goes into River Yamuna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-sends-updated-plan-to-clean-kondli-drain-101613583842513.html
17-02-2021||Other||Air ‘very poor’ across Ghaziabad, Noida for third day||Noida: The average air quality across Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida was recorded “very poor” on Wednesday for a third day in a row. Pollutants PM 2.5 and PM 10 also remained in the air of the five immediate neighbours of Delhi, according to the air quality index (AQI) maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The average 24-hour AQI at 4pm on Wednesday was 328 in Ghaziabad, 322 in Noida, and 337 in Greater Noida, all in ‘very poor’ category, according to the CPCB. On Tuesday, it was 356 in Ghaziabad, 335 in Noida, and 375 in Greater Noida. On Monday, it was 369 in Ghaziabad, 368 in Noida, and 349 in Greater Noida. On Sunday, it was 416 in Ghaziabad, 416 in Noida, and 402 in Greater Noida.According to the index, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. The CPCB states that an AQI in the “very poor” category may cause respiratory illness to people on prolonged exposure.The AQI for each city is based on the average value of all monitoring stations there. Ghaziabad and Noida havefour such stations while Greater Noida has two stations each.According weather analysts, air quality has been affected due to low wind speed. “Wind speed is low and the emissions are consistent, which is the reason why accumulation of particles is at its peak with no scope of dispersion. Air quality is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ condition over the next few days,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. According to the system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to improve over the weekend.“Surface winds are low and forecasted to improve and change in direction to easterly. Better ventilation is likely to influence AQI positively. The AQI is likely to stay in the lower end of the ‘very poor’ for the next two days. AQI is likely to further improve on February 20,” read the SAFAR statement on Wednesday.WITH PTI INPUTS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/air-very-poor-across-ghaziabad-noida-for-third-day-101613583841748.html
17-02-2021||Noida||Teenagers held for murder of 10-year-old boy in Noida||Noida: Two boys aged 13 and 14 years were detained by the Noida police on Wednesday in connection with the death of a 10-year-old boy in October last year. Police said that the two suspects had allegedly assaulted the victim and then strangled him to death. The deceased boy, son of a daily wage earner, had gone missing from his home under Sector 49 police jurisdiction on October 11, and subsequently, a kidnapping case had been registered. Later that week, the minor’s body was found from near a construction site in the area in a decomposed state. Police officials said that this was a blind case initially.“We had questioned the neighbours and friends multiple times but didn’t get any clues. A few days later, a man in the area left the locality and went to Banda where we tracked him. He was a person of interest but upon questioning it turned out that he wasn’t involved. But he mentioned that his son was the deceased boy’s friend. When the son was questioned, he said that he and a few other boys had seen the suspect boys misbehaving with the deceased on a couple of occasions,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1.According to police, the 14-year-old boy, one of the suspects and son of a local property dealer, was then interrogated who admitted to the crime and revealed about his accomplice as well. Police said that he and the other boy had sodomised the deceased on an earlier occasion as well. “On October 11, they molested him again and when he resisted, they assaulted him. He then threatened to inform his family about it, after which the juveniles pushed him and he hit his head on a brick. They then used a rope lying nearby to strangle him. The autopsy had confirmed ligature marks around the neck. The body was dumped at a construction site from where it was later recovered,” the official said.The officials also said that the suspects were helping the family put up posters as well but police have witnesses who allege that the duo used to bully the deceased. The suspects were booked for murder, kidnapping and unnatural sex, police said, adding that they were produced before the juvenile justice board before being sent to the juvenile home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/teenagers-held-for-murder-of-10-year-old-boy-in-noida-101613583721774.html
17-02-2021||Noida||Four persons arrested for administering Covid vaccine illegally||Police arrested four persons for allegedly administering a Covid-19 vaccine to 18 people illegally in a Dadri pathology laboratory on Tuesday.Police identified the suspects in the case as Rizwan Ali, Sanjay Shrivastava, Sudhakar Yadav, and Suresh Kumar Singh from. They were all employees of Ghaziabad’s Flores Hospital and were present at the laboratory at the time on Tuesday. The hospital administrator Mahesh Chaudhury was also booked and was absconding till press time on Wednesday.The hospital was to conduct clinical trials of Zydus Cadila’s Covid-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D. The lab’s owner Vikas Vashishth was also booked in the case and was absconding till press time.Gautam Budh Nagar drug inspector Vaibhav Babbar, in his police complaint, said the health department visited Gopal Pathology Lab on Tuesday after it was informed of an unauthorised vaccination drive. The team found a “free corona vaccination camp” there.The team seized 279 vials of the vaccine from the lab and said that 10 vials had been used.“Ali, Shrivastava, Yadav and Singh were present there and, upon questioning, said they were employees of Flores Hospital. Shrivastava was the supervisor. He said the hospital administrator Chaudhury had given the team vaccine vials, syringes, etc,” Babbar said in the FIR.Vashishth’s uncle Sanjeev, whose name and number appeared on a banner advertising the camp, blamed the incident on communication gap. “The hospital had permission for clinical trials. They had conducted such trials in Ghaziabad and then they approached Gopal Pathology Lab for trials here too. A few relatives of ours and people in the area got the dose. The hospital should have informed the local administration in advance to avoid such a situation,” he said.Drug inspector Babbar said that the vaccine vials were not stored at the required temperature either, possibly rendering them useless. “The four staff members were not technically trained for vaccinating people. The lab too was not registered with the health department,” he said. District chief medical officer Deepak Ohri said that the hospital had not informed the health department or district administration of the trial, which was required by law. A clinical trial involves human subjects and has several phases during which the safety and efficacy of the vaccine is tested. The Zydus Cadila spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.Rajveer Singh Chauhan, station house officer of Dadri police station, said, “A case has been registered against six persons under Indian Penal Code’s section 420 (cheating), sections 51 and 52 of Indian Medical Council Act, and sections 18-A and 27 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The four arrested persons were produced in court and sent to jail.”Flores Hospital owner Dr Manoj Kumar could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. On Tuesday, however, he had said that he had the required permissions from the government of India to conduct the clinical trial. “We signed an agreement with the Dadri lab as a satellite centre for the trials. We had no idea that the local district health department’s permission was needed too,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-persons-arrested-for-administering-covid-vaccine-illegally-101613583661797.html
17-02-2021||Noida||Ahead of ‘Rail Roko’, Tikait says farmers ready to suffer loss of one crop||Leaders of the anti-farm law protest on Wednesday said they will go ahead with the plan to disrupt trains in the country on Thursday.People will not allow trains to ply, they said. But, they added, protesters at the prominent protest sites around Delhi -- UP Gate at the border with Ghaziabad is one of them -- will not leave their positions. These people will continue their protests on the roads.This is the protesters’ third major action this year after the tractor rally to Delhi on Republic Day and Chakka jam (road traffic protest) on February 6. They are demanding the repeal of the three central farm laws and the codification of the minimum support price (MSP) for crops into law.“This is another call to take forward our movement which will not stop and will continue. It is now a fight for our existence. Even if farmers have to suffer loss of a crop, they will do it and will not let the agitation die. Our agitation is not going to break even as people say that there are fewer people at our gatherings. Our farmers have gone to attend to their fields and also have to attend to marriages in their families. They will come back,” said Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union who is spearheading protest at UP Gate.He said people in their respective areas will stop trains.“They will stop trains that ply in area. This will be a peaceful protest and they will offer water, milk, fruits, Lassi and other items to children and other passengers who will be affected. They will also tell them about the farmers’ issues. This will take place across the country,” Tikait said.The farmer leaders seemed reluctant to detail on how exactly they want people to stop trains in the rail roko protest, more so after the incidents of large-scale violence during their tractor rally in Delhi.The ‘Samyukta Kisan Morcha’ (SKM) in a statement issued from Singhu Border said, “SKM appeals to everyone for a peaceful protest in nationwide rail roko program on February 18. This program will be organised from 12 noon to 4 pm in which support is expected from all over the country.”UP Gate farmers’ committee member Jagtar Singh Bajwa said that no protester from UP Gate will go to attend the “Rail Roko” call.“They will stay at UP Gate and will continue the protest here. People are expected to stop trains and strictly told to carry out the call in a peaceful manner,” he said.The Ghaziabad district administration said that they have made arrangements beforehand.“We have deployed police and other security personnel in respective areas, and they will also be accompanied by magistrates of respective tehsils. We will ensure that there is no untoward incident and passengers should not suffer,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The farmers are camping at the UP Gate protest site since November 28, 2020 to press for their demands and also occupying Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway since December 3, 2020. The other carriageway was heavily barricaded by the Delhi police after incidents of violence which took place on the Republic Day in Delhi during tractor rally call given by farmers’ leaders.NHAI concernThe National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials said their work had been disrupted since the start of the protest. About 1.3-km stretch of the Delhi Meerut Expressway was occupied affecting traffic on stretches between UP Gate and Vijay Nagar.“We have received several complaints from the public about the closure of the expressway. We had written to the district magistrate requesting them to get the expressway vacated,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.But district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he had not received any such request. “The district administration on January 28 had also served a notice to farmer leaders at UP Gate to vacate the site, but nothing materialised so far.Meanwhile, BKU national spokesperson Tikait lashed out at the NHAI.“NHAI officials keep telling us to vacate the expressway. When the government couldn’t get it vacated, how can they? There is no one from NHAI who has come to us so far to ask us to vacate. We ask that what action was taken when roads were dug up to stop the farmers (referring to police action to stop the rally on Republic Day). The officials must first initiate action there,” Tikait added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ahead-of-rail-roko-tikait-says-farmers-ready-to-suffer-loss-of-one-crop-101613583601840.html
17-02-2021||Noida||Will raise farmer issues in West Bengal, says Tikait||Ghaziabad: The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Wednesday reiterated his stand to hold panchayats in poll-bound West Bengal and said that he will raise issues of farmers there. In order to garner support for the ongoing their agitation, Tikait and other farmers’ leaders have been holding panchayats regularly in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and other areas in the national Capital region.Farmers’ leaders have also slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said that it is because the government has not paid heed to their demands.Farmers have been camping at various borders around Delhi since November last year, demanding repeal of the three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. “We will definitely go to West Bengal; it is not as if the state is outside the country. We are getting a lot of response from our panchayats and this has baffled the government. Farmers are facing issues in West Bengal as well and their issues should find a way to the manifestos of political parties who intend to come to power. There, farmers are not getting the appropriate price (for their crops) while those involved in fisheries are also facing problems,” Tikait said. BJP leaders are holding rallies in the state hoping to make inroads during the upcoming assembly elections against the All India Trinamool Congress. Assembly elections in West Bengal are likely to be held in April or May.On Tuesday, several BJP leaders including party president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah held a meeting with party leaders from Haryana, Rajasthan and western UP. Sources in the BJP said that it was intended to reach out to farmers, panchayats and khaps over the issue of the three farm laws. Both western UP and Haryana have major Jat populations.“It is good that BJP leaders are discussing farm laws and trying to reach out to farmers. Internally, they are basically worried about letting slip their vote bank and are now trying to win over farmers,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of the UP Gate farmers’ committee.“If their leaders speak to farmers then they will come to know. The government is trying to talk to the people of one caste, but it is not an agitation of any one caste and this, the people will show them. Let them hold talks. We ask them whether only Jats voted for them. It seems they are trying to play the caste card. Caste and religion cards have been exhausted now as we are playing the ‘kisan card’ to raise the issues of farmers,” Tikait added. “We will see what new card they play next. Their cards die out in five days and they try to bring in new cards each time. They are now trying to divide us into castes, and this does not send out a good message. Our intent is to ensure that the government listens to our demand,” he added. The last round of talks between the government and farmers’ union were held on January 22, after which no talks have been scheduled so far.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a body of farmers’ unions at the Singhu border, issued a statement Wednesday in which it said: “It is clear that instead of resolving the ongoing agitation, the BJP is trying its best to counter and destroy it. The SKM condemns this attitude of the ruling party and demands that the government resolve the farmers’ issues without any further delay. The SKM vows that it will intensify the struggle and mobilise more farmers in its support.” BJP leaders declined to comment over the agenda of the meeting held by their senior leaders on Tuesday. “The BJP has never done politics of caste and will never do it. This dharna (sit-in) by the Kisan Union is no andolan (agitation) and has flopped, which is why they are making such comments. Our party people and leaders are always with the common man and they have held a lot of programs to reach out to people. Even our senior leaders in UP have held such programs in the recent past,” said Chandra Mohan, spokesperson and state secretary of BJP – UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/will-raise-farmer-issues-in-west-bengal-says-tikait-101613583481714.html

Testing numbers are enough up to 2,500 per day. We need to do both RTPCR and anti-gen tests if needed.” According to the Mayor, many citizens want to take treatment in private hospitals. Right now, only few hospitals are giving treatment to Covid-19 patients. “All hospitals must increase bed numbers. Government hospitals have enough beds, but we must be prepared to handle the situation,” Mohol said, adding, “There are total a total of 1,162 Covid beds are available in the city’s government hospitals, including Sassoon.

17-02-2021||Patna||Nothing political about meetings with LJP MP, Kanhaiya : Bihar CM Nitish Kumar||Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday insisted that nothing much should be read into his recent meeting with an MP of the LJP, which is headed by his bte noire Chirag Paswan, since members of Parliament and the state legislature call on him regularly over matters relating to their constituencies.About the visit of CPI's Kanhaiya Kumar to his key aide and cabinet colleague Ashok Choudhary, the chief minister said that the former JNU student leader and an MLA of his party had met him earlier but did not discuss politics.Nitish Kumar, who gave up the post of JD(U)s national president recently but continues to wield supreme control over it, was asked by reporters at the partys state headquarters here whether Paswan needs to worry after LJP Nawada MP Chandan Kumar Singhs visit to the chief minister's official residence on Sunday.There is nothing to be worried about. Being the chief minister I am often approached by members of the state legislature and the Parliament who wish to discuss matters relating to their areas. They come when I grant an appointment and we talk. Thats it, he said.Notably, the Singh's visit came less than a month after LJPs lone MLA Raj Kumar Singh had taken part in a book launch ceremony held at Choudhary's residence.Chirag Paswans rebellion against Kumar ahead of the Bihar assembly election in which he fielded candidates against JD(U) nominees, cost the party dearly causing its tally to fall below 50 in the 243-strong house.The LJP and JD(U), both NDA allies, have since been at daggers drawn. At a recent NDA meeting in New Delhi chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Paswan excused himself citing ill-health after the JD(U) raised strong objections over invitation having been extended to him despite his brinkmanship in the assembly poll.About Kanhaiya Kumar, who met Choudhary Sunday afternoon along with CPI MLA Suryakant Paswan, the chief minister said Kanhaiya had met me before. And so had a legislator of his party. But our discussions were about issues relating to their constituencies. There was nothing political about it.Reports in a section of the media had claimed that Kanhaiya, who is understood to be sore over the manner in which he has been treated by the CPI a number of times, was considering crossing over to the JD(U), an ally of the BJP.The CPI central office in Delhi later came out with an angry statement condemning the mala fide and mischievous intentions of some sections of the media to malign the CPI and Kanhaiya Kumar.Asked about JD(U) raising the demand for caste-based census in the Lok Sabha, Nitish Kumar said This is a genuine demand and is one we have been raising for quite some time. In the past we had even sent resolutions to this effect which were passed by both houses of the state legislature to the Centre."We must have an accurate idea of the respective population of different social groups so that we can formulate policies accordingly, he said.Nitish Kumar also expressed confidence that the budget session of the assembly, which will commence on February 19 and conclude on March 24, will be conducted safely. Members have been asked to take precautions like wearing of masks in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.In 2020 the budget session was curtailed in view of the outbreak. This year, the opposition Grand Alliance led by RJDs Tejashwi Yadav has threatened to boycott the assembly and gherao the chief ministers residence if the session was shortened in the name of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nothing-political-about-meetings-with-ljp-mp-kanhaiya-bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-101613571308355.html
17-02-2021||West||If voted to power, irregularities in teachers' recruitment to be probed: BJP||An inquiry panel will be set up to probe alleged irregularities in the appointment of teachers in West Bengal if the BJP is voted to power in the upcoming assembly polls, a saffron party leader said.BJP leader Shamik Bhhattacharya said that there was not an iota of transparency in the recruitment of teachers since 2014, and the merit list released this week was no exception. West Bengal Board of Primary Education on Monday released the state-wide merit list for the appointment of 15,284 primary teachers. The Board had earlier announced vacancies for 16,500 posts."Irregularities have been institutionalised by the Trinamool Congress government in the process of appointing teachers, even those on contractual basis", he alleged.The state government, he said, should come out with a complete merit list and not just roll numbers.The saffron party leader also alleged that para-teachers in West Bengal are facing huge disparity in salaries as compared to their counterparts in other states."On this issue, we will stage a protest march from College Street to Esplanade area in the city on February 19," he added.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had recently announced a three per cent annual pay hike for para-teachers in the state budget, but they said it was not enough.The education department had increased the salary of para-teachers at the primary level from ₹5,954 to ₹10,000 a month, and for those at the higher secondary level from ₹8,500 to ₹13,000.A section of para-teachers on Tuesday staged a protest near the high-security zone of the chief minister's residence, stepping into a canal to press for a salary hike.Contractual teachers have been holding a sit-in in the metropolis for more than 70 days, demanding immediate wage revision.With the assembly elections round the corner, it has snowballed into a major political issue with the opposition BJP and Left Front accusing the ruling Trinamool Congress of turning a blind eye to the plea of the para-teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/if-voted-to-power-irregularities-in-teachers-recruitment-to-be-probed-bjp-101613570900219.html

However, the state’s health department said that there was no uncertainty among the beneficiaries to get the second shot as a total of 12,101 were vaccinated on February 15 against the 18,122 that were administered the first dose on January 16.Also Read| CoWin glitches continue, hamper vaccination in BiharThe low turnout during the second vaccination drive happened due to communication problems, as some of the beneficiaries said they did not receive any details through an SMS on their mobiles, a health department official told Hindustan Times on Tuesday adding that the respective facilities had been ordered to manually follow up with those that were eligible for the second shot.Bihar has registered nearly 262,000 coronavirus disease cases so far out of which 259,748 people have recovered and 1,528 have died. The state has been in national news amid reports of irregularities in conducting Covid-19 tests.

Nobody in the state government knows about his whereabouts," former state Power minister and BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bavankule told reporters.According to Wanwadi police in Pune who have registered a case of accidental death, there was no suicide note.Maharashtra BJP vice president Madhav Bhandari said the state government was supposed to carry out investigation in this case but it intends to either suppress or to slow down the investigation.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who heads the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, had already promised a detailed probe and action against the guilty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/womans-death-bjp-accuses-maharashtra-govt-of-suppressing-case-101613560737073.html
17-02-2021||Pune||Demand for special buses grows, PMPML resumes special bus for students||The use of public transportation is expected to exponentially rise with the city opening up post-Covid-19 and colleges resuming offline classroom lectures. In an effort to meet the rising demands, the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has now started a special bus service for PMC school students and gradually it will be starting the bus service for other students as well. Earlier this month, students in classes 5 to 12 began attending school physically which includes both Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and private schools. “We have started the special students’ bus service for PMC school children as schools have now reopened for classes 5 to 12. Colleges around the city have also resumed offline lectures. Transportation of school and college students is a major part of our public bus transport service and we are going to gradually increase the buses for PMC schools. Also, there are plans to start the bus service for private schools which existed prior to the lockdown,” said Rajendra Jagtap, chairman and managing director (CMD) of PMPML. Since schools and colleges have resumed offline classes, a large number of students are plying on the roads to travel across the city. A majority of them do not have their own vehicle or parents are dependent on private auto-rickshaws, school vans, buses or public transport buses. So, daily a large number of school and college students are seen during the peak hours travelling by the PMPML buses. Harish Jadhav, a class 10 student from New English School, Tilak road said, “I stay at Dhankawadi and earlier used to travel daily by a PMPML bus to school, there were special buses for students. Now, we travel by normal buses but there is a crowd during the peak morning hours, as other office going people are also there. Social distancing is not maintained that much so our demand is that special buses for students should be restarted immediately.” While parents are worried to send their children in crowded buses, Geeta Pathare a mother of two said, “Both my son and daughter daily go to school and college by a public transport bus, it is risky but now we do not have any option to send them for attending the lecture. Already one year has gone at home and children do not comprehend online teaching properly. If more special buses for students are given by the PMPML then it would benefit thousands of students who cannot afford private auto or cab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/demand-for-special-buses-grows-pmpml-resumes-special-bus-for-students-101613560980618.html

The local zila panchayat on Tuesday passed a resolution for the name change.The college is named after Shukla’s father. “It is the privilege of the state government to decide the name of any institution. The zila panchayat cannot pass such a proposal. Such an act is an insult to our freedom fighters.”The college’s foundation was laid in 2004 and it was named after Pandit Ram Sumer Shukla, a freedom fighter in 2016.“I respect Sardar Patel but the proposal to change its name is politically motivated.”Also Read | Uttarakhand glacier burst: 31 of 58 recovered bodies identifiedSuresh Gangwar, a nominated representative of the panchayati raj minister in the zila panchayat, said Pandit Ram Sumer Shukla’s statue has been installed at the main intersection of Rudrapur close to the medical college. “What is the point of naming the medical college after him.”Shukla said he is an ex-officio member of the panchayat but was not invited to the meeting where the proposal was mooted. “It is a political conspiracy, and I will move a privilege motion in the assembly against Apar Mukhya Adhikari of the zila panchayat for not inviting me. The name change is not a good practice.”He rushed to the panchayat after learning about the proposal and protested against the move, triggering a heated exchange of words with Gangwar, who is also the husband of zila panchayat chairperson, Renu Gangwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-row-over-proposed-name-change-of-medical-college-in-rudrapur-101613560501332.html
17-02-2021||Pune||Foam in Indrayani river worries Alandi residents||Residents from Alandi have raised an alarm as a huge amount of foam has been noticed in the Indrayani river since Sunday. On February 1 the same foam formation was noticed in the Pavana river at the Keju Devi temple boat club and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) sent the water samples for testing. “We have not received any complaints, but the pictures are very dangerous. We will look into the matter,” said an official from MPCB on request of anonymity. On Tuesday, a thick layer of foam was noticed in the temple town. Residents blamed industrial units from Pimpri-Chinchwad for releasing waste, while untreated sewage waste is also released into the river. “Every year we face this issue, but there is no concrete solution by MPCB so far. In the past few occasions incidents of fish dying have also occurred,” said Suresh Kali, who was taking pictures when HT visited the spot. The Indrayani river originates in the Western ghats near Lonavala, passes through Kamshet, Dehu, Pimpri- Chinchwad and Alandi, and later meets the Bhima river at Talapur in Shirur tehsil. “Many residents have a habit of using the Indrayani river water for drinking purposes which we keep on telling them not to, as water pollution is happening at the regular intervals in the river,” added Kali. MPCB claimed it was sending officials to the river on Tuesday evening. “Unless strict action is not taken against industries who discharge waste in the river, the pollution issue will not be sorted. PCMC and MPCB need to come out with strict measures, which have not happened till now,” said Prashant Raul, an environmentalist from PCMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/foam-in-indrayani-river-worries-alandi-residents-101613559901978.html

Petrol and diesel prices are increasing continuously despite the low prices of crude oil in the international market," he said.Petrol and diesel prices on Monday were hiked for the seventh day in a row as a rally in international oil prices took retail rates in India to new highs.Petrol price was increased by 26 paise per litre and diesel by 29 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. The hike took petrol price in Delhi to a record ₹88.99 per litre and diesel to ₹79.35 a litre.The cooking gas cylinder prices have increased by ₹75 within the last 14 days. It is a "pity" for the Modi government that a new record is being set in the prices of petrol and diesel, Srinivas said.National media in-charge of IYC Rahul Rao said, "We demand that the increased prices should be withdrawn with immediate effect and the increase in excise duty should be rolled back to provide relief to the masses suffering from inflation and recession."The protesters also included IYC national secretary Khushboo Sharma, secretary Mukesh Kumar, Delhi Youth Congress vice president Ranvijay Singh Lochav and Shubham Sharma among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/youth-congress-activists-protest-in-delhi-against-fuel-price-hike-101613558836939.html
17-02-2021||Chandigarh||Congress sweeps Punjab local body polls, wins 7 out of 8 municipal corporations||The ruling Congress in Punjab on Wednesday registered a stunning victory in the state local body polls, winning seven out of eight municipal corporations for which results were declared on the day. The seven municipal corporations are Bathinda, Abohar, Batala, Moga, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Pathankot. The results for the eighth corporation, Mohali, will be announced on Thursday as the Punjab state election commission (SEC) ordered repolling in two wards, which took place on Wednesday.Follow Punjab municipal polls live updates hereThe Abohar Municipal Corporation was near-perfect for the Congress, with the party winning 49 out of 50 wards, with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) winning one. The SAD is a former ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose government at the Centre passed three contentious farm laws last September, leading to protests by farmers belonging mostly to Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana. Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal’s party announced its split from the BJP in protest against the three laws.The fight for the municipal corporation in Moga was a close one as the Congress won 20 wards against SAD’s 15, with the remaining 15 split among the BJP, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the independents. Punjab’s ruling party also won 41 and 37 wards in Hoshiarpur and the BJP’s bastion of Pathankot respectively. Meanwhile, in Bathinda, the Congress won 43 out of 50 wards, with the other seven going to the SAD.Also Read | Congress steals the show in Majha, defeats BJP in PathankotThe result in Bathinda is significant as it is the Lok Sabha constituency of SAD’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who was the party’s only representative in the central government before quitting in the wake of the passage of the agricultural laws. Congress leader and Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal is the MLA from the Bathinda urban assembly seat. Badal is the cousin of SAD president and former Punjab deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, the Lok Sabha MP from Firozpur and the husband of Harsimrat Kaur Badal.The result is historic also because this is the first time in 53 years that Bathinda will get a Congress mayor. “History has been made today. Bathinda will get a Congress Mayor for the 1st time in 53 years! Thank you to ALL Bathinda residents,” tweeted Manpreet Singh Badal.Thank you to all contestants who kept the flame of democracy bright and burning.We stand committed in working together for the development of Bathinda and ensuring a better future for our residents. pic.twitter.com/N7Y2xMahO3According to reports, the Congress has also been victorious in both the Kapurthala and Batala municipal corporations.The municipal corporation results come as a huge boost for the Congress ahead of next year’s assembly elections in Punjab. The party has wholeheartedly backed the farmers’ agitation in Delhi against the central farm laws. Voting for the seven municipal corporations along with 109 municipal councils and nagar panchayats took place on February 14, with over 71% voters casting their votes.

17-02-2021||Jaipur||Poverty coming in the way of Pakistani brides' reunion with Indian husbands||Three Rajasthan residents have requested the Central government to grant visas to their Pakistani wives, enabling them to travel to India by the road route in view of their poor financial condition, which has prevented their wives to avail of the offer of visa by the Indian high commission through the air route, according to the affected residents.These cross border couples, living separately on two different sides of the Indo-Pakistan border for at least past two years, were overjoyed when the Indian high commission agreed to give their wives visas to travel to join their husbands via air routes. On February 9, officials of the Indian high commission in Pakistan asked the women to submit documents for visa, which they stated, will be valid for travel through the air route.A week passed since then but the brides in Pakistan did not submit the documents. Reason is simple- the families can’t afford to travel by air.Mahendra Singh Girab, a resident of Khejad Ka Paar in Barmer, who got married to a Pakistani girl in April 2017 and Vikarm Singh and Nehpal Singh of Baiyaa village in Jaisalmer district, who married Pakistani girls in January 2019, have now requested Union agriculture minister for state Kailash Choudhary for help in procuring a changed visa type from the external affairs ministry."We have again approached the Union minister Kailash Choudhary and urged him to help us in getting permission (to travel) via road route. It would be a great help,” said Vikarm, who is hoping to see his newly-born daughter soon.Mahendra Singh Girab, who has been hoping to be joined by his wife for the past four years, told HT he was thankful to the government for considering their cases on humanitarian grounds but at the same time stated that they cannot afford to pay for their wives' travel by the air route.Vikarm told HT that it was minister Kailash Choudhary, whose efforts resulted in the in-principle grant of visas to their wives. "We have again approached the Union minister and urged him to help us in getting permission to travel via the road route. It would be a great help,” said Vikarm.Choudhary said he had written to the external affairs ministry to take these cases on humanitarian grounds."Now the family members have again approached me to arrange them a road route (visa) citing financial reasons. I am trying to help the families in all possible manners,” said Choudhary.27-year-old Nehpal Singh Bhati and his 25-year-old sibling Vikarm Singh Bhati got married across the border in January 2019. After their marriages, both stayed in Pakistan for close to three months before returning to India without their brides, who were denied visas on technical grounds, they claimed.Also Read: Rajasthan police, ATS seize 7 kg heroin in Barmer, arrest suspected drug runnerNehpal was married to the daughter of Ranjeet Singh Sodha on January 22, 2019, while Vikarm wed the daughter of Taneraj Singh Sodha on January 25, 2019.In December, last year, Vikarm’s wife delivered a boy but till this day, he hasn’t been able to see his son in person and has been content catching a glimpse of him on video calls.Mahendra Singh Girab’s wife is from Sinoi village in Amarkot district of Sindh.

17-02-2021||Bangalore||'Not opposed to Ram Temple but money collection needs more transparency' says former Karnataka CM H D Kumaraswamy||Days after alleging RSS was marking houses of those who did not donate for Ram Temple in Ayodhya, former Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy on Wednesday said he was not opposed to the construction of the shrine, but only wanted more transparency in the fund mobilisation. The government has a responsibility to check who was collecting funds for the Ram Temple, he told a press conference here. "I am neither opposed to the Ram Temple nor did I speak ill of any organisation or the collection of funds for Ram Temple. Even my party members have given money, but I want to know who has authorised those collecting money door-to-door? What's their background? Who gave them licences," he said. He said his objection was only to collection of funds for the temple construction without transparency and "loot and misuse" of funds in the name of Ram.Kumarswamy had on Monday accused the RSS of marking houses of those who gave donations for Ram Temple in Ayodhya and those who did not and alleged it was similar to what the Nazis did in Germany. The RSS dismissed the allegations, saying they do not qualify for any response while the state unit of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which is among the organisations collecting funds for the temple, condemned Kumaraswamy for the charges. The JDS leader said the donations could be done through online transactions. "We have opened so many Jan Dhan accounts, then why cannot we collect money online? Why collect on the street and mark the houses?" the JD(S) leader asked. He further alleged no one gave any account of the money collected in 1990 for the Ram Temple from across the country. Kumaraswamy said he came from a family which has faith in God, but never misused the name of God. "We have commitment to the 130 crore people but we dont believe in breaking the society," the former Chief Minister said. The VHP Organising Secretary in Karnataka Basavaraj on Tuesday condemned Kumaraswamy's earlier statement against RSS. "It happens to be a highly irresponsible tweet coming in from former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy on Sri Ram Mandir Nidhi Samarpana Abhiyan," (fund mobilisation), Basavaraj said in a statement. Volunteers of various organisations, including the VHP, were reaching out to all sections of society. The latter were responding positively and contributing towards the construction of the grand temple at Ayodhya, he added. They did not even demand money from people and the outreach was merely to enable the whole country take part in the effort as "everyone believes strongly that Lord Ram is the identity of Bharat," he added. "VHP takes serious note of baseless allegations made by an individual who held the highest office of the state.The VHP also condemns Kumaraswamy's statement for making unwarranted remarks on the patriotic organization RSS," Basavaraj said. The fund collection drive for the Ram Temple started from January 14 on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and will go on till February 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/h-d-kumaraswamy-demands-transparency-in-ayodhya-temple-fund-collection-drive-101613556618966.html
17-02-2021||Chandigarh||Congress steals the show in Majha, defeats BJP in Pathankot||The ruling Congress swept the civic body elections in the Majha region, comprising Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Pathankot and Taran districts, by winning 13 of the 16 municipalities. Three civic bodies, namely the Majitha nagar council, Qadian nagar council and Ajnala nagar panchayat, were won by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). In Majitha, former state minister Bikram Singh Majithia’s home turf, the Akalis managed to win 10 of the 13 seats. However, Ajnala witnessed a tough fight between the SAD and the Congress. The SAD candidates won eight wards and the Congress seven. The SAD won seven of the 15 wards in Qadian. The other civic bodies of Rayya, Jandiala and Ramdas in Amritsar district were won by the Congress. Its candidate won the Amritsar municipal corporation’s ward number 37 byelection. BJP faces farm protest heat in Pathankot The Congress defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party in its bastion of Pathankot district mainly due to the backlash the BJP is facing amid the farmers’ protest against the three farm laws. The Congress won 37 of the 50 wards, while the BJP managed to retain only 11 wards of the Pathankot municipal corporation. In Pathankot district’s Sujanpur nagar council, the Congress won eight of the 15 wards. The BJP and Independent candidates won five and two seats, respectively, in Sujanpur. The BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) put up a dismal show in Majha as they failed to win a single municipality. Gurdaspur goes the Congress wayIn Gurdaspur district, the Congress registered a thumping win, bagging the nagar councils of Gurdaspur, Dhariwal, Hargobindpur, Fatehgarh Churian and the municipal corporation of Batala. Gurdaspur district public relations officer Harjinder Singh Kalsi said the Congress won five of the six municipalities in Gurdaspur. In Tarn Taran district, the Congress won the Bhikhiwind nagar panchayat and Patti nagar council. Both the municipalities in Tarn Taran witnessed clashes on polling day.

17-02-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s tales: Pune’s Roman connection… bangles offer the clue!||Reading about my claims of Stonehenges in Pune and now Pune’s Roman’s connections would leave many of you in disbelief… Is the Sutradhara of Pune’s story bluffing to keep up the interest in mundane finds from pits, you may wonder? Certainly not! But, do indulge me for a while as we contextualise the humble findings from the salvage excavations that we talked about in the last column. Last week’s column told us that the settlement of Pune has been here for around 2000 years, atleast. So, what did the historical scene of those times look like? Satavahana, the first empire of Maharashtra, did not rise to be an empire as a result of accident. As we observe frequently in history, political power rises to control the economic resources that the land has to offer. And in case of Satavahana it was not just the land, but the sea played a major role. The western coast of India was abuzz with flourishing trade with Rome and middle-eastern countries under the western Shaka Kshatrapa, or Indo Scythian kings who were contemporaries of the local Satavahana dynasty and the Kushanas in the north. The political conflict between the Kshatrapas and Satavahanas made other associated clans such as Mahabhojas and Maharathis side with either Satavahanas or Kshatrapas, to take control of the flourishing trade, ports and trade routes. The anonymous work of first century CE, “Periplus of Erythrian Sea” and Roman texts such as Ptolemy’s “Geography” and geographer Pliny offer us a plethora of evidence of Indo Roman connections and ancient routes prevalent during those times. Hippalus, a greek navigator discovered the monsoon winds and the route across the Arabian Sea to India around 45 CE. Roman trade in India began with overland caravans and later, by direct maritime trade following the conquest of Egypt by Augustus in 30 BCE. This flourishing trade came to complete stop by the third century CE due to the collapse of the Roman economy and siltation of western Indian ports, but let us understand its nature. Roman traders preferred trade in silk, pearls, cotton, cotton cloth, indigo, ivory, spices, sesame, medicines and animals like tigers, monkeys, cheetah, peacock, and rhinoceros, from India to Europe; in exchange, Indians profited greatly by dealing in gold and silver. European markets were full with Indian goods. Wealthy roman citizens were in love with Indian silk and pearls. Roman wine, and slave women were coveted and one comes across evidence of wine carrying Roman amphorae in many archaeology excavations in western India. Romans took a circuitous sea route around Africa to reach the Persian Gulf and further touch the western Indian shores. Main Ports on western coast of India were Barygaza (Bharuch), Shurparak (Sopara), Kalyan and Chaul. Kalyan was a major loading and offloading centre from where traders would proceed by roads either by wagons/carts or loading the goods on animals to various parts of India. The principle route of Kalyan travelled to the important town of Junnar which was a trade centre and capital via the great Nanghat pass. It is on this pass the famous inscriptions of Satavahana queen Naganika are located in a rock-cut cave. Further important destinations were Satavahana towns of Paithan, Nevasa, Tagar (Ter) and Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh. One important route went south from Junnar travelling though Pune onwards to Karad, Kolhapur and Karnataka. The Roman texts are not the only sources which tell us about this ancient trade. The spread of Buddhism in the Deccan coincides with the Indo-Roman trade and the large scale of evidence is found in the form of western Indian rock-cut caves and inscriptions there in. Along with main cave groups of Kanheri (Mumbai) and hundreds of caves in and around Junnar, the trade routes along the Sahyadris are marked by scattered rock-cut caves mainly affiliated to Buddhism. The traders who travelled on these routes were known to take shelter in many of the Buddhist cave monasteries on the way and numerous inscriptions in the cave stand testimony to their association and patronage. Even today, as you travel via the Pune-Mumbai highway along the Bor ghat, and further down south towards Bengaluru, important cave groups with water tanks such as Bhaje Bedse, Karle, Agashiv, are located on both the side mountains along the way. Near home, the cave group of Shelarwadi, Buddhist vihar at Man near Hinjewadi and Vruddheshwar/Pandav caves (Hanuman Tekdi, Wadarwadi) are of ancient origin dating to early centuries of the Common Era. (We shall learn more about caves of Pune in future articles). Thus, Pune falls right on the ancient Indo Roman trade route. However, till recently we were unaware of any settlement from Pune which has any connection to this trade route. Amongst various objects reported in Pune’s urban excavations of Pune old town, Archaeo-zoologist, Dr Arati Deshpande-Mukherjee of Deccan College studied 95 fragments of shell bangles to find a clue to their origin. These particular fragments were made into circular shape by cutting sections of Turbinella pyrum shell by a sharp saw-like cutting tool. The decorations on the bangles consist of slight incisions, circles, rope-like patterns, embossed knobs and channelled grooves. However, most of them were plain. Adding to the interest, the debitage or discarded shell material after making the bangles was found along with these fragments suggesting a bangle-making industry. Though it is not possible to determine the extent of the activity, evidence certainly establishes a working industry in the heart of Pune. Further enquiry into the particular shell used as raw material took the search to Gujarat coast near Saurashtra from where the original Turbinella pyrum shell can be procured. Similar bangle making industry operates even today in Bengal. These types of bangles were earlier reported from various Satavahana trade centres such as Paithan, Bhokardan, Ter and Nevasa thus underlining the significance as relevant trade goods. Thus, one can reasonably surmise that the market for such crafted bangles was definitely not local in small settlement of Pune and operated across western India and along the international Indo-Roman trade route. So don’t be surprised if handcrafted bangles manufactured in Pune with shell procured from the Gujarat coast are found in any excavated graves in Rome or Middle East! It is quite intriguing that the legends which mention the early beginnings of Pune as a settlements mention Kasari as one settlements where Kasars (Bangdi Kasar) are engaged in bangle making. Though it is difficult to trace a direct connection of the ancient shell bangle makers of Pune to medieval localised Kasar communities of old Pune, it definitely marks the similarity in the occupation. As they say all the roads lead to Rome, we can be sure that in the past, the one from Pune definitely did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sutradharas-tales-pune-s-roman-connection-bangles-offer-the-clue-101613554260507.html
17-02-2021||Delhi||DU fests shift online: Seniors happy, freshers sad||Scores of students wait with bated breath, for the whole year, to attend the coveted college fest. February used to be the time, in previous years, when DU students would party their socks off! Given the pandemic, it’s normal for many to despair and sulk at missing out on all that fun this time, however that’s not exactly the case for some colleges have announced that they’ll be organising online fest, which is a first in the university. “Mahek, the fest of Aurobindo college is being hosted online this year around twelve March. With the ongoing pandemic we thought it would be a good idea for the students to showcase their talents on an online platform rather than gathering physically at a place. And if we start, others will follow,” confirms Professor Sangeeta Kaul, Cultural Convenor of Mehak. What can one expect in the online fest? “We will have all the societies performing from Dance, Music, Dramatics to Fashion society. They will be given a week to prepare and record their performances and that will be showcased at the fest. We are also planning an interactive spic macay session and a Quwaali show. We are also looking for a celebrity who can perform at the online fest. There are many things planned, hopefully they all fall in place. Students are excited to execute and attend the online fest for the first time,” she adds. “At least I get to attend a fest in my final year. Else I thought my final year is going to be a #nofestyear. Last year, too, many college fests got cancelled because of the pandemic. So under the present circumstances, the idea of an online fest is awesome,” says Mukul Malik, a final year student of Sri Aurobindo College. He adds that most final year students are glad that the possibility of online fests has come up. “We are ecstatic that our college is organising an online fest! What would the students prefer? An online fest or no fest? Everyone knows that an offline fest is impossible since the pandemic isn’t over yet. Besides, whenever we use to go to fests of other colleges, we had to wait in long queues, and now none of that is needed. All we need is a click, to enter any college fest!” Some students are worried about losing out on candid moments as fests shift to the online space. Yukti Aggarwal, a first year student of Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies, says, “In many colleges, fests are happening online just to do the formalities. There is no doubt that on-ground fests are much better and worth going. The fun, dance, craziness and group photographs, which become the most memorable moments of college life, can only be gathered when in offline mode. Regardless, I must admit that an online fest is better than a college year with #NoFest. I’m secretly hoping they call Neha Kakkar this time!” But not all freshers are looking forward to online fest, and wish to be back on campus soon to be able to attend fest in their physical avatar. “Obviously offline fests are more lit. They are the best thing in college life, specially when you are a DU student. I wish that they don’t do online fests as yet, because that’ll just take the whole feel away. Rather, colleges must organise an offline one when we resume campus, and the experience is truly worth the wait,” says Aarushi Chaudhary, a student of Daulat Ram College.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-fests-shift-online-seniors-happy-freshers-sad-101613553306130.html

It is for the second consecutive time that the Left candidates registered their victory in the semi-urban town. In 2015, the CPI panel had won nine of the 13 seats. “This time, voters have reposed more faith in us. The mandate expresses a rejection of the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). People have supported us for the works initiated by our panel in the last term,” said Gurmeet Singh, who won from ward number 10. The panel contested on the bucket election symbol. The winner panel has six women candidates. Gurmeet’s wife Gurmel Kaur, a retired teacher, also got elected from ward number 4. “The SAD and the Congress did not field their candidate on their respective symbols. There was a hidden alliance between supporters of the two traditional parties as their candidates contested on the tractor symbol. At a meeting, the majority of our panel also decided to contest without the party symbol,” said Gurmeet, a district member of the CPI unit. Mansa is a bastion of the Left and three-time MLA Jangir Singh Joga is a native of Joga village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/leftbacked-independents-win-12-of-13-seats-in-joga-town-in-mansa-101613551561022.html
17-02-2021||West||Dinesh Trivedi explains why Trinamool leaders don’t want Prashant Kishor around||On Friday (February 12), Trinamool Congress's member of Parliament Dinesh Trivedi resigned in a dramatic gesture inside the Rajya Sabha, becoming the latest to quit the party ahead of Bengal elections. In a conversation with HT's Sunetra Choudhury, Trivedi blames election strategist Prashant Kishor's team for interfering in even his tweets and also says that he couldn't deal with the corruption that was rampant in Bengal. Trivedi hasn't revealed his future plans but has praised the Prime Minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Edited excerpts:What happened that led to your dramatic resignation on Friday?I did an emotional thing. I tried my best to salvage but I was sitting in Parliament and thinking - what am I doing? I am representing the ruling party of Bengal, I am a founder member of the Trinamool Congress, when nobody was there, when we were struggling against the might of the Left which was an ideological fight. We had asked for poriborton (change) and what is that poriborton? It is peace, prosperity and corruption-free (rule). Everybody must try and achieve that but every day I get a call that in my building, TMC goons are coming and asking for money. If you don't give money, there is violence. So, I was sitting, and I said - what am I doing here? I can't change, nobody's listening, I tried my best. There's not a single senior leader who doesn't know what's going on in my mind. The other day I was travelling with Saugato Roy and he agreed with me. He agreed with me and said - what do I do? He appeared so helpless. Politics is not master and slave or master or karamchari, but that's what it's been reduced to. And I said enough is enough. When I went inside the chamber, I didn't even have a letter written. I sat down there and wrote the letter and gave it.Prashant Kishor's team took over my social media: Dinesh TrivediSo the trigger was people calling from your area?It was a combination. For instance, the PM, the Governor of West Bengal are all constitutional positions. Does it look good to start abusing all of them? And if I give a speech in Parliament, the leader of the party in Rajya Sabha tells Mamata that Dinesh Trivedi didn't abuse the PM. That I didn't speak bad of the Home Minister. Are we here to abuse them? If there's something wrong with their policies, in a civilised manner you debate.You are referring to your tweet praising the PM ahead of your resignation?It was much bigger. Why are we in politics? For the country. When I resigned as rail minister, I said the same thing, that country comes first before the party. That's why it was dramatic for you, but for me it was natural and all building up. For instance, my Twitter account - party takes all our details. I could have said no also, and I don't know who uses my account. With my Twitter account, they abused the PM, they abused the governor. I asked why did you do that? I had to delete it many times too.Prashant Kishor's team tweets for you?I don't know who tweets, but the fact is, they do take our account password details. In good faith I shared but many times I'd see abusive tweets. I had to put my foot down and asked them to delete or I would. The governor also realized that Dinesh can't use such abusive language. One day they tweeted in Hindi, abusing the PM and used a bad word. I said that firstly, I don't tweet in Hindi and this isn't my language. My image would be tarnished. They want some kind of conflict with the Centre all the time, but I don't believe in that. If the state scheme gives ₹10,000 and Centre's 15,000, you can add and give ₹25,000. But this ego of not taking Centre's funds harms Bengal which needs development. So too much violence, too much corruption...I'll come back to the violence and corruption but to clarify you were referring to Prashant Kishor's company I-PAC when you said in Rajya Sabha that a corporate group has taken over Bengal?I called them consultants of political parties. Have political parties become so out of touch with the people that you need a consultant? It's not a bad word but the party which I have formed, we have struggled with our blood and sweat. After coming to power, somebody's given hundreds of crores and their employees tell you what to do, how to address rallies- then I think it's a shameful thing. When Mamata fought the Left single-handedly, there were only two general secretaries- Mukul (Roy) and me - we didn't need anybody. That was the time when emotions were there, liberation and the dream of a better Bengal. And the person who was involved ( Mukul Roy) is being abused day in and day out. For what? Everyone understands the problems, but they don't have the guts. Biggest enemy are the chaploos (the sycophants).But weren't the consultants (Prashant Kishor) also credited for Narendra Modi's 2014 win?Has Mr Modi said that? Consultants may have a role to play but you don't sell off your role and the party. They can't decide the party strategy.What you said about corruption, do you agree with what the BJP says about corruption in the TMC?Why should I have to go by the BJP? The people of the state are saying it. I've never opened my mouth but let me tell you that I sent a complaint to the principal home secretary and it goes down to the police. The person who goes is told- “Sabko dena parta hai (Everyone has to be paid)”'. The other day I fired the Home secretary by saying that have you put termites everywhere? Will you let the ordinary person live? I have everything here (signalling his phone). This is an everyday affair.You talk about violence now but isn't that a feature of Bengal politics down the ages?A- Are you trying to say that we should have accepted that? What was poriborton? If it was business as usual, then we have cheated the people. There was no change as far as violence and corruption were concerned. It's 100-fold now. At least during the Left, we didn't see political functionaries taking money on camera. When Narada tapes came, I was the first one to tell the leader to keep all those featured out. And for that, I was kept out and made the bad guy. I was not allowed to go campaigning in 2016.Do you think she favours her nephew Abhishek Banerjee?I don't want to go down that route. I only think that the time has come in India that we must get out of this family business. You must give credit to the Left and also the BJP that at the very top, they don't have bhai-bhatija (brothers-nephews). It is vulgar. For someone who's just come the other day.You mean Abhishek?Whether it's Abhishek or someone else, don't start using the chopper to go to your constituency. It doesn't gel. He was a kid when we were struggling. I understand that he uses a lot of foul language, that's not our culture. If someone in your household leaves, you call that person. Here you start abusing. And just because the prime minister is from Gujarat, you don't have to abuse Gujaratis every day.But aren't a lot of the people who are accused of corruption joining BJP?You should ask them that, who am I to reply to that? I can talk about TMC and when you talk about dynastic politics - if a CM's son or daughter becomes an MLA and everybody bows to them, that's wrong. If everyone starts touching their feet, isn't that vulgar?Is that what's happening there?I don't want to name. Abhishek Banerjee is otherwise a very intelligent boy. India is all about Gandhi. Mamata Banerjee is praised because of her simplicity, because of her hawai chappal and way of life but you can't have a split personality. If your leaders are found in some kind of corruption, no mercy. Due process has to be followed.Has the BJP been in touch?When asked I said it would be a privilege to join the BJP as it is the number 1 party in the world. Sitaram Yechury is also a good friend, so is Uddhav Thackeray, I met Sharad Pawar, everybody's a friend. I have seen it allDid the PM speak to you post the resignation?I don't have to wait to speak to him. At least he listens, here there was nobody to listen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election-2016/dinesh-trivedi-explains-why-trinamool-leaders-don-t-want-prashant-kishor-around-101613549327396.html

Bhoir said he has got permission from the Thane collector and police commissioner to bring the helicopter and develop the helipad on a three-acre plot. The helicopter will be permanently available at the helipad from March 15. A workshop to maintain the helicopter has been set up at the helipad. Bhoir has also hired a pilot, two engineers, and five guards.

I also travel to other states at least four times a month. The traffic snarls and the time consumption are the reasons why I decided to buy the helicopter,” said Bhoir, who comes from a farming family and lives in the village with his wife and their two sons.The family owns a 50-acre farm, where they grow rice and vegetables. They also run a dairy and own 300 cows. “These cows are not available here locally and to buy them I have to travel to Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana often. The helicopter will save my time and help me reach these places conveniently,” said Bhoir, who is also a five-time village head.Bhoir is also involved in the real estate business and has leased 50-acre land to build godowns. He also owns several godowns. Apart from its power loom industry, Bhiwandi is also known for godowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/entrepreneur-from-maharashtra-village-buys-helicopter-worth-rs-30-crore-101613549461082.html

That is why we have also installed toilets here," he said.He said in the past goons had misbehaved with the protesting farmers and that is why CCTV cameras have been installed in the area to identify such anti-social elements in the future.Sharma added that farmers are also planning to grow vegetables on the border too."There is an empty land to grow vegetables on both sides. We will stay here for a long time as we have a long fight with the government. Concrete preparations have to be made for the long fight. There is wilderness around, we will clean the area and make it suitable for farming. The government may take as long as they want. We want to make it clear that farmers will not go without taking their rights," he stated.Another farmer Virender Singh who is also part of the protest at the Ghazipur border echoed similar concern."Farmers have been attacked many times here, and the government is not ready to take any action against attackers. Now with CCTV cameras installed, farmers will know how these attacks are being conducted and who are the people conspiring against farmers," said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-installed-cctv-cameras-toilets-at-ghazipur-border-protest-site-101613548297119.html

It said granting bail would mean granting judicial approval to the marriage while observing the woman was a minor when she was raped.Vadakumchery maintained they were in a consensual relationship and that he quit his priesthood to marry her. He added the woman, and her family were also keen for the marriage to protect their child.“The trial court arrived at the finding that the victim was a child at the time of the incident. As long as the finding remains, allowing the [bail] prayer will amount to granting judicial approval to the marriage directly, indirectly, or by implication,” said Justice Sunil Thomas, while rejecting the bail plea.Also Read | Sister Abhaya Murder: Kerala priest, nun get life imprisonmentDuring the trial, the woman’s parents suggested the marriage.

The civic body’s standing committee has given directions in this regard after Aya Nagar councillor Ved Pal raised the issue of an erroneous message sent to a resident in his ward.Pal said that a resident in his constituency received a message saying, “Your request for death registration has been approved”. “The person who received this message was shocked. He has never applied for anyone’s death certificate. Later, after checking with the SDMC authorities, we found out that it was wrongly sent. But still, the language of the text could have been different... It should be changed,” Pal said.Senior SDMC officials insisted that the text message was “wrongly delivered” due to some technical glitches in the system. However, after Pal raised the issue in the standing committee meeting on Monday, the Leader of the House in SDMC, Narendra Chawla, directed the officials of public health department to change the content of these messages and also ensure that they are not delivered to the wrong people. “We have asked the department to change the format and include the name of the deceased and the person who has applied for the death certificate. The language of the message, which was sent to the wrong person, was also such as if he/she had applied for the certificate,” Chawla said.He added that the department has also been asked to make its system of application for and downloading of various certificates more user friendly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-to-fix-technical-glitch-tweak-notification-sent-out-for-death-certificate-101613547000775.html

If the answers to the questions raised by the members are still not made available on time, it amounts to misutilisation of funds. Besides, it also leads to criticism of the government, which is accountable to the Vidhan Sabha,” said Sinha.The Speaker has also called for a meeting on Wednesday with the nodal officers of all the departments and the principal secretary, parliamentary affairs department to underline the importance of timely replies to questions.Sinha said timely replies to questions will give an opportunity to the members to ask related supplementary questions on issues of public importance. ”This is important to create an atmosphere for meaningful discussions and debates, which is the essence of a healthy democratic system,” he added.The Speaker is quite particular about timely replies, according to a senior official of the assembly secretariat. “Many a time, replies come, but quite late or after the session. Usually, on a day not more than 40-50 questions are taken up in the house during the Question Hour, but the actual number is quite high and the replies need to reach the concerned members and also the media,” he added.For the 104 first-time members in the newly-elected assembly, the month-long Budget session will provide a first-hand experience of the legislative practices. The Speaker got a helpdesk set up earlier this month in the assembly secretariat to help them.Since 2018, Bihar assembly has implemented online questions and replies management system which refers questions posted online to concerned departments for replies.The forthcoming Budget session will have 22 sittings, exactly the same as the 2020 Budget session.

17-02-2021||Bangalore||Doctors at Bengaluru hospital remove 3.5 kg tumour from 15- year-old girl's neck||Doctors at a hospital here have successfully removed a 3.5 kg crippling tumour from a 15- year-old girl's neck. Extending from her neck onto her chest, the benign tumour which had affected Surbhi Ben's life for more than a decade is identified by the doctors as fibromatosis. A team of 21 doctors at Aster CMI Hospital performed the surgery to remove the football-sized tumour stuck on her neck. She is now able to resume her life normally, according to hospital statement on Tuesday. Born in an underprivileged family of farm labourers in Amreli district of Gujarat, Surbhi Ben was still a toddler when her parents first noticed the lumps around her face that have since then engulfed her neck, making her social pariah of sorts. Over the years, her family had approached several doctors in and around Amreli district where many of them had suggested that the tumour cannot be excised upon at local hospitals and recommended her to approach hospitals in metro cities. The treatment involved surgeries and injection sclerotherapy which were quite expensive, the hospital statement said. Due to the prevailing economic condition of the family, they were unable to bear the cost of the treatment and pinned all their hopes on a miracle that could gift their child a new life. Explaining her plight, Surbhi said she was unable to go anywhere because of the tumour and had to drop out of school a year ago due to the immense pain in her neck while doing my homework or an assignment. "Even while stepping out, I had to cover myself and unlike other girls, I could not wear normal clothes and dresses due to the ailment. I often used to ask my mother, why am I the only one who is suffering and there were several moments where I used to feel hopeless and frustrated", she said. Despite her crippling ailment, Surbhi had an optimistic outlook and wanted to resume her schooling to fulfill her dream of becoming a teacher. Fortunately for her, hope soon arrived in the form of a few well-wishers -- the 'NewsLions' helped facilitate the treatment along with 'Milaap' and raised over ₹70 lakh through a crowdfunding effort to provide her this life- changing surgery of multiple sittings over last one year. Once the funds were arranged through Milaap, the family then reached out to Aster CMI Hospital, where the team of doctors and surgeons worked for several months to remove the growth from her neck. Speaking about the complications involved in Surbhis surgery, Consultant - Paediatrics & Paediatric Intensive Care, Aster CMI Hospital, Chetan Ginigeri said there were three tumours present in her throat and that was intertwined with the nerves of her neck, which made her surgery extremely complicated. Consultant - Surgical Oncology, Girish G said the case had extensive involvement of structures in the neck going to upper torso both within and out of the thoracic cavity. "The case was also immensely critical as the tumour had grown in the neck region where all the essential structures of life are located and hence we had to take extra precautions during the surgery", Girish said. "Presently she is fine, tolerating oral diet with no breathlessness and talking comprehensively. We overcame challenges in treating her successfully through a multi-disciplinary approach", he added. Lead and Senior Consultant - Plastic Surgery, Madhusudan G said the complete removal of the tumour posed a challenge of wound cover over the big blood vessels of the neck, exposed to sternum which was as large as 20 x 18 cms. Lead Consultant - CTVS Surgery, Ganeshakrishnan Iyer said: "This was a very extensive tumour growing in front and behind the sternum (breast bone). Hence the difficulty involved in removing the tumour from the front of the chest and then cutting open the breast bone was very challenging as the tumour was also stuck to the chest wall on the inside." President and Co-founder of Milaap, Anoj Viswanathan, said,"The powerful visual impact of the images on the fundraiser page and the video Milaap shot for Surbhis fundraiser accelerated the fundraising process." The video had over a million views on Facebook and was shared more than 1000 times. Over 6200 donors from all over the world united for this cause on Milaap. Expressing her joy on the successful recovery of her daughter, Surbhi's mother Rekha said:"We are seeing a new, beautiful, bubbly and bold Surbhi, thanks to all my brothers and sisters who contributed to her life-changing treatment". "Your kind gesture towards a stranger has reinstated my faith in humanity. She is now leading a normal life, freely riding her bicycle, playing with friends in the neighbourhood and doing her studies, without being subjected to any humiliating remarks from onlookers," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/doctors-at-bengaluru-hospital-remove-3-5-kg-tumour-from-15-year-old-girl-s-neck-101613542872062.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Surge in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra: Districts with high caseload and govt response||As Maharashtra records a surge in Covid-19 cases, the government has started issuing stern warnings to people of the state asking them to follow preventive measures.The state has seen a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases over the past few days which has led to the government to say that it will be forced to impose another lockdown if people keep flouting the guidelines.The concern regarding the rise in cases among the health officials in Maharashtra was seen after the state reported 4,092 new Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day tally in a month. The daily count did fall on Monday and Tuesday but it still remained over 3,000. Notably, before the reported rise on February 14, the state did record more than 3,000 cases for 4 days in a row.The state government has termed the situation as alarming saying that it is displeased with the conduct of the people as the pandemic continues to take lives despite vaccination drives being conducted in the country.The Shiv Sena on Wednesday in its mouthpiece Saamna said that the public has failed to take the government’s advice. It said, “Follow the rules, otherwise the lockdown will have to be imposed again. The same warning has been given by the State Health Minister (Rajesh Tope) himself. The public should take it seriously.”The Maharashtra government on Tuesday said that more than 15 districts have reported a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Jalgaon, Dhule, Jalna, Beed, Latur, Parbhani, Amravati, Akola, Buldhana, Yavatmal, Nagpur and Wardha were districts which reported a rise in the number of cases between January 4 and February 15.Amravati (10.69 % rise), Wardha (4.62% rise), Akola (4.27% rise), Yavatmal (3.16 % rise) and Buldhana (2.28% rise) were districts which saw a notable increase in the number of cases, according to a statement released by the Maharashtra chief minister’s office. Sindhudurg (7.15%), Beed (6.21%), Ratnagiri (6.09%) and Bhandara (4.69%) saw a rise in the number of deaths. The Union ministry for health and family welfare has asked Maharashtra to increase its RT-PCR testing if it wants to arrest the rise in the number of cases.“Over a period of time, both in Maharashtra and in Kerala, the number of RT-PCR tests have gone down and there is a need to substantially increase RT-PCR tests; this is something we have shared with both the states,” NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-districts-with-high-caseload-and-govt-re-101613541946576.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Mandatory RT-PCR tests continue to create problems at Mumbai airport||Three months after Maharashtra mandated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for passengers from Delhi, Goa, Rajasthan, and Gujarat, Mumbai airport officials said they continue to face challenges in implementing the rule.On February 14, a group of around 70 passengers refused to undergo the tests at the airport when they could not produce their Covid-19 negative test reports. The refusal left other inbound passengers stranded around the RT-PCR testing area for over two hours.Satish Menon, a Mumbai resident who had arrived from Goa and got tested, said the group refused to get tested even as the officials explained the rule. “They got aggressive in a manner that authorities had to close the door that led us towards the baggage counter. I tried explaining to the group that they were wrong and would have to get tested just like I did. But they were too violent to listen, which left over 200 passengers stranded for more than two hours. ”The authorities had to call the police to bring the situation under control.An airport official said passengers in large groups find it difficult to pay ₹850 per person for the test. “Despite being aware of the rule, they refuse to take the test and get violent with the staff in charge.”Maharashtra made a negative RT-PCR mandatory from November 25. Passengers flying into the state should have tested negative 72 hours before landing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mandatory-rt-pcr-tests-continue-to-create-problems-at-mumbai-airport-101613542200680.html
17-02-2021||Kolkata||Ahead of assembly polls, political cartoons adorn Saraswati Puja pandals in West Bengal||Ahead of Assembly polls in West Bengal, several Saraswati Puja pandals were decorated with political cartoons in College Square area of Midnapore district on Tuesday.A large number of people yesterday was seen thronging to the pandals for the worship of Goddess Saraswati on the occasion of Basant Panchami."People affiliated with different political parties try to put forth their views through cartoons that are enjoyed by visitors," a local said here.Another visitor Kangana Mukherjee said that these cartoons attract everyone who comes for the Pooja.While at another pandal in Sainthia area of Birbhum district of the state, Goddess Saraswati was portrayed as a healthcare worker amid the ongoing pandemic.The tenure of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government led by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal will come to an end on May 30, 2020. The upcoming state elections in West Bengal are slated to take place in 2021 for 294 Assembly seats.Basant Panchami, the festival which marks the arrival of the spring season in India, celebrated this year on February 16. Held on the fifth day (Panchami) of the Magha maas (month), Basant Panchami is also celebrated as Saraswati Puja in some parts of India.As per Hindu Mythology, Lord Brahma is believed to have created the universe on this day.Apart from that, the reason for the celebration of Saraswati Puja in some parts of the country is because it was believed that on this day Goddess Durga gave birth to Goddess Saraswati.The significance of the occasion is huge in Hindu culture, as the day is considered extremely auspicious to start new work, get married or perform house warming ceremony (Grah Pravesh).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ahead-of-assembly-polls-political-cartoons-adorn-saraswati-puja-pandals-in-wb-101613540315773.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC cites possibility of death by suicide, acquits murder convict||The Bombay high court has acquitted a 35-year-old murder convict from Satara saying there is a strong possibility that his wife he was convicted of murdering may have died by suicide.According to the prosecution, the woman was found dead under a tree hours after the couple in May 2013 left together to fetch wooden logs to support the roof of their hut. The woman’s mother found her daughter drenched in blood with a broken sickle and a blade nearby. She reported the matter to the police, accusing her son-in-law of having murdered her daughter. An additional sessions’ judge in Vaduj in April 2015 accepted the prosecution case based on circumstantial evidence and convicted the man of murdering his wife and sentenced him to life imprisonment.The man challenged the conviction. His lawyer, Aashish Satpute, argued the prosecution failed to prove the homicidal nature of death beyond a reasonable doubt.A division bench of justices Sadhana Jadhav and NJ Jamadar accepted Satpute’s argument. It said the prosecution proved that the couple was last seen together. But the bench added the nature of injuries indicated death by suicide. “The wounds found on the person of the deceased especially the situs, elective parts, and nature are suggestive of suicidal infliction.”The judges noted the woman was right-handed and had two injuries each on her left wrist and left side of the neck. “One injury each on the wrist and neck was superficial - like a test suicidal infliction and other injuries were deep - perhaps inflicted after the victim gathered more courage to take her own life.” The judges said both the injuries were parallel and the clothes of the deceased were not soiled, which they called “other signs of suicidal infliction”.“As the fundamental fact of the deceased having met a homicidal death itself is in the corridor of uncertainty, in our view, the circumstance of last seen and the failure of the accused to offer a plausible explanation, on their own, are not sufficient to sustain the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt,” said the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-cites-possibility-of-death-by-suicide-acquits-murder-convict-101613539500849.html
17-02-2021||Chandigarh||Rail Roko: Railways deploys 20 additional RPSF companies, focus on Punjab, Haryana, UP||The railways has deployed 20 additional companies of the RPSF across the country, with focus on Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, in the wake of the "rail roko" called on Thursday by farmer groups protesting against the Centre's new agri laws.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions which is spearheading the protest, last week had announced the rail blockade to press for its demand to repeal the legislations.Director General, Railway Protection Force, Arun Kumar on Wednesday said, "I appeal to everyone to maintain peace. We will be liaisoning with district administrations and will have a control room in place.""We will gather intelligence. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and some other areas will be our focus. We have deployed 20 companies of the Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) in these areas," he said."We want to persuade them to not cause inconvenience for passengers. We have a four-hour window and we want it (rail roko) to get over peacefully," Kumar said.The SKM had said that the rail blockade will held across the country from 12 pm to 4 pm.Sources in the northern railways said they are expecting that 'rail roko' agitations will be concentrated in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh."No decision has yet been taken on train movement in the backdrop of the rail blockade. Once we get a better picture of the status of the protests and have identified sensitive spots, we will put in place a plan of action. We have around 80 trains which run through potentially sensitive areas and most of them would have passed through them before 12 pm," an official said.The announcement of the rail roko movement came amid the ongoing protests against the laws at Delhi's borders by farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and 'mahapanchayats' that are being organised in these states to garner support for the movement.On Tuesday, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni had said that farmer unions will hold meetings in poll-bound West Bengal as well and indicated that they will ask people there not to vote for those who are "snatching our livelihood".Railway unions which had earlier supported the farmers' movement have distanced themselves from the 'rail roko' protest.Sources indicate that the unions are not in favour of such "short protest" calls.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rail-roko-railways-deploys-20-additional-rpsf-companies-focus-on-punjab-haryana-up-101613538900793.html

Maninder Singh, a car mechanic, was arrested from near a bus stop in north-west Delhi’s Pitampura on Tuesday, said Pramod Kushwaha, deputy commissioner of police (special cell). Two swords were also recovered from Singh after a video helped police identify him, the officer said. “He was seen swinging his swords at the Red Fort and that incited the gathering there to cause more mayhem,” said the officer. The Republic Day violence left several police personnel injured after a group of farmers strayed from the pre-decided route of the tractor parade to reach Red Fort and storm it.Also Read | Deep Sidhu, Iqbal Singh taken to Red Fort to recreate sequence of R-Day clashesKushwaha said that Singh also ran a sword training school near his home in Pitampura. “He was a regular visitor to the Singhu border protest site and was motivated by speeches made by leaders there,” said Kushwaha. There was, however, no word on how speeches of farmer leaders at Singhu border motivated Singh to allegedly turn violent. The officer also said that on Republic Day, Singh had taken six other men from his neighbourhood on motorcycles from Singhu border to Red Fort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/red-fort-violence-delhi-police-arrest-mechanic-from-pitampura-recover-2-swords-101613538240483.html
17-02-2021||Bangalore||Father of 19-yr-old who died due to pothole makes emotional appeal for justice||“Just because someone in authority didn't do their job, a life is lost. Has anyone been held responsible?” asked Syed Mushtaq Ahmed, father of the 19-year-old medical student killed in a road accident on February 5.Tasdeeq Bushra died after her scooter was hit by the truck belonging to the Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) while she was trying to avoid craters on Lingarajapuram-Hennur main road. She died on the spot.“One life is lost, one dream is lost, just because of negligence. But no one is responsible. Even now, one department blames another one for the negligence. Days after the accident, they have filled the pothole now, does it take a life for authorities to fill potholes,” he asked while speaking at a meeting organised in Bengaluru to demand justice for his daughter.“She was a law-abiding citizen, who wore a mask and a helmet. She is killed because of negligence and no one is responsible. The cycle of blame will continue but there should be action against those who were responsible for this road project,” he added.The Bengaluru Police have decided to limit the investigation to the driver of the vehicle that allegedly ran over her. No probe has been initiated against the officials of the civic body or Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM), who monitor civic amenities.A senior officer at Pulakeshinagar traffic police station earlier confirmed to HT that only the driver of the truck, Palani, was booked in the case. “He has been booked for rash and negligent driving and we have collected CCTV footage as part of the investigation. Apart from him, no one is booked... No one from BBMP,” the officer said on February 12.This isn’t the first time that a pothole has claimed a life in Bengaluru. The Karnataka High Court is already hearing public interest litigation filed in 2015 on the condition of roads in the city. At a hearing earlier this month after Tasdeeq Bushra’s death, the high court lamented that the BBMP was yet to fix the problem and asserted that it was time the civic body came up with a clear timetable, not just status reports.“Imagine people dying because of potholes on roads. Imagine the plight of the family,” a division bench of Justice BV Nagarathna and Justice MG Uma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/father-of-19-yr-old-who-died-due-to-pothole-makes-emotional-appeal-for-justice-101613537842864.html

The duo are from Kerala and had planned to conduct explosions at Basant Panchami celebrations by Hindu organisations, and other strategic locations in UP. Their aim was to create religious enmity in society by doing so,” said additional director general (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar. He added that the STF recovered 16 high explosive devices with battery detonators, a pistol and live cartridges from the possession of the accused.PFI, which claims to be a social youth organisation based in Kerala, has been under the radar of police in several states. In 2019, many of its members were arrested across the state of Uttar Pradesh in connection with violent anti Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests.Recently the Enforcement Directorate filed a charge-sheet against office-bearers of PFI and its students’ wing -- Campus Front of India (CFI) -- for allegedly conspiring to incite violence and disturb harmony in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district, where a Dalit woman was gang-raped by four upper caste men last September. ED claimed that more than ₹100 crore were deposited in the accounts of PFI over the years and a very large part of this money is feared to have come in from the middle east.

They identify talent and nurture it. As a nation, all of us have failed if our students are studying in universities abroad and thereafter contributing to the economy of others. Therefore, universities need to reflect on how to stop the brain drain.”Stressing upon the difference between education and human resources development, he said, “Human resources development is a mere tool of education; it is not the foundation of education. It is the role and responsibility of education to ensure that our children are not considered as mere tools or instruments by the world but as thriving human beings.”'Sisodia said universities and educators will face certain challenges in India in the post-Covid and post-National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 scenario. “The first challenge pertained to the challenge of quantity. We introduced several missions and laws such as the Right to Education. We ensured that all children attended school. We created a bumper crop of school graduates. But then the child asks: Where should I go? What should I do now? And we don’t have answers,” he said.Read more: Congress fights polls to help BJP win, alleges AAP's Manish SisodiaSisodia urged universities to think out of the box to find solutions for the large quantities and lack of enough space for the students in higher education.“The bottom line is that we can say that students who graduate from our universities and colleges stands at some level of achievement.

This reduced to just 67,100 tests in January and just over 57,700 as on February 16, according to the daily data shared by the Delhi government.Read more: Uddhav Thackeray warns of another lockdown amid rising Covid-19 casesThe proportion of RT-PCR test has, however, increased from 49.9% in December to 58% in January and 63.8% in February.The daily positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among total tested — stood at 0.17% on Tuesday, the lowest ever recorded in the city. The positivity rate in Delhi has been steadily declining since early-December and has been below 1% for 52 days now and below 5% for 76 days.Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control if a positivity rate of 5% or less can be maintained over two week. However, experts and the state government have warned repeatedly against residents slackening their guard.“The reason for the number of cases going down across the country seems to be immunity gained by the population through exposure to the infection,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Read more: Amid fall in India's Covid-19 cases, 3 states see a surgeAs many as 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled during Delhi’s fifth serological survey, conducted in January, were found to have developed antibodies against the virusDr Kant however warned that the new Brazilian, South African, and UK variants of the virus may pose causes for concern. “If there is indigenous transmission of these variants, it will be very difficult to stop as these variants have a higher transmissibility and the vaccines may not be as effective against them,” he said.He also urged the government to maintain a high testing level.“The surveillance needs to be kept up at the same level that it was when the number of cases was high. It will be important to help the government in detecting any new cases that happen, especially if there is indigenous transmission of the new variants. Currently, a consortium is also sequencing a proportion of the genomes of positive cases and should be able to identify is that happens,” said Kant.Read more: South African Covid variant detected in 4 returnees, Brazil variant in 1: ICMRVaccination drive in DelhiOn Tuesday, over 15,000 doses of the vaccine against Covid-19 were administered across 265 centre in Delhi.

17-02-2021||Chandigarh||UP not doing enough to stop sex determination tests: Khattar tells Adityanath||Rampant gender determination screening in Uttar Pradesh has set alarm bells ringing in Haryana with chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar telling his counterpart Yogi Adityanath that its administration was not doing enough to check the illegal practice even as teams from Haryana were making inter-state raids. Since January 22, 2015, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign from Panipat, Haryana has successfully carried out 109 raids in 14 districts of UP and registered around 100 cases against UP residents after busting sex determination rackets involving touts targeting pregnant women from Haryana. In 2020, notwithstanding the pandemic, teams hand-picked by the Haryana health department, lodged around 100 FIRs under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PC-PNDT) and Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Acts, of which approximately 40 cases were inter-state — 22 in UP and 11 in Ghaziabad. “It was against this backdrop that Khattar wrote a two-page letter in immaculate Hindi to Adityanath informing him that UP officers appointed under the PC-PNDT Act were not showing much interest in their duties,” a government official privy to the correspondence said, on condition of anonymity. In the letter, penned on February 9, to which HT has access, Khattar said, “The teams of my state have conducted over 100 inter-state raids in UP and registered cases but UP has not conducted a single raid either in Haryana or in any other neighbouring states. This is a matter of concern for Haryana.” “During these raids,” Khattar said, “there were instances when Haryana teams were confronted with lack of coordination from UP officials. It would be commendable if UP’s PC-PNDT teams increased surveillance activities and started conducting inter-state raids not only in Haryana but also in other neighbouring states in order to bust sex selection rackets.” “Both states must make joint efforts, especially in bordering districts, to stop this heinous crime of female foeticide. These steps will benefit both the states with far-reaching positive results,” reads the letter. ‘Ghaziabad hub of sex determination, illegal abortions’As per the data shared with UP, Haryana had conducted 26 raids and lodged as many FIRs in UP’s Ghaziabad district, which prompted Khattar to describe the district as an emerging ‘hub of sex determination and illegal abortions’ in the National Capital Region (NCR). A team from Haryana conducted one such raid in Ghaziabad on Monday, in which two people were arrested after recovering three foetuses and a portable ultrasound machine from a prominent nursing home. Another major hotspot is Saharanpur where Haryana has conducted 26 raids, followed by Meerut (14), Shamli (9), Noida (6), Bagpat (5), Aligarh, Bulandshahar and Bijnore (4 each), Mathura (3), Muzaffarnagar, Amroh and Agra (2 each) and Sambhal (1) “Barring four districts, pregnant women from 18 Haryana districts visit UP for carrying out sex determination tests. This indicates UP has become a safe haven for those seeking boys,” an expert involved in the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign said, requesting anonymity. Improved sex ratioHaryana has registered 922 female births per 1,000 males in 2020. Khattar’s letter traces the steps taken by his government to improve the sex ratio at birth (SRB), which has improved by 51 points since 2014. In 2019, Haryana’s annual SRB was 923, the highest so far. While the annual SRB of the state in 2011 was 833, it rose to 876 in 2015, and further improved to 900 in 2016. The annual SRB remained static at 914 in 2017 and 2018, and jumped to 923 in 2019. “In the last six years, Haryana has saved the lives of around 30,000 girls,” Khattar said. Offering to help replicate Haryana’s successful ‘save the girl child’ programme in UP, Khattar told Adityanath, “I request you to issue directions to deputy commissioners and health department officials to extend active support to Haryana teams during inter-state raids in UP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/up-not-doing-enough-to-stop-sex-determination-tests-khattar-tells-adityanath-101613506500786.html

The post is currently occupied by the Congress party.Shinde’s filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court in January after the Bombay high court, too, had rejected his claim over LoP post in BMC in September 2020. “We have decided to file a review petition soon,” Shinde said on Tuesday evening.After the 2017 BMC elections, BJP had voluntarily forfeited LoP post. Of the 227 seats in BMC, Shiv Sena and BJP, who were in alliance in the state government at the time, had 84 and 82 corporators, respectively. The LoP’s post then went to the Congress, which had 31 seats.Current LoP, Congress corporator Ravi Raja, said, “If BJP truly had the interest of the people of Mumbai in mind, it would have accepted the Opposition leader’s post in 2017 itself. Now they are only being political.”After the Assembly elections in 2019, the Sena and BJP parted ways, and the Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) formed the government in the state.In February 2020, BJP staked the claim to the Opposition leader’s post in BMC after party’s city president Mangal Prabhat Lodha wrote a letter to mayor Kishori Pednekar. However, Pednekar denied BJP the post, stating that once it was forfeited voluntarily, it could not be given back.Currently, BJP has 83 seats in BMC, including the support of one Independent corporator and another corporator from the Akhil Bharatiya Sena (ABS), while Congress has 29 seats. The Sena’s strength rose to 97, including the support of 3 Independents. NCP has eight corporators, while Samajwadi Party has six, Maharashtra Navnirman one and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has two corporators. The numbers changed owing to defection of MNS corporators to Shiv Sena, disqualification of corporators after their elections were challenged as well as due to death of sitting corporators..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sc-dismisses-bjp-s-plea-for-opposition-leader-s-post-in-mumbai-civic-body-101613506318406.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body budget: Drop in funds for gardens, disaster management||While the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s budget size in 2021-22 for some crucial departments such as health, bridges, fire brigade have increased, the allocation for some others such as the disaster management, water supply projects, market, and garden and zoo departments have seen a drop. On February 3, BMC presented a budget of ₹39,038 crore for the financial year 2021-22 – up from ₹33,441 crore in 2020-21. BMC increased its capital expenditure by about 48%-49% of the budget value, with focus on infrastructure such as coastal road, roads and bridges, several small and medium development projects, as well as on health and education departments. The disaster management department saw a dip in the budgetary allocation from ₹50.25 crore in 2020-21 to ₹39.47 crore. Though the allocation has gone down this fiscal, BMC has announced to conduct a risk assessment of all areas of the island city and its suburbs. The seismic microzonation, tsunami atlas and hazard vulnerability risk assessment (HVRA) will investigate the severity of the impact of disasters on various areas and on the livelihood of citizens. It will identify the threats that require a timely and coordinated response to protect lives, property and reduce socio-economic loss. The budget size of the garden department – which handles the open spaces in the city – was reduced from ₹685 crore to ₹521 crore. But despite the drop in allocation, BMC aims to modernise at least five gardens in each ward, as well as modernise the Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan and Zoo in Byculla. BMC has also proposed to plant 400,000 trees across 65 locations trees using the Miyawaki method. The markets department that overlooks the construction, upgradation and maintenance of municipal markets in the city was allocated ₹180 crore, down from last fiscal’s ₹264 crore. In the case of the water supply projects’ department, the allocation has gone down to ₹701 crore from ₹1,185 crore in 2020-21. Despite this, BMC has announced a new drinking water supply project which involves the construction of a desalination plant to turn seawater into potable water. A sum of ₹5 lakh has been allocated for the study of its construction. Commenting on the drop in allocation of certain crucial departments, additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “It is better to allocate the money that will be spent. We don’t want to allocate money and not spend it. For gardens, we aim to increase our focus on maintenance and construction via corporate social responsibility (CSR) method, through which BMC will save money and the citizens will even get the required facilities and infrastructure.” Viraj Mamania, a civic activist from Borivli, said, “Crores are spent on gardens and open spaces every year, as there is no fund crunch in BMC. But the amenities are not maintained. Few years ago, BMC provided the city with many gardens and gym equipment, but today they are non-functional or lying in rust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-budget-drop-in-funds-for-gardens-disaster-management-101613506020528.html

The incident took place when the victim’s mother, a domestic help, had gone to work and the boy was trying to catch a kite with people in the area celebrating the Basant Panchami festival. Some passersby rescued the child, identified as Ravneet, when they noticed him being dragged by the stray dogs. They took him to the Dhuri civil hospital from where he was referred to Sangrur town. The victim belonged to a migrant family. “I was at work when someone informed me that my son was attacked by stray dogs. I wake up at 5am and work as a domestic help in the village. My husband left us a year back. I was taking care of two daughters, aged 13 and 10, and my son,” said Meena Rani, the child’s mother. Paramjit Kaur, a resident of the village, said, “The family is poor and Meena is caring of all her children alone. The stray dogs also attack the locals and cattle. One cannot go in the ‘hadda rodi’ area alone. The administration has failed to curb the stray menace.” “The issue of ‘hadda rodi’ has been raised several times, but to no avail. The administration should shift the location to resolve the stray dog menace,” said Ishwar Singh, a local resident who took the child to hospital.

Wearing face masks is mandatory while travelling on local trains, which resumed services for the general public during specified time slots from February 1. According to the Westerna and Central Railway data, 4,618 commuters have been for travelling without face masks on Central (CR) and Western Railway (WR) between February 1 and February 14. With 1,715 people fined, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) has recorded the highest number violating this Covid-safety protocol. Fines worth ₹4.5 lakh have been collected so far, with ₹1.21 lakh recovered on CR and ₹3.28 lakh recovered on WR. “We request passengers to follow Covid-19 protocol while travelling by suburban local train services. Commuters are requested to maintain social distance and wear face masks during their commute,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, CR. Passenger associations have also asked commuters to wear facial masks while travelling. “It is very important to wear face masks while travelling by local trains and when in public. All passengers should wear masks and commute,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad. Local train services resumed for the city’s general public on February 1 with restricted timings. Commuters are permitted to travel by train between noon and 4pm; after 9pm and from first local train service until 7am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/288-commuters-in-mumbai-local-trains-fined-daily-for-travelling-without-masks-data-101613503798946.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Positivity rate rises to 4% with spike in new Covid-19 cases: Mumbai civic body||In the last seven days, the city’s average positivity rate has risen to 4% after it had dropped below 3% last month. Positivity rate signifies the percentage of people who have tested positive of the total tested for Covid-19. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is conducting an average of 15,000 tests daily for Covid-19 and has said that at present, the increased numbers are not high enough to merit any speculation of a “second wave” of infections. Between January 22 and February, Mumbai’s Covid positivity rate had dropped to below 3%. However, since February 9, the positivity rate has been going up. “There are several reasons for the spike. People have remained home for months and dropped their guard due to fatigue, which is leading to the spread of infection,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Dr Bhupendra Patil, medical officer (health) (MOH) of M (West) ward, which covers Chembur, said citizens need to adhere to Covid-19 protocol. “If people don’t follow the safety guidelines issued by the state, we might witness a second wave. But it is too early to say. We need more data for analysis, which will take another week,” he said. City doctors pointed to the resumption of local train services for the general public since February 1 as a possible cause for the spike in numbers. “To some extent, we did expect the cases to go up after the lifting of restrictions. However, we will land up with a second wave if we do not follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour. Besides handwashing, face masks and social distancing, we should probably consider having staggered office timings, delay starting schools and colleges, and consider vaccinating vulnerable groups as soon as we possibly can,” said Dr Anita Mathew, infectious disease specialist at Fortis Hospital in Mulund. However, Kakani said, “Though cases have increased recently, we cannot say we have been hit by the second wave.” Dr Mathew also advised against attending big gatherings. “Unless absolutely necessary, we should stop venturing out for gatherings, family events and shopping. As much as we would love going back to pre-Covid-19 times, we have to understand that we need to control our social behaviour and restrict ourselves for another year or year-and-a-half,” she said. As a precautionary measure and for early detection, BMC has started using mobile vans to screen and test in Dharavi. “The number of new cases is almost constant in Dharavi, but residents have started going to work with the unlocking. To identify high-risk contacts, mobile vans will go around appealing people to test,” said assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/positivity-rate-rises-to-4-with-spike-in-new-covid-19-cases-mumbai-civic-body-101613503558266.html
17-02-2021||Dehradun||Everest summiteers to IITian top cop: People at forefront of U'khand rescue ops||The tragedy that struct Uttarakhand's Chamoli on February 7 has been testing those involved in the search and rescue operation every day. Those leading the challenging task and at the forefront of it include trained mountaineers, IITian top-cop, structural engineers to Everest summiteers and senior officers of state police, rescue agencies and state administration.Posed with new difficulties and challenges every day, they have been working tirelessly to bring relief to the affected families. HT spoke to some of the main rescuers and officers on the frontline who are leading and coordinating the search and rescue operations at Rishiganga, Tapovan and downstream, in which the death toll has now reached 58 while 146 are still missing.Navneet Bhullar, commandant, SDRF UttarakhandNavneet Bhullar, who was part of the 2018 Everest expedition, said after he came to know about the tragedy and its magnitude, he, along with five other SDRF members, flew to Joshimath and reached the disaster site by 12.45 pm.“There was chaos and people were panic-stricken. The first thing we did was to mobilise 11 SDRF teams of nine members each. The Army from Joshimath had already reached there. The ITBP also came by the second and the third day the NDRF personnel joined. We spoke with NTPC engineers for maps and details of workers at the site. We had to change our rescue tactics to see whether if there were workers in the underground tunnel. Boulders and water percolation also created many challenges. Personally, I feel not knowing exactly where workers could be was very difficult to process,” he said.“My mountaineering experience, especially the Everest expedition, helped me lead the SDRF team to the lake that had formed upstream and get back with its first up-close visuals,” he said.Also read: Activists question govt's move to push on with Uttarakhand hydel projectsEverest summiteers of SDRF's Hight Attitude Rescue Team (HART)When inputs came that a lake was forming again upstream Rishiganga, an eight-member HART team, which included six people who had scaled Mount Everest in 2018, and Navneet Bhullar, who had to stop 160 metres short of Everest peak due to malfunctioning of his oxygen cylinder in the same expedition, was sent to the area for the ground survey on Friday. The team trekked the whole day, camped for the night and reached the lake the next day. They took stock of the ground situation and took photographs, samples of soil and water from the lake for analysis by the experts.“We had been given four tasks. We had to get photographs and videos of the lake. Second, we had to get water, soil and mud samples. Third, we had to check the possibility of a helipad in the area, which we realised was not possible given the terrain there. And four, we were asked to widen the point where the water of the lake was draining out, if possible. We sent one team member, Manoj Joshi, there but it was too risky. He widened it by few feet but then we called him back as it was too dangerous,” said Ravi Chauhan, member of the team and an Everest summiteer.Manoj Joshi, another Everest summiteer, said, their experience of rescue operations in Kedarnath area in 2013 and the 2018 Everest expedition helped them reach the lake upstream faster.“With the help of a rope, I even reached the drainage point of the lake to see whether it can be widened. It was a very dangerous incline and widening it was difficult. But being the first team that reached there, we gave our inputs that lake was draining slowly and apprised authorities and experts about the ground situation,” said Joshi.Swati Bhadoriya, district magistrate, ChamoliSwati Bhadoriya, the district magistrate of Chamoli, an IAS officer of 2012 batch, said it has been her most challenging time in the service so far at many levels. “I was at Gopeshwar when I came to know around 10.40 am on February 7 that something had happened. Initially, we didn’t think it was such a big tragedy but when more inputs came, I cancelled all my engagements and left for Tapovan and reached there within nearly two hours so. I started coordinating the search and rescue operations with local officials, the police, the SDRF, the Army and the ITBP. I called senior government functionaries and requested for a chopper and an expert team and also issued alert for downstream banks to be vacated. I left my three and half-year-old son with my help. For the next four days, I didn’t see my son. After 4 days, I brought him to Joshimath where I stay for the night these days. I am devoting all my time to coordinate search and rescue operations and take care of issues like providing relief to the affected people and restoring connectivity to 13 villages," she said.Bhadoriya said the first major operation was rescuing 12 people trapped in one of the tunnels in Tapovan on February 7. “We took the help of structural engineers of NTPC who gave us maps and we prepared a list of missing people. One major thing concern is to find ways to keep the morale of the rescuers up. To keep them motivated has also been a big task,” she said.Ridhim Agarwal, DIG, SDRF UttarakhandAn IPC officer of 2005 batch, Agarwal said the biggest challenge initially for her was to mobilise the manpower immediately for rescue and search operation.“I came to know about the tragedy at around 11.45 am after which we immediately mobilised the state emergency operation centre. The nodal officers of the departments concerned came and started mobilising teams for rescue and search operations. We mobilised our three close SDRF posts at Rudraprayag, Gochar and Joshimath. The flood team at Dalwala was also mobilised immediately. Overall, 100 SDRF personnel are pressed into rescue and search operations in 18 to 20 teams, including six teams from Srinagar to Joshimath which are looking for bodies downstream. Identifying decomposed bodies and body parts is emerging as a big challenge for us,” she said.“In such difficult times, you forget all your personal travails. You just want to save people and find bodies so that their families can get some relief. I had to leave my two sons studying back home. They are having their final examinations but they are managing on their own as I can’t give them any time these days,” she said.Also read: Uttarakhand glacier burst - Heavy damage to two hydel projects at the epicentreAshok Kumar, Uttarakhand DGPUttarakhand director general of police (DGP), Ashok Kumar, who became an IPS officer after passing out from an IIT was on his official tour of the Kumaon range and on his way to Almora from Nainital when he received a video of the flash floods on his phone. Seeing the video, he immediately sensed "it is something big" and rushed to contact all concerned police officers from Chamoli to Haridwar districts along the Alaknanda river to issue a high alert.Kumar said it was the first big challenge before him after being appointed the DGP last year. “The first thing I did after knowing about the disaster was to alert the people living alongside river and move them to safe places,” he said."The villagers near the river had shifted to safer places. Social media played a crucial role in alerting people as we had put out alert posts across all social media platforms, and it worked," said Kumar."Right from day one, our biggest challenge has been finding missing people and then identifying them," said Kumar.“Lessons learnt from the Kedarnath disaster helped the police and other agencies in the rescue and search operation. This time, we received four times more help than required," said Kumar.Aparna Kumar, DIG ITBPAparna Kumar, deputy inspector, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) sector headquarters, Dehradun, who is also the first ITBP woman officer to scale the South Pole, said when disaster struck, she immediately mobilised personnel under her command in Joshimath and left for the spot in her official car. She said that being the first responder to any disaster in the Himalayas, the ITBP personnel, after knowing about the disaster, immediately rushed to the spot from their base in Joshimath."Being a high-altitude force, the ITBP is trained to work for rescue in such disasters,” she said."It was a tremendous feat that our personnel worked with complete focus and determination amidst the chaos at the disaster site and were able to rescue the 12 workers trapped in the tunnel at NTPC's hydel power project site on day one itself. For others, the number of deaths or missing might be just a number but for us, every life trapped there is precious to be saved."Kumar said that she had called the force's doctors and medical staff at the spot to provide medical assistance to the survivors."I also ensured to provide solace to the workers of NTPC and the villagers who lost their dear ones in the disaster as it was important to keep a humane approach," said Kumar, adding that it was her first experience of working in such a "mammoth disaster."Neeru Garg, DIG GarhwalDeputy inspector general, Garhwal, Neeru Garg, an engineer-turned-cop had rushed to the disaster spot with chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and Garhwal divisional commissioner (DC) Ravinath Raman on February 7. Recalling the day, Garg said she was directed to leave for the spot with the CM and the DC. “Meanwhile, I had issued an immediate alert across all the districts downstream of Alaknanda river which included Tehri Garhwal, Pauri Garhwal, Rudraprayag and Haridwar," said Garg.A first of its kind experience for her, she said she "had never handled such a disaster as a cop before.""I had immediately asked all the police stations and outposts near the river to alert the residents to go to safe places apart from stopping all the activities in the river including adventure sports," said Garg.With the search and rescue operation still on to find those missing, the senior police officer said, "at present, the main focus is to recover the bodies and ascertain their identities."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/everest-summiteers-to-iitian-top-cop-people-at-forefront-uttarakhand-rescue-ops-101613502732378.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: MMRDA hasn’t given clean chit to TopsGrup, says RA Rajeev||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday recorded statement of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) commissioner RA Rajeev in connection with the money laundering case linked to Rahul Nanda’s TopsGrup Security Services Limited (TGSSL) and Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik.The senior IAS officer reached ED around 11.45am and left after around seven hours.While speaking to the media outside ED office, Rajeev said, “Officials tried to understand the functioning of MMRDA, tendering process and whom all are involved in decision making. The question session was over by 4pm, but as senior ED officers were not present,, I had to wait till 7pm for certain procedures.”Responding to a question regarding MMRDA reportedly having given clean chit to TopsGrup and Sarnaik, he said, “Clean chit has not been given.”ED sources said that Rajeev was requested to share details on the contract effected for taking security service from Topsgrup for MMRDA properties in 2014 and alleged irregularities linked to it. During that period, UPS Madan was heading the MMRDA, and as he is retired now, Rajeev was called by the investigators to know much about the dealings with TopsGrup. Commissioner’s statement was also recorded in connection with the say filed by MMRDA before Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) regarding alleged irregularities linked to MMRDA. MMRDA had informed EOW that MMRDA never required so many security personnel as claimed in the FIR.Rajeev was also questioned about the role of another senior MMRDA officer who was involved in the decision-making process of awarding a contract for security service to TopsGrup, sources said.ED sources claimed that the agency has in possession of some phone call recordings and text messages between a senior Topsgrup executive and Sarnaik’s aide Amit Chandole, who were discussing bribing an MMRDA official. ED may call another senior officer from MMRDA for questioning. More details about the questioning of senior IAS officer was not shared by ED officers.According to ED, a contract was signed between TGSSL and MMRDA in 2014, as per which about 350-500 guards had to be deployed at MMRDA sites every month. Of these, only 70% of guards were deployed, but the billing was done for all the guards as per the contract.ED in past had stated before the court that it appears that Topsgrup obtained the contract from MMRDA in collusion with Sarnaik through “illegal means by a well-thought-out strategy”. These illegal manoeuvres aimed to get additional inadmissible benefit by inflating the bills at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam, the agency claimed. Against this active role and criminal conspiracy, Sarnaik used to get 50% profit earned out of the said contract through his close aide Amit Chandole, said ED. Chandole and Topsgrup’s managing director M Shashidharan were arrested.In past MMRDA had refuted all the allegations in its statement submitted to the Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW), which is carrying out a parallel probe against Topsgrup. MMRDA’s letter to EOW stated that there was no financial misconduct on its part and all the works were done through tendering under the rules.Earlier Sarnaik and his son Vihang were questioned by ED.BOX: The ED has also issued fresh summons to actor Armaan Jain, cousin of actor Ranbir Kapoor for questioning in connection with the TOPSGRUP-Sarnaik money laundering case. ED has previously summoned Jain, but he did not appear. The investigators have also searched his premises in past. ED wish to question him in connection with business dealings, if any, with Vihang Sarnaik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mmrda-hasn-t-given-clean-chit-to-topsgrup-says-ra-rajeev-101613503378906.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||If citizens don’t follow norms, city might head towards lockdown, Mumbai mayor warns||Mayor Kishori Pednekar on Tuesday cautioned citizens that if Covid-19 protocol is not followed and the number of cases reported daily keeps rising, Mumbai could see another lockdown. Pednekar was speaking to reporters at the inauguration of Byculla zoo’s social media accounts. She said that while there had been deliberations on reopening schools in the city, the authorities may rethink this since the number of cases of Covid-19 in Mumbai have been rising of late. “An increase in the number of cases is witnessed in the city and if in this scenario citizens don’t take precautions, we will have to go towards lockdown. There is no other option if citizens do not take precautions. Hence, face masks, sanitising and social distancing are things we should continue to follow,” said Pednekar on Tuesday. “Citizens have to take precautions and even almost a year after the Covid-19 outbreak, I see many not taking precautions. It is because of this carelessness that we might have a scenario where the state government might consider another lockdown for the city.” Since local train services resumed for limited hours for the general public on February 1, there has been a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases reported daily in Mumbai. Last week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) wrote to the University of Mumbai (MU) and said it would decide on reopening colleges in the city after monitoring the situation till February 22. On Monday, BMC had said a review meeting would be held on February 22 to decide on further relaxations or restrictions in the city. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani had earlier told HT, “Daily cases being reported has increased and one of the reasons can be local trains, but there are other factors too involved here. With unlocking, social mingling has increased, and also citizens have stopped practicing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/if-citizens-don-t-follow-norms-city-might-head-towards-lockdown-mumbai-mayor-warns-101613503198405.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||TRP case: WhatsApp chats contain proof of my innocence, says Partho Dasgupta||The state government on Tuesday argued before the Bombay high court (HC) that Partho Dasgupta, former chief executive officer of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), was the mastermind behind rigging of television ratings and his WhatsApp chats with the anchor of a news channel proved that he was very closely involved in the rating manipulation to benefit the channel. Dasgupta, however, refuted the allegations and maintained that the WhatsApp chat, wherein he had told Goswami that he would not compromise on the outlier policy, was proof of his innocence, hence not granting him bail would be a travesty of justice. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda refuted the allegations of the state that the former CEO of BARC had direct involvement in the rigging of ratings at the behest of some English news channel. The single bench of justice PD Naik, while hearing the bail application of Dasgupta, was informed by Ponda that the gifts in the form of jewellery which his client had allegedly received from Goswami and were used at the time of his wedding. The jewellery that was purchased even before Goswami was conceived.Ponda further submitted that the statement of the BARC employee, which alleged that Dasgupta had not taken any action on her complaint of a sudden spike in the ratings of some news channel was negligence and not a crime. The statement was pertaining to Ramgarhia, and Dasgupta’s failure to act on a complaint. He also submitted that there was no grievance on the part of the advertisers who may have been induced to pay more to the channels, whose ratings had been allegedly rigged, hence he should be granted bail. Earlier in the day, the state through special public prosecutor Shishir Hiray continued argument opposing Dasgupta’s application for bail in the TRP manipulation case and said that the content of the WhatsApp chats recovered from Dasgupta’s mobile was proof that he was very close to some news channels and had masterminded the rigging of ratings. Hiray submitted that the post of managing director and CEO was equivalent in terms of authority and hence Dasgupta could not hide behind the argument that his powers as CEO were limited. Hiray also added that the post on which Dasgupta was appointed was sanctified and he had misused it to benefit some channels. After hearing the submissions, the court said it had concluded hearing the arguments and reserved its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trp-case-whatsapp-chats-contain-proof-of-my-innocence-says-partho-dasgupta-101613503018427.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court refuses to deport eight Pakistani nationals held with heroin worth ₹600 crore||The Mumbai sessions court on Monday refused to deport back eight Pakistani nationals caught by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) with 232kg heroin worth ₹600 crore on the high sea in 2015. All the eight Pakistani nationals, lodged in a Mumbai prison, had approached the special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act court seeking directions to the government authorities to deport them back to Karachi. They had claimed that a court at Mumbai did not have the territorial jurisdiction to try they and they can be prosecuted back in Pakistan, in accordance with the law of that country. ICG and Indian Navy had on April 20, 2015, intercepted a boat carrying Pakistani flag, AL-Yasir, 157 nautical miles away from the baseline of Indian territorial waters. The accused, namely Alibakhsh Allahbakhsh, 30, Yunus Sutar, 35, G Siddique, 40, Gulshan Maulabakhsh, 30, Bakhsh Natho, 40, Mohmmad Yusuf, 40, Mohmmad Ahmed, 28 and Maqsood Akhtar, were all found in the boat from which the packets containing heroin was seized. The lawyer for the Pakistani nationals, advocate Anil Lala, had pointed that territorial jurisdiction of the NDPS court at Mumbai extends only to territorial waters of India – up to 12 nautical miles from Indian shores. Therefore, Lala argued that, the applicants accused allegedly found on the boat in question, AL-Yasir, approximately 157 nautical miles away from the Indian coast were beyond the territorial limits or jurisdiction of any Indian court.” The public prosecutor SS Panjwani had opposed the plea, saying territorial waters of India continue up to continental shelf, exclusive economic zone and other areas determined in accordance with provisions of the Maritime Act, 1976. Panjwani further pointed out that as per section 7(1) of the said Act, there was an Exclusive Economic Zone of India which is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial waters and limit of such zone is 200 nautical miles. Besides, the prosecution relied on the United Nations resolution on the prohibition of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances to point out that a country can act against offenders even if the alleged offence is committed beyond its territory, if that affects the country concerned. “Therefore, even if the offence is committed beyond territorial limits or jurisdiction of Indian courts and if it is within its exclusive economic zone of India which extends up to 200 nautical miles, Indian courts will have jurisdiction to try such offences, being an offence against the country,” Panjwani argued. After hearing both the side, the court rejected the plea. The court said considering the seriousness of the alleged offences, the quantity of the narcotic drugs allegedly seized from the boat in question and that the aspect of national security is involved, it will be just and proper to give the prosecution reasonable and proper opportunity to prove the aspect of the jurisdiction of the court and its case on merits.” The court has, however, expedited the trial of the eight foreign nationals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-refuses-to-deport-eight-pakistani-nationals-held-with-heroin-worth-600-crore-101613502838312.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Amid Covid-19 pandemic colleges, alumni help students pay their fees||The Covid-19 pandemic and eventual lockdown has affected the financial situation of people across sectors. Keeping this in mind, several higher education institutes have introduced various methods to ensure no student ends up losing out on education, due to their inability to pay fees. While fee payment in instalments and part-waiver of fees were introduced in some institutes, in some cases, the college has reached out to their alumni to raise funds for students. “We realised that there were around 27 students facing similar issues and we didn’t want anyone to lose out on education due to lack of funds. Every year, Grenville Solomon, our ex-student gives scholarship of ₹1 lakh each to three meritorious students. But this year, around 27 students were in need of financial assistance and the alumnus helped without any hesitation,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra. Solomon helped the college with ₹4.5 lakh to cover the fees of 27 students who were in no position to pay their fees this year. “Such kindness and generosity in such pandemic stricken times is all we need to boost the spirits of students,” added Fernandes. In July 2020, the management of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) had decided to start their regular lectures virtually and almost immediately, the IIT-B Heritage Foundation (IITBHF) run by the alumni of the institute pledged to address the issue of necessary infrastructure needed to implement online classes. The group announced a grant of ₹2.35 crore which was used to buy around 1,000 laptops and to provide necessary internet and broadband services for current students who were attending lectures from across the country. At Jai Hind College, a handful of students approached the institute seeking extension in deadline for fee payment and the college promptly gave students the freedom to pay the fees, at their convenience any time in the year. “We also made it clear that in case a student can’t pay the full fees, they will not be forced to do so. We luckily have a corpus fund put together by our alumni and end up utilising that fund as and when needed for the benefit of our students only,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of the institute. In October last year, less than a month after colleges reopened with virtual classes etc, the University of Mumbai released a circular addressed to all affiliated colleges asking them to make instalment facility available for all students whose families are facing the economic strain of the Covid-19 imposed lockdown. During admissions for first year courses for the 2020-21 academic year as well, several colleges had dropped the basic admission fee in order to accommodate all students. In some cases, the college staff and management stepped up to cover up expenses of students in order to avoid more financial burden on the students’ family. “We had a case of a student who participates in national level sports activities and for that purpose, his stay and food etc when he travels for sports activities had to be taken care of. Towards the end of last year these sports activities have restarted and we (college management) decided to fund this student’s participation, travel and stay,” said Naresh Chandra, principal of BK Birla College, Kalyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-amid-covid-19-pandemic-colleges-alumni-help-students-pay-their-fees-101613502418407.html
17-02-2021||Other||Tweets by celebrities: Congress demands action against BJP’s IT cell, associates||HT CorrespondentMumbai The Maharashtra Congress, while stating that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) conspiracy behind the tweets by the celebrities has been exposed by the Maharashtra Police, has demanded action against the party associates involved in it.Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant, while referring to the statement by state home minister Anil Deshmukh, said that their apprehension, about BJP hand behind celebrity tweets, has proven true. Celebrities including Lata Mangeshkar, Sachin Tendulkar Ajay Devgn and Akshay Kumar took to Twitter on February 3 after Rihanna and climate change activist Greta Thunberg expressed support for the farmers’ protest. The Indian celebrities tweeted using #IndiaAgainstPropaganda and #IndiaTogether, framed by the external affairs ministry.“The preliminary inquiry by the police has established the involvement of BJP’s IT cell and 12 influencers. This is a conspiracy by BJP against the country. The police should now take strict and immediate action against them,” he said.Sawant also questioned why the celebrities did not come forward to clarify that their tweets were not under pressure from BJP and but they had tweeted out of their own will. “BJP resorted to false propaganda that the state government was probing Bharat Ratna recipients Mangeshkar and Tendulkar, though the inquiry initiated was into the pressure put on them to tweet. The tweets were sent out by Indian celebrities under pressure from BJP. None of the celebrities have come forward to say that there was no pressure on them to tweet,” he said.Maharashtra BJP’s media cell head Vishwas Pathak said, “The statement by the home minister is a face-saving attempt after the state government realised that their earlier announcement of action against Tendulkar and Mangeshkar had evoked a backlash. The tweets were by the celebrities. How can an action be initiated against our IT cell? What action and under which laws can be taken for tweets posted for the sovereignty of the country? We are ready to face any such action then.”‘Congress to fight on all BMC seats’Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole on Tuesday said that the party is set to contest on all the 227 wards in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, slated to be held early next year. A review meeting attended by key party leaders including Mumbai chief Bhai Jagtap, state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, public works department minister Ashok Chavan, former CM Prithviraj Chavan, among others, was held at party office to take stock of the preparations for the polls. The party has also decided to request CM Uddhav Thackeray to relook at the delimitation of wards done in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tweets-by-celebrities-congress-demands-action-against-bjp-s-it-cell-associates-101613501458312.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||Parents to protest inaction of Maharashtra government against private schools||Tired of the government’s inaction over issues concerning private schools, several parent organisations in the state have decided to protest at Azad Maidan on Wednesday (February 17), to demand redressal of their complaints.Parents said they have been writing to the education department over the last several months, demanding action against schools that levied charges indiscriminately during the pandemic, but there has been no action so far. “Several people have been rendered jobless due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown, and many have faced salary cuts. Schools, on the other hand, are exploiting parents by hiking fees and harassing parents and students for non-payment and late payment of dues. We demand a 50% reduction in tuition fees and a 100% waiver in term fees,” said Jayant Jain, president of the Indiawide Parents Association, which has organised the protest.Parents from Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune are expected to join the protest today. They said they have been demanding that the government conduct audits of private schools. “The government gives us an excuse that it cannot control fees of private schools, but it can definitely conduct audits as per the existing Fee Regulation Act. Why is it not doing so despite several complaints in the last few months?” asked a parent.The organisations plan to urge the education department to take action against schools which discriminate against students with pending dues by removing them from online classes, refusing to give their mark sheets and not allowing them to write exams.A government resolution released on May 8, 2020, stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court (HC) on June 26 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The petitioners had argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parents-to-protest-inaction-of-maharashtra-government-against-private-schools-101613501218568.html

Rane remarked that Thackeray would first have to ask environment minister Aaditya Thackeray to resign for his alleged ties to the case regarding the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput (SSR). Rane addressed a press conference in Thane to express his views on the Union budget. He also spoke on the suicide of a woman following which the forest minister had submitted his resignation on Tuesday to the CM. “Rathod might have sent his resignation to the CM, but the CM will not accept it as then he would have to ask Aaditya to resign due to the SSR case. The people of Maharashtra are still unaware who their actual chief minister is; Thackeray is merely the CM of Matoshree and not the state,” said Rane. Thane mayor and Sena leader Naresh Mhaske refused to comment on the issue, while MLA Ravindra Phatak and guardian minister Eknath Shinde did not reply to HT’s calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cm-uddhav-thackeray-can-t-accept-sanjay-rathod-s-resignation-narayan-rane-101613500564755.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||With AQI at 98, Mumbai’s air quality ‘satisfactory’ for the first time this year||The air quality in Mumbai improved significantly on Tuesday and fell in the satisfactory category for the first time this year. The overall air quality index (AQI) of the city was 98 on Tuesday, down from Monday’s 115. The AQI – a pollution measuring indicator – was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Of the 10 locations measured, Andheri had the most polluted air with an AQI of 190. Malad recorded an AQI of 159 and Navi Mumbai recorded 141, all in the moderate category. “Temperatures have been on the rise for some time now, bringing down pollution levels. Clean winds from the ocean have further improved the air quality in Mumbai. It is expected to remain in the moderate category for the next two days,” said a spokesperson for SAFAR.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning in parts of interior Maharashtra from Wednesday. “Under the influence of a wind discontinuity in lower levels over central India, its south-westward movement and moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal, light to moderate rainfall is likely over Marathwada and central Maharashtra, with isolated thunderstorms, lightning and hail. The conditions will persist for a couple of days,” said an IMD official. Rain and thundershowers are very likely at Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg for the next two days. Meanwhile, Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Nasik and Ahmednagar are expected to get thunderstorms and lightning. Temperatures are expected to drop marginally during the next two days, said the IMD official. Minimum temperatures in the city remained slightly high on Tuesday. At the Colaba station of IMD, a minimum temperature of 21.5 degrees Celsius was recorded, up from Monday‘s 21.2 degrees. The minimum temperature at Colaba was 1.1 degrees above normal. At Santacruz, the minimum temperature was up from Monday’s 20.2 degrees Celsius to 20.5 degrees Celsius. It was 2 degrees higher than normal. The maximum temperature at Colaba was 29 degrees Celsius, 0.8 degrees below normal. At Santacruz, the maximum temperature was 28.9 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees below normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-aqi-at-98-mumbai-s-air-quality-satisfactory-for-the-first-time-this-year-101613500318590.html
17-02-2021||Mumbai||MVA allies versus BJP and Centre: It is an all-out war in Maharashtra||If the recent bitter episode of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray denying state aircraft to governor BS Koshyari to fly to Uttarakhand is any indication, the war between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the Raj Bhavan, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Centre is set to intensify in the coming days. Considering Union home minister Amit Shah’s meeting with Koshyari in New Delhi, the Centre and the BJP seem to have taken serious note of the way Koshyari was treated, viewed as a challenge to the BJP-led Centre. Leaders from both the BJP and MVA camps say the coming days will see both the Centre and the BJP taking aggressive stand against the Thackeray-led government. The three-party MVA coalition of the Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), too, is gearing up to hit back at the BJP, beginning with the election of Assembly speaker and later luring some of the legislators who had crossed over to the BJP ahead of 2019 elections. The three parties are also looking to win maximum civic bodies and district councils in the elections to be held later this year. Guv episode The BJP is seeing the Koshyari incident as a deliberate attempt to confront the governor, who has not cleared the state’s recommendations to nominate 12 persons to the legislative Council for three months. Every six years, 12 of the 78 seats of the upper house of state legislature are filled by the governor on the recommendation of the state. “There will be consequences,” said a BJP MP. Through its mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena said the episode was the fallout of a delay in clearing the names. “The delay in appointments is because he follows the orders from Delhi,” the editorial on Saturday. Senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said, “Saamana editorial said it’s an open war. How can it be a battle when the governor has been acting within the framework of the Constitution?” The ruling parties have now threatened to move court if the recommendations are not cleared soon Speaker’s election Nana Patole’s resignation from the post of Assembly Speaker has necessitated fresh election for the post. The election gives the BJP an opportunity to tap into the dissidence in the ruling camp, as a defeat in the election would lead to collapse of the government. The MVA is looking at it as a chance to show its strength on the floor of the Assembly, ending speculations over its stability. During its confidence vote on November 30, 2019, the ruling combine had garnered support of 169 members, while the BJP had claimed the support of 114 MLAs. Parties like AIMIM, CPI(M) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had abstained from voting. Fadnavis had said last week, “A speaker is elected unopposed and it’s the tradition of the state, but it all depends on how the Opposition is treated by the ruling parties.” MVA leaders claim they can win upto 175 votes. NCP leader Shashikant Shinde said, “The MVA has retained its strength, but the question is whether the BJP has it?” Local bodies’ battle As many as 15 municipal corporations, 27 district councils and about 100 nagar panchayats are going to polls over next two years. Touted as mini assembly polls, the political ground will heat up among the four parties. When it was in power for five years until September 2019, the BJP successfully gained top position in local bodies, winning over 14 of 27 municipal corporations, 11 of the 34 district councils. This helped the party drum up support at ground level during the 2019 elections. The first such confrontation will be in the next few months as five municipal corporations, Navi Mumbai, Vasai Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur and Aurangabad; two district councils of Bhandara and Gondiya and about 90 nagar panchayats governing small towns go to polls. MVA leaders say they have begun deliberations on the strategy, which means the three parties will form a coalition where the BJP is strong. They will contest separately where they have strength and do not want the BJP to take up the entire Opposition space. For instance, in Navi Mumbai, the three parties are likely to contest together to defeat strongman Ganesh Naik who is now with the BJP. In Kalyan-Dombivli, where the Sena is dominant, the NCP and Congress may contest as its junior partner or strategically as Opposition. In Aurangabad, the three ruling parties cannot come together due to fundamental differences over renaming of Aurangabad. “In local body elections, we will contest either as an alliance or individually depending upon the local equations to ensure the BJP is kept out of power,” said Congress working president Arif Naseem Khan. “The Sena will fight alone in areas where it is strong, just like the Congress and NCP. We have the option of post-poll alliance,” said Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Raut. Reverse poaching “If it is going to be an all-out war, we, too, need to be aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see defectors returning to the NCP or Congress,” said a top NCP leader. “We have been getting feelers for quite some time. Now there could be time for action. This would discourage the BJP from trying to topple our government.” NCP leader and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said last month that Shivendra Raje Bhosale (BJP’s Satara MLA who was earlier in NCP) and some other BJP leaders are eager to join the party. BJP leaders maintain that the speculations are being spread by the MVA partners. Collapse talk The first year of the MVA government saw uncertainty and speculations of collapse. “It is not hunky-dory. Neither the Congress, nor the Ajit Pawar faction in the NCP is happy. There is resentment over the style of functioning of CM Thackeray. Sooner or later the MVA will implode,” said a senior BJP leader. Mungantiwar said: “We are not interested in toppling the government.” Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “Metro car shed, TRP probe too will be the flashpoints between the MVA and BJP in near future. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has a strong back up to Uddhav Thackeray, and so is the coordination with the key Congress leaders. However, the faceoff is majorly between Shiv Sena and BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-allies-versus-bjp-and-centre-it-is-an-all-out-war-in-maharashtra-101613499959311.html
17-02-2021||Noida||5 of private lab in Noida detained for ‘unauthorised’ Covid vaccine||The Gautam Budh Nagar health department on Tuesday conducted a search at a pathology laboratory in Greater Noida’s Dadri after it received reports that an unauthorised Covid-19 vaccine was being administered to people in that town.Five persons were detained from the path lab, Gopal Pathology Lab, on GT Road, and the premises sealed after it was ascertained that 18 people were administered the unauthorised vaccine, said the district health department. The health department is yet to ascertain whether those who received the unapproved vaccine are fine.Currently, only two Covid-19 vaccines are approved for use in India -- the Covidshield vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India, and the Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech.Later, the lab management informed the health department that they were conducting the third phase clinical trial of a Covid vaccine, developed by private pharma company, Zydus Cadila Healthcare Limited.The health department said the vaccine manufacturer had authorised Flores Hospital in Ghaziabad to conduct the clinical trial. “The hospital was supposed to conduct the trial, but it shared the vaccine vials with the Dadri lab. We have seized 275 vials and initiated action against the hospital and the lab,” chief medical officer Deepak Ohri said.Dr Manoj Kumar, owner of Flores Hospital, said he had permission from the competent authority of the Union government to conduct the clinical trial. “We were supposed to conduct trials on 1,000 people. We signed an agreement with Dadri lab as a satellite centre on Monday to share the work. We had no idea that the local district health department’s permission was needed to conduct the clinical trial,” he said.A Zydus Cadila spokesperson said the company’s Covid vaccine is at present in the trial stage and people are not being vaccinated. The spokesperson said they would release more details in this matter soonDr Sanjeev Kumar, the in-charge of the Community Health Centre, Dadri, said the laboratory was administering a new Covid vaccine to people on Tuesday. “They had placed a banner informing people about the free Covid vaccination drive in collaboration with Nari Raksha Dal. Some locals took a photo of the vaccination drive and that went viral on social media,” he said.Kumar said when he received the information about the illegal drive, he informed his seniors about the matter. “I was directed to go and verify the matter. The lab management told me that they were conducting a clinical trial of a Covid vaccine, developed by Cadila Healthcare Limited. They had by then administered the vaccine to 18 persons,” he said.“They showed us some documents having the approval from the Drugs Controller General of India, for the clinical trial, but they had not informed the health department or the district administration about this exercise,” he said.Dr Ohri said the health department was not informed about this exercise. “The vaccination drive or a clinical trial can’t take place in such a lab. The government has notified certain sites for such clinical trials. They (the lab) had no permission from the health department or the district administration. We have sealed the premises and also arrested five persons from the lab,” he said. Ohri said a police complaint has also been filed against them.Rajveer Singh Chauhan, SHO Dadri police station, said a case will be registered based on the complaint. “The health department and the police team are questioning the lab employees. The FIR may be registered once the primary investigation is over,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/five-of-private-lab-in-greater-noida-detained-for-administering-unauthorised-covid-vaccine-to-18-people-101613499298195.html

The meeting that lasted for around 90 minutes has sparked speculations in political circles ahead of West Bengal assembly elections which are scheduled to be held in the next few months.Chakraborty told the media that the meeting had nothing to do with politics as he is away from it now and wants to remain an actor. The RSS too said that the meeting was pending for around two years and has no political connection.“The first thing I wanted to say is that I have a spiritual relationship with Bhagwat ji which is also not new. He had once told me that he will come to meet me when he will be in Mumbai. He loves me and my family. Today, he was in the city and a meeting took place. You (media) are trying to connect dots because of West Bengal polls but the meeting has nothing to do with politics,” Chakraborty told reporters in response to a question after the meeting.“I have always fought for the poor section of the society. Whoever will work for the welfare of the poor, I will support them anytime but this time no politics,” he said on a question of getting an offer to join another political party.“I am far away from politics now. I am an actor and want to live like that,” he added, responding to another question.The BJP is reportedly looking for a popular Bengali face for the Bengal polls and the meeting has triggered speculations if Chakraborty would be joining the party.Also read: Kiran Bedi removed as Puducherry LG, Tamilisai given additional chargeThe popular Bollywood actor was nominated as a Rajya Sabha member by the Trinamool Congress in 2014 after Mamata Banerjee came to power in Bengal but resigned within two years citing health issues. He was also summoned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the Saradha scam in 2015.Chakraborty met the RSS chief in 2019 in Nagpur, which was termed as a ‘courtesy visit’. The actor spent an hour at the RSS headquarters and then visited the Hedgewar memorial.Pramod Bapat, in-charge, western zone media relations, RSS, termed the meeting as a courtesy visit. “The meeting was pending for almost two years. Chakraborty wanted the RSS chief to visit his Mumbai residence for a long time. The RSS chief could not do it because of lockdown restrictions that stretched for months. Today’s meeting should not be linked to politics,” Bapat said."Bhagwat Ji met Chakraborty in a cordial atmosphere before the Bengal elections. The actor is loved by a wide section of Bengalis not just for his contribution to cinema but also to the nation. He was the country's highest individual income tax payer for four consecutive years. He returned the money he took from Saradha. That establishes his devotion to the nation. He is a thinking person. It is expected that Mithun will contribute positively to shape the future of Bengal which stands at the crossroads of history right now," said Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar.The TMC was quick to react and described the meeting as BJP's act of desperation."The meeting shows the desperation of the BJP. Mithun is an actor who has confined himself to Ooty. He has no relevance in Bengal politics now. He was made a Rajya Sabha member by Mamata Banerjee but he quit after facing threats from the Enforcement Directorate," said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy.In 2015, Chakraborty returned ₹1.16 crore to the ED. He received the money when he was the brand ambassador of the Saradha group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ahead-of-bengal-polls-rss-chief-meets-mithun-chakraborty-101613492208823.html
17-02-2021||World||Trump slams McConnell as GOP divide deepens post-impeachment||In yet another sign of the intensifying battle for the control of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump on Tuesday lashed out Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, calling him a “dour, sullen and unsmiling political hack”.Trump also said he will back supporters take on Republican lawmakers seeking re-election in the primaries, the inner-party nominating contests. This was a clear signal to anti-Trump elements to fall in line or face his base’s ire, a career-threatening prospect for many Republicans.“Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again,” Trump said in a statement, adding, “Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First.”Trump’s outburst came after days of escalating attacks from McConnell who started by slamming Trump in a speech from the floor of the Senate after voting to acquit him in his second impeachment trial last week. McConnell said Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for the January 6 insurrection, and that the former president could still face legal jeopardy. “He didn’t get away with anything yet,” said McConnell.McConnell, who is the minority leader in the senate, carried on in this vein in a widely seen, cited and discussed Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, indicating he was not backing down.The Republican Party is struggling to deal with Trump, a former president who will not go away as they normally do. Ten of them voted to impeach him in the House and 7 held him guilty in the senate trial. Nikki Haley, who is expected to run in 2024, is among leading Republicans who have broken with Trump, saying he “let us down”.Many others have either recanted their initial criticism of the former president — Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, and Senator Lindsey Graham, for instance — or held their tongue, fearing his continued popularity with the party’s base. Nearly 6 out of 10 registered Republicans said Trump should play a dominant role in the party, in a Morning Consult/Politico poll released on Tuesday. And only a slightly lower number of the — 54% — said they will back him in the 2024 primary, a whopping 42 points ahead of former vice-president Mike Pence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-mcconnell-as-gop-divide-deepens-postimpeachment-101613585162501.html

17-02-2021||World||UN nuclear chief to visit Tehran; Germany's Angela Merkel presses Rouhani||The head of the UN nuclear watchdog will travel to Iran this weekend in an effort to find a “mutually agreeable solution” that allows it to continue its inspections in the country, the organization said Wednesday.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel pressed Iran's president for “positive signals” that would help resolve a diplomatic standoff over the future of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, her office said.The International Atomic Energy Agency said that Director General Rafael Grossi will visit Tehran on Saturday for discussions with senior Iranian officials, whom it did not identify.It said the aim is “to find a mutually agreeable solution for the IAEA to continue essential verification activities in the country."Grossi's trip comes amid diplomatic efforts to keep alive the nuclear agreement, which has been unraveling since the U.S. under then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from in 2018.Tehran has been using its violations of the deal to put pressure on the remaining signatories — France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China — to provide more incentives to Iran to offset crippling American sanctions re-imposed after the U.S. pullout.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it does not want to do.President Joe Biden has said he will seek to revive the deal, but insisted that Iran must first reverse its nuclear steps, creating a contest of wills. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said earlier this month that the U.S. must lift all sanctions if it wants Iran to live up to commitments.In a phone conversation with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “high interest” of Germany and the other remaining signatories in preserving the deal, her office said in a statement.She voiced concern that Iran isn't fulfilling its commitments and told Rouhani that “it is now time for positive signals that create trust and raise the chances of a diplomatic solution,” the statement added.Iran has said it will stop part of the inspection of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA next week if the West doesn't implement its own commitments.On Monday, Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, said he had sent a letter to the agency detailing restrictions on inspectors to take effect on Feb. 23.He said Iran would cease to adhere to the so-called Additional Protocol, an arrangement that provides the IAEA broad access and information regarding Iran’s nuclear program, including both declared and undeclared facilities.Following the killing of a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist last fall, Iran’s parliament passed a law that vowed to restrict access of U.N. watchdog inspectors if the sanctions imposed on its oil and banking sectors are not lifted.Grossi last week offered to travel to Iran in view of the proposed changes, which the agency said “would have a serious impact on the IAEA’s verification and monitoring activities in the country.”On Thursday, the French, German and British foreign ministers plan to discuss Iran at a meeting in Paris and hold a videoconference with new U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-nuclear-chief-to-visit-tehran-germany-s-angela-merkel-presses-rouhani-101613581618209.html

Several days later, an Emirati man called authorities to say a stray camel had wandered onto his farm some 3 kilometers (almost 2 miles) away.When interrogated, the man’s story fell apart, according to police in Dubai. He soon admitted to trespassing on his neighbor’s farm to steal a rare breed of camel for his girlfriend, the report said, settling for the newborn after failing to wrangle an adult. The man reported the stray beast when he grew worried about being caught, the paper said.The police returned the camel to its owners and arrested the suspect and his girlfriend on charges of theft and making a false statement, the National said.The days are long gone when camels were an essential part of life in Dubai, now a futuristic skyscraper-studded city on the Persian Gulf. But some continue to raise camels for food and milk. Camel racing remains a cherished pastime in the federation of seven desert sheikhdoms and the occasional camel beauty pageant even draws traders willing to pay millions of dollars for the most prized breeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emirati-man-arrested-for-stealing-camel-to-gift-girlfriend-on-birthday-101613581141108.html
17-02-2021||World||Biden's $15 wage proposal: Job killer or a boon for workers?||President Joe Biden's effort to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour could provide a welcome opportunity for someone like Cristian Cardona, a 21-year-old fast food worker. Cardona would love to earn enough to afford to move out of his parents' house in Orlando, Florida, and maybe scrape together money for college.More than 1,000 miles away in Detroit, Nya Marshall worries that a $15 minimum wage would drive up her labor costs and perhaps force her to close her 2-year-old restaurant, already under strain from the viral pandemic.Between Cardona's hope and Marshall's fear lies a roiling public debate, one with enormous consequences for American workers and businesses. Will the Biden administration succeed in enacting a much higher federal minimum wage — and should it? Economists have argued the merits of minimum wage hikes for years.“The mother of all economic debates" is how economists Michael Feroli and Daniel Silver of JPMorgan Chase describe it.The administration has cast its campaign to raise the minimum as a way to lift up millions of the working poor, reduce America's vast financial inequality and help boost the economy.“No American should work full time and live in poverty,” said Rosemary Boeglin, a White House spokeswoman. “Research has shown that raising the minimum wage reduces poverty and has positive economic benefits for workers, their families, their communities, and local businesses where they spend those additional dollars."Yet just this month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that while raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 would increase pay for 17 million people and pull 900,000 out of poverty, it would also end 1.4 million jobs. The reasoning is that employers would cut jobs to make up for their higher labor costs.The fate of Biden’s minimum wage proposal remains hazy. Facing resistance in Congress, the president has acknowledged that he will likely have to omit the measure from the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 financial relief package he is proposing and re-introduce it later as a separate bill.For years, there was almost no debate at all about a minimum wage. Classical economists had standard advice on imposing or raising minimum wages: Don’t. Piling higher labor costs on employers, the thinking went, would force them to cut jobs and end up hurting the very low-wage workers the minimum wage was intended to help.But groundbreaking research in the 1990s suggested that the Econ 101 version was simplistic at best. Now there is growing confidence among economists — though far from a consensus — that lawmakers can mandate sharp increases in the minimum wage without killing large numbers of jobs.Assessing Biden’s $15 plan, for instance, economists at Morgan Stanley have concluded that “the impact to employment, positive or negative, would be minimal, while the social benefits to lifting real wages of lower-income earners and millions out of poverty are substantial.’’Raising the minimum wage, they said, would also help narrow the chronic economic gap between white Americans on the one hand and Black and Hispanic Americans on the other.The federal government introduced a minimum wage to a Depression-scarred country in 1938. Though Congress has raised the minimum over time, it hasn't done so for more than 11 years — the longest gap between increases. Twenty-nine states and Washington, DC, have already adopted minimum wages above the federal $7.25.The United States lags behind other developed countries in the size of its minimum wage. In 2018, the US minimum amounted to 33% of the nation’s median earnings — dead-last among 31 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By contrast, Canada's minimum wage came to 51% of median income, France's 62%Biden’s plan would shake things up entirely. He proposes gradually raising the wage to $15 an hour by 2025, starting with a jump to $9.50 this year. Thereafter, it would be indexed to grow at the same rate as the US median wage — the point at which half earn more and half earn less.Advocates say that raising wages at the bottom of the pay scale would help relieve income inequality, including racial disparities in earnings. The liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates that 31% of African Americans and 26% of Latinos would receive a raise if the federal minimum wage were elevated to $15 an hour.Two economists at the University of California Berkeley, Ellora Derenoncourt and Claire Montialoux, reported last year that the expansion of the minimum wage in the 1960s and 1970s “played a critical role’’ in temporarily narrowing the income gap between white and Black workers. They concluded that “minimum wage policy can play a critical role in reducing racial economic disparities.’’Expert thinking on the minimum wage began to change with the publication in 1993 of a paper by economists David Card and Alan Krueger, then both at Princeton University. Before then, economists had worried that their theoretical models did not account for the complexity of the job market.So when New Jersey raised its minimum wage in 1992 — and neighboring Pennsylvania did not — Card and Krueger saw a real-world experiment in the making. Would New Jersey lose low wage jobs, as classical economics had taught?The two economists surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in both states. Their surprising discovery: The restaurants in New Jersey, despite the burden of a higher minimum wage, actually added more jobs than those in Pennsylvania did.“What they found was very shocking: Wages rose quite a bit, but there was no evidence of reduced employment,” said Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a leading minimum wage researcher. “This sent shockwaves through the discipline.’’Dube, who himself worked a minimum wage job at McDonald’s as a teenager in Seattle, cites two reasons why he thinks higher minimum wages don’t generally kill jobs. First, many companies can raise prices to pass along their higher labor costs.“A burger may cost 50 cents more,” Dube said. “What that means is that middle- and higher-income consumers are, in fact, subsidizing low-wage workers. That’s a feature, not a bug.’’Second, he said, the higher a wage, the less likely it is that employees will quit. So a higher federal minimum could reduce high turnover at, say, fast-food outlets and make them more productive. Employers wouldn’t have to constantly scramble to find and train new employees — a task that consumes time, money and resources.Speaking with analysts last month, in fact, McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said the fast-food giant would “do just fine’’ as long as the wage increase applied to everybody.Yet by more than doubling the federal minimum wage over a few years, Biden’s plan would enter uncharted territory. Feroli and Silver of JPMorgan note that most minimum wage increases amount to 5% to 15%. A doubling of the minimum, as Biden proposes, could potentially exert a more harmful effect on jobs than research has suggested.Dube concedes that Biden runs the risk of raising the minimum wage too high, too fast. Yet he argues that the gradual phase-in would allow policymakers to monitor how the job market is reacting — and to delay further scheduled wage increases if employers responded to their higher costs by cutting jobs.At a town hall Tuesday night in Milwaukee, Biden seemed to signal a willingness to settle for a more modest increase in the federal minimum wage.“I do support a $15 minimum wage,” the president said, while adding, “but that’s a debatable issue.”He suggested that an increase to $12 or $13 an hour by 2025, rather than to $15, would mean “the impact on business would be absolutely diminished.'' And he agreed that “it’s not illegitimate” for small businesses to fear a sharply higher wage.Indeed, critics argue that now isn't the time for a hefty wage increase. Many of the businesses most likely to pay the minimum — restaurants, hotels, movie theaters — have been hardest hit by the pandemic and the lockdowns and other steps meant to contain it.Consider Marshall's Detroit restaurant, Ivy Kitchen + Cocktails, already devastated by the coronavirus. Revenue is down 85%. She fears that higher labor costs could deliver the final blow.“We’re not making money; 2020 was a complete loss,” Marshall said. “To impose such a wage increase on us right now would not be a good idea, and a lot of us would just shut down .. Our doors are barely open.’’Then again, the pandemic has also exposed how difficult life is at the bottom of the income ladder. In Orlando, Cardona makes $11 an hour as a manager at a McDonald’s. Unable to afford a place of his own, he lives with his parents, chipping in for groceries and help on the electric bill. His plans to save for college are on hold — indefinitely.A bump up to $15 an hour “would definitely be a very nice boost; $11 is still not a living wage,’’ Cardona said. “A lot of people who make this wage, they live paycheck to paycheck.’’Many of his co-workers, he notes, aren’t teenagers making a few bucks after school. They’re single mothers or elderly adults, struggling to pay rent, afford utility bills, buy groceries.As for Biden’s minimum wage proposal, it is up against the Senate’s “budget reconciliation” rules, which will likely govern the president's rescue aid package. The reconciliation rules allow legislation to pass with a simple majority vote, not a filibuster-proof majority of 60 senators. But they are supposed to be limited to budgetary matters and likely don’t apply to a minimum wage increase.Should the federal government remain at an impasse, states and localities, which can go beyond the federal minimum, won't necessarily wait around. Twenty-one states increased their minimum wages last year, Morgan Stanley notes.Cities are getting into the act, too. In a study out this month, Dube and Attila Lindner of University College London found that 42 cities have set minimum wages above the federal mandate. And 22 of them, including Seattle, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, are already at $15 or more — up from just three in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-15-wage-proposal-job-killer-or-a-boon-for-workers-101613580599994.html
17-02-2021||World||Taliban tweet threatens Malala Yousafzai; Twitter removes account||A Pakistani Taliban militant who nine years ago is alleged to have shot and badly wounded Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai has threatened a second attempt on her life, tweeting that next time, “there would be no mistake.” Twitter on Wednesday permanently suspend the account with the menacing post.The threat prompted Yousafzai to tweet herself, asking both the Pakistan military and Prime Minister Imran Khan to explain how her alleged shooter, Ehsanullah Ehsan, had escaped from government custody.Ehsan was arrested in 2017, but escaped in January 2020 from a so-called safe house where he was being held by Pakistan’s intelligence agency. The circumstances of both his arrest and escape have been shrouded in mystery and controversy.Since his escape, Ehsan has been interviewed and has communicated with Pakistani journalists via the same Twitter account that carried the Urdu-language threat. He has had more than one Twitter account, all of which have been suspended.The government is investigating the threat and had immediately asked Twitter to shut down the account, said Raoof Hasan, an adviser to the prime minister.Ehsan, a longtime member of the Pakistani Taliban or Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan as they are known, urged Yousafzai to “come back home because we have a score to settle with you and your father." The tweet added that “this time there will be no mistake."Yousafzai, who has setup a fund that promotes education for girls worldwide and even financed a girls' school in her home in the Swat Valley, called out the government and the military over Ehsan's tweet.“This is the ex-spokesperson of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan who claims the attack on me and many innocent people. He is now threatening people on social media," she tweeted. “How did he escape?”Associated Press queries to the military were unanswered.The charges against Ehsan include a horrific 2014 attack on a Pakistani army's public school that killed 134 — mostly children, some as young as five years old.He also claimed responsibility for the 2012 shooting of Yousafzai in Swat Valley. In the attack, the gunman walked up to Yousafzai on a school bus in which she was travelling, asked for her by name and then fired three bullets. She was just 15 years old at the time and had enraged the Taliban with her campaign for girls education.Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, a teacher, ran a school in Swat Valley for boys and girls. In 2007 when the Pakistani Taliban took control of the area, they forced girls out of schools and ruled with a brutal hand until 2009, when they were driven out by the Pakistani military.During his years in military custody, Ehsan was never charged. Authorities also later never explained how he left the country and traveled to Turkey, where he is believed to be living today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-tweet-threatens-malala-yousafzai-twitter-removes-account-101613579055496.html

17-02-2021||World||Texas blackouts fuel false claims about renewable energy||With millions of Texas residents still without power amid frigid temperatures, conservative commentators presented a false narrative that wind turbines and solar energy were primarily to blame.“We should never build another wind turbine in Texas,” read a Tuesday Facebook post from Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. “The experiment failed big time.”“This is a perfect example of the need for reliable energy sources like natural gas & coal,” tweeted US Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, on Tuesday.In reality, failures in natural gas, coal and nuclear energy systems were responsible for nearly twice as many outages as frozen wind turbines and solar panels, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state’s power grid, said in a press conference Tuesday.Still a variety of misleading claims spread on social media around renewable energy, with wind turbines and the Green New Deal getting much of the attention.A viral photo of a helicopter de-icing a wind turbine was shared with claims it showed a “chemical” solution being applied to one of the massive wind generators in Texas. The only problem? The photo was taken in Sweden years ago, not in the US in 2021. The helicopter sprayed hot water onto the wind turbine, not chemicals.Other social media users, including Republican US Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, puzzlingly labeled the Green New Deal as the culprit. Boebert tweeted on Monday that the proposal was “proven unsustainable as renewables are clearly unreliable.”But the Green New Deal is irrelevant, as no version of it exists in Texas or nationwide, said Mark Jacobson, director of the Atmosphere/Energy Program and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.“It’s really natural gas and coal and nuclear that are providing the bulk of the electricity and that’s the bulk of the cause of the blackouts,” Jacobson told The Associated Press.ERCOT said Tuesday that of the 45,000 total megawatts of power that were offline statewide, about 30,000 consisted of thermal sources — gas, coal and nuclear plants — and 16,000 came from renewable sources.On top of that, while Texas has ramped up wind energy in recent years, the state still relies on wind power for only about 25% of its total electricity, according to ERCOT data.“It’s not like we were relying on it to ride us through this event,” Joshua Rhodes, a research associate at the Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin, told the AP. “Nor would it have been able to save us even if it were operating at 100% capacity right now. We just don’t have enough of it.”The agency confirmed that wellhead freeze-offs and other issues curtailing supply in natural gas systems were primarily to blame for new outages on Tuesday, after severe winter weather caused failures across multiple fuel types in recent days.Renewable energy is a popular scapegoat for new problems as more frequent extreme weather events strain infrastructure, according to Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.“It’s easy to focus on the thing that you can see changing as the source of why an outcome is changing,” Grubert told the AP. “The reality is that managing our systems is becoming more difficult. And that’s something that is easy to blame on the reaction to it, but it’s not actually the root cause.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-blackouts-fuel-false-claims-about-renewable-energy-101613572215071.html
17-02-2021||World||Uber hires prominent critic to focus on treatment of drivers||Alex Rosenblat, an author and labor researcher, wrote for years about how Uber Technologies Inc. obscures pay structures, surveils drivers and creates systems that facilitate discrimination against those workers. Now she works for Uber.The ride-hailing company hired Rosenblat last month as head of marketplace policy, fairness and research. Her appointment, which hasn’t been previously reported, is part of an effort to reform Uber’s treatment of, and relationship with, its drivers.Rosenblat is best known for her 2018 book, “Uberland: How Algorithms Are Rewriting the Rules of Work,” for which she interviewed hundreds of drivers about their working conditions. The book highlights driver stories of pay disparities, pervasive surveillance and the lopsided power dynamics in algorithm-mediated work.As an Uber employee, Rosenblat said her responsibility is to “get the company to take into consideration the experiences and point of view of drivers, especially at the product level” and that her work will be informed by past research.In an emailed statement, Uber said it hired Rosenblat because the company wants “people at Uber who care about driver issues and who aren’t afraid to challenge our thinking on any given issue.”Before joining Uber, Rosenblat was a senior researcher at Data and Society, a nonprofit institute that seeks to “challenge the power and purpose of technology in society.” Founded in 2014, the organization publishes research on artificial intelligence, the impact of technology on labor and health and online disinformation. The MacArthur Foundation and a philanthropic organization overseen by EBay co-founder Pierre Omidyar are among the 20 financial supporters named on the group’s most recent annual report.Uber has long had an adversarial relationship with many academics, who have criticized the company for restricting data access to select researchers. More than 70 gig economy academics wrote in an open letter after the publication of a 2020 study by Cornell University’s Institute for Workplace Studies commissioned by Uber and Lyft Inc., calling its findings suspect.Alexandrea Ravenelle was among those who signed the letter. In an interview, she expressed admiration for Rosenblat but a continued distrust of the company. Ravenelle, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she’s concerned Uber will ignore Rosenblat’s internal critiques and said the poor state of driver conditions has been public knowledge for years.“When you interview the workers, the situation never seems to be improving for them,” Ravenelle said. “If anyone can help them to make a difference, it will be Alex, but I think she’s got a uphill battle ahead of her.”This isn’t the first time Rosenblat considered trying to change things from the inside. In 2017, after three years of researching the company, Uber attempted to hire her. She pondered the offer but ultimately declined.“This moment says a lot about what happens to experts: Once they know enough to be a threat, the companies they study will try to absorb them,” Rosenblat wrote about the attempted recruitment in “Uberland.”That same year, Rosenblat co-authored a paper describing how Uber’s use of customer reviews to evaluate performance could amount to workplace discrimination due to consumer biases. She is now working to apply these findings to service and policy design, as part of her goal to “encourage the company to assess product impact on drivers as individuals, rather than as part of an abstract group.”Rosenblat recently appeared at a speaker series about the ethics of algorithmic governance and co-authored a post about the disappearance of secure employment during recessions. She said she changed her mind about joining Uber because there are now many others conducting the kind of research she has championed and can carry her mantle.“There are new ways I can use my expertise now, inside the company,” Rosenblat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-hires-prominent-critic-to-focus-on-treatment-of-drivers-101613570402757.html

17-02-2021||World||Putin says Russia's elections need protection from 'external interference'||Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia needed to ensure that its parliamentary vote scheduled for September is free of foreign meddling following mass protests calling for the release of one of his fiercest critics.Tens of thousands of people took to the streets last month to urge Russia to free Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny ahead of the September election. The 44-year-old opposition politician was detained and later jailed for alleged parole violations upon his return to Russia. He had been treated in Germany for a nerve agent poisoning he sustained in Siberia last August.The Kremlin has suggested that Navalny is a CIA asset who is being used by Western intelligence services to destabilise Russia, and Moscow has repeatedly told the European Union to keep out of its domestic affairs.Russia has itself been accused of meddling in several elections abroad, including in the 2016 US presidential vote."The citizens of Russia will make their choice (at the parliamentary elections), and we must defend this choice from any attempts of external interference," Putin said at a televised meeting with the leaders of the political parties represented in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament."We cannot allow any blows against Russia's sovereignty, against the right of our people to be the master on their our land," he said, without detailing which countries he was referring to.Navalny said last year he thought Russia's intelligence services had poisoned him with a nerve agent because authorities saw him as a threat ahead of the parliamentary elections.The Kremlin has rejected any suggestion that Putin or authorities had anything to do with Navalny's poisoning.Some European countries have called for sanctions against Moscow over the Navalny case, including halting the construction of the undersea Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, designed to export gas from Russia to Germany by bypassing Ukraine.Putin accused the countries that have called for sanctions against the project of trying to use Nord Stream 2 as a tool to punish Russia."Why is everyone circling around Nord Steam 2?" Putin said."They (Western countries) want to force Russia to pay for their geopolitical project in Ukraine," he added, referring to the conflict that erupted in the country's east after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-russia-s-elections-need-protection-from-external-interference-101613568879226.html
17-02-2021||World||UK’s Boris Johnson hints hospitality faces long wait to reopen||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested pubs and restaurants will be among the last venues to reopen as the government lifts pandemic restrictions.Johnson is preparing to publish on Monday a “road map” to ending the national lockdown that has been in place since early January, shuttering non-essential shops and closing restaurants except for take-away service.The curbs on socializing and commercial activity will be eased “in stages” and in a “cautious” way over the months ahead, Johnson said on Wednesday.“You perhaps remember from last year that we opened up hospitality fully as one of the last things that we did” after the first lockdown, the prime minister told broadcasters during a trip to Wales. There’s “obviously an extra risk of transmission” of coronavirus when people gather to drink alcohol and eat meals in pubs and restaurants, he said.The government has prioritized reopening schools when restrictions start to ease, and the premier is aiming to allow face-to-face teaching to begin again from March 8. No decision has been announced on whether all schools in England will go back at once, or if there will be a phased return to the classroom for different age groups.Beyond schools, officials are looking at relaxing rules on outdoor socializing and exercise, and then allowing non-essential stores to reopen, followed by hospitality venues. Ministers have said they will base their decisions on the state of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the vaccination program.Members of Johnson’s Conservative Party are pushing him to reopen the economy faster, fearing the damage to jobs and businesses. Against that, the premier is seeking to balance the need to keep control over a pandemic he has been criticized for mishandling. He has said he wants the current third national lockdown to be the last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-boris-johnson-hints-hospitality-faces-long-wait-to-reopen-101613566307942.html
17-02-2021||World||Lanka cancels Imran Khan address to Parliament, didn’t want him raising Kashmir||Sri Lanka has cancelled a planned address to its Parliament by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan next week, apparently because of concerns that he could rake up the Kashmir issue.Officials cited Covid-19-related restrictions as the reason for the move, though people familiar with developments in Colombo said on condition of anonymity that the Sri Lankan government had done a re-think following discussions on the implications of Khan raising the Kashmir issue in his speech.Sri Lanka’s Speaker Mahinda Abeywardena had told leaders of political parties during a meeting last week that Khan would address the Parliament during his two-day visit beginning on February 22. The address was scheduled for February 24, and Khan is scheduled to meet President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and foreign minister Dinesh Gunawardena during the visit.“The planned address to Parliament doesn’t appear to have been well thought through. There were considerable discussions within the government at which the possibility of Prime Minister Khan referring to the Kashmir issue came up,” said one of the people cited above.Realising the ramifications of such a development, the Sri Lankan side considered it more prudent to call off the address to Parliament, the people said.It is the Pakistan government’s stated policy to raise the Kashmir issue at international forums, especially since the Indian government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019. Pakistan even raised the Kashmir issue during a virtual meeting of SAARC leaders convened by India last year to discuss ways to counter the Covid-19 pandemic.The sergeant-at-arms of Sri Lanka Parliament, Narendra Fernando, was quoted by the Colombo Gazette as saying that foreign minister Gunawardena had informed officials that Khan’s proposed visit to the Parliament complex “will not take place”. Fernando also said Gunawardena had informed Parliament that Khan’s visit would go ahead as scheduled.Reports in the Sri Lankan media also quoted foreign secretary Jayanath Colombage as saying that the Speaker had informed the government that he would be unable to ensure full attendance in Parliament because of the pandemic.The Pakistan government had made a request for Khan to address the Parliament. The last foreign leader to address Sri Lanka’s Parliament was Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015.Khan will be the first head of state to visit Sri Lanka since the Covid-19 outbreak last year. His visit is being seen in Sri Lanka as crucial to gain the support of Pakistan and other Muslim countries ahead of a hearing on the island country’s human rights record, especially during the war with the LTTE, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on February 24.Last week, Khan had welcomed Sri Lanka’s assurance regarding allowing the burial of Muslim coronavirus victims instead of the forcible cremation of their bodies.The visit also comes at a time when ties between India and Sri Lanka have been affected by Colombo’s unilateral decision to develop the East Container Terminalat Colombo port through a state-run body instead of under a trilateral agreement signed with India and Japan.Both India and Japan have protested against the decision. Reports have suggested Sri Lanka has instead offered to allow India and Japan to develop the West Container Terminal at Colombo port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/week-ahead-of-visit-sri-lanka-cancels-imran-khan-s-address-to-its-parliament-101613567465979.html

The local Babur school, closed for a long period of time due to security reasons, has now reopened to students.The Taliban controls around three-thirds of Afghan territory, including all districts around the capital.Despite the claims of general support in the controlled lands, the Taliban continue to oppose all attempts at holding democratic elections in the country. The peace efforts also appeared to be undermined by the Joe Biden administration's ongoing revision of the Taliban-US deal, signed by Donald Trump administration in February 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-security-forces-kill-11-taliban-terrorists-in-kandahar-101613562176765.html
17-02-2021||World||NATO chief urges joint spending as budget debate rolls on||Donald Trump is no longer around as president to berate US allies in Europe and Canada for failing to spend enough on their defense budgets. But the debate about military spending appears likely to continue to rage at NATO, even under President Joe Biden.So, in an effort to improve “burden sharing” — the way the 30 member countries contribute cash, military hardwar eand troops to operations run by the world’s biggest security organization — Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is proposing that allies jointly fund more of NATO’s work.Stoltenberg said he will urge defense ministers, at a two-day videoconference starting Wednesday, “to increase NATO’s funding for our core deterrence and defense activities.” It’s new US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s first NATO meeting.The plan would mean jointly funding battlegroups of troops on standby in member countries bordering Russia, aerial policing operations, the deployment of warships on permanent maritime duties or military exercises. It would not be used for active military operations outside NATO territory.At the moment, Stoltenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting, “the country that provides the capabilities also provides the funding. So, if you send some troops to the NATO battlegroup in Lithuania, as Norway does, then Norway pays for that. I think that we should change that.”The former Norwegian prime minister believes that by spending more together, members would also be demonstrating their commitment to defend each other if one comes under attack, which is the common defense clause enshrined in Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty.Early in his presidency, standing outside NATO headquarters near a monument to the 9/11 attacks when the allies rallied to the defense of the United States, Trump suggested that the US might not come to the rescue of partners who fail to spend 2% of GDP on defense. That threat damaged trust at NATO.“Spending more together would demonstrate the strength of our commitment to Article 5, our promise to defend each other. And it would contribute to fairer burden-sharing,” said Stoltenberg.Still, his plan has surprised a few members of the 30-nation alliance.Some NATO diplomats have given it a cautious welcome. Questions remain over where the money would come from. NATO has a relatively small in-house budget of around $2 billion, but most of this is taken up with administrative and infrastructure costs, like running the Brussels headquarters.NATO already has a number of trust funds and few countries want to create more. Justifying greater military spending when budgets have already been ravaged by restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus is also hard to sell to weary publics.There is also concern that certain countries might see it as a bailout when they should just be spending more, or that NATO’s ability to act might be slowed by more arguments over money. Some think it’s an ill-conceived plan, proposed without proper consultation and meant to mollify the United States.The funding would favor countries that do more within NATO, and the US leads a battlegroup in Poland so its costs would be covered under such a budget.NATO members began to cut defense spending after the Cold War but were spurred back into action after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Since then, European allies and Canada have together spent an extra $190 billion on their national military budgets, according to Stoltenberg.Nine of the 30 countries are likely to spend the guideline figure of 2% of GDP this year — the US, Greece, Britain, Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania — up from three in 2014. US spending has in fact declined since 2014, but the country still spends more than all its allies combined.Even with this increased spending and the departure of Trump, America’s partners at NATO expect Biden to be just as demanding about military spending. The tone may have changed, but not the substance of a complaint that has been made by US presidents for well over a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-urges-joint-spending-as-budget-debate-rolls-on-101613563296940.html
17-02-2021||World||Impeachment over, Congress shifts focus to security failures||In the still shaken and heavily guarded US Capitol, thousands of National Guard troops still wander the halls. Glass windows remain broken. Doors swing without handles. And in the grand marble hallways, which amplified the shouts of insurrectionists just over a month ago, there is an uncomfortable silence.The end of Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial is only the beginning of Congress' reckoning with the Jan. 6 attack, a violent ransacking of the Capitol that resulted in five deaths. While the Senate has spoken on Trump's role in the violence, acquitting him of insurrection after a wrenching five days of impeachment testimony, lawmakers who fled the violent mob are still demanding answers. How, they ask, could security could have failed so catastrophically? And how can they ensure it doesn't happen again?“This is not a moment where we pivot and move on,” Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said Saturday, just after the acquittal vote in the impeachment trial. “You cannot view today as the last page of the book. What we were talking about today was the accountability for the leader of the mob. But we still have to protect against future mobs, we still have to go after members of the mob.”The coming weeks — and likely the coming months and years — will force lawmakers to work through the many unanswered questions about the attack. It's a complex task that will test whether lawmakers can set aside partisanship, which flared anew during the impeachment process, and turn the harrowing violence that threatened their lives into a restorative moment for their institution.Since Saturday’s vote, Democratic leaders have said they will take steps to form an independent investigative commission modeled after one that studied security failures before the Sept. 11 attacks. Two Senate committees have summoned top security officials to testify, the beginning of a comprehensive look at what went wrong. Separately, retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré is leading an ongoing review of the Capitol’s security process, commissioned by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And several other panels are looking into different aspects of the insurrection, including intelligence lapses and whether it was coordinated.“Security is the order of the day,” Pelosi said in a letter to her House colleagues on Monday. “The security of our country, the security of our Capitol which is the temple of our democracy, and the security of our members.”Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump, said Sunday that there should be a “complete investigation” into what happened. “What was known, who knew it and when they knew, all that, because that builds the basis so this never happens again,” he said.Legislation to set up the commission could be introduced in the House as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with the process and granted anonymity to discuss the planning. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to support the commission, and a spokesman said Tuesday that he “looks forward to it being approved by both chambers with overwhelming bipartisan support.”At the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden supports it as well. Biden “backs efforts to shed additional light on the facts to ensure something like that never happens again,” she said.In her letter to Democratic colleagues, Pelosi said the House will also put forth supplemental spending to boost security at the Capitol.The first congressional hearings will come next week, with two Senate panels calling in the former chief of Capitol Police and the former heads of security for the House and Senate, all three of whom resigned immediately after the attack.The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Rules Committee announced Tuesday that they had invited former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, former Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving to the hearing, along with Robert Contee, the chief of the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department. The hearing will begin a broad examination of the security failures that led to the breach.In addition to the Feb. 23 hearing, the two committees are pressing for information from almost two dozen agencies and departments about the response.The security breakdown on Jan. 6, as the House and Senate met for a joint session to count electoral votes, was severe. The Capitol Police had planned for a free speech demonstration, not a violent insurrection by Trump supporters to overturn the election. With the diminished security presence, the rioters not only breached the Capitol but entered the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled. The rioters also tried to break through the doors of the House chamber with lawmakers still inside. Outside, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat with an outnumbered, ill-prepared Capitol Police force, which was eventually assisted by D.C. police.The acting chief of the Capitol Police, Yogananda Pittman, has acknowledged the department knew before Jan. 6 that extremists and white supremacists could be in the crowd outside the Capitol. But she and other leaders are still pointing fingers about who was responsible for not bolstering security.The hearings and investigations — which will be conducted in both the House and Senate by several committees — are expected to help inform decisions about the wide perimeter around the building that has been in place since Jan. 6. The show of force has also angered D.C. residents who have to navigate blocked-off roads, and it has frustrated some lawmakers in both parties who believe the building should be open to the public.Outside of Congress, federal law enforcement has arrested more than 200 people who broke into the Capitol, and others have suggested that Trump himself could be criminally liable for his efforts to persuade officials to change election results and encourage his supporters to overturn his defeat.In a blistering speech that came immediately after his vote to acquit Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pinned responsibility for the riots on Trump and said he didn’t “yet” get away with anything. “We have a criminal justice system in this country, we have civil litigation,” McConnell said.Still, inside the building, people are still dealing with the aftermath.Maine Sen. Angus King, an Independent who voted to convict the Republican former president, said he’s most worried about presidents who come after Trump, and what lessons they will take from the Senate’s decision to acquit. "I do feel sad,” he said. “This gave us an opportunity for closure which we missed.”Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski reflected on the sights and sounds she heard on Jan. 6 as she walked out of the chamber after the vote. Like Cassidy, she was one of the seven Republicans who voted to convict.“It hits me,” Murkowski said in an interview with Politico, remembering the trash that scattered the same floors she was walking on as she spoke. “I hear the sound of the of the Capitol Police officer who was retching in the bathroom because he had just gotten sprayed with pepper spray and was trying to wash it out. … We’re all witnesses to this. And you have to bear witness to it, I guess.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-over-congress-shifts-focus-to-security-failures-101613562371045.html
17-02-2021||World||Italy's Draghi urges unity, sacrifice in fighting the virus||Italian Premier Mario Draghi urged Italy’s polarized politicians to unite behind his new government to confront the coronavirus pandemic and the economic devastation it has wrought, saying Italy has a once-in-a-lifetime chance to create a more sustainable, equitable and healthy world for future generations.Draghi vowed an environmentally conscious and digitally reformed government program in a 50-minute speech Wednesday before the Senate, which came ahead of a mandatory confidence vote later in the day. Draghi is expected to win votes in both the Senate and lower Chamber of Deputies after securing broad-based support for his government.“Today unity isn’t a emotion, it’s a duty,“ Draghi said to applause as he concluded his speech. “A duty guided by what unites us all: love of Italy.”Draghi, the former European central bank chief who is widely credited with having saved the euro, vowed a similar all-out effort to do whatever it takes to emerge from the pandemic, which first erupted in Italy this time last year. He said the principle aim of his administration was to confront the pandemic and safeguard Italians “with all means," and urged politicians to put aside their political interests in a spirit of sacrifice for future generations.Draghi’s government was sworn in over the weekend, capping a remarkable few weeks that saw the widely popular Premier Giuseppe Conte resign after a key ally yanked his support. After efforts to forge a third Conte government failed, President Sergio Mattarella asked Draghi, 73, to form a high-profile, non-political government.Draghi’s 23-member cabinet includes politicians in most ministries but puts technical experts in key roles, especially those responsible for ensuring that the more than 200 billion euros ($240 billion) in European Union pandemic recovery funds that Italy expects to receive are spent according to EU criteria, such as for ecological and digital transformations.Draghi said his government would be “convincingly” pro-EU and pro-U.S., saying he envisaged in particular reinforcing bilateral relations with France and Germany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italys-draghi-urges-unity-sacrifice-in-fighting-the-virus-101613561755967.html
17-02-2021||World||After delay, Israel allows vaccines into Hamas-run Gaza||The Palestinian Authority sent the first shipment of coronavirus vaccines to the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip on Wednesday, two days after accusing Israel of preventing it from dispatching the doses amid objections from some Israeli lawmakers.Palestinian Health Minister Mai Alkaila said in a statement that the PA sent 2,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, which would go to front-line medical workers. An Associated Press photographer in Gaza saw the shipment arrive midday at the Kerem Shalom crossing.An Israeli defense official had earlier said that authorities approved the delivery, adding that it's “not in Israel's interest to have a Gaza health crisis.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.Israeli lawmakers had debated whether to allow the delivery of vaccines into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas, an Islamic militant group, seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank and coordinates with Israel on security and other matters.Some lawmakers have said the delivery should be linked to progress on the release of two Israeli captives held by Hamas and the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in a 2014 war. They have also expressed concern that the first batch of vaccines will go to Hamas members rather than medics.Gaza is home to more than 2 million Palestinians, many of whom live in close confines, and has yet to receive any vaccines. Authorities there have reported more than 53,000 cases and at least 538 deaths since the start of the pandemic.Israel has launched one of the world’s most successful vaccination programs, inoculating more than a third of its population of 9.3 million since December.Rights groups say it has an obligation as an occupying power to share its vaccines with the Palestinians. Israel denies having such an obligation and says its priority is its own citizens. The Palestinian Authority has not publicly requested vaccines from Israel and says it has secured its own supply through the World Health Organization and agreements with drug makers.Still, Israel provided 2,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine to the PA earlier this month, allowing it to begin vaccinating medical workers, and the PA says it independently acquired another 10,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. It would need Israel’s permission to transfer them to Gaza.Hamas is believed to be holding two captives, an Israeli of Ethiopian descent who entered Gaza shortly after the 2014 war and an Arab Bedouin citizen of Israel. In exchange, Hamas is likely to demand the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including individuals implicated in deadly attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-delay-israel-allows-vaccines-into-hamas-run-gaza-101613561205405.html
17-02-2021||World||Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested again while in jail: Report||Jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been arrested again, on suspicion of assisting one of 12 fugitives China captured at sea last year, his Apple Daily tabloid and Oriental Daily said on Wednesday, without citing a source.Lai, detained while awaiting a bail hearing on Thursday, has been charged with colluding with foreign forces under a sweeping national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong last year.The fugitives could face potential charges in Hong Kong over mass anti-government protests in 2019, with Andy Li, whom the papers identified as the person Lai was suspected of helping, being investigated for suspected national security crimes.Neither newspaper gave further details. It was unclear if the national security legislation extends to the assistance Lai is suspected to have given Li.Police did not immediately respond to a request to comment.The Chinese coast guard captured the 12 fugitives in August as they tried to flee Hong Kong in a boat believed to be bound for Taiwan. All were held virtually incommunicado in a mainland China prison until a trial late in December.Ten were jailed for terms ranging from seven months to three years for illegally crossing the border or organising the crossing, while two minors were sent back to Hong Kong.Lai was already the most high-profile person to be charged under the new security law, for statements made on July 30 and Aug. 18, in which prosecutors say he requested foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.He was arrested in an August raid by about 200 police officers on the newsroom of his Apple Daily, known for its feisty and critical coverage of China and Hong Kong.Beijing imposed the new law on the former British colony last June, after months of pro-democracy protests, to target anything China that considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.Punishment under the law can range up to life in prison.Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent and erodes freedoms in the semi-autonomous financial hub. Supporters say it restores stability after months of unrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-again-while-in-jail-report-101613560749324.html
17-02-2021||World||West Africa guards against Ebola as cases rise in Guinea||Guinea’s West African neighbors are taking measures to prevent the Ebola hemorrhagic fever from entering their countries, as cases rise in the world’s top bauxite exporter.Five people have died from the highly contagious disease, its National Health Security Agency said in an emailed statement Tuesday. Three people have tested positive and ten other suspected cases are awaiting laboratory results, it said.Authorities are also monitoring 125 people who were in contact with cases. Most of them are in the southeastern Nzerekore region, where an outbreak has been declared, and the remaining ten are in the capital, Conakry, it said.No cases or contacts have been reported beyond Guinea so far, Georges Ki-Zerbo, who heads the World Health Organization’s (WH country office, said by phone from the capital Tuesday. The WHO, which expects more cases to be confirmed locally in the coming days, has warned neighbors to “act immediately” to prevent a spread, Ki-Zerbo said.Guinea was at the epicenter of the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, which spread mainly to Liberia and Sierra Leone, infecting more than 45,000 people in West Africa, and killing more than 11,000. The latest outbreak couldn’t have come at a worst time as countries grapple with the health and economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.The worst-affected countries are still reeling from the last Ebola outbreak, Gyude Moore, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington D.C. and former Liberian cabinet minister, said in an emailed response to questions. The resurgence is “happening at a time when governments have less resources, slowing economies and a global system that is preoccupied with a pandemic,” he said.Guinea was the first sub-Saharan African country to administer Covid vaccines but has only vaccinated 55 people. It’s now working to secure Ebola vaccines, approved for use in 2019, within the next three days, authorities said, fueling hope that the new outbreak will be contained.Ivory Coast, which shares a western border with the affected Guinean region, has taken “heightened” protective measures, it said in a statement Monday. It has also reactivated its Ebola surveillance centers and tightened checks at land, sea and air borders.“The government insists on personal and collective responsibility in the fight against the two diseases,” Ivorian Health Minister Aka Ouele said in the statement.Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who led the country during the last epidemic, echoed the sentiment in a tweet Monday, after the incumbent, George Weah, ordered health authorities to increase surveillance.Authorities in Sierra Leone and Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country that quashed the 2014 outbreak before it could take root, are also tightening checks, according to government statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-africa-guards-against-ebola-as-cases-rise-in-guinea-101613559972247.html
17-02-2021||World||Gunmen kidnap 'hundreds' of schoolboys in Nigeria: Report||Gunmen believed to belong to a criminal gang have kidnapped hundreds of schoolboys from their hostels along with some of teachers in central Nigeria, an official and a security source told AFP Wednesday.The attackers wearing military uniforms stormed the Government Science College in "huge numbers" in the town of Kagara in Niger state late on Tuesday, herding the students into a nearby forest, the sources said.One student was dead during the kidnapping, the official said.Northwest and central Nigeria have increasingly been targeted by criminal gangs known locally as "bandits" who kidnap for ransom, rape and pillage across the region."Bandits went into GSC Kagara last night and kidnapped hundreds of students and their teachers," said an official who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue."One of the kidnapped staff and some students managed to escape. The staff confirmed a student was shot dead during the kidnap operation," the official said.The school has around 1,000 students and it was not immediately clear how many were taken.The security source confirmed the details of the attack and said a headcount was under way.Troops with aerial support were tracking the bandits for possible rescue, the security source said.The Niger kidnapping came two months after hundreds of schoolboys were abducted in northwestern Katsina state then released days later following negotiations with the government.The gangs who are driven by financial motives have no ideological leanings but security officials fear they are being infiltrated by jihadists from Nigeria's northeast where the army is battling a decade-long Islamist insurgency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-kidnap-hundreds-of-schoolboys-in-nigeria-report-101613558813747.html

Her next hearing is set for March 1."We love democracy and hate the junta," Sithu Maung, an elected member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) told tens of thousands of people at the Sule Pagoda, a central protest site in the main city of Yangon."We must be the last generation to experience a coup."Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the ruling council, told the Tuesday news conference that 40 million of the 53 million population supported the military's action.Sithu Maung poked fun at that saying: "We're showing here that we're not in that 40 million."Suu Kyi's party swept a November 8 election as widely expected, but the army alleges there was fraud. It said its seizure of power was in line with the constitution and it remained committed to democracy.A protester who gave her name as Khin was scornful."They said there was vote fraud but look at the people here," said Khin.The coup that cut short the Southeast Asian country's unsteady transition towards democracy has prompted daily demonstrations since February 6.The takeover has also drawn strong Western criticism, with renewed anger from Washington and London over the additional charge for Suu Kyi.Although China has taken a softer line, its ambassador in Myanmar on Tuesday dismissed accusations it supported the coup.Despite that, protesters also gathered outside the Chinese embassy.Tens of thousands took to the streets of the city of Mandalay, where some people also blocked its main rail link, and crowds gathered in several other places.Photographs from the small central town of Khin U showed a sea of people in straw hats and coronavirus masks listening to speeches. Thousands marched in the capital, Naypyitaw, and hundreds in the southern town of Mawlamyine, witnesses said. Both places saw clashes last week.There were no reports of serious trouble on Wednesday.Earlier, UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said he feared the possibility of violence against the protesters and made an urgent call on any country with influence over the generals, and businesses, to press them to avoid it.In Yangon and elsewhere, motorists responded to a "broken-down car campaign" spread on social media, stopping their supposedly stalled cars, with bonnets raised, on streets and bridges to block them to police and military trucks.Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners group said more than 450 arrests had been made since the coup. Those arrested include much of the NLD's senior leadership.The suspension of the internet at night has added to a sense of fear.'DISTURBED'Zaw Min Tun told the news conference, the junta's first since the coup, that the military was giving a guarantee that an election would be held and power handed to the winner. He gave no time frame, but said the army would not be in power for long.The last stretch of army rule lasted nearly half a century before democratic reforms began in 2011.Suu Kyi, 75, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest for her efforts to bring democracy.The United States was "disturbed" by reports of the additional criminal charge against Suu Kyi, State Department spokesman Ned Price said. Washington imposed new sanctions last week on the military. No additional measures were announced on Tuesday.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also decried the new criminal charge, saying the military "fabricated" it.The unrest has revived memories of bloody suppression of protests under previous juntas.Police have opened fire several times, mostly with rubber bullets, to disperse protesters. A protester who was shot in the head in Naypyitaw last week is not expected to survive.A policeman died of injuries sustained in a protest in Mandalay on Monday, the military said.As well as the demonstrations in towns across the ethnically diverse country, a civil disobedience movement has brought strikes that are crippling many functions of government.Actor Pyay Ti Oo said opposition could not be quelled."They say we're like a brush fire and will stop after a while but will we? No. Won't stop until we succeed,” he told the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-protesters-mass-again-reject-army-s-claim-it-has-public-support-101613557721406.html
17-02-2021||World||Western allies condemn Iraq rocket attack||France, Germany, Italy, Britain and the United States on Wednesday condemned "in the strongest terms" a rocket attack on an airbase in Iraq's Kurdistan region that killed a foreign contractor.The firing of more than a dozen rockets in the northwest of the Kurdish regional capital Arbil on Monday wounded at least 14 people, as well as fatally injuring a contractor working for the US military."We are united in our view that attacks on US and coalition personnel and facilities will not be tolerated," the foreign ministers of the five Western allies said in a joint statement."Together, our governments will support the government of Iraq's investigation into the attack with a view to holding accountable those responsible."The barrage of 107 mm rockets -- the same calibre used in recent attacks in Baghdad -- was fired late Monday from around eight kilometres (five miles) west of Arbil.They appeared to be aimed at a military complex inside the Arbil airport that hosts foreign troops deployed as part of a US-led coalition that has helped Iraq fight jihadists since 2014.But they struck all over the city's northwest, including in residential districts where they wounded five civilians.One US solider was among those injured at the airport, where at least three of the rockets landed.The nationality of the foreign contractor killed has not been disclosed.It was the first attack in nearly two months targeting Western military or diplomatic installations in Iraq after a series of similar incidents blamed on pro-Iranian Shiite factions.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday he was "outraged" at the attack and pledged American support in holding those responsible to account, while the United Nations warned that tensions in Iraq could now escalate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/western-allies-condemn-iraq-rocket-attack-101613555405254.html

"Currently, that is not our judgement, but clearly we are not planning to wait until it is too late," she added.Sweden, with a population of around 10 million, has registered more than 615,000 Covid-19 cases and over 12,400 deaths, a rate per capita many times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours, but lower than several European countries that opted for lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-government-seeks-wider-powers-to-shut-businesses-if-third-wave-hits-101613555518592.html

The US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment."It was a reciprocal step," RIA state news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying.Russia and the United States have cooperated closely in space exploration for decades, jointly flying the International Space Station, despite deteriorating relations in other areas.Ryabkov said NASA was not responsible for creating obstacles that thwarted interaction with Moscow, but that this was not the case for other US government bodies."Ideally we would eliminate" restrictions on diplomatic visas between the two countries, he said. "We will propose this to the administration in Washington."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-denies-visa-to-us-official-for-nasa-post-calls-it-a-reciprocal-step-101613555730338.html

She was educated at the Dubai English Speaking School, followed by the International School Choueifat and one year at the Latifa School for Girls.She is said to be an excellent and experienced skydiver, trained by former world champion Stefania Martinengo.Latifa had attempted a daring escape from the middle-easterm country on February 24, 2018 when she and her Finnish friend Tiina Jauhiainen left Dubai in a car and crossed into Oman. They took jet-skis from there and met former French intelligence officer Herve Jaubert and his crew on the yacht Nostromo.She alerted British human rights lawyer David Haigh of Detained International of her departure two days later. Jaubert made contact with an Indian journalist on March 3, 2018, in preparation for their arrival, but the yacht was intercepted by Indian authorities as they were approaching Goa.The attempted sea escape and its aftermath threw the carefully controlled family image of Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed into public life.On December 24, 2018, the UAE authorities released three low resolution images of Latifa meeting with former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson. The meeting was scheduled by Princess Haya, one of the UAE Prime Minister's wives, as per Robinson.Robinson described Latifa as a 'troubled young woman' on BBC Radio 4.However, Robinson's comments were criticised by rights groups and Detained in Dubai's head, Radha Stirling, for repeating the Dubai's official version of the story almost word to word. Latifa's representatives also questioned the nature of Robinson's visit and called for an independent investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/princess-under-house-arrest-who-is-uae-s-sheikha-latifa-101613550387278.html

The contract includes a firm order for 200 million shots, with an option to request an additional 100 million, which could double the EU’s overall supply from the companies.As many as 75 million doses from the order will be shipped in the second quarter, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said when the deal was first announced in January.EU countries are far behind the US and UK in the race to vaccinate as many people as possible, even as faster-spreading variants of the virus gain a stronger foothold on the continent.The commission is also seeking to boost its stock of vaccines from Moderna Inc., which, like Pfizer-BioNTech, has a shot based on messenger RNA technology. Unlike more conventional vaccines, the mRNA shots can be modified within weeks if necessary to protect against mutant versions of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-finalizes-deal-with-pfizer-biontech-for-200-million-more-covid-19-vaccines-101613554508480.html

Shanghai Fosun secured rights in March to develop and market the Pfizer Inc./BioNTech vaccine across mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageTaiwan has been one of the standout successes in combating the spread of the coronavirus, registering nine deaths and fewer than 1,000 cases since the beginning of the pandemic. But securing vaccinations for its 23.5 million people has proved to be more challenging. The deal’s collapse is a significant setback for Taiwan’s inoculation efforts, and the concerns of interference by Beijing are likely to further strain relations with China.China’s government claims Taiwan as its territory, despite having never ruled it. Under leader Xi Jinping, China is increasing its military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, while also threatening to invade.Dealing with a Chinese company to access the vaccine had been a source of anxiety for Taiwan’s government, Chen said. “At the time we were worried there would be political pressure,” he said.Taiwan’s government is still talking with BioNTech, according to Presidential Office spokeswoman Kolas Yotaka. Taiwan has not started offering vaccines to the public yet, but Chen said efforts to procure them from overseas continue, with the first vaccinations likely to begin in the middle of the year.The government plans to purchase 20 million doses, approximately 5 million of which will likely be provided by the Covax program, co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization.Beijing has blocked Taiwan’s participation as an observer in the WHO’s World Health Assembly for the past several years, since President Tsai Ing-wen came into office.Speaking during a commercial break on the radio broadcast, Chen said of the failure to secure the German vaccines: “It’s just like our [attempts to] participate in the WHA,” according to a YouTube video of the interview.“This should not surprise anyone, but we are prepared,” spokeswoman Kolas said via text message Wednesday. “Our policy has not changed - we are developing our own high-quality vaccine and at the same time securing short-term access by purchasing from other companies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-alleges-political-pressure-from-china-may-have-blocked-vaccine-deal-101613554222363.html

Longfield will call for a “year of opportunity” to be launched once the virus is suppressed, with schools, sports halls and swimming pools opened at evenings and weekends to help children “catch up with confidence.”Also read| SA, Brazil variants of Covid virus in India: All we know about the two mutationsShe will also urge Johnson to extend the 20-pound ($27.80) weekly uplift in Universal Credit benefits payments when it comes to an end in April, warning that failing to do so would push 800,000 children into “devastating poverty.” Johnson’s “promise to ‘level up’ is just a slogan unless it focuses on children,” she will add.A government spokesperson said: “Protecting vulnerable children has been at the heart of our response to the pandemic, driven by our commitment to level up opportunities and outcomes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-urged-to-focus-post-covid-plans-on-vulnerable-children-101613543015387.html
17-02-2021||World||Prez Joe Biden describes life at the White House: 'A gilded cage'||Four weeks into his presidency, Joe Biden says he’s still getting used to the trappings of the office.Biden offered a frank description of what it’s like to live at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. during his CNN town hall Tuesday night, referencing past presidents who have spoken of the building as “a little like a gilded cage.”“I get up in the morning and look at Jill and say, ‘Where the hell are we?’” Biden joked, adding that he wasn't used to household staff waiting on him.“I find myself extremely self-conscious,” Biden added, saying he was unaccustomed to someone “handing me my suitcoat.”Biden’s working-class upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania, has long been a central part of his political brand. He most recently lived in a large house in the Wilmington, Delaware, suburbs.The White House features a spacious lawn that has an unimpeded view of the Washington and Lincoln Monuments, but is otherwise surrounded by high fencing and a small army of guards. Biden said it’s “totally different” from the vice president’s residence, set on 80 acres and offering ample room to swim, explore and exercise in greater privacy.The former vice president said he’d been in the Oval Office 100 times or more over the years, but had never been to the residential areas of the White House.Even if the residence still feels new, Biden suggested he's already settled deeply into the work of the presidency.“Sometimes, because things are moving so fast, not because of the burden, it feels like four years,” Biden said. “It’s not because of the burden, it’s because there’s so much happening, that you’re focused on, you’re constantly focusing on one problem or opportunity.”Biden confirmed he had picked up the phone to talk with one or more of his predecessors but declined to say who.He added: “By the way, all of them have, with one exception, picked up the phone and called me as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prez-joe-biden-describes-life-at-the-white-house-a-gilded-cage-101613553127183.html
17-02-2021||World||French Assembly passes bill aiming to curb 'a rise in Islamism'||France's National Assembly on Tuesday approved legislation designed mainly to counter a rise in Islamism in towns and cities which the government says threatens national unity.The legislation did not single out any particular religion, but it cracked down on practices such as forced marriage and virginity tests.It included tough measures against online apologists for acts of violence, stricter surveillance of religious associations, and tighter restrictions on educating children outside mainstream schools.France's Muslim population is estimated to number about five million people, many whose family origins lie in Algeria or other parts of its former empire.The country has suffered a wave of Islamist militant attacks in recent years, and tackling religious extremism, French identity and domestic security will be big issues in next year's presidential election.Presented to parliament on the 115th anniversary of the law that enshrined the separation of state and religion in France, the bill has been branded by some on the left as an attack on Islam and as too weak by the far-right and some conservatives.The legislation represented a "powerful offensive" by the secular state, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. "It's a tough text...but necessary for the Republic," Darmanin told RTL radio ahead of the vote.The bill passed by 347 votes to 151 in parliament's lower house, where President Emmanuel Macron's centrist ruling party and its allies hold a majority. The legislation now moves to the Senate, where the centre-right opposition dominates.The debate around the law became more charged after the Oct. 16 beheading of a schoolteacher, Samuel Paty, by a teenage Islamist who said he wanted to punish him for showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on free speech.Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has accused Darmanin of not tackling radical Islam head on."You are restricting everyone's freedom to try to modify the freedoms of a few Islamists," she told Darmanin in a debate last week, referring to the curbs on home-schooling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-assembly-passes-bill-aiming-to-curb-a-rise-in-islamism-101613551642344.html

He pointed to global worries around the prospects for asset bubbles and the possibility of a sudden uptick in inflation, as well as interest rates that currently are “ultra-low.”When he was managing director at MAS, Heng warned as early as April 2007 about the under-pricing of risks for securities, including the type of collateralized debt obligations at the heart of the U.S. housing crisis.Here are other comments Heng made in the interview:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-minister-warns-full-pandemic-brunt-not-yet-felt-101613541856994.html
17-02-2021||World||Freeze could keep Texans in the dark for days: energy update||The deep freeze that has forced the shutdown of US refineries, oil wells and meat plants, disrupted shipments of soybeans and corn, and is still leaving more than 3 million customers without electricity could continue to keep parts of Texas in the dark for several days.To prevent the collapse of their networks, suppliers from North Dakota to Texas implemented rolling power cuts for a second consecutive day, with outages spreading to more states Tuesday night including Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The operator of the Texas electric grid no longer expects all service to be restored in the state by Tuesday night, saying it could take days for enough power plants to be up and running. Utility CenterPoint Energy Inc. also warned residents blackouts may last for several more daysIn the Permian Basin, major producer Occidental Petroleum Corp. told customers it would be forced to curtail oil deliveries, while Chevron Corp. shut in some wells in the region. Fracking in the top U.S. shale plays has gone dark. US oil production has plunged by a third.Meanwhile, gasoline futures in New York jumped almost 5% on Tuesday as more than 20 refineries were disrupted by the polar blast. Citgo Petroleum Corp. said its Corpus Christ refinery in Texas won’t be able to deliver fuels. Wheat futures also surged as the freeze snarled grain shipments.Amazon.com Inc. closed facilities in Arkansas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Kentucky.Authorities warned Houston-area residents to stay off the roads and highways after sunset on Tuesday amid expectations that plunging temperatures and an approaching ice storm would make driving dangerous. Long lines formed at grocery stores in scenes reminiscent of the early days of Covid-19 as residents stocked up on necessities. Hotels in the area suspended some meal service because of delayed deliveries, and vacancy rates were near zero.At least 20 deaths have been reported across the U.S. in connection with severe winter weather that has left millions without power, according to the Associated Press.Three people were found dead after a tornado in North Carolina, and four others died in a Houston-area house fire after lighting a blaze in the fireplace to stay warm. Other causes of death included car crashes on icy roads and carbon monoxide poisoning.The Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc. lowered its emergency level to a level that no longer requires rolling blackouts.The grid had earlier asked all utilities in its southern region -- most of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Southeast Texas -- to implement periodic power outages after frigid weather forced generator shut-downs at the same time demand was rising.Texas Warns Fuel Shortages Developing in Western Half of State (9:30 p.m.)Motor fuels are running low in some parts of Texas as winter storms and frigid weather cripple power generation, natural gas output and the oil refineries that rely on them.The shortages have been detected along a stretch of Interstate 10 between San Antonio and El Paso, the Texas Department of Transportation said in a tweet late Tuesday.“Parts of Texas have fuel shortages,” the tweet said. “If you must drive, top off before you hit the road.”Houston Suburbs Tell People to Boil Water Before Drinking (8:50 p.m.)Officials in several Houston suburbs issued so-called boil orders warning residents to purify water supplies amid deepening weather and energy crises.Water-pressure levels in some municipal systems west and south of the fourth-largest U.S. city have fallen so low that the water is no longer safe for human consumption, according to warnings from multiple districts late Tuesday.The boil orders came just hours after office towers in the downtown business district warned tenants that low pressure meant the water was no longer potable. Power supplies across the state have been crippled by a combination of record cold temperatures and disruptions in fuel deliveries. Water utilities in Texas rely on electric pumps to operate distribution networks.The Freeport liquefied natural gas export plant in Texas has delayed and canceled planned loading of several shipments over the next few weeks as the facility curbs output in response to the deep freeze. Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked the three-train plant to dial back operations in keeping with the state’s disaster declaration.Power disruptions at export facilities, closed ship channels and a reduction in the flow of natural gas have held back LNG tankers off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Crews are working to restore power to the Sempra Energy-owned Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana. Houston-based Cheniere Energy Inc., the top U.S. LNG exporter, also curbed production at Sabine Pass LNG in Louisiana and Corpus Christi LNG in Texas.Gas flows to U.S. LNG export facilities have dropped to the lowest level since early-September, according to data from BloombergNEF.The Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc., which runs the largest power grid in the U.S. Midwest, called for rolling blackouts across its entire southern region amid generation outages and high demand. The order is scheduled until 1 a.m. on Feb. 17.MISO operates a system that stretches along the Mississippi River region from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico, taking in 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.Houston Power Outages Could Last Several Days, CenterPoint Says (6:05 p.m.)Rolling blackouts that have paralyzed Houston and the rest of Texas may last for several more days, utility CenterPoint Energy Inc. warned residents.With too little electricity being generated to supply all demand in the fourth-largest U.S. city, CenterPoint said in a tweet that it has no way to predict when supplies will be restored.Canadian Gas Commands Rare Premium Over U.S. Fuel Amid Freeze (5:49 p.m.)A deep freeze that’s sent Texas power prices surging and curtailed millions of barrels of oil production is serving as a short-term boon for Canada, which is fetching a rare premium for its natural gas.The country’s benchmark AECO gas price traded at a 27% premium to its U.S. equivalent on Tuesday, just days after touching a 7-year high of $5.28 per million British thermal units, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Canadian gas usually sells at a discount to American supplies because of its distance from major population and manufacturing centers, among other reasons.U.S. Oil Output Plunges by a Third as Freeze Slams Permian (5:32 p.m.)Total U.S. oil production has plunged by nearly a third as an unprecedented cold blast freezes well operations across the central U.S., according to traders and industry executives with direct knowledge of the operations.Crude output has now fallen by about 3.5 million barrels a day or more nationwide, they said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Before the cold snap, the U.S. was pumping about 11 million barrels a day, according to last government data. Production in the Texas’s Permian Basin alone -- America’s biggest oil field -- has plummeted by as much as 65%.Operations in Texas have stumbled because temperatures are low enough to freeze oil and gas liquids at the well head and in pipelines that are laid on the ground, as opposed to under the surface as practiced in more northerly oil regions. The big question now is how quickly temperatures return to normal.It Could Take Several Days to Restore Power in Texas (5:20 p.m.)The operator of the Texas electric grid no longer expects all service to be restored in the state by Tuesday night, saying it could take days for enough power plants to be up and running.One of the chief hurdles is that there isn’t enough natural gas flowing to fuel plants, Bill Magness, chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said in a briefing. He expects “significant progress” in the next several days but warned more power plants could still trip offline.“We are seeing progress on restoration of the system,” Magness said. “There could be setbacks”Earlier Tuesday, grid officials said they expected all power to be restored by the evening.Deep Freeze Upends U.S. Agriculture Markets From Grains to Beef (5:17 p.m.)The deep is snarling shipments of goods from corn to soybeans, shutting meat plants and curbing ethanol production.Traders say it’s increasingly hard to move grain to ports in the Pacific Northwest, and ice warnings are restricting navigation on the Illinois River. Energy costs soared, prompting some ethanol and soybean processing plants to slow down, said the traders, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Cargill Inc. is curbing energy use while Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. slowed production at several locations due to gas shortages. Tyson Foods Inc. was among meat producers forced to shut plants in Texas.Houston-Area Motorists Urged to Stay Home (4:50 p.m.)Authorities in Harris County, Texas, the nation’s third-largest county and home to Houston, warned residents to stay off the roads and highways after sunset on Tuesday amid expectations that plunging temperatures and an approaching ice storm will make driving dangerous.Meanwhile, long lines formed at grocery stores in scenes reminiscent of the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic as residents stocked up on necessities ahead of another round of punishing weather. Hotels in the Houston area suspended some meal service because of delayed food deliveries and vacancy rates were near zero as state-mandated power outages entered a third day.Chevron Shuts in Some Permian Wells Due to Freeze (4:09 p.m.)Chevron shut in compression and production at wells in Culberson County in West Texas due to cold weather, according to a state regulatory filing.Compression was shut down first, then production shut wells in, causing flaring. Emissions began on Sunday.Chemical Makers Shutting Coastal Facilities (4:08 p.m.)Olin Corp., Indorama Ventures and other chemical producers are shuttering plants along a 150-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast as gas shortages and icy temperatures hinder operations.Such shutdowns are not without danger -- Olin’s Blue Cube plant in Freeport, Texas, suffered a leak from a valve as crews were winding down operations, resulting in ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride emissions into the atmosphere, according to a state regulatory filing. Indorama alerted authorities and neighbors that it would be burning off excess gases frequently while it worked to suspend operations at its complex in Port Neches, Texas.Citgo Declares Force Majeure After Freeze Shuts Texas Refinery (3:44 p.m.)Venezuela-backed Citgo Petroleum Corp. has told its suppliers and customers that its Corpus Christ, Texas, refinery won’t be able to receive or deliver crude and refined products after a historic cold snap caused major disruptions to operations.The company is in the process of assessing damage and evaluating a restart time for the 167,000 barrel-a-day refinery, according to a force majeure notice seen by Bloomberg. Part of the refinery experienced operating issues and unplanned unit shutdowns due to freezing weather and third-party supplier outages, according to the latest regulatory filing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/freeze-could-keep-texans-in-the-dark-for-days-energy-update-101613541895962.html
17-02-2021||World||Civil rights groups want EU to ban biometric surveillance ahead of new AI laws||Civil and digital rights groups on Wednesday launched a petition seeking the support of one million Europeans to help pressure the European Union to ban biometric mass surveillance ahead of laws on artificial intelligence (AI) due this year.Surveillance tools such as facial recognition systems have triggered concerns about risks to privacy and fundamental rights and that they could be exploited by repressive regimes to commit human rights violations.The EU executive plans to announce a legislative proposal on AI in the first quarter of the year, which is expected to cover high-risk sectors such as healthcare, energy, transport and parts of the public sector.The group, made up of the Civil Liberties Union for Europe, Reclaim Your Face, European Digital Rights, Privacy International and about 26 other organisations, warned of the dangers of biometric data captured via CCTV cameras and facial recognition technology.The coalition, which aims to gather one million signatures so it can take part directly in the legislative process, said it has already collected evidence of vast and systemic abuses of people's biometric data across Europe."This is about everyone's control over their own future," Orsolya Reich, senior advocacy officer at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe, said in a statement."We can already see this happening with the way AI is used to make decisions about us. Biometric mass surveillance will just feed more data from more people into these systems and make these practices even more widespread and harmful," she said.The EU's rights watchdog, the Vienna-based EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, last year sounded the alarm on the risks of using AI in predictive policing, medical diagnoses and targeted advertising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/civil-rights-groups-want-eu-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-ahead-of-new-ai-laws-101613545561261.html
17-02-2021||World||New Zealand ends lockdown after deciding outbreak contained||A lockdown in the New Zealand city of Auckland will end at midnight, the government announced Wednesday after concluding a coronavirus outbreak had been contained.“This is good news,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.The nation's largest city was put into lockdown on Sunday after three unexplained cases were found in the community. It was the first lockdown in six months in a nation which so far has managed to successfully stamp out the spread of the disease.The move to end the lockdown came as health authorities said the outbreak had grown by three cases to six in total. But Ardern said the additional cases were to be expected because they involved close contacts.Ramped-up testing indicates the outbreak hasn't spread far. Laboratories processed more than 17,000 individual tests on Tuesday, authorities said, and they also tested wastewater samples, which came back negative.“What this tells us is that we don't have a widespread outbreak, but rather a small chain of transmission which is manageable by our normal contact-tracing and testing procedures,” Ardern said.The initial cases were a mother, a father, and their 13-year-old daughter, who attends a local high school. Health authorities said the three new cases were a high school classmate, who was a close contact of the daughter, and two family members of the classmate.Senior lawmakers in the Cabinet who met Wednesday afternoon decided most Aucklanders could go back to work and school from Thursday, but they would still leave some restrictions in place until at least Monday.Genome testing has shown the family caught a more contagious variant first found in Britain.The mother who caught the disease works at a catering company that does laundry for airlines. Officials have been investigating whether there is any link to infected passengers, but so far haven't been able to find a direct connection or explain how the outbreak might have begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-ends-lockdown-after-deciding-outbreak-contained-101613545223625.html
17-02-2021||World||Israel's election sprint resembles US presidential brawl||In Israel, the sprint to the March 23 election is striking a notable resemblance to the American presidential brawl in 2020.Candidates are holding virtual events or limited in-person gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some have signed up star US advisers who faced off against each other during the contest between Republican incumbent Donald Trump and the Democrat who defeated him, President Joe Biden.As in the United States, the Israeli race is a referendum on the divisive personality at the top and his stewardship of a nation brutalized by Covid-19.Many Americans saw the choice as Trump — or almost anyone else. In Israel, the field is divided between those who are for or against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Where Trump had, “Make America Great Again,” Netanyahu implores people to, “Come back to life."The question of moral authority, too, is a common theme. As president, Trump stood accused of a multitude of wrongdoing, including sexual misconduct against more than a dozen women (he denies all of them), questions about his taxes and serial problems telling the truth. Netanyahu last week pleaded not guilty to charges of breach of trust, fraud and accepting bribes.Both men have cast themselves as victims.“It's almost verbatim,” said Alon Pinkas, Israel's former consul general in New York. "They're both victims of a 'witch hunt,' both running an entire campaign about how ‘They’re out to get me. And if they're out to get me, they're out to get you.'"But there is a key difference. While Trump suffered a solid defeat in November, Netanyahu remains Israel's most popular politician and has a strong chance of continuing his 12-year reign.That stems in part from the two countries' vastly different populations and government systems. The US is home to nearly 330 million people; Israel has just over 9 million. America is a democratic republic, where voters choose both the president and members of Congress on Election Day. Israel holds national elections where an array of political parties compete for proportionally awarded seats in the 120-member parliament, or Knesset.Since no individual party has ever won a 61-seat majority on its own, that generates relentless coalition-building to form a government.Netanyahu's Likud party is projected in all opinion polls to emerge as the largest party in the March election. But his hopes of cobbling together a government have been complicated by his legal woes, with a growing number of parties refusing to serve under a prime minister accused of serious crimes. In December, a delicate governing coalition between Netanyahu and his arch-rival collapsed after just seven months, sending the country to its fourth vote in two years.Netanyahu — unlike his close ally Trump — has taken the virus seriously and made Israel's vaccination campaign the centerpiece of his reelection bid.Late last year, he personally negotiated what has become the world's speediest coronavirus vaccination drive. As of Tuesday, nearly half of the population had received a first dose of vaccine. Nearly one-third have been inoculated twice and the level of severe infections and deaths has begun to decline.But other parts of Netanyahu's management of the pandemic have come under heavy criticism. Like Trump's key allies, a bloc of Netanyahu's core supporters, the ultra-Orthodox, are flouting safety guidelines and attending mass events in defiance of the virus threat. Public anger is pronounced, with thousands of protesters gathering outside his residence each week or toting black flags on bridges and overpasses. They want Netanyahu to step down over his legal woes and the deep economic damage caused by a series of lockdowns over the past year.In a break from Israeli tradition, Netanyahu's toughest opponents are not retired generals but former journalists. Three party leaders are former TV commentators and a fourth opponent, Gideon Saar, is married to one of the country's most famous news anchors.These media-savvy personalities, backed in some cases by American strategists, have waged impressive pandemic politicking.Lesson No. 1: Learn effective virtual campaigning, cross-post those events on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and weave them with relentless social media campaigns.Netanyahu, educated in the US at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and deeply familiar with American politics, last month named Philadelphia native Aaron Klein his campaign manager. Klein, 40, is a former U.S radio show host and ex-Jerusalem bureau chief for Breitbart News. He was appointed by the site’s executive chairman at the time, Steven Bannon, who would later become a key strategist to Trump.The prime minister also has brought back longtime American adviser John McLaughlin, whose banner photo atop his Twitter feed features him shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump. Netanyahu used similar images in recent campaigns. But with Biden in office, he has played down the Trump connection this time around.Saar, a onetime ally of Netanyahu, is challenging the prime minister now from the right. Last month, he hired several founders of the Lincoln Project — perhaps the best-known anti-Trump group of the 2020 election — that drew Republican voters away from the president by attacking his moral authority. The group is now grappling with allegations over how it handled charges of sexual misconduct of one founder, John Weaver, who has resigned. On Tuesday, Saar's campaign said it was re-evaluating its ties with the group.The moral questions raised against Trump are similar to Saar’s message as head of the New Hope, the party he founded when he broke away from Netanyahu's Likud.Saar shares the prime minister's hard-line nationalist ideology — he's a strong proponent of West Bank settlements and favors their eventual annexation. But he's trying to create a contrast with Netanyahu, who he said has turned Likud into a “cult of personality," familiar rhetoric to anyone listening to Trump's various opponents.Saar also is making civility and decency a centerpiece of his campaign, reminiscent of Biden's approach against Trump. In an AP interview, Saar said he was “in a better position" than Netanyahu to have a positive relationship with Biden.Another Netanyahu challenger, Yair Lapid, is partnering with prominent Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. The Times of Israel reported that Lapid flew to the U.S. last month to meet personally with his longtime ally.“The situation here in Israel is crazy,” Lapid, a former anchorman, said several times during a virtual town hall February 9. “We can have a prime minister with integrity."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-election-sprint-resembles-us-presidential-brawl-101613544126889.html
17-02-2021||World||Biden warns China of repercussions over human rights abuses||US President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned China of “repercussions” for human rights violations in Hong Kong and against minority Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.China has drawn criticism for its human rights violations such as its Hong Kong crackdown, the internment of Uighurs in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in Asia, including towards Taiwan, which China claims as its own. “We must stand up for human rights”, Biden said addressing his first town hall meeting since taking office. It was hosted by CNN in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a swing state Biden won narrowly. “What I’m doing is, making clear that, we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the UN and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.”“There will be repercussions for China and (President Xi Jinping) knows that,” Biden added, when pressed if there will be consequences for violation of human rights by China.Biden said he brought up Hong Kong and the condition of Uighurs in his recent — and first — call with the Chinese president. They spoke for two hours. “President Biden underscored his fundamental concerns about Beijing’s coercive and unfair economic practices, crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including toward Taiwan,” A White House readout of the call had said.The president did not elaborate on what the “repercussions” entail. Secretary of state Antony Blinken was more forthcoming in separate remarks in a radio interview. He indicated curbs on import of products made with use of forced labour in China and export of products to China that could be used to oppress people.The American president and his officials have faced unrelenting scrutiny of their remarks and pronouncements regarding China and the expectations are for the new administration to continue the hardline positions of the Trump administration, if not to make them tougher.“I think that president Trump was right to take a tougher line on some of the egregious things that China has done and is doing that are counter to our interests and counter to our values,” Blinken acknowledged in an interview to NPR when asked about Trump’s “hard line” on China.He added: “But I think the way that we went about doing it did not produce results.”Secretary Blinken, who has called the repression of Uighurs a “genocide”, was asked if he would support the boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in China, as has been demanded by some activists. “There are things that we can and should be doing, for example, to make sure that any products or technologies that we make are not being used to repress people, including in Xinjiang,” he said, adding, “Similarly, we ought to be able to make sure that we’re not importing things that are made with forced labour, including in Xinjiang.”The Trump administration had announced restrictions on the import of apparels, hair products and certain technologies from China which it said were made using forced labour in Xinjiang. The Biden administration could go further and ban cotton and tomato imports from Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-china-of-repercussions-over-human-rights-abuses-101613544300788.html
17-02-2021||World||US President Joe Biden suggests more police funding, no jail for drug offenders||President Joe Biden outlined changes he hopes to make to criminal justice and policing in the United States during a town hall Tuesday night, highlighting issues that his administration may tackle after Covid-19 relief.Asked how United States law enforcement could protect citizens in high crime neighborhoods while training officers to police compassionately, Biden answered "By number one, not defunding the police."Some Democrats pushed for reviews of local police budgets after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer last summer and diversion of funding to social and mental health services.Biden told the televised town hall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that he would put more money into local policing."We have to put more money for this to work so we have legitimate community policing, and we are in a situation where we can change the legislation," he added.On the campaign trail, Biden promised to invest $300 million in a program that gives grants to hire more diverse officers and trains them to develop less adversarial relationships with communities.He also reiterated another campaign promise Tuesday, ending jail sentences for drug use alone."No one should go to jail for a drug offense. No one should go to jail for the use of a drug, they should go to drug rehabilitation," he said."Every cop, when they get up in the morning and put on that shield, has a right to expect to be able to go home to their family that night," Biden added. "Conversely, every kid walking across the street wearing a hoodie is not a member of a gang and about to knock somebody off."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-suggests-more-police-funding-no-jail-for-drug-offenders-101613542105181.html
17-02-2021||World||Biden says China will face repercussions on human rights issues||China will pay a price for its human rights abuses, US President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday, responding to queries at a televised event on the Asian nation's handling of Muslim minorities in its far western region of Xinjiang.Chinese President Xi Jinping has drawn global criticism for holding the minority Uighurs in internment camps and other human rights abuses."Well, there will be repercussions for China and he knows that," Biden said of Xi, when pressed on the issue at the town hall event televised on broadcaster CNN.The United States will reassert its global role in speaking up for human rights, Biden said, adding that he would work with the international community to get China to protect them."China is trying very hard to become a world leader and to get that moniker and be able to do that they have to gain the confidence of other countries," Biden said on his first official trip since taking office as president in January."As long as they are engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it is going to be hard for them to do that," he added.In a two hour phone call with Xi this month, Biden emphasized the US priority of preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region, where the United States and China are major strategic rivals.He also voiced concern about Beijing’s "coercive and unfair" trade practices and rights issues, such as its Hong Kong crackdown, the Xinjiang internments, and increasingly assertive actions in Asia, including toward Taiwan, which China claims as its own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-china-will-face-repercussions-on-human-rights-issues-101613534622206.html
17-02-2021||World||Epstein's ex-girlfriend Maxwell alleges physical abuse by guard in federal jail||Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend claimed through her lawyer Tuesday that a guard physically abused her at a federal lockup in Brooklyn, and then she was punished for complaining about it.Attorney Bobbi Sternheim wrote in a letter to a Manhattan federal judge that the abuse occurred recently at the Metropolitan Detention Center as Ghislaine Maxwell was undergoing a pat down search in her isolation cell.The lawyer said the British socialite asked that a camera be used to capture what was occurring, but a guard “replied no.'”“When Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she was threatened with disciplinary action,” Sternheim said.Days later, Maxwell was retaliated against for reporting the abuse when a guard ordered her into a shower to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom, the lawyer said. She added that Maxwell was denied a request that the encounter with the guard in the tight space be recorded.A spokesperson for prosecutors declined comment. A message seeking comment was sent to the federal Bureau of Prisons.Maxwell, 59, is awaiting a July trial on charges that she recruited three teenage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse in the 1990s and committed perjury during 2016 depositions in a civil case. She has pleaded not guilty.She has remained incarcerated without bail since July, when she was arrested almost exactly a year after Epstein was arrested to face sex trafficking charges. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail a month after his arrest.In late December, a judge rejected a USD 28.5 million bail proposal for Maxwell, saying she was a risk to flee and was not forthcoming with authorities about her finances after her arrest.As part of the bail proposal, lawyers said Maxwell had about USD 22.5 million in assets with her husband and had set aside over USD 7 million for her defense.In Tuesday's letter, Sternheim repeated assertions made before that Maxwell is being subjected to onerous conditions that include repeated searches and being awakened every 15 minutes by a light flashed into her cell when she sleeps. The lawyer said the prison is reacting to Epstein's suicide.Sternheim said Maxwell has been physically searched approximately 1,400 times in the last seven months and no contraband has ever been found despite hundreds of physical searches of the cell where she lives alone as well as her locker, legal papers, and personal effects.She said her client is under 24-hour surveillance by two-to-six guards and approximately 18 cameras, not including a hand-held camera trained on her when she is moved outside the cell.Meanwhile, harsh treatment that includes food so poorly prepared that it sometimes cannot be eaten has taken a toll, the lawyer said.“She is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight, losing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate,” Sternheim wrote. “In addition to the many difficulties impacting her review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her stamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epsteins-ex-girlfriend-maxwell-alleges-physical-abuse-by-guard-in-federal-jail-101613532760620.html
17-02-2021||World||More women at meetings, but only if they don't talk: Japan's ruling party||After a sexism row sparked by Tokyo Olympics chief's saying women talked too much at meetings, Japan's ruling party wants women at key meetings - but only if they don't talk.The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed a new plan that allows five female lawmakers to join the party's key meetings as observers.Toshihiro Nikai, the party's secretary general, said on Tuesday that he heard criticism that the party's board is male-dominated, but added that the board members are elected.But it is important for the party's female members to "look" at the party's decisionmaking process, he said."It is important to fully understand what kind of discussions are happening. Take a look, is what it is about," Nikai said at a news conference late on Tuesday.Those female observers can't speak during the meetings, but can submit opinions separately to the secretariat office, the daily newspaper Nikkei reported.Yoshiro Mori, the head of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic organising committee, resigned last week after derogatory comments about women speaking too much at meetings and making them too long triggered backlash at home and abroad.The 83-year-old former prime minister's remarks are one of the examples that show how deep rooted sexism is in Japanese society.Japan is ranked 121st out of 153 countries on the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Gender Gap Index - the worst ranking gap among advanced countries - scoring poorly on women’s economic participation and political empowerment.This week, a group of female lawmakers at the Liberal Democratic Party asked Nikai to increase the ratio of women in key posts at the party.But requiring female observers at meetings to remain quiet has drawn criticism on social media that the party is out of touch.Twitter users say the party's male-centric view has not changed since the Mori controversy."People will just put women on them as a kind of PR exercise," Belinda Wheaton, a cultural sociologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, told Reuters."I think it’s probably time to be asking questions as to why it is that we feel that men in their 70s or 80s are able to fulfil these roles better versus a man in their 40s or 50s, or a woman," Wheaton said.Also making the rounds on social media were comments by a senior official speaking to a business lobby group who said Japan's glass ceiling was "partly women's fault".(Reporting by Ju-min Park and Chang-ran Kim; additional reporting by Mari Saito; Editing by Gerry Doyle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-women-at-meetings-but-only-if-they-don-t-talk-japan-s-ruling-party-101613529598137.html
17-02-2021||World||Biden pushes for pandemic relief in first official trip as president||President Joe Biden vowed during a prime-time televised town hall on Tuesday to accelerate the country's vaccination program and said teachers should be moved closer to the front of the line for inoculations to allow more schools to reopen.In his first official trip since taking office in January, Biden travelled to Wisconsin, a battleground state that helped propel his electoral victory over President Donald Trump, to address Americans' concerns directly and build public support for his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill."I think that we should be vaccinating teachers - we should move them up in the hierarchy," Biden said during a CNN broadcast in Milwaukee, after a parent and a teacher asked what he planned to do to permit schools to operate safely. The president noted that states, not the federal government, have the authority to decide how to prioritize vaccinations.Biden said he expected that everyone who wanted a vaccine would be able to get one by July, when his administration will have secured enough shots to inoculate all Americans.With the U.S. Senate having acquitted Trump in his second impeachment trial on Saturday, the White House is eager to press ahead with Biden's agenda on the economy, fighting COVID-19, curbing climate change and addressing racial inequality.Biden wants Congress to pass his relief bill in the coming weeks in order to get $1,400 stimulus checks out to Americans and bolster unemployment payments.Tuesday's visit, as well as a trip scheduled for Thursday that will take Biden to Michigan to tour a vaccine manufacturing site, offered the president an opportunity to tout the bill's importance even as Republicans remain largely opposed to its massive price tag.Congressional Democrats have barreled ahead with the legislation, arguing that going "big" will help boost the economy and bring the pandemic under control in a country where more than 485,000 people have died from COVID-19.The number of deaths, new cases and hospitalizations has dropped in recent weeks across the country, and the pace of vaccination is slowly increasing. But thousands of Americans are still dying every day from the disease, and the economy remains fragile.Tuesday's event took place at the Pabst Theater, a landmark concert venue, where attendees were masked and spaced apart.Wisconsin had supported Democratic presidential candidates since 1988 before backing Trump in 2016, one of a handful of states that flipped Republican and helped him defeat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Biden narrowly carried the state in November.Biden has traveled to his home state of Delaware and to the Camp David presidential retreat since taking office on Jan. 20, but the trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city, was his first on official business since becoming president.Tuesday's travel also included Biden's first flight on the larger version of Air Force One, the presidential plane. When traveling back to Delaware, he flew on a smaller model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-pushes-for-pandemic-relief-in-first-official-trip-as-president-101613532078501.html
17-02-2021||World||'Worse than my ex': Myanmar's very online youth take on the junta, coup||Their signs say it all: Myanmar's ruling junta is worse than an ex-boyfriend, fouler than fish curry, rejected by millions and more painful than a period.As they flood streets across the country in opposition to last week's military coup, a younger generation of Myanmar protesters are cracking jokes at the military's expense and winning fans on social media with their colourful, witty and often explicit signage.The situation is so bad, "even the introverts are here", as one demonstrator's poster put it."My ex is bad, but Myanmar military is worse," said another.Scorn has particularly been heaped on army chief Min Aung Hlaing, now in charge after the coup deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi."Our dreams are higher than MAL's height," read a handwritten cardboard sign -- a reference to the commander-in-chief's diminutive stature."Min Aung Hlaing I hate you more than my periods," said another held out a car window.Photos of the relatable, sly remarks have been shared thousands of times on social media, with retweets and comments from users in Hong Kong, the United States and elsewhere.This social media savvy campaign "is a new, creative type of protesting for Myanmar," said Htaike Htaike Aung, executive director of Myanmar ICT for Development, a Yangon-based digital rights group."The younger generation... are on Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Discord mobilizing other young people," she told AFP.Unlike previous generations largely cut off from the world during the 49 years of military rule, these younger Myanmar protesters came of age plugged into the internet zeitgeist.And they are very online.In one widely shared sign, a woman reinterpreted "WAP" -- Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's sexually-explicit summer hit -- to mean "We Are Protesting Peacefully".Many of the signs are in English, highlighting the desire to appeal to an international audience.Social media has not only spread their message, but also connected Myanmar protesters to Hong Kong and Thai users who have swapped tips on how to stay safe during demonstrations.Hard hats -- essential gear during Hong Kong's unrest -- are also becoming a signature of this movement.- Coming online -None of this would have been possible a decade ago.Before Myanmar began its democratic transition in 2011, cyber cafes dotted major cities, but Skype, Gmail and Facebook were restricted under the military-imposed isolation.Despite smartphone usage exploding around the world, only North Korea had fewer mobile phones than Myanmar, where SIM cards cost thousands of dollars.That changed in 2013, when the government ended the state monopoly on telecommunications and SIM prices plummeted while cheap, Chinese smartphones -- with Facebook preloaded -- became widely available.Eager to connect after years in the dark, the country came online virtually overnight and was soon inundated with ride hailing apps, food delivery services and money transfer platforms in an internet gold rush.Pulling the plug on all this connectivity will be hard, if not impossible, said Htaike Htaike Aung, the digital rights campaigner.The military has already tried to put a chokehold on the country's internet, but users circumvented a nationwide blackout as well as social media restrictions with VPNs, foreign SIM cards and other measures before access was restored.As one of the tongue-in-cheek signs proliferating across the country put it, the military "has messed with the wrong generation".lb/dhc/ohoFACEBOOK||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worse-than-my-ex-myanmar-s-very-online-youth-take-on-the-junta-coup-101613528205984.html

Half will participate in a 7-week health survey.Inoculations of 3.7 million more health workers will begin in March, followed by about 36 million people aged 65 and older starting in April.

17-02-2021||World||Indians in UAE can now renew International Driving Permit at Indian Embassy: Report||Indian expats in the UAE can locally renew their International Driving Permit (IDP) issued in India starting Tuesday.According to Gulf News, the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi on Monday announced that it would facilitate the re-issuance of IDP to Indian nationals, which were originally issued by the relevant authorities in India with effect from February 15.The move is part of the Indian government's decision to allow Indian Embassies abroad to provide the service in cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and Highways (MoRTH).In an advisory related to the launch of the service posted on social media, the Embassy -- as quoted by Gulf News -- said: "Those who intend to avail of this consular service may please visit the Embassy during working hours (between 08:30 am to 12:30 pm on all working days from Sunday to Thursday) with their valid passport and expired IDP/ IDP number as well as their Indian driving license."After physical verification of the documents, it said, the applicants will be asked to submit duly filled-in Miscellaneous Consular Service Form (EAP-II), Gulf News reported further.On the subject of whether the same would be applicable for Indians living in Dubai and Notehrn Emerates or not, the Indian Consulate in Dubai confirmed to Gulf News that the same service can be done through an outsourced agency providing attestation services for Indians in Dubai and the northern emirates.A consulate spokesperson said the process, documentation and fees will remain the same for Indians living in Dubai and the northern emirates as well."However, instead of visiting the consulate, they need to visit the IVS office for document submission," he said to Gulf News.On the subject of the cost applicable, the mission said that they also have to provide Dh40 as consular service fee and Dh8 as Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) charge.The applicant would need to upload all the relevant documents along with the receipt issued by the mission in the Parivahan portal of the ministry and pay the requisite IDP fees online on the same portal.The mission explained further that on receipt of the application through the portal, the licensing authority (MoRTH), upon verification of the document shall courier the IDP, directly to the residential address of the applicant."It may be noted that the role of the embassy in this consular service is limited to the extent of facilitating submission of IDP renewal application form only. Any further correspondence pertaining to the subject, including status of the application would need to be verified directly from the authority concerned (MoRTH) in India," it added.The government of India had last year announced the plan to facilitate the renewal of IDP for citizens whose permit expired while abroad through Indian missions as there was no such mechanism earlier.The Ministry of External Affairs on Friday announced that a new consular service has been launched by Indian Missions/Posts abroad, in cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for the facilitation of the issuance of International Driving Permit (IDP) to Indian nationals.According to a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, the Consular Service will be provided by Missions/Posts abroad in countries, which are signatory of the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-in-uae-can-now-renew-international-driving-permit-at-indian-embassy-101613523753357.html
17-02-2021||World||India says UN peacekeeping missions not tools for pushing political interests||The UN peacekeeping missions should not operate in perpetuity and there is urgent need for time-bound exit strategies to ensure they do not become instruments for "furthering political interests", India, one of the largest troop-contributing countries, has said.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti said the current peacekeeping operations are multi-dimensional and are called upon to not only maintain peace and security but also to facilitate the political processes, protect civilians, disarm combatants, support elections, protect and promote human rights and restore the rule of law.“Peacekeeping missions are meant to be transitional measures and not operate in perpetuity. There is an urgent need for time-bound exit strategies to ensure that peacekeeping missions do not become instruments for furthering political interests,” he said at the General Debate on Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations on Monday.Highlighting India’s perspective on priority issues in UN peacekeeping, he said performance of peacekeeping operations should be measured in relation to political and operational realities, priorities set for implementing mandate, and adequacy and appropriateness of resources.Tirumurti said India has always voiced its support for the adoption of “No National Caveats Policy” at UN peacekeeping deployments.“India believes that a caveat, whether declared or undeclared, places additional burden on those who do not have any caveats besides having an impact on performance of peacekeepers in fulfilling their mandate and safety and security,” he said.India has always called for matching mandates with adequate resources, Tirumurti said, underlining that “an under-resourced, under-equipped mission, will not only result in underperformance in mandate implementation, but will impact the credibility of UN peacekeeping as a whole”.President of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir said the COVID-19 pandemic has put additional challenges to the already complex peacekeeping operations. Peace operations are also supporting government-led efforts to both prevent and prepare for COVID-19 outbreaks at the country level.“Amidst these daunting challenges, it is essential that we provide peacekeeping operations with clearly defined mandates and realisable objectives, adequate resources based on a realistic assessment of the situation on the ground, as well as secure financing,” he said.Bozkir said it was crucial that the UN’s approach keeps pace with, and responds to, evolving challenges and new threats and opportunities.In this ever more complex and interconnected world, UN peace operations require constant refinement, drawing on analytical and operational capabilities, while leveraging new technology to increase their impact, he said.Tirumurti said that in the context of COVID-19, India was happy to respond to the request of UN Secretary-General and swiftly dispatch two medical teams and upgrade India’s peacekeeping hospitals in MONUSCO in Goma, DRC and in UNMISS in Juba, South Sudan.“We are working closely with our partners on the vaccine front also and make available our facilities for all humanity,” he said.India stressed that honest assessment and feedback for peacekeeping performance was essential to have an effective accountability system.“Assessing performance without determining accountability will leave us open to repeating errors,” Tirumurti said, adding that India supports the effective implementation of Integrated Performance Policy Framework, which covers all stakeholders and all phases of peacekeeping operations, and not just those on the ground.India strongly supports the SG’s Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative, which requires sustained and effective follow-up and implementation and appreciates the Secretary-General’s attention to improving safety and security of UN peacekeeping personnel.“With rising incidents of attacks, including from terrorists, and rising casualties, we need to do more to ‘protect the protectors’,” he said.India, however, voiced concern over the non-payment of cost of service rendered by the Troop and Police Contributing Countries to the “closed” peacekeeping missions, saying this “unresolved” issue requires resolution and considered attention.According to a UN statement, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said the current session sends a powerful message in support of peacekeeping personnel facing complex challenges in the field amid the pandemic.Tirumurti asserted that India will push for the presence of more women in peacekeeping.With more than one million men and women having served under the UN flag in more than 70 peacekeeping operations over the past seven decades, Tirumurti recalled the “pioneering” efforts of India, especially the first all-women UN police peacekeeping contingent in Liberia – in the backdrop of “our own history of forming the first all-women Rani of Jhansi regiment of the Indian National Army of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose during India’s fight for independence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-says-un-peacekeeping-missions-not-tools-for-pushing-political-interests-101613522285186.html
17-02-2021||World||Missing Dubai princess Sheikha Latifa says she is a hostage: Report||A daughter of Dubai's powerful ruler who tried to flee the country in 2018 only to be detained by commandos in a boat off India has re-emerged in new videos published Tuesday, saying she doesn't know if she's “going to survive this situation.”The videos released by the BBC show Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum at a “jail villa,” apparently located in the skyscraper-studded city-state in the United Arab Emirates. Her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, also serves as the prime minister and vice president in the hereditarily ruled UAE.“I'm a hostage,” the sheikha says in one video. "This villa has been converted into jail.“I can't even go outside to get any fresh air,” she also said.The government's Dubai Media Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.In 2018, the AP reported how a friend and an ex-French spy helped Sheikha Latifa escape by boat, only to be captured off India.The BBC said Sheikha Latifa recorded the videos in a bathroom at the villa over months on a phone she secretly received about a year after her capture.“I don't know when I'll be released and what the conditions will be like when I'm released,” she says in a video. “Every day I am worried about my safety and my life.”The videos, part of an episode of BBC's “Panorama” investigative series being broadcast Tuesday, also include an interview with Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Robinson appeared in photos with Latifa published by Emirati officials after the sheikha's return to Dubai in 2018.Robinson told the BBC that she had been misled by Emirati authorities who told her Latifa was a troubled young woman safe in the care of her family.“I was particularly tricked when the photographs went public,” Robinson told the BBC. "That was a total surprise.... I was absolutely stunned.”The dramatic would-be sea escape and its aftermath intruded into the carefully controlled image maintained by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, who is believed to have several dozen children from multiple wives. Some of his sons and daughters figure prominently in local media and online, but others are rarely seen. Sheikha Latifa was widely known for her love of skydiving prior to 2018.Sheikh Mohammed's family life again became a public matter in 2020. Then, a British judge ruled the sheikh had conducted a campaign of fear and intimidation against his estranged wife and ordered the abduction of two of his daughters, one of them Sheikha Latifa. The ruling came in a custody battle between Sheikh Mohammed and estranged wife Princess Haya, daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan.Sheikh Mohammed is the founder of the successful Godolphin horse-racing stable and on friendly terms with Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. In 2019, he received a trophy from the queen after one of his horses won a race at Royal Ascot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-dubai-princess-sheikha-latifa-says-she-is-a-hostage-report-101613521623124.html
17-02-2021||World||Death of 14th Dalai Lama could spark religious crisis in Asia||As only a few years are left for Dalai Lama to turn 90-year-old, there are fears among the international community that his death could spark a religious crisis in Asia.The Buddhist figure, who is currently 85-year-old, had earlier announced that upon turning 90 he will decide whether he should be reincarnated.According to CNN, while the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is reportedly still in good health, questions over his succession are growing, along with fears that his death could lead to a religious crisis in Asia.The Chinese government occupied Tibet in 1950 and has ever since tried to control the region.The Dalai Lama, whom China views as overseer of an "evil clique" that seeks to split Tibet from China, escaped to India in 1959 and the 10th Panchen Lama (Lobsang Trinley Lhundrup Choekyi Gyaltsen) stayed behind in Tibet. He spoke against Chinese rule many times and wrote a report chronicling Tibet's famines in the 1960s.In recent years, China has intensified its efforts to eradicate the Dalai Lama from the religious lives of Tibetans to crush their identity. During a meeting, Mao Zedong had told the 14th Dalai Lama, that "religion is poison."According to CNN, over the years, the Dalai Lama has floated a number of options for his reincarnation, including picking a new successor himself in India, rather than in Tibet -- and has even toyed with the idea of a woman taking on the role.Meanwhile, the experts have opined that there are probabilities of choosing two separate Dalai Lamas -- one in China and another in India.The Chinese government's State Religious Affairs Bureau had published a document in 2007 laying out "management measures" for the reincarnation of living Tibetan Buddhas.According to the document, the reincarnations of Tibetan religious figures must be approved by Chinese government authorities, and those with "particularly great impact" must be approved by the State Council, China's top civil administration body currently led by Premier Li Keqiang, CNN noted.However, the Dalai Lama has stated that if he chooses to reincarnate, the responsibility for finding the 15th Dalai Lama will be on the Gaden Phodrang Trust, an India-based group he had founded after going into exile.Tenzin Tseten, a research fellow at the Dharamsala-based Tibet Policy Institute, was quoted as saying that the Dalai Lama is of great significance to the Tibetans and a symbol of their "nationalism and identity.""The Tibetan people will never accept a CCP-appointed the Dalai Lama," Tenzin emphasised.While China continues with its policies to eradicate the Dalai Lama from the lives of Tibetans by bringing the religious institution under its control, the US has threatened to sanction the Chinese government officials who chose a reincarnation of the Dalai Lama over the wishes of the Tibetan people.

17-02-2021||World||Hospitals still ration medical N95 masks as stockpiles swell: Report||One year into the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of medical-grade N95 face masks are pouring out of American factories and heading into storage, yet doctors and nurses say there still aren’t enough to keep them safe.An Associated Press investigation found a logistical breakdown at the heart of the perceived mask shortage, rooted in federal failures to coordinate supply chains and provide hospitals with clear rules about how to manage their medical equipment.Exclusive trade data and interviews with manufacturers, federal regulators, hospital procurement officials and frontline medical workers reveal a communication breakdown — not an actual shortage — that is depriving doctors, nurses and others risking exposure to COVID-19 of first-rate protection.In Fort Worth, Texas, medical-grade mask manufacturer Prestige Ameritech’s warehouse is piled high with cases of N95s. It can churn out 1 million every four days. But there aren’t orders for nearly that many, so Prestige recently got government approval to export them.“I’m drowning in these respirators,” owner Mike Bowen said.Meanwhile, Mary Turner, a COVID-19 intensive care nurse at a hospital outside Minneapolis, strapped on the one disposable N-95 respirator allotted for her entire shift.Before the coronavirus pandemic, Turner threw out her mask after each patient to prevent the spread of disease. Now she wears one mask from each infected person to the next because N95s — which filter out 95% of infectious particles — have supposedly been in short supply since last March.Turner’s employer, North Memorial Health, said in a statement that supplies have stabilized, but the company is still limiting use because “we must remain mindful of that supply” to ensure everyone’s safety.Internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show there were deliberate decisions to withhold vital information about new mask manufacturers and availability.Before the pandemic, medical providers followed guidelines that called for N95s to be discarded after each use. As the masks ran short, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modified guidelines to allow for extended use and reuse if supplies are “depleted,” a term left undefined.Hospitals have responded in a variety of ways, the AP has found. Some are back to pre-COVID-19, one-use-per-patient N95 protocols, but most are doling out one mask a day or fewer to each employee. Many hospital procurement officers say they are following guidelines for depleted supplies, even if their own stockpiles are robust.Chester “Trey” Moeller, a political appointee who served as the CDC’s deputy chief of staff until President Joe Biden’s inauguration last month, said efforts to increase US mask production succeeded, but the government has failed to connect new suppliers with customers.“We are forcing our health care industry to reuse sanitized N95s or even worse, wear one N95 all day long,” he said.Before the pandemic, the US demand for N95s was 1.7 billion per year, with 20% for medical use, trade groups say. In 2021, demand for medical use is estimated by industry sources to be 5.7 billion.Manufacturers like Bowen stepped in to fill the need.Still, many hospitals are restricting masks for workers while building their stockpiles over fears of a future COVID-19 surge.The AP spoke with a dozen procurement officers who buy supplies for more than 300 hospitals, and all said they have enough N95s now, between two and 12 months worth, sitting in storage.Even so, all but two are limiting workers to one mask per day, or even one per week.To boost domestic supply, the federal agency that oversees N95 manufacturers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, has approved 94 new brands, including 19 domestic manufacturers, according to the internal government emails.But in December, Moeller, an appointee of President Donald Trump, grew frustrated.“(NIOSH) had approved almost 20 US manufacturers to make N95 masks, but had not published any guidance or notice of what is ultimately more than 100 million N95 mask-making capacity a month going unsold,” Moeller told the AP.The Food and Drug Administration was monitoring N95 supply chains, and received $80 million in emergency pandemic funds “to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus.” Of that amount, about $38 million was for efforts related to tracking medical product shortages.But the agency has still not solved the problem. “There have been a good number of new NIOSH (mask) approvals that have been granted,” said Suzanne Schwartz, director of the FDA’s Office of Strategic Partnerships & Technology Innovation. “Yet the access to those new manufacturers, there seems to be a hurdle there. FDA ... is trying to identify that blockage.”The internal emails show that Moeller in December alerted NIOSH head Dr. John Howard about the unused US N95s.In a Dec. 22 email, Howard acknowledged he was still hearing of shortages: “Apparently, there is a significant domestic production capacity going unused for the lack of orders and we have tried to address this supplier/purchaser disconnect.”NIOSH was not actively promoting the new mask producers, Howard wrote, saying that “to avoid the perception of inequitable treatment and because of the dynamic production landscape, we have not posted information on our website regarding respirator availability.”Howard, through an agency spokesperson, declined a request for an interview. In a statement, NIOSH also acknowledged “a supply and demand disconnect” exists and said it is working to better connect purchasers with US-made masks.Meanwhile, the US finds itself in a paradox. The more N95s are rationed to alleviate a perceived shortage, the fewer masks are actually reaching the front lines.Dr. Robert Hancock, an emergency room doctor and president of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians, said hospitals are taking risks by rationing N95s, even when they have enough. He said some doctors tell him they get one N95 mask every five to seven days.“All the N95s currently out there were designed to be worn once. They were never designed to be reused,” Hancock said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospitals-still-ration-medical-n95-masks-as-stockpiles-swell-report-101613519988965.html
17-02-2021||World||Myanmar's Suu Kyi faces new charge as crackdown intensifies||Police in Myanmar filed a new charge against ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, her lawyer said Tuesday, in a move that may allow her to be held indefinitely without trial as part of an intensifying crackdown by authorities who seized power in a coup.Suu Kyi, who was deposed and detained in the military takeover on Feb. 1, already faced a charge of illegally possessing walkie-talkies — an apparent attempt to provide a legal veneer for her house arrest. Under the new charge, she is accused of breaking a law that has been used to prosecute people who have violated coronavirus restrictions, lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters after meeting with a judge in a court in the capital, Naypyitaw.It carries a maximum punishment of three years in prison. But, perhaps more worryingly, because of changes to the Penal Code instituted by the junta last week, it could allow her to be detained indefinitely, even without a court's permission. Suu Kyi’s lawyer told reporters he has not seen her since her arrest — and only arrived after an unexpected videoconference the judge said had been held with her.The legal maneuver comes two weeks after the military seized power in a coup that shocked many in the international community who had been hopeful that Myanmar was taking steps toward democracy. Since then, the junta has ratcheted up the pressure on protesters resisting the takeover, including violently breaking up some demonstrations and blocking internet access.“We have called for charges against her to be dropped, for her to be released," United Nations spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said.He stressed that adding a new charge against Suu Kyi doesn't change that demand and “our firm denunciation" of the military overturning the “democratic will of the people" and arresting political leaders, activists and peaceful protesters.On Monday, security forces pointed guns at a group of 1,000 demonstrators and attacked them with slingshots and sticks in the city of Mandalay. Local media reported that police also fired rubber bullets into a crowd and that a few people were injured.Protests continued Tuesday in Yangon, the country's largest city, and elsewhere. In Yangon, police blocked off the street in front of the Central Bank, which protesters have targeted amid speculation online that the military is seeking to seize money from it. Buddhist monks demonstrated outside the U.N.'s local office in the city.Around 3,000 demonstrators — mainly students — returned to the streets of Mandalay, carrying posters of Suu Kyi and shouting for the return of democracy.The protests are taking place in defiance of an order banning gatherings of five or more people. But the security presence was low-key around the march after Monday's confrontations.State media have been acknowledging the protest movement only indirectly. The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported about a meeting of the State Administration Council, the new top governing body, and quoted its chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, saying the authorities “are handling the ongoing problems with care.”It said the council discussed taking legal action against protesters and providing “true information” to the media. On Sunday and Monday nights, the military ordered an internet blackout — almost entirely blocking online access. Once before in recent weeks it imposed a similar blackout and has also tried less successfully to block social media platforms. It has also prepared a draft law that would criminalize many online activities.While the military did not say why the internet was blocked, there is widespread speculation that the government is installing a firewall system to allow it to monitor or block most or all online activity.The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper also reported that council members discussed acting against a “parallel government" established by some elected lawmakers of Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, who were prevented from taking their seats when the military stopped Parliament from opening its session Feb. 1.In the days following the takeover, members of Suu Kyi's party formed a committee, declaring themselves the true representatives of Myanmar's people and asking for international recognition. No such recognition has come, even as the United States and other governments have condemned the coup and urged the military to return power to the elected government and release Suu Kyi and other detainees.Neighboring China, meanwhile, has so far not condemned the takeover. Some protesters have accused Beijing — which has long been Myanmar’s main arms supplier and has major investments in the country — of propping up the junta.China's ambassador to the Southeast Asian country responded to those accusations, noting that Beijing has friendly relations with both Suu Kyi’s party and the military, according to the text of an interview posted on the embassy's Facebook page Tuesday. Chen Hai said he wished the two sides could solve their differences through dialogue.In the interview, Chen also addressed what he said were rumors that China was helping Myanmar to control its internet traffic and others that Chinese soldiers were showing up on the Myanmar's streets.“For the record, these are completely nonsense and even ridiculous accusations,” Chen said.The military contends there was fraud in last year’s election, which Suu Kyi’s party won in a landslide, and says it will hold power for a year before holding new elections. The state election commission found no evidence to support the claims of fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-suu-kyi-faces-new-charge-as-crackdown-intensifies-101613518493099.html
17-02-2021||World||Texas power plants shut by cold; left pipes exposed to elements||Texas blackouts triggered by frozen power infrastructure have left many wondering why the state’s electricity generators weren’t prepared for the cold.The short answer: They aren’t required to cold-proof their assets. While generators in chillier regions are typically compelled by federal or state rules to protect their plants from the elements, Texas plants can leave their pipes, valves and pressure gauges exposed. It’s cheaper that way.“The power plants in the Northeast, we put exterior closures around it,” said Michael Webber, the chief science and technology officer at Engie, and an energy professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “They wrap a building around the plant.”While Texas’s grid operator has called for generators to winterize their facilities after a 2011 cold snap also led to blackouts, it can’t force the companies to do so, said Adrian Shelley, Texas office director of the advocacy group Public Citizen.“From a generator perspective, the only incentive is to bring energy to market as cheaply as possible,” Shelley said. “Those sorts of investments aren’t recouped in any other way but by selling energy.”More than 45 gigawatts of Texas electricity capacity has been shut this week, in many cases because the instrumentation froze over, according to the state’s grid operator. Natural gas, coal, wind and even nuclear facilities have gone dark because of the cold and wind turbines have stopped because of ice on the blades.In West Texas, wellheads have frozen, curbing natural gas supplies bound for power plants. While fieldworkers in frigid North Dakota are used to cold-proofing -- for example, using winterized chemicals for fracking, setting up heaters to keep equipment warm and installing chains on all trucks -- Texans aren’t accustomed to it.“Some of it too is just the cost of capital,” said Joseph Triepke, founder of the industry research firm Infill Thinking. “We’re all trying to run so lean, and this kind of weather is a once-every-several-years or more kind of thing. You’re just not going to invest in having that winterization infrastructure on hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-power-plants-shut-by-cold-left-pipes-exposed-to-elements-101613518507054.html
17-02-2021||World||UK identifies 1.7 million more people at high Covid risk||The UK government identified an extra 1.7 million people in England at serious risk of coronavirus after using a new computer model that takes into account age, ethnicity and body mass index as well as medical conditions.Of the new cohort, those over 70 have already been invited for vaccination and 820,000 adults will now be prioritized for the shot “as soon as possible,” the Department of Health said Tuesday in a statement.The findings expand to almost 4 million the number of people asked to “shield” from the virus by staying at home, as the government strives to protect Britons from a pandemic that’s already cost more than 117,000 lives. All those shielding have been asked to do so until the end of March.More than 15.5 million people in the UK have had their first dose of the vaccine, and it is now being rolled out to people under 70 and those with certain clinical conditions.Road mapPrime Minister Boris Johnson hopes the vaccine roll out will help unlock national lockdown restrictions that have been in place since early January. Speculation is growing in Westminster over which sectors will see curbs eased and when, ahead of his statement on a “road map” on Feb. 22.The government’s new “predictive risk” model was developed following research at Oxford University that looked at the factors involved with Covid-19 deaths in the first wave.It will help the National Health Service to identify “further individuals who may be at high risk from Covid-19 due to a combination of personal and health factors,” Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, said in the statement.Positive impactOfficials reported evidence Tuesday that the vaccination program is having an impact. A report from the Office for National Statistics showed people over 80 years old -- one of the highest priority groups -- were the most likely to test positive for Covid antibodies in England.The analysis estimated that 40.9% of people aged 80 or older had antibodies during the four-week period leading to Feb. 1, “most likely due to the high vaccination rate in this group.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-identifies-1-7-million-more-people-at-high-covid-risk-101613518596631.html
17-02-2021||World||TikTok accused of failing to protect children from 'inappropriate' content||The European Consumer Organisation BEUC has filed complaints on Tuesday (local time) against Chinese-owned short video app TikTok over breaching European Union (EU) consumer rights and failing to protect children from hidden advertising and inappropriate content.According to an official statement issued by the European Consumer Organisation BEUC, a complaint has been filed with the EU and the network of consumer protection authorities against TikTok.Meanwhile, consumer organisations in as many as 15 countries have demanded their authorities to investigate TikTok's conduct.The European Consumer Organisation has said that the social media app has failed to protect children and teenagers from hidden advertising and potentially harmful content on its platform."TikTok's marketing offers to companies who want to advertise on the app contributes to the proliferation of hidden marketing. Users are for instance triggered to participate in branded hashtag challenges where they are encouraged to create the content of specific products. As popular influencers are often the starting point of such challenges the commercial intent is usually masked for users. TikTok is also potentially failing to conduct due diligence when it comes to protecting children from inappropriate content such as videos showing suggestive content which are just a few scrolls away," the statement said.It termed TikTok's practices for the processing of users' personal data as "misleading" as the app "does not inform its users, especially in a way comprehensible to children and teenagers, about what personal data is collected, for what purpose and for what legal reason".It stated that one of TikTok's features is that the users can purchase coins that they can use for virtual gifts for TikTok celebrities whose performance they like."TikTok's 'Virtual Item Policy' which manages this feature contains "unfair terms and misleading practices". TikTok claims, for instance, an absolute right to modify the exchange rate between the coins and the gifts, potentially skewing the financial transaction in its own favour," the statement added.In recent months, TikTok has come under flare for its policies.Earlier, US lawmakers had raised concerns over potential risks to data collection. Donald Trump, then President, had even sought to overhaul how TikTok operated in the US, but the deal was left unfinished before he left office, The Hill stated.Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki had said, "Broadly speaking, we are comprehensively evaluating ... risks to US data including from TikTok and will address them in a decisive and effective fashion."However, unlike the US, Europe has stricter regulations on data privacy.According to The Hill, under the General Data Protection Regulation law, which was implemented in 2018, companies are required to state what data is collected and for what purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-accused-of-failing-to-protect-children-from-inappropriate-content-101613516960567.html

17-02-2021||World||Twitter star to vaccine tsar: Japan's Taro Kono's moment in the spotlight||Japan's recently appointed vaccine tsar, Taro Kono, is having a breakout moment.Twitter-savvy and educated at Georgetown University in Washington, Kono has seen his popularity surge even as the government of his boss, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, has been battered by criticism over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.Two recent opinion polls have favoured Kono, who is also the minister for administrative reform, to be the next prime minister. As Japan launches its much awaited Covid-19 vaccination campaign, his role as the logistics head of the programme has thrust him even more firmly into the spotlight.Part of Kono's attraction, in a nation known for wooden, script-following leaders, is his ability to engage directly with voters through social media, a sharp contrast to Suga, who has been criticised for seeming stiff and aloof from voters.In recent weeks, Kono, 58, has used Twitter to publish videos on vaccine safety, repost memes and address media reports. He frequently responds directly to followers - 2.2 million on his Japanese account and 50,000 for his English one.Last week he posted about conferences with governors over the coronavirus, and a black mask embroidered with a dinosaur skull he had worn the previous day.But for all his appeal to voters and a resume that includes foreign and defence minister, some in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which he would lead as premier, are wary."He speaks English, he's smart, he's got a media presence, and he uses social media, so that's kind of appealing," said Scott Seaman, Asia director at the Eurasia Group in Washington. "But he would still have to run the LDP. And that's a skill."Given the LDP's majority in parliament, its leader is virtually guaranteed the premiership. Only two LDP presidents have failed to be premier during brief spells when the party was out of power - including Kono's father, Yohei.Some say his father's being denied the top job may have helped feed the son's ambition for the post.Kono declined a direct answer on Tuesday about whether he could work with the party if he became premier, with his current job a possible step towards that end."My job is the health of the Japanese people, let's not politicise this job," he told a news conference. "It's too important to politicise."Some in the LDP feel he is too young, given the average age since 2000 for premiers to take office is roughly 62. But their concerns also include his lone-wolf character in a land that runs on consensus, as well as an outspoken streak and occasional divergence from the standard line.Last month Kono told Reuters that "anything is possible" regarding the Tokyo Olympics, breaking with government vows that the Games, already postponed once, will open as planned in July.Last year, as defence minister, he suddenly cancelled deployment of the U.S.-made Aegis Ashore missile defence system without consulting others beforehand, a move that an LDP official said may have angered key ally the United States."I wonder if he can build a good relationship with the U.S. as a result," said the official, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of the issue.The faction-ridden LDP could prove difficult to run. Its tolerance of mavericks such as the wildly popular Junichiro Koizumi, premier from 2001 to 2006, has diminished in recent years, said political commentator Atsuo Ito."His bluntness will likely go over well with voters, but I'm not sure how well it'd work running a big organisation," added Ito.Kono's popularity, though, may prove hard for the LDP to resist and was likely part of Suga's calculus in putting him in charge of the vaccine rollout, to gain some support himself, political analysts said, although they wondered if Suga was also trying to neutralise a political rival.With a general election looming by October and the LDP chief's term expiring in September, putting Kono in the top job could bring big benefits for LDP candidates. But pitfalls remain, including Japan's rollout of the coronavirus vaccine."This is a gamble," the LDP official said. "If the vaccine doesn't go as planned, it's the end for both Suga and Kono."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-star-to-vaccine-tsar-japan-s-taro-kono-s-moment-in-the-spotlight-101613513689946.html
17-02-2021||World||'The path to diplomacy is open right now' with Iran, says US' Blinken||U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday "the path to diplomacy is open right now" with Iran over its 2015 nuclear deal but would not address whether the Biden administration has had any direct engagement with Iranian officials."The path to diplomacy is open right now. Iran is still a ways away from being in compliance (with the deal). So we'll have to see what it does," Blinken told National Public Radio according to a transcript provided by the broadcaster.Asked if there was any move under way to resume direct diplomacy, Blinken pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden's public stance that if Iran resumes compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal the United States would do so too."The president's been very clear publicly, repeatedly, about where we stand. And we'll see what, if any, reaction Iran has to that," he said.The interviewer noted Blinken had not directly answered the question and asked: "but you're not ruling out that direct diplomacy might be somewhere in the future here?"Blinken responded: "Well, at some point, presumably, if there's going to be any engagement on this, that would have to require diplomacy. That's what we're in the business of."In 2018, former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear deal, which limited Iran's uranium enrichment activity to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear arms - an ambition Iran has long denied having - in return for the easing of U.S. and other sanctions.When Trump left the deal, which Iran struck with six major powers, he reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran's economy.In response, Tehran has breached the deal's key limits, enriching uranium to 20% - above a 3.67% cap but below the 90% needed for weapons - expanding its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, and using advanced centrifuges for enrichment.Iran has told the U.N. nuclear watchdog it will scale back cooperation with it in a week, ratcheting up protests against U.S. sanctions still choking its economy.

The BSF team carefully searched the entire area and found the package which when opened revealed two jars containing a powdery and crystalline substance –weighing 4 lbs. They then contacted the forest officials who said that the substance looked like Cobra venom in the powdery and crystalline form. The forest officials also added that snake venom was a very expensive substance in the international market.The BSF personnel contacted the DFO at Balurghat to ascertain the veracity of the product. The DFO said that snake venom is normally priced at about $120 per gram if purchased officially, but in the grey market the seized amount would cost approximately ₹24 crore. The entire amount has been handed over to officials of the Forest department.The jars had markings which read “Cobra SP – Red Dragon –Made in France – Code No- 6097”. The venom had possibly been brought in from France into areas of Chittagong in Bangladesh from where it was taken to Rangpur in Bangladesh. It is from there that the smugglers attempted to push the product into India from where it may have been taken to China.Cobra venom is used in the preparation of chemicals needed for Chemotherapy of terminally ill Cancer patients. More information is awaited about the seized cache, the modus operandi by which it was being smuggled and the ultimate destination of the venom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-team-seize-smuggled-snake-venom-worth-rs-24-cr-near-indo-bangladesh-border-101613581902150.html

He was 73.Sharma was suffering from cancer and was ailing for some time."He died at 8.16 PM at Goa. His last rites would be done in Delhi on Friday, as the body is being brought from Goa," his son Samir told PTI.A close aide of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, Sharma was Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas from 1993 to 1996 in the Narasimha Rao government.Born on October 11, 1947 in Andhra Pradesh's Secunderabad, Sharma was a professional commercial pilot.A three-time Lok Sabha MP who represented Rae Bareli and Amethi constituencies, Sharma was a Rajya Sabha member for three terms representing the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.He first became a member of Rajya Sabha in June 1986 and was later elected to the Lok Sabha from Amethi in 1991 after the death of Rajiv Gandhi.He was later a member of Rajya Sabha from July 2004 to 2016. Sharma is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. Senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala expressed condolences to Sharma's family."Deeply saddened at the demise of Capt.

17-02-2021||India||Satellite images show China emptying military camps at border row with India||China has dismantled dozens of structures and moved vehicles to empty out entire camps along a disputed Himalayan border, where Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a face-off since last summer, satellite images released on Wednesday show.The nuclear-armed neighbours last week announced a plan to pull back troops, tanks and other equipment from the banks of Pangong Tso, a glacial lake in the Ladakh region, that became a flashpoint in the prolonged border dispute.Satellite imagery of some areas on the northern bank of Pangong Tso from Tuesday supplied by Maxar Technologies show that multiple Chinese military camps, which could be seen there in late January, have been removed."Similar action is happening from our side also," an Indian official in New Delhi, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.India's defence minister Rajnath Singh told parliament that both sides had agreed to pull back troops in "a phased, coordinated and verified manner" around Pangong Tso, after which military commanders would discuss ending the standoff in other parts of the Ladakh frontier.Tensions began rising along the high-altitude border in April, when India accused Chinese troops of intruding into its side of the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border. China denied the allegation, saying it was operating in its own area.But the confrontation spiralled in June when 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops were killed during hand-to-hand clashes in Ladakh's Galwan region - the first such casualties along the 3,500 km (2,200 mile) long border in decades.Despite several subsequent rounds of diplomatic and military talks, India and China had been unable to settle on an agreement until February, making the ongoing first phase of the withdrawal critical."What is happening now is that wherever troops, especially north and south of Pangong Tso, were in eyeball-to-eyeball contact, they have taken a step back to reduce tensions and pave way for further de-escalation," the Indian official said.Videos and images released by the Indian army earlier this week also showed Chinese troops dismantling bunkers and tents, and tanks, soldier and vehicles moving out as part of the disengagement process.But some experts have cautioned that current withdrawal is only the first step in a potentially long-drawn out process."It is still nowhere near a full disengagement or an agreement on what we should be doing," India's former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon told The Wire news outlet."We need much more than just disengagement. We need a return to the positions before April last year."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/satellite-images-show-china-emptying-military-camps-at-border-row-with-india-101613578913208.html
17-02-2021||India||Trinamool Congress expels district leader known to be close to Suvendu Adhikari||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Wednesday expelled Mosharaf Hossain, the sabhadhipati (president) of the Murshidabad Zilla Parishad (district council), on charges of anti-party activities.Hossain is among those leaders in Murshidabad who are known to be close to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former TMC minister Suvendu Adhikari. He was earlier in the Congress but switched sides a few years ago.“The TMC has done me a great favour. I will join the Congress-Left alliance since it is not possible for me to join the BJP. Adhikari, however, will remain my friend,” Hossain said in the evening.A leader close to him said he will join the Congress at a rally on February 19.Senior TMC leaders in Murshidabad and most of the Zilla Parishad members held a meeting in Berhampore town in the afternoon. The expulsion was announced by the party’s district president Abu Taher Khan.There has been tension between Hossain and senior district leaders for the last few months. He did not attend party meetings and even skipped chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s rally in Berhampore last week, saying his father was unwell.Khan said, “Hossain was ignoring the party. He took the lead role in organising a programme for Adhikari. He inaugurated several roads and bridges and held programmes where no TMC flag or photograph of Banerjee could be seen. Hossain displayed his own photos.”“He was trying to make several Zilla Parishad, Gram Panchayat and Panchayat Samiti members leave the ruling party,” said Khan.“A few days ago, we made him the vice-president of the TMC’s district unit but today we unanimously decided to expel him. We have approval of the state leadership,” Khan added.Hossain did not comment on the allegations brought against him.District Congress spokesperson Jayanta Das said, “There was a cold war between Khan and Hossain when both were in the Congress. It seems it has not ended.”“It is impossible to work in the TMC if one has a clean image. Our state president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has declared that all those who want to join our fight against the TMC and BJP are welcome. If Hossain wants to return to the Congress we will welcome him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-expels-district-leader-known-to-be-close-to-suvendu-adhikari-101613577785865.html

As the Jatha (caravan of pilgrims), which may have nearly 600 members, is scheduled to visit five Gurudwaras across Pakistan over a period of a week, we apprehend considerable threat to the safety of a large number of our citizens during this visit,” the home ministry letter said.A person familiar with the development acknowledged said the home ministry decision was unusual. Sikh Jathas have never been stopped from going to Pakistan in the past even when bilateral relations between two countries were at its worst, during the 26/11 Mumbai attacks or Pulwama attack. There may have been instances where individuals were stopped but Sikh Jathas were allowed to travel to Pakitan in November 2020 also.Wednesday's home ministry letter said its permission was needed "in view of the ongoing suspension of cross-border traffic due to Covid-19 pandemic"India had suspended travel to Pakistan in March 2020 in view of the coronavirus pandemic that infected more than 10 million people and led to 1,55,913 deaths.The home ministry letter added: “While the pandemic continues to persist, it is pertinent to note that Pakistan has so far recorded over half a million cases with over 10,000-plus deaths due to Covid. Considering the capacity of health infrastructure in Pakistan, it is not advisable for a large group of our citizens to visit Pakistan for a week during the pandemic”.There has been no reaction from the SGPC so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-won-t-allow-600-sikh-pilgrims-to-travel-to-pak-says-threat-to-their-life-101613577085714.html

One will have to first disclose their identity, religion, income everything before one enters into a marriage with any girl,” Sarma told journalists in Guwahati.In the backdrop of some states announcing laws on ‘love-jihad’, the minister, who holds finance, health, education and PWD portfolios in the Sarbananda Sonowal-government, had said in November last year that the state government was mulling bringing in a legislation that requires the bride and groom to disclose their religion, income etc.He had stated that the legislation was aimed at bringing in more transparency in a marriage and with the intention of empowering women. The legislation would require couples from same religion as well to disclose details about themselves and their families, Sarma had said.“We are also against the concept called land ‘jihad’. Many of our lands in lower and middle Assam including those belonging to our monasteries are being grabbed by certain elements. There will be something in our manifesto on this as well,” said Sarma.“We are against radicalism, fundamentalism and communalism.

But when the object was removed she recalled the incident, they said, adding, she is now relieved of her breathing problems and cough.She told doctors that she drank a lot of water to dislodge the object but was unaware that it got lodged in the bronchus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-in-kerala-remove-whistle-stuck-in-woman-s-respiratory-system-for-25-yrs-101613576612288.html

17-02-2021||India||PM Modi says middle class burdened due to previous govt's import dependence||On a day when petrol crossed the ₹100 mark, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the middle-class would not have been burdened if the previous governments had focussed on reducing India's energy import dependence.Without referring to the relentless increase in retail fuel prices, which are linked to international rates, he said India imported over 85% of its oil needs in the 2019-20 financial year and 53% of its gas requirement."Can a diverse and talented nation like ours be so energy import dependent?" he asked, addressing an online event to inaugurate oil and gas projects in poll-bound Tamil Nadu."I do not want to criticise anyone but I want to say (that) had we focused on this subject much earlier, our middle-class would not be burdened," he said.Price of petrol crossed the ₹100 per litre mark in Rajasthan after fuel rates were hiked for the ninth day in a row. Since India imports the majority of its oil needs, retail rates are benchmarked to international prices, which have spiralled in recent weeks.Opposition parties including Congress have criticised the price hikes, blaming it on the Modi government raising taxes to scoop out the benefit that arose from international oil rates plunging to a two-decade low in April/May last year. While global rates have rebounded with pick up in demand, the government has not restored the taxes, which are at a record high.Central and state taxes make up for 60% of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54% of diesel.The Prime Minister further said it was a collective duty to work towards clean and green sources of energy as well as energy independence."Our government is sensitive to the concerns of the middle class. That is why India is now increasing the focus on ethanol to help farmers and consumers," he said.Ethanol extracted from sugarcane is being doped in petrol to reduce the requirement of imports. Currently, 8.5% of petrol is ethanol and this proportion is targeted to be raised to 20% by 2025, helping cut imports as well as give farmers an alternate source of income.India, he said, is looking to cut energy import dependence as well as diversify its sources to reduce risks.The focus now is also towards using renewable sources of energy, which will by 2030 form 40% of energy generated in the country, he said, listing measures such as increased share of solar power, focus on public transport, switching to LED bulbs, scrappage policy for vehicles and use of solar pumps in irrigation."Today, India is increasing the share of energy from renewable sources. By 2030, 40% of all energy will be generated from green energy sources," he said.Modi further said India is looking to reduce energy import dependence through capacity building. "In 2019-20, we were fourth in the world in (oil) refining capacity. About 65.2 million tonnes of petroleum product have been exported. This number is expected to rise even further."Also, Indian firms have ventured overseas in the acquisition of oil and gas assets, which provide energy security."Today Indian oil and gas companies are present in 27 countries with an investment worth about ₹2.70 lakh crore," he said.Modi said the nation is looking to build a natural gas pipeline grid to boost usage of the environment-friendly fuel that would help cut carbon emissions."We have planned to spend ₹7.5 lakh crore in creating oil and gas infrastructure over five years," he said. "A strong emphasis has been laid on the expansion of city gas distribution network by covering 470 districts."City gas projects will provide clean cooking fuel to households in form of piped natural gas, alternate transport fuel as CNG to vehicles and feedstock and fuel to industries.The government is working towards raising the share of natural gas in the energy basket to 15% from the current 6.3% and is committed to bringing it under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime to eliminate cascading effect of multiple taxes, he added."We are trying to eliminate the cascading effect of different taxes on natural gas across different states," he said adding this would help bring down the cost of gas."We are eager to increase the share of natural gas in energy basket from 6.3% currently to 15%... We are committed to bringing natural gas under the GST regime," he said.When the GST in 2017 subsumed over a dozen central and states taxes, five products -- crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and jet fuel (ATF) -- were kept out of it for the time being.This has meant that taxes paid on inputs cannot be offset by taxes on the final product."Since 2014, we have brought in various reforms across the oil and gas sector, covering exploration and production, natural gas marketing and distribution. We are working on attracting domestic and international investment through investor-friendly measures," Modi said. "I want to tell the world come invest in India's energy."The Prime Minister dedicated to the nation the Ramanathapuram-Thoothukudi natural gas pipeline and ₹500 crore gasoline desulphurisation unit at Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited, Manali. He also laid the foundation stone of a ₹31,500 crore Cauvery Basin Refinery at Nagapattinam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-middle-class-burdened-due-to-previous-govt-s-import-dependence-101613575012134.html

17-02-2021||India||In a first, Centre approves financial powers for top military officers||The Cabinet on Wednesday approved enhanced financial powers of up to ₹200 crore for senior military officers to make capital procurement, a government statement said. The deputy chief of army staff (capability development and sustenance) – a post created last December – is among the officers who have been granted enhanced financial powers.This is the first time regular financial powers (as opposed to special financial powers) have devolved below the vice chief level for specified items of capital nature to meet emerging security challenges, people familiar with the matter said. The enhanced powers come in the backdrop of challenges along the borders with China and Pakistan.The Cabinet approved financial powers to the tune of ₹200 crore for one category of officers and ₹100 crore for the second category that consists of military officers of the rank of commanders-in-chief (senior three-star officers heading different commands).Among the officers who have been given authority to spend ₹200 crore are the navy’s chief of material, the air force’s chief of maintenance, the deputy chief of Integrated Defence Staff and the coast guard’s additional director general, the statement said.“This delegation of powers within service headquarters and up to command level for items of capital nature such as overhauls, refits and upgrades will enhance the utility of existing assets and will facilitate faster processing and implementation of projects for modernisation of the armed forces to meet security challenges,” the statement said.Delegation of financial powers is a welcome step as it will provide impetus to capability development, shorten procurement cycles and enhance operational readiness, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.The Cabinet has also approved enhanced financial powers in the ‘Make-I category’ under which government funding of up to 70% of the prototype development cost is available for design and development of equipment, systems and platform upgrades.“The Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee or CISC, vice chiefs of the army, navy and air force, and Director General, Coast Guard have now been given powers to sanction government support up to ₹50 crore towards cost of prototype development,” the statement said.Financial powers have also been increased for other competent authorities under ‘Make-I’, in line with the government’s plan to boost the self-reliant India campaign to build a robust defence industrial ecosystem, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-centre-approves-financial-powers-for-top-military-officers-101613573852586.html
17-02-2021||India||‘Karnataka govt, police not informed’: Cong MP on Disha Ravi's arrest||Congress MP Syed Naseer Hussain alleged on Wednesday that the Karnataka government and the state police were not informed about climate activist Disha Ravi’s arrest. Hussain added that Ravi’s arrest was similar to the ones made in Punjab over the ongoing protests against the Centre’s three new farm laws and earlier, during the stir against the contentious Citizenship Act.“Disha Ravi’s arrest was made without informing the Karnataka police & state govt. These kinds of arrests have also been done in CAA-NRC cases, in Punjab who have been agitating against farm laws,” Hussain was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.In the last 6 yrs, 140 sedition cases registered against Indian citizens but the conviction rate has been around 1%. They just want to see that nobody speaks or agitate against govt & create some sort of fearmongering among the common citizens: Syed Naseer Hussain, Rajya Sabha MP pic.twitter.com/AwAc2PxlDMThe Rajya Sabha MP further pointed out that 140 cases had been registered against Indian citizens in the past six years but the conviction rate was close to only 1%. Sharpening his attack, Hussain said that the Centre just wanted to ensure that nobody speaks or protests against it. “They just want to see that nobody speaks or agitates against govt and create some sort of fearmongering among the common citizens,” he told ANI.Hussain is the latest Opposition leader to condemn Ravi’s arrest. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has also targeted the Centre over the issue, accusing the government of ‘destroying the nation’s character and destiny by frightening people and not allowing them to talk.’ Addressing college students in Puducherry, Gandhi urged youngsters to not allow anyone to frighten them into silence.Bengaluru-based Disha Ravi was arrested by the Delhi Police on February 13 in connection with the toolkit tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg over the ongoing farmers’ protest in India. She is currently in a five-day judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-police-not-informed-cong-mp-on-disha-ravi-s-arrest-101613572601614.html
17-02-2021||India||Ahead of kisan mahapanchayat in Malwa region, MP issues prohibitory orders||The Indore district administration in Madhya Pradesh has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC preventing the assembly of four or more people for the next two months in wake of announcement of kisan mahapanchayats (farmers’ meetings) in the Malwa region, the richest agrarian belt of the state.Farmers’ unions protesting three recent farm laws have been holding kisan mahapanchayats in several states since January 27 when the Uttar Pradesh police tried to evict farmer leader Rakesh Takait from the UP-Delhi border at Gazipur.The farmers have held their meetings in several places including Meerut, Saharanpur, Muzzafarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Jind and Ambala in Haryana and Bharatpur, Sikar and Dausa in Rajasthan. A large farmers’ meet has been planned in Malwa in Madhya Pradesh in the next few days.On Wednesday, the Indore district administration banned public rallies, protests, dharnas and public meetings unless permitted by the district collector till April 15. Even social, political and religious organisation will not be allowed to advertise and publicise any programme without permission, the administration said in its order.“There will be a ban on posters, hoardings, banners, flags and other publicity materials related to religion, persons, caste and community. Nobody can write slogans and graffiti on a wall of government and private building without permission. There will be a ban on using public announcement system. In case of violation of the order, action will be taken under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC,” said the order.The prohibitory order in Indore district came into force on Wednesday after the first kisan mahapanchayat in Madhya Pradesh was held in Khargone district on Monday. As many 500 farmers attended the Mahapanchayat.Farmers panchayats in Chambal, Bundelkhand, Central and Naramadpuram region were not very impressive and in terms of numbers.Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Mahasangh, national president Shivkumar Sharma ‘Kakkaji’ said the prohibitory order will not stop the farmers from attending the mahapanchayats.“The governments of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states are trying to suppress the farmers’ agitation. After Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has started targeting the protests in Madhya Pradesh. The farmers of Malwa region have started coming out of their houses and are planning to hold mahapanchayat in Indore. The order won’t stop the farmers.”Kisan Sangh Sanyukt Morcha MP convener Badal Saroj said, “In Chambal and Gwalior division, the administration and police are not even allowing us to hold small meetings. The state government’s authoritarian behavior will not work. Now, farmers have started understanding that the Centre’s new farm laws are not for them but in favour of industrialists.”The opposition Congress also attacked the state government for imposing prohibitory orders.“The government wants to suppress the voice of Congress and farmers against the injustice of BJP-led state and Central government. MP Congress Committee is holding many protests across the state including in Indore against the rise in prices of fuel and LPG. We are going to organize a programme on February 21 in Indore and this order will not stop us from becoming a voice of farmers and common people,” MP Congress general secretary Rakesh Yadav said.Former Madhya Pradesh advocate general Anand Mohan Mathur said, “The misuse of section 144 has been increased in the past 5-6 years in Indore. The prohibitory orders are being imposed without any reason to suppress protests.”But Indore’s additional district magistrate (ADM) Himanshu Chandra said it was only a “common prohibitory order”."This is a common prohibitory order to maintain law and order in the district. It has nothing to do with farmers protest and any other protest,” he said.The ruling BJP tried to play down the prohibitory order and accused the Congress of politicising the matter.BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “The district administration takes this decision to maintain peace in the district. If someone wants to protest or hold a rally, they can do so by taking permission. Some leaders failed to get the support of farmers in MP so they are targeting the state for that. Similarly, the Congress leaders are unnecessarily trying to politicize the matter.”(With inputs from Neha Jain in Indore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-kisan-mahapanchayat-in-malwa-region-mp-issues-prohibitory-orders-101613572109859.html
17-02-2021||India||IAF proposes closure of Jammu airport for civilian traffic next month||The Indian Air Force (IAF) has proposed closure of the Jammu airport for civilian traffic for 15 days next month for runway resurfacing work , drawing a strong resentment from the Jammu and Kashmir administration which has sought the defence ministry's intervention into the matter, officials said on Wednesday.Nearly two dozen flights operate to and from the Jammu airport, and in view of the development, all the companies operating their flights in the sector have stopped booking for the period.Quoting a communication addressed to the Jammu airport director, the officials said Air Force Station, Jammu wants complete closure of the runway for 15 days towards laying of final two top DAC-II layers on the runway surface from March 6 to 20, which has been approved by Air Headquarters.The officials said Jammu and Kashmir Chief Secretary B V R Subrahmanyam lodged his protest with the Civil Aviation Ministry against such a move and requested intervention of the defence ministry into the matter to ensure that the resurfacing is carried out in such a manner that civilian air traffic is not affected during the day time."Complete closure of the airport for 15 days would create huge administrative issues for the government of Jammu and Kashmir," Subrahmanyam had written in his letter to Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola.The officials said the chief secretary highlighted that the Jammu airport, being the only civil airport in the division, caters to the requirement of civilian air traffic for the entire province and serves as the only connecting airport for Mata Vaishno Devi shrine."In the eventuality of the closure for 15 days, air traffic would have to be diverted to the nearest civil airport in Punjab, which would result in various logistical issues," Subrahmanyam said.He added that air connectivity to Kashmir also gets disturbed and even disconnected in extreme weather conditions and in such cases, the air traffic at Jammu increases manifold as Kashmir-bound passengers also prefer disembarking at the Jammu airport.The chief secretary further said tourist activities have only recently picked up in the union territory after easing of restrictions imposed on account of the COVID-19 pandemic."In the given scenario, it would be administratively and operationally prudent to explore the possibility of carrying out the resurfacing work at night time and simultaneously utilising ramp facilities for aircraft operations at the said runway, a practice which is generally adopted by the AAI (Airport Authority of India) for all resurfacing work," he said.Responding to the letter of the chief secretary, Kharola took the matter with his counterpart in the defence ministry, Ajay Kumar, and requested his intervention into the matter, citing inconvenience to passengers and tourists and likely fallout on the economy, the officials said.They said the AAI has already requested IAF Headquarters to plan and execute the proposed work of runway surfacing during night time so that civil aircraft operations are not hampered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-proposes-closure-of-jammu-airport-for-civilian-traffic-next-month-101613570916165.html

A litre of diesel was selling at ₹86.98On Tuesday, one litre of petrol was priced at Rs. 95.75 in the city whereas one litre of diesel was available at ₹86.72. On Monday, one litre of petrol was available at ₹95.46 and one litre of diesel was priced at ₹86.34 in the city.The Petrol Dealers’ Association, however, has stated that the consumption of petrol and diesel in the city has not decreased following the price hike in past few days.“As local train services are not fully operational and citizens continue to use their personal vehicle, the general trend is that there has been a constant steady increase in the consumption of petrol and diesel. The sales have not reached the level of pre coronavirus yet.” said M Venkatrao, president, Petrol Dealers’ Association.Residents say they have no option but to buy petrol at a higher rate. “We are forced to commute in this manner. Local train services are not available which is why people are travelling by their personal vehicle. The state government should reduce the value added tax on fuel products,” said Aadi Jain, a Byculla resident.Citizens have urged the central government to intervene immediately to reduce fuel prices. “The central government can reduce the fuel prices. They need to intervene immediately to reduce petroleum cost,” said Ajeet Verma, a Matunga resident.In Delhi, petrol is selling at ₹89.29 per litre today, while diesel is priced at 79.95 per litre.In Rajasthan's Ganganagar, the price of petrol crossed ₹100 per litre mark today. It touched ₹100.33 per litre. It was ₹99.81 per litre on Monday. In Jaipur, the price of petrol was ₹95.99. On February 14, the price of premium petrol reached ₹102.07 in Ganganagar.Central and state taxes make up for over 61 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and about 56 per cent of diesel.Minister of petroleum and natural gas and steel Dharmedra Pradhan had said last week that an increased investment in development of basic infrastructure, among other factors, had resulted in frequent hike in fuel prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-sells-at-rs-96-in-mumbai-touches-new-all-time-high-101613571266224.html

Last month, the Sri Lankan government scrapped the trilateral deal with India and Japan to develop the Colombo Port’s Eastern Container Terminal (ECT).Gammanpila told a gathering at the Colombo north suburb of Kolonnawa that talks with the Indian High Commissioner in Colombo on this issue concluded last Sunday."I am happy to state that the Indian High Commissioner was very flexible at the talks. He ignored the conditions mentioned in the agreement signed in 2017 in order to be helpful to us," Gammanpila said, referring to his discussions with High Commissioner Gopal Baglay."He was flexible to agree to all our conditions. A majority of ships which sail around Trincomalee are from India. So we need India's cooperation to win their market," he said."I am proud to announce that the oil tanks the use of which had been denied to us since 2003 will be soon ours," Gammanpila said on the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm.The Trincomalee Harbour is one of the deepest natural harbours in the world. It was developed by the British during World War II.These tanks will have the capacity to offer bunkering facilities to the ships sailing in close proximity to Trincomalee, Daily Mirror newspaper reported on Wednesday."After World War II, these tanks were abandoned without being used. In 2003, the tanks were leased to the Indian Oil Company. But we are happy to say that Sri Lanka will soon have those tanks back," the minister said.Sri Lanka in 2003 had leased out 99 oil tanks to the IOC for 30 years for an annual payment of $100,000.The IOC was also given one third share of the Sri Lankan government entity, Petroleum Stirage Limited. However, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions had been pressing for the takeover of the tanks.Initially, the CPC wanted to develop 25 of the tanks by investing $25-30 million. The CPC maintains that it will allow them to strengthen their oil storage and distribution in the north and eastern provinces while allowing stock maintenance to suffice 2-3 months.Last month, the Mahinda Rajapaksa government said it has decided to run the Colombo Port’s Eastern Container Terminal as a fully-owned operation of the State-run ports authority.India, Japan and Sri Lanka had inked an agreement in 2019 on development of the terminal project.The Colombo port trade unions opposed the proposal of investors from India and Japan buying 49% stake in the ECT. They demanded the ECT to remain 100% owned by the SLPA as opposed to the 51%.India expressed regret over the cancellation of the deal and asked Sri Lanka to abide by its commitment to the trilateral deal with it and Japan.Japan has also conveyed its unhappiness with the Sri Lankan government over the cancellation of the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sri-lanka-to-re-acquire-99-oil-tanks-leased-to-indian-oil-corporation-minister-101613570180762.html

Speaking about the District Development Council (DDC) polls held last year, Srinagar Municipal Corporation Mayor Junaid Mattu said that all the agreed that there were free and fair elections, ANI reported. "Free and fair elections are the biggest attestation to the empowerment of democracy," the news agency reported Mattu as saying.The group of envoys including those from several Europe Union countries are in the union territory to take first-hand account of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and government's efforts to restore normalcy.Srinagar mayor also said that the visiting dignitaries were apprised of the "landmark elections of DDC and urban local bodies." "They wanted to know the ground realities," he also said. Elected representatives from all political opinions and parties participated in the discussion which was held at the Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre (SKICC) on the banks of the Dal Lake."The key issue discussed was decentralisation of power and planning, empowerment of the grassroots representatives," the Mattu also said. "I believe most important thing happening now is the empowerment of local elected representatives at the grassroots level," he added.The envoys which has representation from four Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) -- Malaysia, Bangladesh, Senegal and Tajikistan -- were taken to Magam in central Kashmir amid heightened security arrangements in the city and elsewhere in the Valley, officials said here.Other envoys included in this delegation were from Brazil, Italy, Finland, Cuba, Chile, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Sweden, Kyrgyzstan, Ireland, Ghana, Estonia, Bolivia, Malawi, Eritrea and Ivory Coast.Speaking after the discussion, Juan José Cortez Rojas, Charge d Affaires, Embassy of Bolivia in Delhi, lauded the Centre and said, "What we are realising is that democracy took place here. It is impressive." He also said that people here are happy with the political decisions taken by the central government.This is the third delegation that has arrived in Jammu and Kashmir since the government abrogated the erstwhile state's special status on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated it into two union territories by carving out Ladakh. The first two groups visited Jammu and Kashmir in January and February 2020.On the second day of their visit on Thursday, the diplomats will travel to Jammu region for more meetings and interactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/impressive-foreign-envoys-after-visiting-jammu-and-kashmir-101613568748986.html
17-02-2021||India||Andhra assembly to adopt resolution against privatisation of Vizag steel plant||Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday announced that the state assembly would adopt a resolution soon requesting the Centre to drop its proposal to privatise the prestigious Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), better known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.“We shall make all out efforts to ensure that the Vizag steel plant, which is a sentiment of the people of Andhra Pradesh, will not be sold out to private parties under any circumstances. I am confident that the Centre will change its stand in this regard,” Jagan said.The chief minister held an hour-long meeting with the representatives of various trade unions belonging to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant in the wake of intensifying agitation of the workers against privatisation of the plant.He said he had suggested to the Centre to restore the leases of the RINL in the iron ore mines in Odisha as a strategy to prevent proposed privatisation of the steel plant.The chief minister said the RINL was suffering losses due to lack of captive mines and it was forced to spend an additional amount of ₹4,000 per tonne of iron ore. “I wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting that a captive iron ore mine in the neighbouring Odisha state be allocated to the RINL,” he said.He pointed out that the RINL had earlier been given 51 per cent of share in five iron ore mines Odisha, the remaining 49 per cent stake belonging to the Central government, LIC and Odisha Mineral Development Corporation.“These mines have high quality iron ore to the extent of 200 million tonne, which is enough for the RINL for the coming several years. However, the lease agreement of these mines had lapsed long ago. If this agreement is revived and the stakes of RINL is restored, the steel plant will be back into profits,” Jagan said.He further said the RINL had an accumulated debt of ₹22,000 crore, including long-term loans worth ₹12,000 crore and another ₹11,000 crore loans obtained from banks towards working capital. Some banks had given loans at a high interest rate of 14 per cent.The chief minister said he had suggested conversion of high-interest long-term loans into equity so as to reduce the interest burden. “It will immediately help the RINL overcome the burden of repayment of around ₹3,000 crore. This will bring the company into profits. The RINL can come out with a public issue and get the shares listed in the stock exchange, so that the banks could use the exit options whenever they want,” he said.The chief minister also suggested another solution to bail out the RINL from losses. “The steel plant has around 20,000 acres of land, of which 7,000 acres are still not in use. The state government will give approval to the steel plant for the land use conversion, since it is under the purview of the state. The RINL management can auction these vacant lands and plough the money that is accrued back into the steel plant. It will increase the cash reserves of the steel plant,” he said.The chief minister requested that the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, too, support these suggestions and take them up with the Centre to drop the privatisation plan. “We shall also make our own efforts in this direction,” he said.Jagan, however, appealed to the workers of the steel plant not to strike work but operate t with more efficiency. “Under any circumstances, we shall not create an impression that the plant was running in losses due to lack of production,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-assembly-to-adopt-resolution-against-privatisation-of-vizag-steel-plant-101613568374945.html
17-02-2021||India||Lawyer couple hacked to death. Had sought police protection months ago||An advocate couple, who sought protection alleging threatening calls from the police, was murdered by unknown miscreants in Telangana’s Peddapalli district on Wednesday afternoon, the police said.The incident happened at around 3 pm in front of a petrol bunk at Kalvacharla village of Ramagiri block, when the couple – Gattu Vaman Rao (53) and P V Nagamani (50) – was returning from Manthani town after arguing a case in the local court. They were practising lawyers at the Telangana High Court in Hyderabad.Ramagundam commissioner of police V Satyanarayana said the miscreants waylaid the couple and hacked them to death.“While Rao got down from the vehicle and collapsed on the road, Nagamani collapsed in her seat. Both breathed their last while being shifted to Peddapalli government hospital in an ambulance,” the SP said.The driver of the car, who was an eyewitness to the gory murder, is being questioned by the police.A video clip of Vamana Rao, lying on the road profusely bleeding with multiple stab injuries, telling the onlookers that someone named Kunta Srinu from Gunjamadugu village had attacked him and his wife went viral on social media.The SP, too, said the advocate had named Kunta Srinu, a local Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader, before succumbing to injuries. “We understand Vaman Rao had a dispute with Kunta Srinu over a temple issue. Srinu is absconding. We have formed six special teams of police to launch a manhunt for the killers. We shall probe the case irrespective of their stature and political links,” he said.The couple had been arguing cases against local political leaders in Peddapalli district, apart from the infamous case of custodial death of a Dalit Seelam Rangaiah in Manthani police station in May 2020.In November last, the couple approached the high court seeking protection as they were getting threatening calls from the police. On February 8 this year, the state high court issued a direction to director general of police M Mahender Reddy to ensure that the advocate couple was not harassed by the police.Vaman Rao’s brother Indrasekhar told reporters that he was suspecting the hand of Kunta Srinivas, who was allegedly involved in land encroachments, against which his brother was fighting in the courts.Congress MLA from Manthani D Sridhar Babu demanded a CBI investigation into the killing of Vaman Rao and his wife Nagamani, as the couple was facing threat from the police in the lock-up death case.Telangana bar council strongly condemned the murder of Vaman Rao and Nagamani. “We demand that the police act swiftly and arrest the culprits. We also demand security for the advocates who are arguing sensitive cases,” G Jitender Reddy, bar council member, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyer-couple-hacked-to-death-had-sought-police-protection-few-months-ago-101613567875487.html
17-02-2021||India||'I might get arrested for saying this...': Rahul Gandhi on Disha Ravi's arrest||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said people were being arrested in the country "for what they think". Speaking at an interaction with students of Bharathidasan Government College for Women in Puducherry, Gandhi reacted to climate activist Disha Ravi's arrest and said that the nation's character was being destroyed as people were not being allowed to talk."Maybe I'll get arrested for saying this... if you're shutting up the nation and frightening people and not allowing them to talk, you're destroying the nation's character," he said.The 22-year-old Ravi was arrested by the cyber crime unit of Delhi Police for allegedly sharing on social media a toolkit related to the farmers’ protests against the Centre’s contentious agricultural laws. According to the police, it was Ravi who had shared the toolkit document with Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg. She was booked for sedition, promoting enmity and criminal conspiracy, among other offences and was produced at a city court on Sunday, after which she was sent to five days in police custody.“Disha Ravi, arrested by CyPAD Delhi Police, is an Editor of the Toolkit Google Doc & key conspirator in document’s formulation & dissemination. She started WhatsApp Group & collaborated to make the Toolkit doc. She worked closely with them to draft the Doc,” a tweet by Delhi police read. “In this process, they all collaborated with the pro-Khalistani Poetic Justice Foundation to spread disaffection against the Indian State. She was the one who shared the Toolkit Doc with Greta Thunberg,” another tweet read.The police further claimed that the call was to wage an economic, social, cultural and regional war against India. Thunberg, who had shared the toolkit on Twitter, later deleted the original tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-might-get-arrested-for-saying-this-rahul-gandhi-on-disha-ravi-s-arrest-101613567587520.html
17-02-2021||India||All you need to know about farmers' 'Rail Roko' call||Protesting farmers’ have called for a four-hour long 'Rail Roko andolan' (rail blockade) across the country from 12 noon to 4pm on Thursday. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a representative body of protesting farmers, announced the rail blockade last week, in a bid to amplify the voices of agitating farmers.Here’s all you need to know about tomorrow’s 'Rail Roko' protest:The movement is being held all over the country but the Railway Protection Force (RPF) has tightened security in four key states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The RPF has deployed 20 additional companies across these states. “Railways has appealed for peace. We will have additional security focus on Punjab, Haryana, UP and Bengal. 20 additional companies of RPF have been deployed. We appeal to everyone to maintain peace calling for peaceful protests so as not to inconvenience passengers,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) is also planning to hold a Kisan Mahapanchayat in poll-bound West Bengal. BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni told PTI that farmer unions will hold meetings in poll-bound West Bengal and will be asking people in Bengal not to vote for those who are "snatching our livelihood".This is not the first railway blockade launched by farmers; last year in September, before farmers set off for Delhi, they held a state-wide rail blockades in Punjab, resulting in total suspension of train services in the state for nearly two months. Many passenger trains were later re-routed as the state and central government sparred over allowing passenger trains to traverse through the state.The railway ministry informed Parliament during last week’s budget session that the railways suffered a loss of ₹1,462.45 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 due to “various agitations/strikes including dharnas at platforms and near tracks”.Along with 'Rail Roko', Mahapanchayats are being organised all over the country. Both BKU and SKM have made it clear that farmers will not stop protesting until the three contentious farm laws are repealed by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-farmers-rail-roko-call-101613567304355.html
17-02-2021||India||Experts say India's Covid-19 'human barricade' to keep cases under control||With falling rates of Covid-19 infection in India and surveys suggesting nearly 300 million people may already have antibodies, some experts believe the worst of the disease has passed, despite a recent uptick in two hard-hit states."There is a human barricade for the virus," said Bhramar Mukherjee, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, who with a team of researchers, has been modeling the trajectory of the outbreak in India."By the end of March, we should see a very slow, steady decline (in cases)," she added.Cases that were rising by nearly 100,000 a day in September are now growing at just 10,000 a day. And India's official number of total infections, which was projected to surpass that of the United States in late 2020, now stands at 11 million, well behind the US tally of about 28 million.Total deaths so far in India are just under 156,000, the world's fourth highest number of fatalities."India suffered through a lot and because it suffered through a lot, it's reached the other shore now," said Ramanan Laxminarayan, an epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, a research firm based in Washington, DC. and New Delhi. "I don't see the prospect of a second wave in India. If it does happen, it will likely be a modest one."A recent government serological survey indicated 21.5% of Indians were likely infected by Covid-19, giving them a degree of immunity, while antibody tests on more than 700,000 people by a diagnostic company showed that 55% of Indians may have already been infected.To be sure, not all epidemiologists agree India is out of the woods. The country is currently battling a surge in cases in two states - Maharashtra and Kerala, which account for a combined 70% of nationwide active cases.Even those predicting further declines in cases, like Mukherjee, warn that India will need to continue Covid-19 containment measures and surveillance of new variants, besides aggressively vaccinating its people.More socializing, coupled with a recent restart of local trains in the financial hub of Mumbai, could be causing the spike in Maharashtra, say experts, while a restart of schools in Kerala is being blamed for the surge there. New clusters have also been identified in the tech hub of Bengaluru."Even though there are advisories against large gatherings, people have started to take it easy," said Pradeep Awate, a senior health official in Maharashtra.Still, Mukherjee notes the "percentage of cases that require hospitalizations in Kerala and Maharashtra has gone down."VaccinationThe reason why millions of Indians are asymptomatic — as survey numbers suggest — has flummoxed experts.Theories range from India's early lockdown implementation to its youthful population and an intrinsic immunity among Indians. Some say an open-air lifestyle in villages could have prevented a surge in rural India, where two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live.But epidemiologists say finding the true reason will require research that could take years.While experts agree many Covid-19 cases and deaths may be under-reported in India, available indicators like hospital-bed utilization rates point to a falling curve.Epidemiologists say a key factor would be how aggressively India moves on its vaccination drive."If vaccines are given in large numbers right away, we're going to be in a very good position," said Mukherjee. "By the time infection-induced immunity wanes, people will get vaccine-induced immunity."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-say-india-s-covid-19-human-barricade-to-keep-cases-under-control-101613567028418.html
17-02-2021||India||No data Indian vaccines' efficacy against SA, Brazilian variants: Scientists||Preliminary research shows the two vaccines against Covid-19 approved in India are effective against the UK variant of the novel coronavirus but there is no data on their efficacy against the South African and Brazilian mutants detected in the country.On Tuesday, the Health ministry said four people were detected with the South Africa variant of SARS-CoV-2 and one tested positive for the Brazil variant, a first for India, prompting scientists to stress the need for more data and studies so the country’s vaccine programme can be tailored to evolving exigencies.The number of people who have tested positive for the UK variant in the country has climbed to 187, officials added.The vaccines currently approved for emergency use in India are Covishield, from the Oxford-AstraZeneca stable manufactured by Pune’s Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).Answering the question uppermost in many minds, researcher Deepak Sehgal said it is difficult to say how effective the two will be against the new emerging variants, particularly the South African and Brazilian ones, unless scientists have studied them properly.“Having said that, among the two vaccines currently in India, Covaxin may do better against the new mutants because it generates protection against the whole virus. The Covishield vaccine is targeted at only one protein of the virus,” Sehgal, head of the department of Life Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, Uttar Pradesh, told PTI.Covaxin, he explained, can produce antibodies against many epitopes, or many regions of the complete virus, while Covishield produces antibodies against only a specific region of the virus.“So even if there is a mutation in one region, there are antibodies being produced against other regions of the virus which will be effective in case of Covaxin,” he added.Covaxin is an "inactivated" vaccine developed by chemically treating novel coronavirus samples to make them incapable of reproduction. This process leaves the viral proteins, including the spike protein of the coronavirus which it uses to enter the human cells, intact.Covishield contains an engineered version of adenoviruses that infect chimpanzees to carry the gene responsible for the spike protein of the novel coronavirus.Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause mild cold or flu-like illnesses.Both the vaccines claim to have some efficacy against the UK variant.According to a yet-to-be published study on 26 participants, Covaxin was found to be effective against the UK variant, Bharat Biotech said in late January.Similarly, a study by Oxford University found that the ChAdOx1-nCoV19 vaccine, known as Covishield in India, was effective in tackling the UK variant.Immunologist Vineeta Bal noted that the UK variant had only one mutation that mattered and hence these results were not surprising.“While Bharat Biotech results were on a small number of samples to check inhibition against UK virus in the present evolving situation, this can be taken as adequate preliminary data,” Bal, from Pune’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), said.However, both the South African and Brazilian variants have many more mutations and hence significant decrease in efficacy may be seen, she said.“We do not have an answer for the efficacy against the new variants yet. I am sure efforts are on to test sera (blood) from vaccinated individuals for their ability to block the growth of new variants in the tissue culture system,” Bal told PTI.“For that the variant virus has to be available and also the testing facility. NIV, for example, has competence to do it and I am sure they are attempting to test,” she said, adding that no results are available in the public domain yet.Globally, 10 COVID-19 vaccines have been either approved by several countries or are under limited emergency use.New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the one that started the pandemic.UK government scientific advisers say the COVID-19 variant now predominant in the country may be 30-70 per cent more "deadly" than previous variants, underscoring concerns about how mutations may change the characteristics of the disease.A recent study suggests the vaccine co-developed by the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the German biotechnology company BioNTech can neutralise variants of the novel coronavirus that were first reported in the UK and South Africa.The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, noted that the vaccine is effective against coronavirus variants carrying the N501Y and E484K mutations.In January, US biotechnology firm Moderna said lab studies showed its COVID-19 vaccine would remain protective against variants of the coronavirus first identified in the UK and South Africa.However, out of caution, the company will test adding a second booster of its vaccine -- to make three shots in total -- and has begun preclinical studies on a booster specifically for the South African variant.In the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the messenger RNA -- or mRNA -- acts as a blueprint for the production of the coronavirus spike protein and is encapsulated by lipid molecules and delivered into human cells.mRNAs contain a blueprint for producing proteins in cellsBased on the reports rather than solid published data, it appears that rapid spread of these emerging variants would pose some risk to individuals who have recovered from earlier infection as well as those already vaccinated, Bal said.“In India we do not know how effectively testing, screening and quarantine is implemented for contacts and cases.“Depending upon that, spread can be curtailed with varying efficiency and hopefully serious spread will not happen and another round of lockdown will not be needed,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-data-indian-vaccines-efficacy-against-sa-brazilian-variants-scientists-101613566028358.html

The SKM is an umbrella body of farmers’ unions spearheading the agitation and holding talks with the Centre.2. The blockade will be the third major demonstration by the farmers as part of their agitation. Besides the January 26 tractor march, they held a nationwide ‘chakka jam’ on February 6.3. In view of the impending blockade, several trains have been diverted or cancelled in Punjab. Farmers in the state had blocked railway tracks last September, days after the laws were passed. Two months later, the protesters shifted their agitation to Delhi.Also Read | Railways cancels, diverts trains in Punjab amid rail roko call by farmer unions4. 20 additional companies of the Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) have been deployed across the country, news agency PTI reported. The focus is on Punjab and Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Majority of protesters are from Punjab and Haryana.5. In Punjab, the ruling Congress, which has wholeheartedly backed the agitation, registered a comprehensive win in state local body elections, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in power at the Centre, was wiped out.Also Read | Congress sweeps Punjab local body polls, wins 7 out of 8 municipal corporations6.

17-02-2021||India||'Don't have anger towards anybody': Rahul Gandhi on father Rajiv Gandhi's killers||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that he still carries his father Rajiv Gandhi inside him. Interacting with a group of students in Puducherry, Gandhi said that violence cannot take anything from you.The response came after a student asked Gandhi how he feels about LTTE members who assassinated Rajiv Gandhi."I don’t have anger towards anybody. Of course, I lost my father and for me it was a difficult time. It's like someone has cut your heart out. I felt tremendous pain. But I don’t feel angry. I don’t feel any hatred. I forgive," the former Congress president said at the Bharathidasan College for Women."I still carry my father with me. Understand something - violence cannot take away anything from you. It doesn't have that power. You can give up something but violence cannot take anything from you. My father is alive. A lot of things you have heard today, they came to me from my father. So my father is talking through me. So it’s not that my father is not here today," Gandhi added.Rajiv Gandhi took over the charge of the Congress in 1984 following the assassination of his mother and then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He became India’s youngest Prime Minister at the age of 40.Rajiv Gandhi served as the sixth PM of India. He was assassinated during an election rally in Tamil Nadu by a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suicide bomber in 1991.The suicide attack was carried out by Dhanu at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on the fateful night of May 21, 1991 killing Rajiv Gandhi and 15 others on the spot. Dhanu perished in the bomb attack.During the course of investigations, pictures clicked by S Haribabu, an LTTE photographer who was also killed in the blast, exposed the role of Nalini Srihatan - a key team member in the LTTE plot to assassinate Gandhi - and others.Sriharan, along with six other people - her husband V Sriharan, Perarivalan, Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran - were convicted in the case. They have been in prison for close to three decades.Though most parties supported the release of seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) had opposed it.Rahul Gandhi is in Puducherry amid a crisis where Congress party's government has come in minority. He earlier interacted with the fishermen community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-have-anger-towards-anybody-rahul-gandhi-on-father-s-killers-101613564025974.html

Local priests, traders are quite concerned and unhappy with the government attitude towards Kumbh,” said Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha. However, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), the apex body of all the thirteen akhadas, is divided over this move with both president and general secretary making contradictory statements. ABAP president Mahant Narendra Giri said he has decided to raise the issue during a February 24-25 meeting of the parishad’s executive committee.

Later, director general of police Ashok Kumar remarked that a fair duration will be of 48 days. Now, again the state chief secretary has stated the fair will be further shortened to just a month. We will discuss this matter in Akhada Parishad meeting and then decide whether it is feasible or not,” he said. Another section of saints, led by Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri, said in view of the new strain variants of England,Brazil, South Africa which are more transmissible, we need to adhere to government’s guidelines. “We need to look at the larger picture. A shorter and safer Kumbh is better than a grand yet unsafe one,” said Mahant Hari Giri. District Trader Association president Sunil Shetty has urged the state government to organise Mahakumbh along the lines of Magh Mela in Prayagraj. BJP ward councillor Anil Mishra questioned the state government and Kumbh Mela administration’s motive, saying why works worth crores of rupees are still being done for Kumbh when it will be held for only 30 days. “It is a wastage of money when pilgrims will be arriving in fewer numbers owing to strict guidelines,” he said. Meanwhile, Hindu Jagran Manch state president Krishan Singh Bora has announced a statewide protest on February 26 against Kumbh restrictions and its SOP. Saints are also concerned about March 11 Maha Shivratri festive bath which is a Shahi Snaan. Swami Rishishwaranand of Chetan Jyoti ashram pointed out that if Kumbh fair is notified from April 1 to April 30, then will Maha Shivratri festive bath not officially be a Shahi Snaan (Royal Bath)?. He said there are four Shahi Snaans falling in the March-April period, which are highly regarded, and most devotees arrive for these festive baths. The government should also clarify regarding this, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priests-against-uttarakhand-govt-proposal-to-restrict-mahakumbh-to-a-month-101613563083622.html

He added a team of scientists from the country’s top institutions will look into the first aspect and agencies such as National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force into the second one.“The NDMA at the meeting constituted a committee of scientists to study the causes on their own and then come together to share their findings and chalk out a common report,” said Sain.An official said the NDMA assured the scientists that they will be provided the required help in pursuing the study. “They have given about 60 days to submit the study report.”The flash floods damaged two hydropower projects and has so far claimed 58 lives even as 146 people remain missing. An initial report suggested an avalanche in the glaciers of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve resulted in the flash floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-ndma-officials-meet-experts-on-ways-to-tackle-disasters-101613561821427.html

Each Committee has 10 members from Rajya Sabha and 21 from Lok Sabha. Attendance of 11 of the 31 members of each committee constitutes the quorum.The eight committees of Rajya Sabha clocked average attendance of close to 50 per cent (49.34 pc) in 172 meetings held since September 2019, marking 15 per cent increase over the average attendance of 42.90 per cent for the previous two years (2017-19), sources said.While no committee recorded average attendance of 50 per cent during the two-year period of 2017-19, three committees clocked more than 50 per cent attendance in the meetings held since September 2019, according to the data compiled by the secretariat.The average duration of meetings of these eight committees held since September 2019 improved to two hours and seven minutes, an increase of over 16 per cent over the average duration of the meetings held during the previous two years (2017-19), sources said.The Rajya Sabha chairman, on the concluding day of the first part of the Budget Session, urged the members to ensure effective functioning of these committees during the recess when committees examine the Demands for Grants of various departments/ministries as proposed in the General Budget for 2021-22."The Department Related Standing Committees of the Parliament, introduced in 1993 have come to be acknowledged as instruments of effective functioning on behalf of the Parliament given their bipartisan consideration of various major issues, policies, Demands for Grants and legislative proposals as chosen/referred to them."The functioning of these Committees, particularly, during non-session periods highlights that Parliament functions not only during the sessions but round the year," Naidu said in his letters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-panels-improve-performance-naidu-writes-to-chiefs-to-enhance-attendance-101613558409509.html

A documentary on the life history of KCR was also screened on the occasion.Yadav also presented a golden saree weighing 2.5 kgs to Goddess Yellamma at Balkampet on behalf of KCR’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha. The golden saree, designed in Bengaluru, was donated by TRS leader Kuna Venkatesh Goud from Sanathnagar as an offering to the deity on the occasion of KCR’s birthday.Another TRS leader Balka Suman, who, too, in the past said KTR had all the qualities of replacing his father as the chief minister, said that KCR had all the qualities of becoming the Prime Minister of the country. “On his birthday, I wish KCR should give a new direction to the country,” he said.Birthday wishes for the chief minister also poured in from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and various leaders in the country and the state.The TRS leaders organised various other programmes including Mrutyunjaya, Navagraha and Anjaneya havans as well as Koti Kumkumarchana for the well-being of KCR and also for the welfare of the State. The party leaders also organised social service activities like blood donation camps, distribution of fruits and serving food to the needy, among other activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-goes-on-overdrive-to-celebrate-k-chandrasekhar-rao-s-birthday-101613558278248.html

His speech was translated by Narayanasamy.Also read | Rahul Gandhi reaches Puducherry as political crisis brewsGandhi then made a request to the fishermen, “Next time I come here I want to go with you in the fishing boat to see what you experience so that when I go back to Delhi, I can truly understand what farmers of Puducherry feel.”Answering a range of questions about the functioning of the media in the country to the role of electronic voting machines (EVM), Gandhi said that the EVM is a big issue and the media is not owned by poor people and is not interested in their issues.“The current government in Delhi has given ₹10 lakh crores of loan to the richest people in this country. During Covid ₹1.5 lakh crore was given to the richest people in this country as a gift. But when the labourers who are going back home, asked for a bus ticket or railway ticket they were not given,” Gandhi added, as he urged that poor people need to be more organised by themselves.“I will come next time for lunch,” the Congress leader said while parting, after many in the crowd asked him to join for lunch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-of-sea-rahul-gandhi-interacts-with-fishing-community-in-puducherry-101613557696597.html

17-02-2021||India||MJ Akbar defamation case: Judge quotes Mahabharata, Ramayana on importance of a woman's dignity||A Delhi court on Wednesday acquitted journalist Priya Ramani in the criminal defamation case filed by former Union Minister MJ Akbar.In its judgement, the court quoted two epics - Mahabharata and Ramayana - and said that they show the importance of dignity of a woman."It's shameful that such incidents are happening in India. Two great epics Mahabharata and Ramayana have been written here to show the protection of dignity of a woman," said Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey.Referring to Aranya Kand from the Ramayana, the judge said that legendary bird Jatayu fought demo king Ravana to save Sita. Speaking more about the Ramayana, the judge said that when Laxman was asked to describe Sita, he said he never looked beyond her feet. "Reverence to women is essential in Indian ethos," the judge remarked.The court accepted the contention that Akbar was not a man of stellar and impeccable reputation.The court also said that most women do not talk about the sexual harassment to prevent her dignity as she also has a family and has to go through the trauma.The judge had on February 1 reserved the judgment after Akbar as well as Ramani completed their arguments.Ramani had made allegation of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018.Akbar, the former minister of state for external affairs, had filed the complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018 for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct decades ago when he was a journalist.Ramani was the first woman to accuse Akbar of sexual harassment during the #MeToo campaign. The allegations levelled against him forced him to resign from the Union Cabinet on October 17, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mj-akbar-defamation-case-judge-quotes-mahabharata-ramayana-101613556395822.html
17-02-2021||India||PFI says two of its men were abducted and arrested by UP’s STF||The Popular Front of India (PFI), a radical outfit, on Wednesday said two of its workers arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police in connection with alleged terror activities were innocent and they were abducted by UP’s Special Task Force (STF) while they were going to West Bengal for poll-related work.The STF claimed that the two men from Kerala - Ansad Baharuddin and Firoz Khan - were planning a series of bomb attacks in UP and seized improvised explosive devices from them. It also said they were on a mission to train local youth and had prepared a list of top Hindu functionaries to attack them.The PFI rejected this claim and said STF was planning to implement the agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).“They were missing for the last three days and their relatives had filed complaints with the police in Kozhikode and Pandalam. They were on their way to West Bengal in connection with upcoming elections and were abducted by the STF along the Bihar-Bengal border,” said PFI’s national secretary Nasaruddin Elamaram in Kozhikode (north Kerala).He said there was a concerted campaign to portray the PFI in a bad light for opposing the RSS agenda and the latest incident was part of it. “The STF is playing into the hands of the RSS. The seized materials were planted. We will approach the court against their illegal detention,” he said.Last week UP police had taken Campus Front of India, PFI student wing, national secretary Rauf Sharief to Mathura in connection with a complaint regarding an alleged move to incite unrest in Hathras last October following the death of a young Dalit woman after gang rape.Central agencies had also raided offices and houses of many PFI leaders including Nasaruddin Elamaram. The UP police had alleged that Rauf Sharief bore travel expenses of Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and three others who were arrested in October on charges of planning to incite unrest in Hathras.On Monday, the Supreme Court allowed a five-day bail to Kappan to meet his ailing mother.The latest arrest of the two PFI came at a time when many BJP-ruled states have sought a ban on the organisation.

17-02-2021||India||Priya Ramani acquitted in MJ Akbar defamation case||A Delhi court on Wednesday acquitted former journalist Priya Ramani in former Union minister MJ Akbar's defamation case against her for her allegations of sexual harassment and said a woman has right to voice her grievance even after several years.The verdict, which was earlier expected to be pronounced at 2pm, was delayed after the judge said his judgement needed corrections.Watch | MJ Akbar case: Court acquits Priya Ramani, quotes from Mahabharata & RamayanaReferring to ancient epics 'Mahabharata' and 'Ramayana' in its judgement, the court said they were written to show the importance of dignity of a woman and it was shameful that such incidents were still happening in the country."Most women do not talk about the sexual harassment due to stigma that surrounds it. Sometimes even the victim does not understand as to what is happening. Despite going through extreme cruelty, the they chose to stay quiet," the court said.The court accepted the contention that Akbar was not a man of stellar and impeccable reputation and pointed out that right of reputation can't be weighed over the right of the life of a woman.It regretted the absence of laws to protect survivors of sexual harassment when the incident had happened. "Prior to the issuance of the Vishaka guidelines by the Supreme Court, they (survivors) did not have the option to lodge the complaint of sexual harassment due to social stigma,” the court ruled.In 2018, Ramani had made allegation of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #Metoo movement. According to the former journalist, in December 1993, Akbar sexually harassed her when she was called to a Mumbai hotel for a job interview.The allegations against Akbar had forced him to resign from the Union Cabinet on October 17, 2018. Before resigning, he had filed a complaint against Ramani on October 15 for allegedly defaming him.Senior advocate Rebecca John was appearing for Ramani while Geeta Luthra was the for the former Union minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mj-akbar-vs-priya-ramani-metoo-case-priya-ramani-acquitted-101613553546507.html

As emissions, traffic accidents and inefficient traffic flows characterise more and more of the world's major cities, the hack aims to develop solutions to these problems," said Klas Molin, Ambassador of Sweden to India."It's very encouraging to see that several Indian organisations and companies have joined the hackathon as partners," Molin said.Anna Lekvall, Consul General of Sweden in Mumbai, added, “Innovation is at the heart of the Sweden India relationship, and safe, sustainable transport has grown immensely as a vital new area of co-operation.""The Sweden-India Mobility Hackathon is expanding this partnership, providing a strong platform for students, start-ups, companies, experts from the two countries to co-create new solutions for mobility. Together, we can change the way we move,” Lekvall added.According to the statement, the theme of the hackathon has a strong connection to the "joint innovation partnership" that exists between India and Sweden and the Sweden-India Transport Safety and Innovation Platform (SITIS), which was launched in February last year.The event is supported by several Swedish and Indian partners including startups, incubators, research institutes, innovation cells, road safety organisations and companies in sectors of sustainability, automotives and transport, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sweden-to-host-42-hour-digital-hackathon-to-tackle-traffic-issues-101613553296157.html

But now, we use the transparent system, the government’s e-market place or GEM, which has enabled us to invite tenders online.”The Prime Minister was speaking at the National Technology and Futuristic Forum organised by Nasscom.“Due to some reasons, the large domestic market of India could not be used by the IT industry,” he said. “The digital divide in the country kept increasing because of this. In a sense it was a period of ‘diva tale andhera’ [darkness under a lamp]. Our government has changed this. The government has lifted unnecessary restrictions on the tech industry.” Also Read | India invites Pakistan to virtual SAARC meet on Covid-19Modi added that geo-tagging of projects was being done to ensure timely completion and technology was being leveraged to provide fast, precise and futuristic solutions to all sections of society.“Digital India has connected the ordinary citizen to the government,” he said. “We have also democratised data. Online delivery of services has helped the lower and middle classes find relief from corruption.”He added that India has moved from being a heavily cash dependent economy to one that uses digital transactions. “The more digital transactions happen, the more we reduce the prevalence of black money.” The PM also stressed transparency as the building block of minimum government and maximum governance. “The government has moved from its registers to the dashboard. The attempt is that whatever the government does should be accessible to the ordinary citizen on their phones.” Modi also mentioned that the government was mapping villages using drones and reducing human involvement in the tax filing process. He urged entrepreneurs to move from Make In India to Make for India. “Use your CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds to provide education to children who do not have access such facilities.”He added that innovation was needed, especially in the space of agriculture and health. “India needs mentors,” he said. “To become a global leader, India’s IT sector needs to focus on a culture of excellence and institution building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-transactions-helped-reduce-corruption-pm-modi-at-nasscom-event-101613553721190.html

17-02-2021||India||India pushing ahead with key Kaladan transit project in Myanmar||India is pushing ahead with the Kaladan transit project in Myanmar’s Rakhine state as it is seen as key to improving connectivity with the landlocked northeastern states and creating conditions to facilitate the repatriation of Rohingya refugees.The Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project, being implemented with an Indian grant of $484 million, includes development of Sittwe port in Myanmar, an inland water terminal at Paletwa on the Kaladan river and creating road connectivity from Paletwa to Zorinpui in Mizoram.The project has been hit by delays due to work being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the threat posed by rebels of the Arakan Army, which has targeted the shipment of materials for the infrastructure project and attacked Myanmar troops providing security to the venture.During a visit by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane to Myanmar last October, both sides discussed the operationalisation of Sittwe port in the first quarter of 2021. Despite questions raised by the military coup in Myanmar, recent remarks by external affairs minister S Jaishankar indicated the project is on track.Also Read | Myanmar’s Suu Kyi faces new charge as crackdown intensifies“The Kaladan multi-modal transport link, including the Sittwe port and the Paletwa inland water terminal, will add to our access to the Myanmar coastline,” Jaishankar said during an address in Guwahati on Monday.The project is aimed at enhancing access to the sea for the seven northeastern states, which are currently dependent on ports in Bangladesh. Access to a port in Myanmar will shorten the distance for transporting heavy cargo for northeastern states such as Manipur and Mizoram, which share borders with Myanmar.The Indian government is also keen on the project as it believes it will boost economic development in Rakhine state and create the grounds for the return of Rohingya refugees currently sheltering in Bangladesh. India, which has often been nudged by Bangladesh to help facilitate the repatriation of the refugees, believes the best course for it in this matter is to create conditions in Rakhine for the safe and sustainable return of the Rohingyas, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.Another reason for India’s push for the Kaladan project is to counter China’s plans to create the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) centred round a deep-water port at Kyaukpyu in Rakhine state.The people said one of the crucial portions of the Kaladan project, which has faced several delays, is the construction of a 109-km road from Zorinpui in Mizoram to Paletwa in Myanmar. This work is expected to take some more time, the people said.The parliamentary committee on external affairs, in a recent report, expressed concern that current allocation of funds for Myanmar was “not congruent with the ongoing strategic projects” such as the Kaladan project. The committee also called on the external affairs ministry to take adequate steps to ensure the allocations are used optimally for completing ongoing projects.The ministry, in its reply to the committee, said the status of the road segment of the Kaladan project is being closely monitored along with the department of heavy industries, the parent department of Engineering Project (India) Limited that is part of the joint venture implementing the project. India’s budget for 2021-22 included an outlay of ₹400 crore as grants and loans for Myanmar.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the Kaladan project will improve connectivity by facilitating the shipment of cargo from India’s eastern ports to Myanmar and to the northeastern states.“The essential idea is to provide the northeast with quick access to the sea via Myanmar and also to help boost exports from the northeastern states,” said Bhatia, who served as India’s envoy to Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pushing-ahead-with-key-transit-project-in-myanmar-101613551020873.html
17-02-2021||India||Bihar to unveil ethanol production incentive policy soon to woo big investors||The Bihar government will soon unveil an incentive policy to attract investment to set up ethanol plants with easy availability of land and raw materials in the next one month, a top official said on Wednesday.“The policy will be aimed to attract investment for production of ethanol from molasses, sugarcane, maize and cereals. It will cover all aspects so that setting up of plants is easy. It will come up in the next one month or so,” said additional chief secretary (industry department) Brijesh Mehrohtra.In December last year, Union minister for MSME and road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari in an interaction with chief minister Nitish Kumar had asked the state government to boost production of ethanol promising the Centre would help in purchasing it. Based on Gadkari’s assurance, the state government has been working on the new incentive policy.A few days back there were discussions between industry minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain and sugarcane industry minister Pramod Kumar on promoting ethanol production in the state with better co-ordination among the two departments and other agencies concerned.In Bihar, the production of ethanol is still low. Most of the organic chemical is produced by distilleries in Gopalganj and Jandaha in Vaishali district. Ethanol is widely used in alcohol production and now increasingly in motor fuel.Officials said the production in these distilleries is 65-75 kilo litre per day and the supplies are given to various oil companies.Officials said the new incentive policy would be in sync with the Bihar Industrial Investment Policy, 2016 where there are provisions of easy clearance of projects, land availability and tax reliefs for investors.“We are looking to attract investment for producing ethanol from maize and even rice which has high production in the state. It will help the sugarcane sector and also help farmers to get better prices for their produce be it sugarcane or maize,” said one official in the industry department.The state government had tried to raise production of ethanol to boost industrialisation and give fillip to the sugarcane sector from 2006 onwards but the initiatives did not attract much investors owing to certain conditions laid down by the Centre that only sugar factories can produce ethanol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-to-unveil-ethanol-production-incentive-policy-soon-to-woo-big-investors-101613549650808.html

Addressing a NASSCOM event, PM Modi urged the IT industry veterans to look for talent in smaller cities of the country."India is not short of ideas, it needs mentors to turn those ideas into realities," the Prime Minister said during the address via video conferencing."There are many young innovators in smaller cities, they want your support. Government is planning to build infrastructure in tier 2 cities, to help all of you," he added.He then lauded the efforts of the country's IT sector during the Covid-19 crisis. "At a time when every sector was affected due to Corona, you achieved a two per cent growth. It's commendable if India's IT industry adds 4 billion dollars to its revenue at a time when suspicions of de-growth were being cast," said PM Modi.The Prime Minister then asked those present at the event to create world-class products "that will set the global benchmark on excellence". "There can be no compromise on these goals. Without them, we will also be a follower and not a global leader," said PM Modi.The markets in tier 2 cities - outside the metro cities - have picked up fast in the last few years. The incentives were introduced by the Modi government during its first term.These incentives include tax rebates and government's push for affordable housing to attract companies and people.Another factor that has worked for the smaller cities is that, as the gaps in infrastructure and lifestyle have narrowed, businesses have moved in, drawing migrant professionals, creating a melting pot culture that is more cosmopolitan and urban, and eventually drawing people back home to those cities from prime metros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-short-of-ideas-needs-mentoring-pm-modi-on-developing-tier-2-cities-101613549956099.html
17-02-2021||India||Lingaraj temple priests cite threat to Shivratri as Odisha temple war escalates||The political battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) over the temple beautification drive intensified on Tuesday. The priests of the 11th century Lingaraj temple, backed by the BJD, claimed that the draft bylaw for the 13th century Vaishnavite temple Ananta Basudeva, issued by a Central agency, will hinder Shivaratri festival at the Lingaraj temple."The draft bylaws of the Ananta Basudeva temple are an outcome of the difference of opinion between the BJP and the BJD. If the government doesn’t roll back the draft regulations with immediate effect, it may have an impact on the upcoming Shivaratri rituals. Political game over the matter is playing spoilsport in the development of the temple," said Biranchi Pati, secretary of Brahmana Nijog, one of the most powerful bodies of priests of Lingaraj temple. His contention was similar to what Odisha chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra said in his letter to the Union culture secretary on Monday.Last month, the National Monument Authority or the NMA, under the Union culture ministry issued draft bylaws for Jagannath temple of Puri, and Ananta Basudeva and Brahmeswar temples of Bhubaneswar under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. As per the draft bylaws, construction activities are prohibited within the first 100 metre radius of the monument and are regulated within the next 200 metres. The draft bylaws, however, are in conflict with the Odisha government's proposed temple beautification drive in Puri and Bhubaneswar.In his letter to Centre, the Odisha chief secretary demanded withdrawal of the draft bylaws of Ananta Basudeva temple citing apprehensions of a widespread agitation leading to disturbance in religious rituals. "The kind of atmosphere in temples is bound to hurt the religious sentiments of lakhs of devotees. It is important to have a peaceful atmosphere for conducting the annual Maha Shivratri festival in which a large number of devotees from all over the state participate," the chief secretary wrote, referring to the possible impact of the bylaws on the Lingaraj temple, situated less than 100 metres from the Ananta Basudeva temple.However, Bhubaneswar BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi accused the Naveen Patnaik government of misleading the people since construction in the close vicinity of monuments protected by the Archaeological Society of India is already banned under the existing Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. She also alleged that the draft bylaws in contention could not have been formulated without the knowledge of the director of the culture department of Odisha.Early this month, Union minister for petroleum and natural gas and senior BJP leader Dharmendra Pradhan wrote to Union culture minister Prahallad Singh Patel requesting him to send an expert team from the ASI in Delhi to carry out a detailed study and thorough scientific excavation of the area around Lingaraj temple, which is being developed by the Odisha government. Soon after, a team of BJP leaders visited the site and demanded a halt to the ongoing work in the region till the entire area surrounding the complex is excavated.Also Read: Odisha: Devotee donates over 4 kg gold, 3 kg silver to Puri Jagannath TemplePolitical analysts said the sparring between the BJD and the BJP over the NMA draft bylaws showed religion was going to be an important issue in the forthcoming polls in Odisha. "The BJP is aware that the BJD is trying to snatch its religious card through development of old temples in a deeply religious state like Odisha. So the NMA draft bylaws on heritage temples may have come as a blessing for the BJP as the party can now challenge the BJD's temple development plank. But how much can the BJP counter the BJD's plan is not easy to predict," said political science professor Gyana Ranjan Swain of GM University in Sambalpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lingaraj-temple-priests-cite-threat-to-shivratri-as-odisha-temple-war-escalates-101613549430866.html

He also lauded the solutions given by tech experts which he said served as an inspiration to the world during Covid-19 crisis.He then talked about the various initiatives taken by the government in liberalising various sectors, most recent being the mapping sector. The government on Monday liberalised regulations on geospatial data and maps to achieve a $5 trillion economy and the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat or self-reliant India."In a major move, policies regarding mapping and geospatial data have been liberalised for the industry. This step will empower our tech start-up eco-system and the mission of Aatmanirbhar Bharat," PM Modi said while addressing the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM)'s Technology and Leadership Forum (NTLF) via video conferencing."The biggest consideration on geospatial regulations was on security. India is more confident nation now which can be seen on our borders," he added.The Prime Minister said that whether it's projects related to infrastructure, or houses of the poor, everything is being geo-tagged so that projects can be completed on time."Technology has empowered the regular citizen in the country and connected him with the government. We've democratised data as well and last-mile service delivery has also been effective," PM Modi said.Under the new policy, geospatial data from government agencies such as the Survey of India and the Indian Space Research Organisation will also be made available to public and private companies.After the liberalisation of regulations on geospatial data, private companies can now conduct surveying and mapping without prior approvals and share the data for various everyday applications, from logistics and transport to road safety and e-commerce.The new guidelines will allow an increase in the scale, speed, and accuracy of mapping.The government estimates that the new guidelines will boost the geospatial data sector to a value of ₹1 lakh crore and create jobs for 2.2 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-nasscom-event-pm-modi-spotlights-new-mapping-policy-says-biggest-consideration-was-on-security-101613548278293.html

Jacob approached the HC after the Delhi cyber crime unit raided her residence on February 11 and seized her computer and phone in connection with the toolkit which was allegedly authored by her and Disha Ravi, an activist from Bengaluru. Also Read | Toolkit case: Bombay HC grants transit anticipatory bail to Shantanu MulukAnother activist from Beed, Shantanu Muluk, who had applied for transit anticipatory bail before the Aurangabad bench of the HC, was granted the same for a period of ten days on Tuesday. The single bench of justice PD Naik held that Jacob had no religious or political intent to incite violence and she apprehended arrest which was corroborated by the fact that a NBW was issued against her.The court also referred to the order of justice Vibha Kankanwadi that was passed in Muluk’s application on Tuesday and said that similar reliefs had been sought by Muluk as well and the same were granted.The bench of justice Vibha Kankanwadi while granting bail to Shantanu Muluk in her order passed on Tuesday had observed that apprehension of arrest was the key factor, that is, required to be considered in such applications and as Muluk was seeking limited protection to enable him to approach the competent court or officer, the HC was competent to grant the same. Justice Naik said Jacob had been interrogated after which she was apprehensive of being arrested hence approached HC seeking relief to go to Delhi to approach the appropriate court. In light of this and the fact that the issue of transit anticipatory bail was pending but still the same was granted by other courts, the court granted protection to Jacob for three weeks and in the event of an arrest, she was to be released on a personal bond of ₹25,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-hc-grants-nikita-jacob-transit-bail-for-three-weeks-101613546400689.html

17-02-2021||India||SC seeks Centre’s response on system to avert air crash on table top runways||The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought Centre’s response to a petition seeking installation of an advanced technological system at vulnerable airports to prevent aircrafts from overshooting runways. The petition cited the example of the United States where over a dozen aircraft accidents could be prevented due to the technology, as per the court documents.“A crash is something horrible. To see people trapped in the aircraft is a terrible sight to watch,” The SC bench observed while asking the Centre not to view this petition as ‘adversarial’ but to respond positively to the concern raised in it.“This technology (EMAS) has been installed in approximately more than 125 airports across the world, with more than 100 in the United States itself. The installation of Engineered Material Arresting System or EMAS would not only have saved hundreds of lives but would have also saved crores of rupees in aircraft equipment. There are at least 15 incidents in the United States, where the EMAS has come into play and prevented accidents,” the petition filed by advocate Shohit Chaudhry said.Last year, an airplane fell into a valley from a table-top runway at the Calicut airport, causing several deaths and injuries. A similar and more deadly crash took place at the Mangalore airport, another table-top runway, in 2010. Citing these two accidents, public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a retired mechanical engineer Rajen Mehta, questioned why the Centre could not install a technology similar to the Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) used in 125 airports across the world.Earlier in September last year, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Mehta’s petition but there was no response.“We have seen the issues raised in the petition and will respond to it,” said additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati.The EMAS works as an “arrestor bed” which uses crushable material placed at the end of a runway to stop an aircraft that overruns the runway. This crushable material generally consists of concrete blocks and can reduce the 1000 feet runway end safety area (RESA) requirement to 600 feet or less. The wheels of the plane dig into the concrete resulting in a controlled deceleration that brings the airplane to a smooth halt within a predetermined distance. “This minimizes or virtually eliminates the potential for aircraft nose gear collapse and injury to passengers and crew,” the petition stated.Also Read: SC seeks Centre’s response over priority Covid vaccination for judges, lawyersThe petitioner, an 85-year-old engineer retired from a company that globally supplied the EMAS system to airports, pointed out that the government had initially planned to install the EMAS technology at Calicut and later at Mangalore runways, which could have averted the accidents.The petition claims that in 2008, the Calicut EMAS project was shelved citing economic crisis. Two years later, after the Mangalore crash, the inquiry committee probing the crash recommended installation of the EMAS on the runway overshoot areas. Yet, no action has been taken on the recommendation till date, it said.The SC bench, comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian posted the petition after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-on-system-to-avert-air-crash-on-table-top-runways-101613543072288.html

The bus was on its way to Satna from Sidhi.But the bravery of a schoolgirl is winning hearts. Shivrani Lonia and her brother - all aged between 16 and 22 years - saved seven passengers from the ill-fated bus.“A 17-year-old girl Shivrani Lonia and her brother Ramprasad, who live near the canal with her family, helped at least seven people in coming out of water. Lonia informed the others that a bus has fell into the canal,” said Pankaj Kumawat, superintendent of police, Sidhi.Lonia saw the bus coming in at high speed, skidding off the road and rolling down into the water-filled canal. But without fearing for her life, she and her brother jumped into the canal to save the passengers.“The bus was at a very high speed when the driver lost the control. After the bus plunged into the canal, we jumped into the canal to save the passengers, but we could save only seven people, who came out of the bus after the accident,” Lonia told reporters on Tuesday.However, one of the seven saved by Lonia died during treatment.District collector Ravindra Kumar Choudhary said at the time of the accident, the water level in the canal was about 25 feet."I salute the courage shown by daughter Shivrani. Not caring for her life, this daughter saved the lives of two passengers by jumping into the canal in Sidhi. I thank the daughter. The entire state is proud of you," chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said in Bhopal.The accident took place near Patna village, around 80 km from the Sidhi district headquarters.“In the preliminary investigation, it was found that the driver took a short route as there was a traffic jam on the regular road near a Chhuiha Valley and the job aspirants, who were in the bus, were requesting the driver to increase the speed as they were getting late for the exam. The driver lost the control of the bus and it plunged into a canal,” said Kumawat.Passengers unsuccessfully tried to break the windows of the ill-fated bus, which had more than 50 people, when it rolled down into the canal, news agency PTI quoted a survivor as saying. The driver of the bus Balendyu Vishwakarma is missing after the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-bus-accident-17-year-old-schoolgirl-jumped-into-canal-and-saved-7-people-101613542929774.html

On a previous occasion but he did not appear despite being summoned.The ED wants to question him in connection with business dealings, if any, with Sarnaik’s son Vihang Sarnaik, who is reportedly a close friend of Jain. The directorate claims it has come across several communications between the two. The investigators had also searched Jain's premises in the past. But the agency later stopped the searches following the death of Jain's uncle Rajiv Kapoor.Vihang and his father Pratap Sarnaik were previously questioned by ED in the case.The ED had earlier arrested Sarnaik's close associate Amit Chandole and TopsGrup Security Services Limited (TGSSL) managing director M Shashidharan in the cae where TopsGrup had allegedly bagged contracts from MMRDA in collusion with Sarnaik through illegal means. These illegal manoeuvres aimed to get undue benefit by inflating bills at the cost of MMRDA and illegal cash gratification to Sarnaik for facilitating this scam. Sarnaik used to get 50% of the profit earned of the said contract through Chandole, the ED had claimed.It said that in 2014, a contract was signed by TGSSL with MMRDA under which 350 to 500 guards were to be deployed at MMRDA sites monthly. Out of the same, only 70% of guards were deployed. However, the billing was done for all the guards as per the contract and the wage details were submitted to MMRDA for 100% of the contract vałue.Mumbai police's economic offence wing (EOW) is also probing cross complaints of TopsGrup chairman Rahul Nanda and his former employee Ramesh Iyer (the complainant in the ED's case). Nanda has alleged that Iyer and other employees siphoned off the company's money, while Iyer claimed that Nanda, through his company, indulged in massive misconduct and financial irregularities worth ₹175 crore.On Tuesday the agency also recorded the statement of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) commissioner RA Rajeev, who said that MMRDA has not given clean chit to anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armaan-jain-reaches-ed-office-for-questioning-in-topsgrup-money-laundering-case-101613541514867.html

We must continue embrace these good practices, which have saved us… The vigil to contain this disease must continue,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.“I would very much like to convey that things cannot be taken for granted, and we have to be mindful of the fact that ICMR’s [Indian Council of Medical Research] last national sero survey tells us that a majority of Indians, as high as 70% of us, are still vulnerable for sure. And we have to diminish this vulnerability not by waiting for the virus to infect us but by getting immunized against the virus,” he added.

This Brazilian and South African variant virus has the capacity to easily enter the lungs,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Last year, the centre had created the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG) of 10 advanced laboratories based at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Union ministry of health and family welfare, as part of sentinel surveillance measures taken for early detection of variants of concern of Sars-CoV-2 that may have caused clustering, high mortality etc.“Fortunately, there has been no increase in mortality,” said Dr Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/risk-of-covid-19-spread-during-ongoing-wedding-season-say-experts-101613541960625.html

17-02-2021||India||Telangana MP A Revanth Reddy's padayatra exposes Congress fault lines||The 10-day-long padayatra or foot-march campaign by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president and party MP A Revanth Reddy ended on Tuesday, exposing serious differences in the state unit of the party, said leaders aware of the developments.Reddy’s padayatra-- The Rythu Bharosa Yatra or the march supporting farmers seeking the withdrawal of the controversial farm-reform laws ended at Tukkuguda on the outskirts of Hyderabad, from where he took out a tractor rally up to Raviryala, where a public meeting was held in the evening. However, several senior leaders of the Telangana Congress didn’t attend the programme as they were reportedly under instruction from the Pradesh Congress Committee president to boycott it, said a party leader, who didn’t wish to be named.“How can he decide on taking out the padayatra without even informing the state party leadership or the high command in Delhi?” the leader said, quoting the PCC chief.Reddy’s padyatra began after a rally of farmers at Achampet in Nagarkurnool district on February 7. Reddy, who represents Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency, walked through Nagarkurnool, Mahabubnagar and Ranga Reddy districts covering a distance of 130 km before reaching Tukkuguda.Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy and Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka stayed away from the public meeting organised at Raviryal for the grand culmination of Reddy’s march. All India Congress Committee in-charge of Telangana, Manickam Tagore too, dropped out at the last moment under pressure from the PCC leadership, the Congress leader quoted above said.The boycott call was apparently given since Reddy’s rally did not have the permission from the high command.Revanth Reddy is seen as one of the front-runners for the PCC chief post ever since Uttam Kumar Reddy offered to step down after the party’s poor show in the GHMC elections in December last.Though majority of the party leaders have extended support to Revanth Reddy as the next PCC chief, several senior leaders opposed saying he was relatively a new-comer to the party – Reddy joined the Congress in 2017. Veteran Congress leader and ex-MP V Hanumanth Rao even threatened to resign if Revanth Reddy was made the PCC chief, said a senior Congress leader.Also Read: Cong MP Reddy says BJP implementing East India Company modelDespite the boycott by the seniors, many Congress leaders attended the rally on Tuesday. They include former ministers Mohd Ali Shabbir, Konda Surekha and S Rajaiah, ex-MPs Balaram Naik, Mallu Ravi and Suresh Shetkar, PCC working presidents Kusuma Kumar and Ponnam Prabhakar and MLA D Sitakka, besides several ex-MLAs and party office-bearers.AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan, who also attended the rally, said there was no need for taking permission from the high command for such padayatra and rallies, as was demanded by certain seniors. “You don’t need to take permission to kill a serpent. It has to be done instantaneously. Revanth Reddy did the same. Such efforts would only strengthen the party,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-mp-a-revanth-reddy-s-padayatra-exposes-congress-fault-lines-101613540501934.html

17-02-2021||India||SC denies registering suo motu contempt against Rajdeep Sardesai||The Supreme Court late on Tuesday clarified that a suo motu criminal contempt petition was inadvertently listed on its website against journalist Rajdeep Sardesai and the process was on to rectify it.This case was registered over Sardesai’s tweets criticising the apex court’s decision against activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan last year, despite attorney general KK Venugopal denying permission to initiate contempt over the same tweets five months ago.“This is in context with news item being flashed in some news channels about initiating suo motu criminal contempt proceeding against Mr. Rajdeep Sardesai by Supreme court, it is made clear that no such proceeding has been initiated against Mr. Rajdeep Sardesai. However status shown at Supreme Court website vide case no. SMC (Crl) 02/2021 has been placed inadvertently. Appropriate action to rectify the same is under process,” the court said in a statement.Also Read | Centre’s charges of rioting, sedition against journalists are not correct: Shiv SenaThe website showed that a petition by law student Aastha Khurana was converted into a suo motu (on its own) criminal contempt plea on February 13 and the Supreme Court registry informed Khurana’s lawyer Omprakash Ajitsingh Parihar of the development on Tuesday. No date was indicated for hearing the petition.Parihar questioned how such an error could take place. “We received the message from the Supreme Court about the listing of our case and even the website is showing so.”The petition filed by Khurana alleged that Sardesai’s comments will cause disrespect to the Supreme Court in the minds of citizens.“Alleged contemnor being an Indian news anchor is a well-known personality and various people take his statement as true and correct, therefore his statement on the top judicial body of this country indicates a threat to the society which will lead to no trust on the judiciary,” the petition read.When contacted, Sardesai on Tuesday said he did not wish to comment at this stage.The offence of criminal contempt carries a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine up to ₹2,000 or both.The law student first filed the contempt plea under Article 129 of the Constitution on September 21. At the time, Venugopal refused consent to initiate contempt, calling his tweets “trifling remarks”.“The reputation of the Supreme Court as one of the great pillars of our democracy has been built assiduously over the last 70 years. Trifling remarks and mere passing criticism though perhaps distasteful are unlikely to tarnish the image of the institution,” Venugopal wrote in his response to the petition last year.The tweets by Sardesai were not of a serious nature so as to undermine the majesty of the court or lower its stature in the minds of the public, the Centre’s top law officer said.Under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act and Rule 3 of Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of Supreme Court, the consent of the AG or the solicitor general is required before the apex court can hear a criminal contempt petition filed by a private individual.In her petition, Khurana included tweets by Sardesai criticising the top court’s decision to convict Bhushan for contempt and impose a fine of Re 1.The first tweet by Sardesai, as quoted in the petition, said, “Prashant Bhushan held guilty of contempt by Supreme Court, sentence to be pronounced on August 20. This even as habeas corpus petitions of those detained in Kashmir for more than a year remain pending.”The second tweet, as per the petition, said, “Re 1 token fine imposed by SC on Prashant Bhushan in contempt case. If he doesn’t pay it, then 3 months jail sentence. Clearly, court looking to wriggle out of an embarrassment of its own making.”Khurana referred to older tweets by Sardesai on former top court judge Arun Mishra, who headed the bench hearing the Bhushan case, She also reproduced an earlier tweet against former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi.“All these actions of the alleged contemnor clearly show that he has no respect towards the Supreme Court of India and he is trying to defame this court by doing such type of tweets,” the petition read.On August 31, the SC directed Bhushan to pay a fine of Re 1 for two tweets against the CJI and the apex court. “It is not expected of a person who is a part of the system of administration of justice and who owes a duty to the said system, to make such tweets which are capable of shaking the confidence of general public,” the judgment read.Venugopal, who appeared in his personal capacity at the court’s request, asked the court not to punish Bhushan and let him off with a reprimand. That case was also registered suo motu by the top court on a petition that didn’t have the consent of the attorney general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-denies-registering-suo-moto-contempt-against-rajdeep-sardesai-101613538720455.html

The petitioner said that the government has identified certain groups of citizens as deserving of the vaccine in the first round, leaving out the essential services being performed by the judicial system.The petition was drawn by advocate Rishi Sehgal, who said, “despite forming part of ‘essential services’, working continuously and discharging their respective duties towards the constitutional framework of India even during the times of this deadly Covid-19, the Judges, court staff, lawyers and their staff do not find mention in the priority group identified by the respondents for administration of vaccine.”Also Read: GST evasion case: Let's try not to put everyone in jail, says Supreme CourtIt was on December 28 last year that the government came out with the “Covid-19 Vaccines Operational Guidelines” laying out the mechanism for the rollout of vaccination across the country.

17-02-2021||India||Manipur doctor wins high Japanese honour for promoting ties between 2 nations||Japan has conferred the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays decoration on Manipur physician and former president of state tourism forum, Dr Thangjam Dhabali Singh, to honour his contribution to strengthening ties between Japan and India, and Japan and Manipur. He was honoured in a simple event in Imphal on Tuesday.“We appreciate that Dr Singh has earnestly dedicated himself to deepening the bonds between Japan and Manipur. During his tenure from 2012 to 2017 as president of Manipur Tourism Forum (MTF), Japan and Manipur rediscovered each other and got even closer, going beyond our historical ties,” said a statement from Japanese ambassador Suzuki Satoshi, read out by Japanese embassy counselor Kajita Takuma.Dr Dhabali was involved in organising the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Imphal in 2014, an event attended by dignitaries from Japan, Britain and Australia.Later with support from the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and the Nippon Foundation of Japan, the Imphal Peace Movement (IPM) was launched on June 22 in 2019, which, Ambassador of Japan termed as ‘another symbolic achievement’. The MTF played an important role in giving shape to IPM during Dr Dhabali’s tenure as its president.The decoration was constituted by Japanese Emperor Meiji in 1875. It is one of the highest orders conferred in the name of his majesty the emperor, by the government of Japan to non-military and apolitical persons, who have made distinguished achievements in international relations, promotion of Japanese culture, achievements in their respective field, development in welfare or preservation of the environment.The highest Japanese order, the Order of the Chrysanthemum, is reserved for heads of state or royalty, while the second highest order, the Order of the Paulownia Flowers, is mostly reserved for politicians.Dr Dhabali thanked everyone particularly the members of MTF and the Second World War Imphal Campaign Foundation (ICF) who had been instrumental in providing a definite direction to the promotion of tourism between the two countries.Also Read: Manipur's iconic women-run market reopens after nearly 11 months“Words truly fail to express how humbled I feel for the acknowledgement of what I still consider to be a small contribution. I know I still have much to learn but with the continued support and encouragement from my fellow colleagues from MTF and ICF, I am sure we will be able to explore more areas to strengthen our friendship with Japan,” Dr Dhabali said after receiving the honour.Present MTF president Kh Krishnan, PM Director Haobam Joyremba and Rajeshwar Yumnam, president of ICF, were present during the decoration ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-doctor-gets-japan-s-highest-honour-for-promoting-ties-between-2-nations-101613528494357.html

A special 'pooja' was also performed by devotees at the temple.Santosh Razadan, a devotee who came to offer prayers at the temple, said that they received huge support from locals especially those from the Muslim community for the reopening of the temple."Shital Nath temple reopened after 31 years. People used to come here before to offer prayers but it was closed due to militancy. Hindus residing near the temple had also left. Locals mostly belonging to the Muslim community helped us," she told ANI.Ravinder Razdan, one of the organisers of the pooja conducted at Shital Nath temple, said people from the Muslim community provided much-needed support to us in this initiative and they even came forward to clean the temple."Our Mulsim brother and sisters brought pooja items. We used to do this pooja every year. Baba Sheetal Nath Bhairao's birth anniversary falls on Basant Pachmit that is why we celebrate this day with fervour," Razdan said.Terrorist violence cases and stone-pelting incidents have dropped in Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 that gave special status to the erstwhile state. Jammu and Kashmir was also bifurcated into two union territories- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.On February 8, Union Minister of State Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy had informed Rajya Sabha that the number of terrorist violence cases and stone-pelting incidents in Jammu and Kashmir have reduced drastically in 2020 in comparison to 2019. "A total of 157 terrorists were neutralised in 2019 and 221 were eliminated in 2020. There were 594 cases of terrorist violence in 2019, which reduced to 244 in 2020. There were 327 stone pelting incidents in 2020 as compared to 2,009 such incidents in 2019," he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temple-in-srinagar-closed-due-to-militancy-reopens-after-31-years-on-panchami-101613525586752.html

Subsequently, the diesel rate climbed to ₹79.95 a litre in Delhi.Adding to a common man's plight, petrol prices have been soaring for nine days in a row, touching the highest level India has ever seen in states like Rajasthan.At the start of this week, petrol price was raised by 30 paise per litre and diesel by 35 paise.The relentless hike in prices has been criticised by the opposition parties including Congress that has demanded an immediate cut in taxes to ease the burden on the common man.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week had told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday had attacked the government over high fuel prices and alleged that it was "looting people"."The Modi government is determined to loot people, just to ensure the development of "two"," he said using the hashtag "FuelLoot".Central and state taxes make up for over 61 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and about 56 per cent of diesel.The price of liquefied petroleum gas domestic cylinders has also increased by ₹50 per unit this week in Delhi.The new price of ₹769 per 14.2 kilograms LPG cylinder was applicable in the national capital from Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-diesel-prices-increase-in-delhi-by-25-paise-each-101613524473633.html

We wanted her to be removed for unconstitutional behaviour, interfering in the day-to-day activities of the administration, ignoring the elected government and not following rules and procedures. We launched several agitations against her. We also organised signature campaigns for her removal," Narayanasamy said.The Chief Minister accused Bedi of blocking the welfare schemes in the Union Territory."Due to pressure from us, the Government of India has removed Bedi. This is a great victory for the people of Puducherry. She blocked the welfare schemes. However, the rights of the Puducherry people have been saved today. Now, Puducherry will teach a lesson to BJP," he added.Meanwhile, Congress workers celebrated the removal of Bedi as Puducherry LG by bursting firecrackers and distributing sweets.Bedi has been removed as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, the Rashtrapati Bhavan said in a statement on Tuesday.Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has been directed to discharge functions of the Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry, in addition to her own duties, until a new appointment is made, the statement said.Earlier, Congress MLA from Kamaraj Nagar constituency, A John Kumar had resigned from his post, citing "dissatisfaction with the Congress government."This comes ahead of the Puducherry Assembly polls scheduled to be held later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-cm-terms-ouster-of-lg-kiran-bedi-as-victory-of-people-101613522016487.html

17-02-2021||India||Twitter’s clash with government gives boost to Koo app||An Indian alternative to Twitter Inc. is experiencing a surge in popularity after the US microblogging site clashed with the country’s government, a sign of the growing political challenges for social media services.The Koo app, which lets users send out tweet-like posts in English as well as seven Indian languages, shot to prominence after the San Francisco company got into a weeks-long standoff with the Indian government over blocking certain content. Prominent officials -- including Piyush Goyal, the minister of industry and commerce -- defected to Koo and urged supporters to follow suit.That led to a 20-fold explosion in daily users, overwhelming the servers and 10-person engineering team at parent Bombinate Technologies Pvt. Aprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder and chief executive officer, said the Bangalore-based startup’s primary goal is not political at all, but rather to expand the reach of social media to a broader demographic.“We are building for 100% of India and not just the top 1%,” Radhakrishna said in a phone interview. “You may not be able to follow Elon Musk on Koo but you can connect with Indians who speak and write in a multitude of languages.”Twitter declined to comment.Koo, whose logo of a yellow chick bears a resemblance to Twitter’s blue-and-white bird, was founded just a year ago and is a fraction the size of Twitter. It had approximately 2.6 million installs from Indian app stores last year, compared with about 28 million installs for Twitter, according to data from analytics provider Sensor Tower. But from Feb. 6 to Feb. 11, Koo’s installs soared by 901,000, according to the firm’s mobile insights strategist Stephanie Chan.Twitter’s clash with the Indian government has echoes of its controversial decisions in the US, including the banning of Donald Trump after riots in Washington, D.C. In India, the government pressed the social media company to block accounts because of farmer protests over agricultural laws that the government said included misinformation and threats to national security.Twitter first resisted and then complied with a majority of orders, shutting hundreds of accounts the government had flagged. However, Twitter refused to ban others, citing freedom of expression. Politicians like Goyal have urged followers to go to Koo. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said it will post exclusive updates on the app.Even the country’s Supreme Court has gotten involved. It has asked the government and Twitter for input on litigation over how to curb toxic content and fake news online. Any ban on Twitter in India could hit user growth in a critical market.The sudden rise of Koo has sparked privacy concerns over its collection of personal data and security questions because one of its investors is China’s Shunwei Capital. While Koo plans to buy out the Chinese venture firm, Radhakrishna is mostly focused on building the capability to serve more users.“We are working really really hard to get this to more Indians,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitters-clash-with-government-gives-boost-to-koo-app-101613517083858.html

Digvijaya Singh has done this (donated for Ram Temple construction). A Congress MLA (in Kerala) also did the same. Congress should realise that such a move amounts to giving acceptance to the RSS," he said.Vijayan further criticised the Opposition for the ongoing protest against back door appointments."We have seen campaigns alleging back door appointments including by the former Chief Minister. The answer is truth-telling figures. The Public Service Commission (PSC) has published 4012 rank lists during the last 4 years and 7 months of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. During the same period of the last United Democratic Front (UDF) government, only 3113 rank lists were published," he said."During the LDF government, 13,825 appointments were made in the police. During the same period of the last UDF government, 4,791 appointments were made. LD Clark recruited 19,120 people during the 2016-20 period. It was 17,711 during 2011-16. Such appointments have been made by overcoming circumstances, including Covid," he added.The Chief Minister said that the state government is committed to giving opportunities to all and filling eligible vacancies on time."The LDF government has decided to give appointments to those who are eligible with clear criteria. This government has fixed only those posts which are not left to PSC and with more than 10 years of service," he said."UDF leaders are campaigning by saying more than three lakh temporary workers were given permanent appointments. It is not known where such a figure came from. The total number of employees in the state is 5,28,231. Then they have to clarify where such figures come from," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/difference-between-congress-bjp-narrowing-down-says-kerala-cm-vijayan-101613516937072.html
17-02-2021||India||Gujarat Rajya Sabha bypolls: Old-timer, OBC leader on BJP’s list||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday announced the names of candidates for by-elections to two Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat on March 1 — one an old-time party worker of four decades, Ram Mokariya, and the other a backward classes leader, Dinesh Anavadiya.The ruling party will have a walkover on both the seats since the Congress has decided not to nominate any candidate because it doesn’t have the adequate numbers to win any seat — particularly since voting will be held separately for the two seats. The opposition party will, therefore, have to concede the seat that fell vacant after the death of veteran Congress leader Ahmed Patel.Another seat held by the BJP fell vacant after the death of Abhay Bhardwaj. Both Patel and Bhardwaj succumbed to Covid-19 complications.Ram Mokariya, who is a surprise choice from the party, founded Gujarat’s first Shree Maruti Courier service in 1985 to cater to four cities in the Saurashtra region. The primary reason for Maruti’s success was that it delivered to remotest towns in Gujarat.“I have been a dedicated party worker for four decades without any expectations. I am indeed happy that the party has picked me to contest the Rajya Sabha elections,” Mokariya told reporters after his selection.The other candidate is Gujarat’s OBC Morcha chief Anavadiya, a senior leader from North Gujarat’s Banaskantha district who was director of the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation between 2014 and 2017.The BJP, which won 99 seats in the 2017 elections, now has 111 legislators in a House of 182, while the number of the Congress has fallen from 77 to 65 after several desertions. The Bharatiya Tribal Party has two MLAs, Nationalist Congress Party one, and Jignesh Mevani is the only independent MLA.As of now, two assembly seats are vacant.“We don’t have the numbers to nominate a candidate. If polling was to be held together for both seats, we could still have stood a chance of retaining our one seat since the voting MLAs would be equally divided. In two separate ballots, all 180 MLAs will vote for each seat,” Gujarat Congress chief spokesperson Manish Doshi said.Meanwhile, there is some surprise in the BJP camp as well since the party was expected to field Balwantsinh Rajput, who created an upset in 2017 when he quit the Congress to join the BJP. He was immediately nominated against Ahmed Patel for the Rajya Sabha, and came close to pulling off a win against his former mentor. Patel won the seat by one vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-rajya-sabha-bypolls-old-timer-obc-leader-on-bjp-s-list-101613513496891.html

After his supporters began celebrating his victory based on early leads, Chidambaram was declared winner by a narrow margin of 3,354 votes after 21 rounds of counting.Rajakannappan, who is now with Congress ally DMK, levelled charges stating that Chidambaram misused his position then as union minister, distributed cash for votes and manipulated the counted votes. He also alleged that the returning officer influenced the election to favour Chidambaram. The former minister denied all charges.Chidambaram retained the seat in 2014 parliamentary elections while the case was ongoing. His son Karthi Chidambaram currently holds the parliamentary seat from Sivaganga after winning the contest in 2019.Reacting to the order, Karti Chidambaram tweeted, “Hope this gives quietus to a manufactured controversy and juvenile barbs which accompanied it. 2009 results of Sivaganga were accurate. I reiterate my confidence in EVMs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-years-later-hc-upholds-chidambaram-s-2009-ls-win-from-tn-constituency-101613514661069.html
17-02-2021||India||GST evasion case: Let's try not to put everyone in jail, says Supreme Court||The Supreme Court (SC) has decried demands for “keeping everybody in jails”, stating that the criminal jurisprudence in the country needs a correction yet again.“We don’t understand what is happening to the jurisprudence in this country. Everybody wants everybody to remain in jail. Nobody should come out on bail, ever. What is this?” asked an SC bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, earlier this month. It recently came across several such cases relating to bail.On January 18, the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, gave bail to an accused who was behind the bars in connection with a Goods and Services Tax evasion case.Additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju opposed the plea for bail, arguing there was siphoning of ₹21 crore and that the money belonged to the nation. But the court said it failed to understand why somebody should be kept incarcerated in a case of GST evasion where most of the evidence would be documentary. The bench also noted that the accused was remanded to police custody for the maximum period of 15 days, but the police still wanted him in jail.“Let us keep jurisprudence to what it was – bail is the rule and jail is an exception. We must correct our jurisprudence again,” the bench told ASG Raju on January 18, as it released the accused on a regular bail even though the initial plea before the top court was for an interim bail on medical grounds.Similarly, there was a petition for cancellation of bail in a case registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The bench was amused to learn that the appeal was being filed after a delay of almost two years.Additional solicitor general KM Nataraj sought to explain the delay and also the fact that the cancellation was being sought since the quantity involved was commercial in nature. But the bench was unmoved.“If it was such a serious matter, why did you take 617 days to file an appeal? Now that man is already out and you want this court to send him back to jail. But there are no good reasons you have shown to us. Why should everyone be in jail?” asked the court as it dismissed the appeal by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) by an order last month.Earlier this month, another petition came up for hearing before the Justice Kaul-led bench in a cheating case where the man had been given bail but the complainant wanted it cancelled. The court observed that it was “worried to see how people wanted everyone behind bars”.It summarily rejected the plea, saying: “So, according to you, everyone should be in jail till the time the trial is over. Nobody should be given bail. What has happened to the jurisprudence that we had? It needs a correction.”Veteran lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi told HT: “The principle is unexceptionable and age-old. The problem lies with the high degree of inconsistency with different benches of different courts in applying the principle that bail is the rule, jail is exception. This salutary principle became a chimera in the hands of the subjective judges, applying whimsical discretion.”The senior advocate added: “My personal view is that there should be a reset and the bail should again become a norm after applying the triple test — flight risk, non-cooperation with the investigation and interference with the evidence. Apart from the triple test and in cases of some heinous offences such as serious terrorism and child rape, there is a need to make this principle not only a theoretical standard but an operational norm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-tax-evasion-case-let-s-try-not-to-put-everyone-in-jail-supreme-court-101613514803232.html

It is not good.”Former chief minister Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti also condemned the arrest and the charges framed against Lone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncs-hilal-lone-held-under-uapa-for-hate-speech-101613514591286.html

Several JJP leaders have already demanded the repeal of the farm laws and a protracted agitation will not augur well for the government,” the functionary explained.Last week, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended a Kisan Mahapanchayat in UP.In UP, the party wants to placate the community ahead of the polls as at least 73 seats in the western region of the state are considered to hold the key to the chief minister’s chair. “The government has maintained from the beginning that it is ready for talks but the farmers have to tell us where they think the laws will hurt them,” a minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-avoid-jat-backlash-nadda-shah-discuss-farm-stir-with-leaders-101613514732149.html

The law does not differentiate between a 22-year-old and a 50-year-old. She was produced before a court which sent her to five-day police custody,” Shrivastava said on the sidelines of an event to mark Delhi Police’s 74th Raising Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explain-activist-s-arrest-women-s-panel-to-cops-101613508705411.html

The protesters, affiliated to All India Students’ Association (AISA) and other student organisations, also submitted a memorandum to the commissioner demanding the release of persons associated with the farmers’ ongoing protest against the Centre’s farm laws.“In a highly condemnable act, Delhi Police has arrested Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old Bengaluru-based environment activist for supporting the farmers’ movement. All activists such as Shiv Kumar and others arrested for merely supporting the farmers’ movement must be released,” Prasenjeet Kumar, national working general secretary of AISA, said in the memorandum.The students said toolkits have been “a common tool for agitation” and the malicious ploy to term it an ‘international conspiracy’ is the BJP’s way of defaming the mass farmers’ protest. Activists also raised their voice against the vilification of Ravi on social media.Madhurima Kundu, JNU student and AISA activist, said it was shameful that “a dedicated propaganda machinery” was focussed on “maligning” Ravi’s image. “The false links to ”international conspiracy” is a prime toolkit of fascist politics,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-protest-outside-delhi-police-hq-demand-disha-ravi-s-release-101613508745322.html
17-02-2021||India||Will ask ‘toolkit’ suspect why he was at Tikri on R-Day: Cops||Delhi Police on Tuesday said it will ask Maharashtra engineer Shantanu Muluk, who allegedly created a social media toolkit on the ongoing farm protests, to explain why he was present at the Tikri border on January 26 when violence broke out at many places in the Capital during a tractor rally by farmers.“Our technical probe to ascertain Muluk’s phone location shows that he was present in Delhi between January 21 and 27. And, that he was at Tikri border protest site on January 26. We will ask him to join the investigation and tell us what was he doing at Tikri border when farmers were taking out the tractor parade,” an officer associated with the investigation said on condition of anonymity.The Bombay high court on Tuesday granted transit anticipatory bail to Muluk while reserving the order on a similar appeal by Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, another accused in the case, for Wednesday.Read more: Disha Ravi can get warm clothes, masks and books in police custody, says Delhi courtOn Saturday night, Delhi Police arrested 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi from Bengaluru on charges of sedition, intending to riot and criminal conspiracy, for editing and creating a toolkit, essentially a Google document.The police alleged that the toolkit was created to spread misinformation and incite unrest. They also alleged that Ravi shared the document with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg who tweeted it but later removed it.Muluk has been accused of similar charges as Ravi.Investigators said that Ravi created a WhatsApp group, International Farmers Strike, on December 6. Police said Jacob allegedly joined the group on December 11 while a few members of pro-Khalistani group, Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF), also joined it.Muluk was added to the group on December 6, the police alleged, adding that the group was created to discuss the modalities of the Google toolkit document titled Global Farmer Strike and Global Day of Action, 26 January, backing the ongoing agitation by the farmers against the three laws passed by Parliament in September.Read more: Disha Ravi's arrest: 'False to say there were lapses', says Delhi Police chiefThe three suspects also attended a meeting organised on video conferencing platform Zoom by the PJF on January 11 this year, investigators said.The police said they have written to Zoom and WhatsApp, seeking details such as the identities of the participants, the creator and administrator of the group, the meeting coordinator, apart from the deleted chats, videos and documents.“These details will help us ascertain the sequence of events leading to the creation of the Google toolkit documents and the role each participant played in it. Disha deleted the WhatsApp group soon after Greta Thunberg accidentally posted the entire toolkit document on Twitter and later deleted it,” said a senior police officer associated with the case, requesting anonymity.The police’s decision to arrest Ravi and charge the activists has drawn sharp criticism from activists and Opposition politicians.On Tuesday, Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar attacked the Centre. “Arrest of Disha Ravi is an attack to weaken the moral strength of India’s Youth and make dissent illegal. Police action against her, using a concocted ‘Toolkit’ conspiracy violates legal norms. Why not approach a competent court before arresting a young woman?” Shivakumar tweeted.Read more: Delhi women's panel sends notice to police over Disha Ravi’s arrestActivists from various organisations say creating a toolkit was standard operating procedure for advocacy and media outreach, and did not constitute a crime as it was entirely up to people whether or not to follow what toolkits suggested.The Left-wing All India Students’ Association (AISA) staged a protest at the Delhi Police headquarters on Tuesday, demanded Ravi’s immediate release and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of running an “anti-democracy campaign”.Police said Ravi’s interrogation, and examination of her laptop and mobile phone showed that she deleted a series of emails related to the toolkit. Efforts to retrieve those emails are being made, they said.A second police officer, who did not want to be named, said their investigation so far has shown PJF founder Mo Dhaliwal contacted Ravi, Jacob and Muluk through a Canada-based woman named Puneet.“Puneet got in touch with Jacob in the first week of December and was told about the PJF’s ‘bigger plans’ pertaining to the farmers’ agitation. We have reason to believe that after Jacob agreed to be part of the plan, she roped in Muluk and Disha. Muluk is the common link between Jacob and Disha. Disha’s direct link with Thunberg could be the reason why she was included in the toolkit plan,” the second officer said.Police said their probe pointed to the alleged involvement of another PJF member, Anita Lal.“We have found that Disha, Jacob, Muluk and others communicated each other through an email created on PJF’s domain apart from other secured messaging apps,” the second officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-ask-toolkit-suspect-why-he-was-at-tikri-on-r-day-cops-101613508449542.html
17-02-2021||India||Illegal land allotment case: ED charge-sheets Hooda, 21 others under PMLA||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and 21 others, including three former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officials, for alleged illegal allotment of land in Panchkula.The case involves allotment of 14 industrial plots worth ₹30.34 crore to the acquaintances of Hooda in 2013, when he was the CM. All the plots were attached as per provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by ED in 2019.ED, which probes financial crimes, initiated an investigation in 2015 -- after a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government came to power -- based on a First Information Report, or FIR, by the Haryana vigilance bureau.The FIR was subsequently transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2016, which registered a case under relevant sections and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.ED said investigations revealed that Hooda, as the then ex-officio chairman of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), three retired IAS officers and other office-bearers of the body illegally favoured pre-selected acquaintances of the then CM by allotting them 14 industrial plots, while denying worthy applicants.The three retired IAS officers are: Dharam Pal Singh Nagal (the then chief administrator, HUDA), Surjit Singh (the then administrator, HUDA), and Narinder Kumar Solanki (the then zonal administrator of HUDA’s Faridabad Zone).Two other HUDA officials named in the charge sheet are: Subhash Chandra Kansal (the then chief controller of finance, HUDA) and Bharat Bhushan Taneja (the then superintendent, HUDA).The agency said the criteria for allotment was altered 18 days after the last date of application in such a way to favour the pre-selected applicants. It added that the entire interview process was “vitiated and compromised”.State home minister and BJP leader Anil Vij said “irregularities” committed during the Congress rule in Haryana were getting exposed through investigations. “Law of the land will take its course,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-land-allotment-case-ed-charge-sheets-hooda-21-others-under-pmla-101613506116933.html
17-02-2021||India||Top court rebukes retired Madhya Pradesh district judge for ‘flirting’||The Supreme Court on Tuesday reproached a former district judge from Madhya Pradesh for “flirting” with a junior woman judge, and said such conduct was “unacceptable” in the judiciary.“Such conduct by a senior judge for a junior lady judge is not acceptable at all,” said an SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, as it heard an appeal by the retired judge against the disciplinary proceedings, initiated suo motu (on its own) by the Madhya Pradesh high court.While his petition emphasised that there could not be any inquiry after the woman judge had chosen to “settle” the matter with him, the high court defended its action on the ground that his conduct was unbecoming of a judge and an example had to be set.During the hearing, senior advocate Ravindra Shrivastava, appearing for the high court, also read out a WhatsApp conversation between the former district judge, who retired last year, and the woman judicial officer, who was posted under him in 2018.Read more: Orders that set the bar: How Allahabad HC stood for civil rightsThese messages were about how the former wanted to “touch” her, have an affair with her like “husband and wife”.HT is not naming the retired district judge because there has been no decision on his guilt or otherwise, and his petition has challenged the initiation of the inquiry itself.Shrivastava pointed out that the woman officer had made a complaint and also recorded her statement against her senior, but later withdrew from the inquiry under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, saying she had settled the matter.He contended that the male judge was a senior judicial officer and there must have been some kind of pressure on the woman judge that made her retract.According to Shrivastava, even though the inquiry under the sexual harassment act could not conclude after the woman judge opted out, the gender sensitisation committee of the high court had the authority to take a suo motu note of the demeanour by the former district judge and recommend a disciplinary inquiry, as it did in November 2019.Read more: Supreme Court agrees to consider issue of priority vaccination for members of legal fraternity, issues notice to CentreHe presented before the bench the district judge’s statement to the committee -- the judge had admitted the WhatsApp conversation with the woman officer, and called it “flirting”.At this, senior advocate R Balasubramanium, representing the retired district judge, said that his client might have gone “overboard”, but he could not be proceeded against when the complainant has herself said that she did not want any inquiry.He also questioned the timing of the complaint, pointing out the district judge was being considered for appointment to the high court when the allegations surfaced.Read more: Supreme Court notice to WhatsApp: ‘People value privacy more than money’But the bench declined to entertain such contentions. “We understand these are two adults talking. And you thought it is a private conversation. But you have not just gone overboard. Your WhatsApp messages are offensive and improper,” the Supreme Court bench told advocate Balasubramanium.It said that the former district judge should withdraw his petition and face the consequences of the disciplinary proceedings lest the court pass “some sweeping observations against him”.Balasubramanium was given a week to consult the former judge and come back with instructions on withdrawing the appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-rebukes-retired-madhya-pradesh-district-judge-for-flirting-101613505164883.html
17-02-2021||India||Sedition can’t be used to quieten disquiet: Delhi court observes||A Delhi court has said that sedition charges should not be invoked to quieten disquiet under the pretence of muzzling miscreants, making the observations while granting bail to two people arrested in connection with the tractor rally violence during farmers’ protest on this year’s Republic Day.Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana made the observation while granting bail to Devi Lal Burdak and Swaroop Ram. The two were arrested by the Delhi Police for alleged sedition and circulating rumours by posting videos on social media.“The law of sedition is a powerful tool in the hands of the state to maintain peace and order in the society. However, it cannot be invoked to quieten the disquiet under the pretence of muzzling the miscreants,” the judge said on Monday. The court said the invocation of Section 124 A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code was a “seriously debatable issue” in the case.Read more: Karnataka police yet to file charge-sheets in 3 sedition cases filed a year agoBurdak and Ram, both aged 25, were booked under sections 124A (sedition), 505 (spreading rumors), 468 (forgery) and 471 (fraud) of the IPC. While Ram, a labourer, was arrested from Mahisagar in Gujarat, Burdak was arrested from Nagaur in Rajasthan. The police alleged that both the accused circulated a video on social media that showed a senior police official briefing other personnel during the farmers’ protest. It alleged that though it was an old video of September 2020, it was being projected through social media posts as being connected with the farmers’ agitation and the violence son January 26 in an effort to project that there was unrest within the police forces.“In the recent violence that occurred on Jan 26 at Red Fort, near ITO and other areas in Delhi, a large number of police personnel were injured and these posts have been released on social media at a strategic time deliberately in an attempt to excite disaffection towards the government established by law and with an intent to cause any officer or soldier in the Armed Forces to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in his duty as such,” the police told the court.Read more: Kangana Ranaut seeks quashing of FIR for sedition, tells court her tweets did not incite violenceThe investigating agency also said that the accused circulated fake videos and also charged them for forgery. The court, however, rejected both the contentions and said that the invocation of sedition in this case was a “debatable issue”.“Evidently, law proscribes any act which has a tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence. In the absence of any exhortation, call, incitement or instigation to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence or any allusion or oblique remark or even any hint towards this objective, attributable to the accused, I suspect that Section 124 A IPC can be validly invoked against the accused,” the court said.It also said that “it had personally seen the video in the courtroom where evidently a senior police officer of Delhi Police is raising slogans, in a very agitated tone, and a group of Delhi Police personnel are seen standing beside him. The background voices also suggest a very charged up atmosphere”.Read more: JNU sedition case: Delhi court takes cognisance of chargesheet against Kanhaiya Kumar, othersThe judge also rejected the charges of forgery and said that the video in question was not created by the accused and was merely forwarded by them.“Consequently, since the prosecution has failed to point out the creation of any false document in the instant case, I fail to understand as to how come the offence u/s 468/471 IPC (forgery) can be invoked in the instant case,” the judge said.Advocate Surender Chaudhary, the counsel representing the accused, said that it was complete injustice on the part of the police to arrest the two young men who had no connection with the farmers’ protest. He said that his clients had not even visited the Red Fort or any of the protesting sites and they were arrested from their homes.“This is complete travesty of justice. The career of the young boys is at stake now. This is also suppressing the right to protest envisaged under the Indian Constitution,” he said. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra said sedition has a high benchmark and the SC has said that unless there is an incitement to violence, the act will not constitute sedition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sedition-can-t-be-used-to-quieten-disquiet-delhi-court-observes-101613501393189.html
17-02-2021||India||4 South Africa variant cases found, 1 with strain from Brazil||Four people who flew into India last month were infected with the South African variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and another traveller was found infected with the Brazilian variant, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, announcing the detection of the two mutations that scientists fear can make coronavirus vaccines less effective and trigger reinfections among people.Authorities have carried out contact tracing for the five people, and no other person is found to have contracted the new variants till now, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at the weekly government briefing on Covid-19 in the Capital. People returning from these countries will now be tested more aggressively, he added.“There are no direct flights from South Africa or Brazil, so the health ministry and the civil aviation ministry are in touch on the steps to be taken on the matter,” Bhushan said, while refusing to give details about which airport the five people arrived at or their location at present in order to protect their privacy.Read more: Covid-19: South Africa's health care workers eager for first vaccinesIndia now has all three of the coronavirus variants that are a global concern -- B.1.1.7, first discovered in the UK; B.1.351, which is now dominant in South Africa; and P.1, which has spread in Brazil. All three have a unique collection of mutations, two of which -- N501Y and E484K -- seem to make it spread more readily or cheat vaccine-immunity triggered by the virus predominant in the world. The UK variant carries the N501Y mutation, the Brazilian variant has the E484K mutation, and the South African variant has both.Bhushan indicated that genomic tests of all positive cases among people who arrive from Brazil and South Africa are likely to be carried out. “We got genome sequencing done of all those who were found positive among those tested for the UK variant. This strategy worked significantly well, and most likely the same strategy we will apply for flights coming from South Africa and Brazil,” he said.But, he added, passengers from South Africa and Brazil do not take direct flights. “The traffic is largely routed from other sectors; for example, the Gulf sector. So, to have measures that can be put in place for passengers coming from these two countries, the Union health and civil aviation ministries are in constant touch and should come up with a solution soon that will be made public,” he said.Read more: Covid-19 variant in UK picks up worrying South Africa mutationThe South African strains were found among two people who returned from the country as well as one traveller each from Angola and Tanzania.“All travellers and contacts have been tested and quarantined, and ICMR-National Institute of Virology is attempting to isolate and culture the South Africa variant strain from the samples of these four individuals,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The South African and Brazil variants are different from the UK variant because the Brazilian and South African variants have the capacity to easily enter the lungs, Bhargava said.Last year, the Union government created the Indian Sars-Cov-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG) of 10 laboratories based at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Union ministry of health and family welfare, as part of a surveillance mechanism for early detection of variants of concern.“For the UK variant, we have found 187 such variants. We were able to isolate the virus and culture the strain and have also tested the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccine. Neutralising potential with the UK variant is there with the vaccine that is in use in India,” Bhargava added.Read more: Oxford Covid-19 shot less effective against South African variant: StudySuch experiments in South Africa have showed that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine’s efficacy dropped to an insignificant 22% against the B.1.351 variant. The country dropped its plan last week to use the vaccine, which is also being used in India as Covishield, and has decided to offer doses to the African Union, where the variant has not reached. Vaccine trials carried out by Johnson & Johnson-Janssen and Novavax too showed a significant drop in efficacy due to the variant.Similar implications could also hold for people who were previously infected. World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on February 14 that WHO had received new reports of reinfection, including some from South Africa where people who had Covid-19 were infected again.The coronavirus outbreak has waned dramatically in India and over the past week, the country recorded around 93 deaths a day -- a level not seen since early May. The decrease has raised fears that people might become complacent, and that variants such as the three of global concern could take hold, wiping out population immunity and triggering a resurgence.According to ICMR, experiments to assess vaccine effectiveness against this strain are currently underway. “The significance of a mutation will depend on where the mutation has happened, as mutations in RNA viruses happen all the time. It will be significant if the mutations help the virus to attach to the cell easily as then it will impact the disease spread,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-south-africa-variant-cases-found-1-with-strain-from-brazil-101613503495609.html

Hours later, Kiran Bedi was replaced as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, with the Telangana governor being given the additional charge of the UT.With Congress legislator A John Kumar’s resignation on Tuesday, the Congress’s tally in the 33-member assembly dropped to 10. Kumar, who was seen as a close aide of Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy, resigned after health minister Malladi Krishna Rao announced he was quitting the House on Monday. Two Congress MLAs-- A Namassivayam, and E Theepaindan -- resigned in January this year and later flew to Delhi to join the BJP. Another Congress MLA, N Dhanavelu, was disqualified in July 2020 for anti-party activities.Read more: Assembly polls in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu will be held simultaneously: CECThe assembly has 30 elected seats and three nominated members. In the 2016 assembly polls, the Congress won 15 seats. It has the support of three MLAs from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and an independent MLA. The Opposition comprises the All India NR Congress, a splinter group of former chief minister N Rangasamy, with seven seats and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, with four members. Three members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been nominated as MLAs to the assembly. Unlike some other states, the nominated members can vote in the Puducherry assembly.Gandhi is scheduled to launch the Congress’s campaign on Wednesday for the UT’s elections, due in April-May.Kumar handed his resignation on Tuesday to speaker VP Sivakolunthu after the health minister posted his resignation on Twitter on Monday. The Speaker told PTI he was perusing the letter and will take a decision soon. He said he received Rao’s resignation letter from the House through fax on Monday night. With the five vacancies, the strength has reduced to 28 in the Puducherry assembly.Read more: Rift in Cong-DMK alliance in Puducherry; all eyes now on ties in poll-bound TNOn Tuesday night, a Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson said Bedi will “cease to hold” the office of the Lieutenant Governor. “The President has directed that Dr. Kiran Bedi shall cease to hold the office of the Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry and has appointed Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan, Governor of Telangana, to discharge the functions of the Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry, in addition to her own duties, with effect from the date she assumes charge of her office, until regular arrangements for the office of Lieutenant-Governor of Puducherry are made,” Ajay Kumar Singh, press secretary to the President, said in a statement.An official in the L-G’s office said the development came as a surprise. “We are yet to receive an official communication of the change,” the official said, asking not to be named. “She likes to be in the driver’s seat, which is what created the friction between her and the chief minister,” the official added. At least three functionaries in Tamil Nadu told HT that one of the possible reasons of Bedi’s removal could be that she had a bitter relationship with the Congress leaders who recently quit the party and joined the BJP.Read more: BJP appoints election in-charges for Puducherry, 3 poll-bound statesThe Puducherry Congress said that its alliance held the majority amid calls from the Opposition, demanding CM’s resignation. “Our alliance with the DMK is strong...We have a majority and we will continue to function,” Narayanasamy said.Rangasamy, however, said: “They have lost the majority with the four resignations, so the government has to come forward and voluntarily quit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-loses-puducherry-majority-after-4-mlas-quit-bedi-replaced-101613504145202.html

It is not adversarial at all. The government should tell us what it is doing about the OTTs.

Instead, additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj, also appearing for the Centre, submitted: “We are looking at the issue. The issue is under deliberation. Nothing is finalised yet. We are contemplating something in this regard.” This submission made the bench retort: “We cannot accept the word mere ‘contemplation’. We need to know what exactly you are doing. Everyone in the world contemplates. So that’s not enough. You file your affidavit and tell us what is it that you are planning to do. Tell us something concrete.” Two weeks have been given to the government for filing their reply to the petition by Shashank Shekhar Jha and Apurva Arhatia.Last October, the court issued notices on this PIL, which had sought establishment of a proper institution for the monitoring and management of content on different OTT and streaming and digital media platforms.Read more: Manoj Bajpayee says OTT will lose its charm if it comes under censorshipNone of the OTT platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, and Hotstar have signed the self-regulation provided by the ministry of Information & Broadcasting since February 2020, said the PIL. It had also stated that absence of a monitoring and regulatory body has let writers, directors, and producers to experiment limitless, due to which unchecked and uncensored contents on cruelty, violence, sex, obscene language and on screen-smoking were being streamed on these platforms.In November last year, the Union government had brought the streaming video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, and news websites under the ambit of I&B ministry for regulation. This notification was seen as a precursor to the government approving future rules — either through legislation or endorsement of self-regulatory mechanisms. At present, there are no laws or autonomous bodies that have a say on the sort of content on streaming services or news websites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spell-out-regulatory-regime-sc-tells-govt-on-ott-norms-101613503941290.html
17-02-2021||India||Activists question govt's move to push on with Uttarakhand hydel projects||The environment ministry said in a statement that it has come up with a common policy for the seven under-construction hydropower projects in the higher reaches of Uttarakhand, a move that gains significance in the wake of the February 7 glacial lake overflow flood in the Rishi Ganga valley.The policy, which is to be presented in the Supreme Court in July, has been drafted by the environment, power and Jal Shakti ministries.One of the seven projects is National Thermal Power Corporations’ 520 MW Tapovan Vishnugad project that has been completely destroyed following the flood on February 7 and which will have to be rebuilt. As of Tuesday, the bodies of 17 workers have been recovered and 123 are missing at the Tapovan Vishnugad site.The list includes the 444 MW Vishnugad Pipalkoti, a few kilometres downstream of Tapovan; the 99 MW Singoli Bhatwari; and the 76MW Phata Byung projects.The Tapovan Vishnugad project is in a so-called paraglacial zone (above 2,000 metres in Uttarakhand), while the Vishnugad Pipalkoti, Singoli Bhatwari and Phata Byung projects are located in areas bordering paraglacial zones. These are landscapes that are extremely vulnerable to changes in geology related to glacial retreat. All also partially bore the brunt of the 2013 flood or floods that came before.Read more: Uttarakhand glacier burst: Heavy damage to two hydel projects at the epicentreThe apex court, in its order dated January 24, 2015, in the Alaknanda Hydro Power Co. Ltd Versus Anuj Joshi & Ors, sought a common policy framework from the environment, power and Jal Shakti ministries for implementation of projects in the upper reaches of the Ganga (Alaknanda and Bhagirathi Basin).“A common policy framework has been arrived at with consensus on the implementation of the following seven under-construction projects,” a statement from the environment ministry said.Hydropower projects impact ecological flow in the Ganga and they can amplify disasters from extreme weather events as was seen in the February 7 glacial flood. Ecological flow is the minimum flow needed in a river to sustain life. Dams and hydropower projects create barriers to this flow.Experts hope that the February 7 flood will be the last such reminder of the risks associated with hydropower projects in these regions.The impact of the February 7 disaster would have been manifold had the flash floods impacted Vishnugad Pipalkoti, which is under-construction a few kilometres downstream of the Tapovan Vishnugad project. Further downstream of Pipalkoti is the Srinagar hydroelectric project of 330 MW, which is already generating electricity but is vulnerable to upstream floods.Read more: Amid rescue ops in Uttarakhand, identifying decomposed bodies a big challengeIn 2013, the apex court ruled that no new hydroelectric power projects should be set up in the state of Uttarakhand. In all, 69 projects were envisaged in the region, and 24 were granted environmental clearance. These clearances were also stayed by the SC. The court sought a detailed and scientific assessment of the cumulative impact of hydropower plants in the state.Following the SC order, a committee headed by Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute, submitted a detailed report which warned that a glacial retreat in the state, coupled with structures built for hydroelectricity generation and dams, could lead to large-scale disasters downstream.“We (the committee) had recommended that 23 of the 24 hydropower projects should be cancelled. My opinion is that those under-construction should also be cancelled. Tapovan Vishnugad is already destroyed and will take years to be commissioned... Vishnugad Pipalkoti is again very close to the para-glacial zone and extremely vulnerable. Why would the government want to commission these?” said Chopra.Read more: Uttarakhand disaster: Locals feared Kedarnath-like tragedyThe 2013 court order came in the wake of the Kedarnath flash floods.“The under-construction and existing dams were the reasons for the escalated damage and impact of the 2013 disaster. The same phenomenon was seen in Asi-Ganga flash flood of 2012 and also in the recent Uttarakhand tragedy in Rishi and Dhauli Ganga. These dams must be cancelled with immediate effect and the existing dams too must be systematically decommissioned in phases...” said Mallika Bhanot, an activist from Ganga Ahvaan.Following submission of the committee’s report, the top court ordered a stay on 24 hydropower projects.The February 7 disaster has also raised concerns about disaster preparedness. For example, early warnings weren’t triggered both at the 13.2 MW Rishi Ganga project and the Tapovan Vishnugad project even though systems were in place according to officials at the disaster site.“We had a complete system of emergency measures. But water came with such volume and speed that reaction time was nil,” said a senior NTPC official who asked not to be named.“The abnormality this time was that the water level was even higher than the place where people are supposed to stand after climbing rescue ladders. Our project was 76 per cent complete and we never imagined a disaster of this scale. But NTPC has no thoughts of abandoning this project,” he added. The damage to Tapovan Vishnugad is to the extent of around ₹1,500 crore. Locals here also have polarised views on the impact of hydropower projects.“Not a single person from this village has benefitted from the hydropower projects. They haven’t given us any jobs. They have only pushed us towards disaster,” said Bharat Singh, a resident of Raini village, known for Goura Devi, a Chipko movement icon and Mahila Mangal Dal leader.But Bhimsingh Rawat, a cab driver in Joshimath who also does farming during lean tourist seasons, said such projects have helped. “Before hydropower projects came, people across this area were poverty-stricken. Let’s not be impractical. Hydropower has brought money to this state. Can’t they function with better warning systems?” he said.On Tuesday, at the Tapovan Vishnugad site, rescue workers were searching for bodies, and medical teams were collecting DNA samples from relatives to match body parts retrieved.“For the past eight days, we have been waiting here from morning to evening in the hope that my brother and four workers installing a machine in the NTPC tunnel are found. I can’t imagine the horror of a disaster like this burying them in a tunnel. How can NTPC have no early warning? Who will answer these questions?” asked Mukesh Dhiman from Saharanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/activists-question-govt-s-move-to-push-on-with-uttarakhand-hydel-projects-101613503065025.html
17-02-2021||India||First joint commands to be launched by May||India is set to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan to best utilise its military’s resources amid growing security threats, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.The commands are being set up in the backdrop of border tensions with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and Pakistani hostility along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu & Kashmir, with a joint threat from the two nuclear-armed neighbours being acknowledged as a reality by the country’s military leadership, and at a time when India is demonstrating a muscular stance in the Indo-Pacific region.“The final validation exercises to set up the two commands are in full swing. Aspects related to executing authority, command and control structures and budgeting are being fine-tuned,” said a senior official, one of the people cited above, who asked not to be named.Read more: India has not conceded any territory to China along LAC, says defence ministryThe Air Defence Command, which will come up in Prayagraj (Allahabad), will be the first to be set up in April. It will control the air defence resources of all the three services, and will be tasked with protecting military assets from airborne enemies. Its commander-in-chief will be a top three-star Indian Air Force officer. The Maritime Theatre Command, to be headquartered in Karwar on the west coast, will come up the following month and be responsible for securing India from seaborne threats and will have army and air force elements under it. Its commander-in-chief will be a top three-star Indian Navy officer.Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands are led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them.“The Air Defence Command will be rolled out first, in April. The Maritime Theatre Command will follow a month later. The commanders-in-chief of the commands will report to the chief of defence staff (CDS) in his role as permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC),” said a second official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.Read more: India to get 5 military theatre commands, one each for China and PakImportance of jointmanshipIndia’s CDS General Bipin Rawat wears three hats — he is the permanent chairman of COSC, heads the department of military affairs (DMA), and is the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.The government expects Rawat, who took charge as India’s first CDS on January 1, 2020, to bring about jointness among the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the means to achieve jointness is the setting up of integrated theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles.Apart from the Air Defence and Maritime Theatre Commands, India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts — these will be rolled out by December 2022, and several studies are currently on to finalise the structures of these commands. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources. The CDS’s mandate includes bringing about jointness in operations, logistics, transport, training, support services and repairs and maintenance of the three services.Read more: Behind PM Modi’s stinging critique of the IAS, a Jan meeting holds the clueThe long-overdue integrated theatres will transform the Indian military from a military force to a military power, contributing to India’s stature as a global leader, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), who was heading the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS) until last month and has worked extensively on aspects related to jointness. “On account of China’s aggressive behaviour along the LAC and the Covid-19 pandemic, the armed forces will be tasked, asked and expected to do more with less (resources). Hence, it is imperative that the armed forces roll out the integrated theatre commands fast,” said Bhatia, also a former director general of military operations.The Air Defence Command will bring about the much-needed synergy between air assets of the three services, with their optimal application providing seamless air defence cover, which will be critical to counter the Chinese threat, experts said.“While the aerospace domain is critical for deterrence, the maritime theatre too needs integration at the earliest as our locational/geographical advantages can deter China’s aggressiveness (in the Indian Ocean region). Synergy in application of combat power is essential in new age warfare, which is multi domain and waged in many key battle spaces simultaneously,” said Bhatia. India has finally demonstrated politico-military will to address the much-needed theaterisation, he said.Read more: India conducts 'Kavach' drill in Andaman Sea to fine-tune joint war-fighting skillsRestructuring in DMA?The operational control of all the theatre commands will eventually come under CDS, with the service chiefs being responsible for raising, training and sustaining their forces.“CDS will have operational control over all the integrated commands when they are fully functional. This will be in his role as CDS, and not as permanent chairman, COSC. And whenever that happens, some restructuring will have to be carried out in DMA,” said the first official.The restructuring, he said, could involve the chief of integrated defence staff to COSC, or CISC, being appointed as the secretary of DMA in due course to allow CDS to focus on the theatre commands. CISC is a three-star officer and the number 2 man in DMA. DMA is one of the five verticals in the defence ministry, apart from the departments of defence, defence production, defence research and development and ex-service welfare.“The armed forces will also have to ensure that the transformation also factors in transition management, as we have to be present-relevant and effective as also future ready,” Bhatia said.Read more: India to kick off major drills in Andaman Sea to sharpen military synergyThe government is clear about one thing — the setting up of the integrated commands will not entail creating new infrastructure. “If you take that route, it not only adds to the financial burden but also becomes a five-year plan. The integrated commands will be created using existing infrastructure,” said the second official.The Indian military is pushing ahead with theaterisation at a time when the country faces a collusive threat from China and Pakistan. The threat isn’t just something that is a part of some strategic paper or loud thought process, but it manifests itself on the ground, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-joint-commands-to-be-launched-by-may-101613500932277.html
17-02-2021||India||Toolkit case: Some relief for activists as police defend action||Activists facing prosecution for allegedly creating and editing a social media toolkit on the farmers’ protests received some relief from the courts on Tuesday, even as Delhi Police defended its arrest of a 22-year-old woman in the case that has triggered widespread criticism from free speech advocates.The Aurangabad bench of the high court granted Beed resident Shantanu Muluk protection from arrest for 10 days on a personal bond and surety of ₹50,000. His co-accused, Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, also asked for anticipatory bail and the high court will give its decision on Wednesday.In Delhi, a magistrate’s court allowed Disha Ravi, who was arrested Saturday night and is facing a sedition charge for allegedly helping edit the document, access to a copy of the FIR, remand application, meetings with her lawyer, calls with her family, warm clothes, books, masks and home-cooked food.Read more: Disha Ravi’s arrest in 'toolkit case' unprecedented attack on democracy: Arvind KejriwalPolice said it asked Zoom to share details of a virtual meeting in January where Jacob, Ravi, Muluk and roughly 70 people allegedly fixed details of the document and protest with pro-Khalistani members. Investigators sought help from WhatsApp over a group where the document was allegedly discussed.Jacob and Muluk, who face non-bailable warrants, said they were targets of political vendetta. “Such vendetta is the dark face of authoritarianism and the real tool kit for devastation of not only democracy but also basic human rights,” Muluk’s petition read.Delhi Police say the document, first publicised by Swedish Nobel laureate Greta Thunberg in support of the farmers’ agitating against three laws, aimed to spread misinformation, incite unrest and was linked to clashes that rocked the Capital on Republic Day.Read more: Toolkit case | Zoom meet held before Republic Day to create Twitter storm: ReportBut the police’s decision to charge Bengaluru-based Ravi, a member of Thunberg’s Fridays For Future movement, with sedition, criminal conspiracy and inciting to riot, stoked allegations of muzzling dissent and procedural lapses.On Tuesday, police commissioner SN Shrivastava denied any lapses. “Disha Ravi’s arrest has been made in accordance with the law which doesn’t differentiate between a 22-year-old or a 50-year-old,” he said.Police said their investigation revealed Muluk was in Delhi between January 20 and 27. Investigators focused on a WhatsApp group named “International Farmers Strike” allegedly created on December 6 by Ravi. Police said Jacob joined the group on December 11 while pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) members joined it the following day.Muluk was added on December 6 and the trio allegedly attended a virtual meeting by PJF on January 11. The modalities of a “Global Day Action” were allegedly worked out in the meeting attended by 70 people, police said. Police wrote to Zoom and WhatsApp seeking details on the identities of participants and administrators, apart from chats, videos and documents.Read more: Toolkit case: Disha Ravi first to be arrested, many others involved, say Delhi Police“These details will help us ascertain the sequence of events leading to the creation of the Google toolkit documents and the role each participant played in it,” said a senior police officer requesting anonymity.A second police officer, who did not want to be named, said PJF founder Mo Dhaliwal contacted Ravi, Jacob and Muluk through a Canada-based woman named Puneet.“Jacob was the first one to be contacted by Puneet in the first week of December and was intimated about the PJF’s ‘bigger plans’ pertaining to the farmers’ agitation. We have reason to believe that after Jacob agreed to be part of the plan, she roped in Muluk and Disha,” the officer said. He added that the first toolkit that Thunberg posted and deleted contained the name of a man identified as Pieter Friedrich, who police claimed was associated with Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Read more: Disha Ravi can get warm clothes, masks and books in police custody, says Delhi courtThe activists rejected the charges. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, representing Jacob, said the toolkit meant to provide digital support for the farmers’ protest. “It does not talk about any violence or about the January 26 incident at the Red Fort,” Desai argued.Advocate Hiten Venegaonkar, who appeared for Delhi Police’s cyber crime unit, said Jacob was part of a larger group formed to support the protest and added the toolkit was prepared and authored by Jacob and Ravi.Muluk’s advocate said it would take him time to reach New Delhi and file an application for anticipatory bail. The petition states that he and others were only supporting the dissenters, who are farmers. The plea said the applicant was 34, had done well in his field, had a bright future, and that police action would be destructive for his life and family.In Delhi, chief metropolitan magistrate Pankaj Sharma allowed seven applications moved by Ravi. The judge allowed her to speak to her mother and family members for 15 minutes over telephone after her counsel told court that five minutes were not enough. The court also permitted Ravi’s counsel to meet her for 30 minutes every day. Besides the FIR, the court also directed the police to provide her copies of the arrest memo and remand documents used to seek her custodial interrogation.Read more: Delhi women's panel sends notice to police over Disha Ravi’s arrestPolice action in the case has come under sharp criticism from activists and experts, who argue that Delhi Police violated procedure by not informing Bengaluru police in time, producing Ravi in a local court or providing her with a lawyer. The toolkit first hit the headlines two weeks ago when Thunberg shared it on social media along with a post in support of the agitating farmers. Shortly afterwards, Delhi Police registered an FIR on charges of criminal conspiracy and sedition, but did not name any individual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toolkit-case-some-relief-for-activists-as-police-defend-action-101613501021410.html
17-02-2021||India||Army releases new visuals showing Pangong Tso disengagement in top gear||Fresh visuals released by the Indian Army on Tuesday showed that disengagement in eastern Ladakh’s Pangong Tso sector is in top gear, with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers dismantling their bunkers, tented camps and pillboxes, and retreating from barren heights on both banks of the lake to vehicles waiting at the nearest road-heads to carry them back to their bases.This forms part of the February 10 agreement on disengagement between India and China that makes it binding on the two sides to remove structures they constructed on the mountains after April 2020 when border tensions began.The new visuals showed PLA using earth-moving machinery to level structures built by it to support forward-deployed troops on heights. Disengagement between rival soldiers deployed on heights on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso began on February 10, and will be completed by the weekend, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.New images show disengagement in top gear in Pangong Tso sector. pic.twitter.com/6N5kYcVqaeThe images also captured what the areas looked like before and after the disengagement. One of the several images released showed a group of Chinese soldiers in battle fatigues lugging a portable generator from a bunker.Armoured and artillery elements of both armies retreated to their respective positions from heights on the south bank last week. The Army released some new images of rival tanks disengaging from heights on the south bank.The pictures give an idea of the scale and extent of the deployment, build-up and heavy equipment like tanks that were employed in the standoff, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“I have maintained that the start of the disengagement process is a positive step as it separates the two forces from an eyeball-to-eyeball situation that could trigger some local incident. We have a long way to go but at least the first step has been taken,” Hooda added.Also read: Karnataka imposes restrictions on travel from Kerala amid Covid spike in B'luruThe last three days saw the PLA remove a jetty near Finger 5 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, take down structures at a make-shift helipad and dismantle scores of observations towers, bunkers and shelters.“Both sides have pulled back a large number of their troops deployed on heights on the two banks. Some concrete structures are being dismantled. Disengagement is progressing smoothly and will be over in the next three to four days,” officials familiar with the developments said.Senior commanders of the two armies are likely to meet next week to discuss disengagement at other friction points in eastern Ladakh.Smooth disengagement in the Pangong Tso area augurs well for subsequent disengagement at other friction points, Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director-general of military operations, said last week.The disengagement will be phased, coordinated and verified at all friction points, and could be a time-consuming process. “As long as disengagement is successful, time is not of the essence,” Bhatia had said then.The PLA is retreating to its base, east of Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, while the Indian Army is moving back to its permanent position near Finger 3. Neither side will patrol the contested areas in between until an agreement is reached through future talks.Outstanding problems with the PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra - friction points on the contested border - will be tackled after full disengagement in the Pangong Tso area.The outstanding issues relating to the deployment and patrolling at the three friction points will be taken up within 48 hours of the pullback of troops in the Pangong Tso area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-releases-new-visuals-showing-pangong-tso-disengagement-in-top-gear-101613485806619.html
