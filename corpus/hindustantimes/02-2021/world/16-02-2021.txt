The signers welcomed the Biden administration's release of some hurricane recovery funds, but said $50 billion more was needed.Biden campaigned against the "current untenable situation" in Puerto Rico and pledged to boost federal disaster aid, end discriminatory practices, and rebuild the island's "significantly deficient infrastructure."But his administration has not yet scrapped the Justice Department's lawsuit under former President Donald Trump to block an April 2020 federal appeals court ruling allowing eligible Puerto Ricans to apply for supplemental Social Security benefits.The Justice Department declined to comment. No comment was immediately available from the White House.The benefits had been available to any U.S. citizen living in any of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Mariana Islands, but not Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, said the letter was intended to galvanize action by the Biden administration to help Puerto Ricans, who have faced "crisis after crisis, disaster after disaster" over the past decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-urged-to-end-trump-lawsuit-blocking-payments-to-puerto-ricans-101613496434229.html
16-02-2021||World||New York City's rich neighbourhoods get an outsize share of Covid vaccines||New York City’s vaccines are disproportionately going to wealthier neighborhoods in Manhattan and Staten Island, according to data the city released Tuesday.The disparities highlight the inequities of a vaccine drive that has already been criticized for what New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called “profound” racial disparities.White residents composed almost half the people who had gotten at least one dose, despite being only a third of the population. More than a quarter of those getting the Covid-19 vaccine are nonresidents, who tend to be younger and are more likely to be White than those living in the city.“We have a lot of work to do,” de Blasio said. “A lot of this is about underlying painful disparities and inequalities to begin with. Folks who have more privilege are best able to navigate this process. Folks who have more confidence in the vaccine are going to go through more effort to get it.”While 7% of of adult residents across Manhattan are fully vaccinated, only 3% of Brooklyn residents are, city data shows. The second-most-vaccinated borough is Staten Island, where 9% of adult residents are partially vaccinated and 6% have had both shots.“Just as we’ve seen a much smaller portion of vaccines going to Black and brown New Yorkers, we see these geographic disparities bearing out as well,” said Torian Easterling, chief equity officer of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. “Staten Island and Manhattan have the highest vaccination rates, while the South Bronx, parts of central Queens and central Brooklyn lag behind.”Equitable EffortNew York City has been prioritizing health-care workers, the elderly and essential workers for immunization. Officials have pledged to carry out the country’s most equitable vaccine rollout, and said Tuesday that the data provided a guide on how to that.De Blasio said that 77% of the city’s vaccination sites are in 33 hard-hit neighborhoods. “We definitely want to go a lot deeper,” he said.He said supply shortages and vaccine hesitancy also play a part. “Folks who have been doing very well in this society also have a high level of confidence in the vaccine,” de Blasio said.The mayor said the city will be creating new vaccine centers in Brooklyn’s Brownsville and East New York sections, where only about 3% of residents have received first doses.Wealthy sections in Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx show a different picture: More than a quarter of adults on City Island have received first doses, while 13% of adults in Riverdale have. More than 10% of adults in parts of Manhattan’s Upper East Side and Upper West Side have been vaccinated, compared with about 6% in parts of Washington Heights and 3% in Harlem.New York City recorded the highest number of vaccine doses administered last week since the inoculation drive began in December, doling out more than 317,000 shots, de Blasio said Tuesday.The city still has a long way to go to cover its more than 8 million residents. New York had administered nearly 1.3 million total vaccine doses as of Sunday, including 870,6000 first doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-s-rich-neighbourhoods-get-an-outsize-share-of-covid-vaccines-101613495824918.html
16-02-2021||World||Nepal PM Oli blames ruling party leaders tried to form parallel government||Defending his move to dissolve the House of Representatives, Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has blamed some leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) for attempting to form a "parallel government".Oli made the comments while highlighting the major achievements of the government during his address from the prime minister’s office in Singha Durbar on the occasion of the third anniversary of the government on Monday.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after Oli, in a surprise move, dissolved the House of Representatives, amidst a tussle for power with his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'. His move to dissolve the 275-member House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party.The Prachanda-led faction has been holding anti-government protest rallies and public gatherings in various parts of the country, including Kathmandu.Both Prachanda and the rival Oli group claim to control the Nepal Communist Party and the issue is being disputed at the Election Commission.Oli said that his government had been facing obstacles similar to that of a coalition government for the past one year.Blaming his own party colleagues, he defended his move to dissolve the House, saying that some leaders of the party attempted to form a "parallel government".Oli also blamed the rival faction of the party for obstructing the process of the endorsement of various bills, recommendations for the vacant position in various constitutional bodies and hearing in parliament.“Such an inappropriate act was purely an exercise of a parallel government,” he said.On the occasion, Oli mentioned the implementation of constitution and federalism; putting in place the necessary policies and legal arrangements and the encouraging overall economic situation in the country as his government’s major achievements.The government has achieved rapid progress in the post-earthquake reconstruction; and the encouraging progress made in the education, health and social security sectors, Oli said.The prime minister said that the size of public spending has increased nearly 29 per cent and the size of the public budget too has grown by 186 per cent. The per capita income has increased by 23.6 per cent to 1,097 USD. More than 900,000 people have been taken out of absolute poverty.“If there weren't Covid-19, this number would cross 1.5 million," he said.He said the UN Human Development Report shows that the Human Development Index has increased by more than five percentage points, poverty has not increased and there is no hunger in Nepal.He added that 559,461 private houses damaged by the 2015 earthquake have been rebuilt and that 95 per cent of the quake-damaged government buildings have already been reconstructed.Oli had earlier said he was forced to dissolve the House after knowing that the Prachanda-led faction was planning to file a no-confidence motion against him and introduce an impeachment motion against President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Oli-led CPN-UML and Prachanda-led NCP (Maoist Centre) merged in May 2018 to form a unified Nepal Communist Party following victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections.The Prachanda-led faction, which is currently launching agitation to get official recognition from the Election Commission as the legitimate NCP, held a massive rally last week in a bid to show its strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-blames-ruling-party-leaders-tried-to-form-parallel-government-101613495939541.html

Security Council meeting on Iraq that one of the highest barriers to creating a conducive environment for credible, peaceful and inclusive elections "is the presence of armed militias, violent extremists and spoilers.""A conducive environment means that we must address Iran-backed militias and Iran's destabilizing activities in Iraq, as well as the remaining ISIS (Islamic State) elements," Mills told the 15-member council."These groups undermine the public's trust in the government, and in the October 2021 elections. They're killing Iraqi citizens and depriving Iraq of much-needed economic relief and foreign investment. No one is immune," he said.A rocket attack on U.S.-led forces in northern Iraq on Monday killed a civilian contractor and injured a U.S. service member. The attack was claimed by a group that some Iraqi officials say has links with Iran.The United States has about 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq."Such reckless attempts to inflame tensions pose grave threats to Iraq's stability. Close collaboration between Baghdad and Erbil, to bring the culprits to justice, is now of the greatest importance," U.N. Iraq special envoy Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert told the Security Council on Tuesday.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration pledged to be a steady, reliable partner for Iraq, Mills said."Among its top priorities, the United States will seek to help Iraq assert its sovereignty in the face of enemies at home and abroad, by preventing an ISIS resurgence and working toward Iraq's stability," he said."For the United States this means supporting Iraq's efforts to hold credible inclusive and peaceful elections," Mills said.(Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Dan Grebler)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-meddling-must-be-tackled-before-iraq-elections-us-tells-un-101613495791684.html
16-02-2021||World||‘No excuse’: Researcher questions US' strategy over evolving coronavirus variants||After researchers identified evolving variants of the coronavirus in the US, a virologist studying the mutations said that there’s “really no excuse” why the country has not sequenced more samples to obtain additional data on the virus. Jeremy Kamil, an author of the study in which seven new variants carrying similar troubling variants were identified, said that the US has not done enough to get continuously updated with the mutations of the virus.“Our study identified seven [mutations], but there's a giant family tree of the coronavirus in humans as it spilled into us. And our country has really not done enough to keep up to date or keep up tabs on what the virus is doing,” Kamil, an associate professor at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, told CNN.The study has not been peer-reviewed yet but the scientists are rushing online to quickly share the information with other experts. The researchers believe that the evolution favours the particular genetic stretch, named 677, given the similarity of the mutations.“In late January of 2021, our two independent SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance programs...noticed increasing numbers of...viruses carrying an S:Q677P mutation, and that this variant had increased in frequency in samples collected in late 2020 to mid-January,” the researchers wrote in the study published in pre-print sever.Read | The coronavirus may not be able to mutate beyond controlThey identified seven similar mutations at 677 and named them after American birds for ease of discussion and to avoid geographically-associated names or nicknames. One of the variants, Robin 1, has been detected in more than 30 US states but predominates in the Midwest. Another variant which first appeared in an October 6 sample from Alabama has been named “Robin 2”, owing to its similarity to the parental Robin 1 sub-lineage. “This cluster contains 303 sequences, and is found mostly in the Southeast,” they wrote.“I think the bigger message is that we need to be doing a better job -- and a more even job -- sequencing the virus so we can know whether there are changes to be concerned about or not,” said Kamil.The United States has reported more than 27 million coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and over 480,000 related deaths so far, the highest across the world, according to Coronavirus Resource Center of Johns Hopkins University & Medicine. Although the number of daily cases has been on a decline, a senior White House Covid-19 adviser said that the drop could be misleading and the virus could have “a lot of surprises in store for us.”“Ultimately, science will win here, ultimately, we will beat this...but I don’t think we’re anywhere close to out of the woods,” Andy Slavitt told MSNBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-excuse-researcher-questions-us-strategy-over-evolving-coronavirus-variants-101613492732104.html

16-02-2021||World||House Democrat sues Trump, Giuliani over role in Capitol riot||A Democratic congressman accused Donald Trump in a federal lawsuit on Tuesday of inciting the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol and of conspiring with his lawyer and extremist groups to try to prevent the Senate from certifying the results of the presidential election he lost to Joe Biden.The lawsuit from Mississippi's Rep. Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is part of an expected wave of litigation over the Jan. 6 riot and is believed to be the first filed by a member of Congress. It seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages.The case also names as defendants the Republican former president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and groups including the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, extremist organizations that had members charged by the Justice Department with taking part in the siege.Lawyers for Trump have denied that he incited the riot. A Trump adviser didn't immediately comment about the lawsuit on Tuesday, and a lawyer for Giuliani did not immediately return an email seeking comment.The suit, filed in federal court in Washington under a Reconstruction-era law known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, comes three days after Trump was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial that centered on allegations that he incited the riot, in which five people died. That acquittal is likely to open the door to fresh legal scrutiny over Trump's actions before and during the siege.Even some Republicans who voted to acquit Trump on Saturday acknowledged that the more proper venue to deal with Trump was in the courts, especially now that he has left the White House and lost certain legal protections that shielded him as president.The suit traces the drawn-out effort by Trump and Giuliani to cast doubt on the election results even though courts across the country, and state election officials, repeatedly rejected their baseless allegations of fraud. Despite evidence to the contrary, the suit says, the men portrayed the election as stolen while Trump “endorsed rather than discouraged" threats of violence from his angry supporters in the weeks leading up to the assault on the Capitol.“The carefully orchestrated series of events that unfolded at the Save America rally and the storming of the Capitol was no accident or coincidence,” the suit says. “It was the intended and foreseeable culmination of a carefully coordinated campaign to interfere with the legal process required to confirm the tally of votes cast in the Electoral College.”Presidents are historically afforded broad immunity from lawsuits for actions they take in their role as commander in chief. But the lawsuit filed Tuesday was brought against Trump in his personal, not official, capacity and alleges that none of the behavior at issue had to do with his responsibilities as president.“Inciting a riot, or attempting to interfere with the congressional efforts to ratify the results of the election that are commended by the Constitution, could not conceivably be within the scope of ordinary responsibilities of the president,” Joseph Sellers, a Washington lawyer who along with the NAACP filed the lawsuit on Thompson’s behalf, said in an interview.“In this respect, because of his conduct, he is just like any other private citizen,” Sellers said.Though the impeachment case focused squarely on accusations of incitement, the lawsuit more broadly accuses Trump of conspiring to disrupt the constitutional activities of Congress — namely, the certification of election results establishing Biden as the rightful winner — through a monthslong effort to discredit the outcome and to lean on individual states and his own vice president to overturn the contest.The case against Trump was brought under a provision of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which was passed in response to KKK violence and prohibits violence or intimidation meant to prevent Congress or other federal officials from carrying out their constitutional duties.“Fortunately, this hasn't been used very much," Sellers said. “But what we see here is so unprecedented that it's really reminiscent of what gave rise to the enactment of this legislation right after the Civil War.”The suit cites incendiary comments that Trump and Giuliani made in the weeks leading up to the riot and on the day of it that lawyers say were designed to mobilize supporters to work to overturn the election results and to prevent the Senate's certification process. That process was temporarily interrupted when Trump loyalists broke into the Capitol.Trump told supporters at a rally preceding the riot to “ fight like hell,” but lawyers for the former president adamantly denied during the impeachment trial that he had incited the riot. They pointed to a remark during his speech in which he told the crowd to behave “peacefully” that day. Defense lawyers are likely to revisit those assertions in the lawsuit. They may also argue, as was done during the impeachment case, that Trump's speech was protected by the First Amendment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-democrat-sues-trump-giuliani-over-role-in-capitol-riot-101613489633516.html

Here's the list||The World Health Organization has asked six African countries to be alert for possible Ebola infections, as Guinea on Tuesday reported new cases and Democratic Republic of Congo said its new infections were a resurgence of a previous outbreak.Guinea declared an outbreak of the virus on Sunday in the first return of the disease there since the 2013-2016 outbreak, while Congo has confirmed four new cases this month.Health authorities have rushed to respond to the cases in Guinea, anxious to prevent a repeat of the last outbreak in West Africa, which killed more than 11,300 people, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in the worst Ebola epidemic on record."We have already alerted the six countries around, including of course Sierra Leone and Liberia, and they are moving very fast to prepare and be ready and to look for any potential infection," the WHO's Margaret Harris told a Geneva briefing on Tuesday.Read | Ebola outbreak in Guinea: Symptoms, modes of transmission | All you need to knowSix CountriesGuinea's neighbours include Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Liberia.Guinea has so far recorded up to 10 suspected cases of Ebola and five deaths. Since declaring the outbreak on Sunday, it has identified 115 contacts of the known cases in the southeastern city of Nzerekore and 10 in the capital Conakry, the health ministry said on Tuesday.Gene sequencing of Ebola samples from both Congo and Guinea is being carried out to learn more about the origins of the outbreaks and identify the strains, according to the WHO.As a result, Congo has confirmed that its latest cases are not linked to a new Ebola variant but represent a resurgence of its tenth outbreak, the second-largest on record that caused more than 2,200 deaths in 2018-2020."As for the infection, we're not yet able to identify its origin," said provincial health minister Eugene Nzanzu Salita, referring to how the first person to fall sick in this resurgence caught the virus.Since the devastating epidemic in West Africa, the development of vaccines and treatments has greatly improved survival rates and containment efforts.Further spread of the disease could cripple the regions' under-funded health systems which are also battling the coronavirus pandemic. Ivory Coast, Mali and Sierra Leone have launched plans to stop any potential spread and reinforced border controls.The Ebola virus can cause severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids. It has a much higher death rate than Covid-19, but unlike the coronavirus it is not transmitted by asymptomatic carriers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-alerts-six-african-countries-after-ebola-outbreaks-here-s-the-list-101613484712633.html

He was discharged and stripped of his medals in 1993 on the grounds that his conduct was “prejudicial to good order and naval discipline,” even though he had sought to keep his sexuality secret.He was forced to admit his sexuality during a court martial that found him guilty of being in bed with another man, a charge he always denied.Ousalice fought to have his medals returned but was unsuccessful until he took legal action against the Ministry of Defense in May of 2019. The ministry settled the case in December of that year, apologizing to Ousalice and promising to return the medals of other veterans in similar situations.“The Navy was my life and I loved it,” Ousalice said the day his decorations were returned. “I spent 18 years serving before losing my medal and having my rank and pension reduced, and I know there are many like me who deserve to have this injustice recognized.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-return-medals-to-veterans-discharged-because-of-sexuality-101613481454522.html

16-02-2021||World||North Korea hackers targeted vaccine technology: S Korea spy agency||North Korean hackers attempted to steal information about coronavirus vaccines and treatments, South Korea’s intelligence service said Tuesday, but it denied a lawmaker's claim that vaccine maker Pfizer Inc. was targeted.Earlier Tuesday, Ha Tae-keung, a member of parliament’s intelligence committee, told reporters that the National Intelligence Service told him and other lawmakers during a closed-door briefing that North Korea hacked Pfizer to obtain Covid-19 vaccine technology.After Ha’s comments made headlines, the NIS said it didn’t mention any pharmaceutical company by name when it told lawmakers that North Korean hackers were going after coronavirus vaccine information. In an unusual rebuke, the NIS public affairs office called Ha’s comments “wrong.”Ha stood by his claim when contacted by The Associated Press, saying the NIS documents he was shown said that “North Korea stole Pfizer (vaccine information) and attempted to steal (technology) from South Korean vaccine and pharmaceutical firms.” He said the lawmakers were required to return the documents at the end of the briefing.Ha said the wording about Pfizer “was so clear that I didn’t even ask about that verbally” during the briefing.The NIS, which has a mixed record on confirming developments in North Korea, rarely comments on North Korea-related information it provides to lawmakers at private briefings. Ha suggested the NIS was likely trying not to anger North Korea too much.Kwon Bo-young, a public relations manager at Pfizer’s South Korean office, said in text message that it was checking Ha’s claim with its global headquarters.Ha is one of the two executive secretaries of the intelligence committees whose responsibilities include relaying the content of private NIS briefings at parliament to journalists.The office of Kim Byung-kee, the other executive secretary at the intelligence committee, didn’t immediately respond to a request to verify Ha’s comments.While North Korea has denied involvement, it has been linked to a slew of prominent cyberattacks in recent years, including a 2013 campaign that paralyzed the servers of South Korean financial institutions, the 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures, and the WannaCry malware attack of 2017.Acquiring coronavirus vaccines is crucial for North Korea, whose public health care system is in shambles. Many outside experts are highly skeptical about North Korea’s claims to have had no coronavirus cases but say the country likely has avoided a widespread outbreak thanks to more than a year of stringent lockdowns.An international health group established to promote global access to coronavirus vaccines said earlier this month that North Korea could potentially receive 1.9 million doses of vaccines manufactured in India during the first half of the year.The World Health Organization-backed Covax said in a forecast that the supplies going to North Korea will likely be provided by India’s Serum Institute, which is licensed to produce vaccines that AstraZeneca developed with the University of Oxford.The current South Korean government of President Moon Jae-in espouses rapprochement with North Korea and a negotiated settlement of the global standoff over North Korea’s nuclear program. Moon was a driving force behind now-dormant nuclear diplomacy between North Korea and the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-hackers-targeted-vaccine-technology-s-korea-spy-agency-101613479112617.html
16-02-2021||World||Hamas condemns Israel over blocking Covid vaccines to Gaza||Hamas on Tuesday blasted Israel's refusal to allow some 2,000 coronavirus vaccine doses destined for Gaza health workers through its blockade of the territory as a "violation" of international law.The Palestinian Authority, based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, had planned to send the Russian Sputnik V doses through Israel to Gaza, a separate territory run by Islamist movement Hamas.But on Monday evening, the PA health ministry said Israel had blocked the delivery.Israel's move marked "a real crime and a violation of all international laws and humanitarian standards," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said.COGAT, the Israeli military department that runs civil affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, said Monday that the PA had requested to transfer 1,000 vaccine doses to Gaza but that "this request is waiting for a political decision".The Palestinian Authority on Tuesday urged the World Health Organization to "condemn Israel" for the obstruction.The PA called on the WHO and other international organisations "to hold (Israel) fully responsible for the dangers arising from preventing the entry of vaccines into the Gaza Strip," spokesman Ibrahim Melhem said.The PA said Monday that its own vaccination campaign for the general public had been pushed back due to a delay in deliveries.It had been anticipating a shipment by the middle of this month, enabling it to start vaccinating the general public in the West Bank while sharing stock with Hamas.The PA is expecting some two million doses ordered from various manufacturers, in addition to vaccines from the UN-backed Covax programme, set up to help less wealthy nations procure vaccines.It began inoculating frontline healthcare workers earlier this month with an initial procurement of 10,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, as well as several thousand doses of the Moderna product.Israel, which is carrying out one of the world's fastest vaccination campaigns per capita, has faced international calls to share its stocks with Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank and blockaded Gaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hamas-condemns-israel-over-blocking-covid-vaccines-to-gaza-101613479137051.html
16-02-2021||World||Prez Biden to pitch stimulus bill in Wisconsin, US state hard hit by pandemic||U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday to press his case for a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill in the political battleground state that helped secure his victory in last year's presidential election.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last week that Biden would do a CNN town hall with voters while visiting the state, hard hit by the pandemic and its economic fallout."That's an opportunity to hear directly from people about how the dual crises are impacting them," she told reporters.Biden has traveled to his home state of Delaware and to the Camp David presidential retreat since taking office on Jan. 20, but the trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city, is his first on official business since becoming commander-in-chief.The state, which has 10 Electoral College votes, sided with the Democratic president over Donald Trump, then the Republican incumbent, by a narrow margin in the November election.With the U.S. Senate having acquitted Trump in his second impeachment trial on Saturday, the White House is eager to press ahead with Biden's agenda on the economy, fighting Covid-19, curbing climate change and addressing racial inequality.Biden wants Congress to pass his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill in the coming weeks in order to get $1,400 stimulus checks out to Americans and bolster unemployment payments.The White House strategy to promote the package and other policy goals involves getting out to voters. Having been vaccinated for the coronavirus, Biden, 78, is stepping up his travel in coming days.On Thursday he will visit Michigan, another political swing state, to see a Pfizer manufacturing site and talk to workers involved in making the company's Covid-19 vaccine. Its 16 Electoral College votes also contributed to Biden's election win.Wisconsin had supported Democratic presidential candidates for nearly two decades before backing Trump in 2016, helping him defeat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In 2020, it helped give Biden a 306-232 vote edge in the Electoral College.The president faces resistance from Republicans over the high price tag of the stimulus bill. Biden and his allies have argued that going "big" will help boost the economy and bring the pandemic under control in a country where more than 485,000 people have died from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prez-biden-to-pitch-stimulus-bill-in-wisconsin-us-state-hard-hit-by-pandemic-101613478848719.html
16-02-2021||World||NATO to agree larger Iraq training force as violence rises||NATO defence ministers are set to expand the military alliance's training mission in Iraq once the coronavirus pandemic eases, senior officials and diplomats said, potentially cementing a broader role for the Atlantic alliance in the Middle East.Ministers are set to agree plans on Thursday during a video conference, potentially taking the mission from its current maximum of some 500 troops to around 4,000 or 5,000, four diplomats said.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday he expected defence ministers to agree to an expanded mission, with more allied personnel working in more security institutions across Iraq."The mission will expand gradually, in response to the situation," he said.NATO has had a non-combat, "train-and-advise" mission in Baghdad since October 2018 but plans to expand it were delayed, in part, by Covid-19 and also due to concerns about regional stability after a U.S. drone killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad on Jan. 3. 2020.Earlier expansion plans were mainly in response to a demand by then-U.S. President Donald Trump for NATO to do more in the Middle East. This time, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief and U.S. ally who took office in May, is eager to have a greater NATO presence in the country at a time of rising insecurity, diplomats said.A rocket attack on U.S.-led forces in northern Iraq killed a civilian contractor on Monday and injured a U.S. service member, in the deadliest such incident in almost a year.Paramilitary groups aligned with Iran in Iraq and Yemen have launched attacks against the United States and its Arab allies in recent weeks, including a drone attack on a Saudi airport and a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.NATO will likely take over some of the training activities carried out by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. The allied mission, involving allies including Britain, Turkey and Denmark and led by a Danish commander, is seen as more acceptable to Iraqis than a U.S. training force, diplomats said.Currently, the NATO mission only trains and advises members of the Iraqi security institutions and forces who are under the direct control of the Iraqi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-to-agree-larger-iraq-training-force-as-violence-rises-101613477701783.html
16-02-2021||World||China arrests kingpin of fake Covid vaccine gang||China has arrested dozens of suspects including the kingpin of a gang who packaged and sold thousands of doses of fake Covid-19 vaccines in the country and abroad, state media reports said.The leader of the gang, identified as Kong, packaged some 58,000 doses of saline and mineral water solutions as anti-Covid vaccine and sold them in batches including to unidentified countries. They made profit worth some 18million yuan ($2.78mn).Kong closely studied the design of vaccine packages available in the market and online before launching the multi-million-dollar fraud, official news agency Xinhua said in a report.The report did not say to which country the fake vaccines were smuggled to.Though the racket was busted last year, and formal arrests were made weeks ago, the information about the fake vaccine racket was only released by the government this week.At least 70 people have been arrested in similar fake vaccine scandals until early this month, the report added.Police from several provinces including capital Beijing were involved in the investigation, raids and arrests, the report said.The suspects had been profiting from the illegal manufacturing and sales of the vaccines since as early as September 2020, it has emerged.Kong and his accomplices allegedly told potential buyers that the vaccines were sourced through channels working within real vaccine manufacturers; some batches were sold at inflated prices to hospitals.“The police investigations showed much of the counterfeit vaccines were merely saline solutions scalped at a very high price. Some of the fake vaccines were smuggled out of the country, which has tarnished Chinese brand vaccines,” the Xinhua report added.China’s top agency for investigation and prosecution, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate on Monday asked procuratorates across the country to cooperate with public security authorities to crackdown on crimes involving the production and sale of counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines.China, which had given 40.52 million doses of vaccine to key groups of people by February 9, has largely managed to bring the Covid-19 pandemic under control – notwithstanding a few localised outbreaks recently - with strict lockdowns, testing and contact tracing measures.China had plans to vaccinate 50 million citizens before the start of the ongoing Lunar New Year holiday but seems to have fallen short of the target.A state media report said last week that China is providing vaccine aid to 53 developing countries and exporting vaccines to 22 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-arrests-kingpin-of-fake-covid-vaccine-gang-101613476916594.html
16-02-2021||World||UK set for new laws to protect free speech on campus||Britain is set to introduce new laws guaranteeing freedom of speech in universities to counteract what the government on Tuesday called "unacceptable silencing and censoring" on campuses.As part of the plans, the government is considering appointing a "free speech champion" to investigate possible breaches of the right to expression, while academics who lose their jobs in similar disputes may be able to claim compensation."I am deeply worried about the chilling effect on campuses of unacceptable silencing and censoring," said education minister Gavin Williamson."That is why we must strengthen free speech in higher education, by bolstering the existing legal duties and ensuring strong, robust action is taken if these are breached."However, the government was accused of exploiting culture wars, after itself launching a pushback against the toppling of slavery-era statues and efforts to educate Britons about their colonial past, in the wake of last year's Black Lives Matter protests.Just six events out of almost 10,000 involving an external speaker were cancelled over the speakers' views in 2019-20, according to a survey in December by the group Wonkhe, which analyses higher education policy."The government has tapped into a wider push by conservatives, right-leaning libertarians and 'classical liberals' to combat 'cancel culture' and the supposed 'woke left' agenda that they claim has led to a crisis of free speech in Britain," Australian historian Evan Smith wrote on the Wonkhe site.Smith, who published a book last year about campus free-speech rows, added that "similar claims (are) being made in the US, Australia, Canada and France."The government proposals were slammed by Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, which represents staff in higher education."It is extraordinary that in the midst of a global pandemic the government appears more interested in fighting phantom threats to free speech than taking action to contain the real and present danger which the virus poses to staff and students," she said.But a group of senior academics welcomed the proposals in a letter to The Times."In recent years, too many academics have been marginalised because they hold unorthodox views on issues like gender, Brexit and the legacy of empire," said the letter, organised by high-profile political commentator Matthew Goodwin.Speakers to have been "no-platformed" at universities include Brexit politician Nigel Farage, Canadian academic Jordan Peterson, leading feminists Julie Bindel and Selina Todd, philosopher Roger Scruton and former interior minister Amber Rudd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-set-for-new-laws-to-protect-free-speech-on-campus-101613471767669.html
16-02-2021||World||Myanmar police file new charge against Aung San Suu Kyi||Police in Myanmar filed a new charge against ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, her lawyer said Tuesday, which may allow her to be held indefinitely without trial.Lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters after meeting with a judge in a court in the capital, Naypyitaw, that Suu Kyi has been charged with violating Article 25 of the Natural Disaster Management Law, which has been used to prosecute people who have broken coronavirus restrictions.Suu Kyi, who was ousted in a military coup on Feb. 1, has already been charged with possessing walkie-talkies that were imported without being registered.The maximum punishment for the Covid-19 violation is three years’ imprisonment. However, the new charge may allow her to be held indefinitely without trial because a change in the Penal Code instituted by the junta last week permits detention without court permission.Ousted President Win Myint was charged under the same law when he and Suu Kyi were detained during the army's takeover. Suu Kyi held the top government post with the title of state counsellor.Groups of demonstrators turned out in Yangon and other cities on Tuesday to protest the coup and demand that Suu Kyi and members of her ousted government be freed from detention.In Yangon, police blocked off the street in front of the Central Bank, which protesters have targeted amid speculation online that the military is seeking to seize money from them.Buddhist monks demonstrated outside the U.N.'s local office.The protests are taking place in defiance of an order banning gatherings of five or more people.Around 3,000 demonstrators – mainly students – returned to the streets in Mandalay, the country's second biggest city, carrying posters of Suu Kyi and shouting for the return of democracy.Security presence was low-key around the march, with most police guarding key buildings in the city, such as state banks branches.Suu Kyi's lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, told reporters he had not arrived at the court in time to see a videoconference the judge said had been held with Suu Kyi. The lawyer said he has not yet seen his client.The court’s videoconference was unexpected because it had only announced a hearing on Wednesday on the walkie-talkie charge.On Monday in Mandalay, soldiers and police violently broke up a gathering of more than 1,000 protesters in front of the Myanmar Economic Bank. They attacked the protesters with slingshots and sticks, and police could be seen aiming long guns into the air amid sounds that resembled gunfire. Local media reported rubber bullets were fired into the crowd and that a few people were injured.The government ordered internet access blocked on Sunday and Monday nights without giving a reason. It has in the past few weeks imposed selective and ineffective blocks on social media platforms and prepared a draft internet law that would criminalize many online activities.There is also widespread speculation that the government is installing a firewall system that can monitor or block most or all online activity.State media were acknowledging the protest movement with indirect references. The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported about a meeting of the State Administration Council, the new top governing body, and quoted its chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, saying the authorities “are handling the ongoing problems with care.”It said the council discussed taking legal action against protesters, providing “true information” to the media, and resuming public transport, an apparent reference to strikes and slowdowns by truckers and state railway workers.The newspaper also said the council members discussed acting against a “parallel government" established by some elected lawmakers of Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, who were prevented from taking their seats when the military stopped Parliament from opening its session Feb. 1.The self-styled Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw has 15 members who met online and said they have enough support to convene Parliament. It stakes a claim to being the sole legitimate government institution and has appealed to foreign powers and the U.N. and other multilateral institutions for recognition, with no known positive responses. Committee members believe warrants have been issued for their arrests.The military contends there was fraud in last year’s election, which Suu Kyi’s party won in a landslide, and says it will hold power for a year before holding new elections. The state election commission found no evidence to support the claims of fraud.The military says its takeover is legitimate under a 2008 constitution that was drafted under military rule and ensures the army maintains ultimate control over the country. The U.N., U.S. and other governments have urged it to return power to the elected government and release Suu Kyi and other detainees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-police-file-new-charge-against-aung-san-suu-kyi-101613471923667.html
16-02-2021||World||Plummeting Covid-19 cases in US show a path to crushing the pandemic||Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are dropping dramatically across the US, suggesting that measures to interrupt transmission are working, at least for now.More than 27.6 million Americans have tested positive, likely giving them some degree of immunity. A rising number -- 11.8% of the population -- has now received at least one dose of a vaccine. And data gathered from mobile phones suggest people are being more cautious day-to-day. If cases keep falling, it could buy time for the vaccination effort to take hold in the warm summer months ahead, potentially underpinning a long-sought economic recovery.Health experts, though, anticipate challenges. Inoculations need to outpace highly contagious variants from the UK and South Africa that are now in the US. And the upcoming holidays -- Spring Break, Easter and Mother’s Day included -- hold the threat of group gatherings that can swiftly boost the virus’s spread.“The history of surges is they do come down,” said Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco. “They generally come down from some combination of changes in behavior, changes in government policy and the impact of immunity.”Infectious disease experts agree it’s way too early to call an end to the pandemic. The declines follow a surge tied to the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season, and infection levels remain roughly on par with trends from last fall at around 91,000 new cases confirmed daily.Rochelle Walensky, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Sunday rang a warning bell. “We are nowhere out of the woods,” she said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” adding that “now is the time to double down” on mitigation efforts.If those efforts are relaxed “with increasingly transmissible variants out there,” she said, “we could be in a much more difficult spot.”Walensky’s warning comes as some states, including Iowa and Montana, ease mandates on mask wearing and as the CDC emphasizes that tamping down community spread is key to safely reopening schools -- a priority of the Biden administration.Early on, the country experienced regional surges in the northeast last spring, Sun Belt states in the summer and Midwest and Western states through the fall. However, the latest surge worsened nearly everywhere in January, producing the deadliest month so far.Dead SilenceSince then, the numbers have leveled off or declined. Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics at the University of Washington’s Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, said that after the holiday surge, Americans began to behave much more cautiously.“If you look at our data, the week after Thanksgiving, the week after Christmas, it was dead silence,” Mokdad said. “People stayed at home, even cell-phone calls went down.”The country is still far short of herd immunity, the time when the country has so much protection from the dominant strain that it can no longer spread effectively. That will likely require 70% to 85% of the 330 million Americans be either vaccinated or have natural protection, experts say.At the present vaccination rate, enough doses will have been administered by Spring Break in mid-March to cover about 15% of the US population with two doses, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. By Easter Sunday, that will rise to about 20% and by Mother’s Day enough shots could be given to cover close to 30% of Americans. And these estimates, based on vaccination rates over the last week, should rise substantially as more vaccine supply becomes available.UK VariantStill, the highly-contagious UK variant, known by scientists as B.1.1.7, is already tied to about 1% to 4% of US infections and is predicted to become the dominant strain by late March or April, according to Gregory Armstrong, director of the Advanced Molecular Detection Program at the CDC.That may set up a race between vaccine dispersals, which are likely to rise, and the ability of the virus to spread among Americans who aren’t yet immunized, some experts say.Armstrong emphasized in an interview that the mutation today remains at relatively low levels. Even if the UK variant -- which is believed to be 50% more transmissible -- accounted for 10% of all known infections, it would drive cases up by just 5%, according to Armstrong.That’s “small enough that we’re not even going to be able to detect it,” Armstrong said.Still, as the variant becomes more prevalent, adherence to measures like mask-wearing, social distancing and vaccination will have to be even better to prevent infections from increasing, he added.California MutationResearchers at Cedars-Sinai recently claimed to have found a US variant in California linked to the holiday season in Los Angeles. That finding has prompted new concern about the role being played to date by the new mutations.“There’s no consensus yet on what to think of that,” Armstrong said. “Across the U.S., what’s happened in the last several months, this surge that peaked in the beginning of January, a lot of people have looked at this and have not seen anything in the virus itself that would explain it.”In contrast, B.1.1.7 already made up about 80% of cases in parts of the UK by the time early concerns were raised about it, Armstrong said.The US, however, lags behind many other countries, including the UK, in its genomic surveillance, in which scientists use genetic data to track the spread of different strains of a disease.Counter PressureIn the near term, new dominant variants can be expected to exert counter pressure to the forces that are driving cases lower. Meanwhile, holiday seasons and big events that traditionally draw people together have often matched up with case surges.A stretch of new events and holidays -- from the recent Super Bowl and Chinese New Year to Mardi Gras, St. Patrick’s Day and then Passover and Easter in April -- are expected to test social distancing commitments moving forward.“Which one wins and whether we have a fourth surge is sort of the great unknown at this point,” said Wachter at the University of California-San Francisco.Last year’s Mardi Gras festival dramatically accelerated transmission in Louisiana, eventually leading to secondary localized epidemics throughout the South, according to a preprint by scholars at The Scripps Research Institute and Tulane University.Eventually, Covid-19 may reach an endemic state and become seasonal like other coronaviruses, the common cold and influenza, said Brian Fisher, a senior scholar at the Penn Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics. The endemic state will still need to be addressed with vaccines, he said, including updated ones.“Now, how we get there is up for debate, and there likely will be some increased periods of increased transmission still ahead,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plummeting-covid-19-cases-in-us-show-a-path-to-crushing-the-pandemic-101613470766777.html

The federal government plans to bear the costs, RND said.Spahn also wants to make tests that can be conducted at home available to everyone once they have been approved by regulators."These testing options can contribute to a safe everyday life, especially in schools and daycare centres," Spahn said on Twitter, adding the health ministry was in negotiations with test manufacturers.The number of new daily infections in Germany has been falling in recent weeks, to 3,856 on Tuesday, although this was around 480 cases higher than a week ago. The seven-day incidence was 59 cases per 100,000.German leaders agreed last week to tighten the threshold for a gradual reopening of the economy, targeting an infection rate of under 35 new cases per 100,000 people over seven days, down from 50 previously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-plans-to-offer-free-rapid-coronavirus-tests-from-march-1-101613470718297.html
16-02-2021||World||Australia to amend laws to make Google and Facebook pay||Australia’s government said on Tuesday it will amend draft laws that would make Google and Facebook pay for news to clarify that publishers would be paid in lump sums rather than per click on news article links.The legislative changes described in a government statement as “clarifications and technical amendments” follow Australian ministers’ weekend discussions with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google.The conservative government hopes to enact the so-called News Media Bargaining Code before the current session of Parliament ends on Feb. 25.The amendments to be introduced to Parliament on Wednesday “improve the workability of the code while retaining its overall effect,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said in a joint statement.The opposition center-left Labor Party agreed at a meeting of lawmakers on Tuesday to support the bill, guaranteeing its passage through the Senate where the government does not hold a majority of seats. But the government might have to compromise with further Senate amendments.Australia Institute’s Center for Responsible Technology, a think-tank that supports the proposed world-first legislation, accepted the proposed changes.“On face value, the amendments keep the integrity of the media code intact,” the center’s director Peter Lewis said in a statement.Read | Microsoft backs search engines paying for news worldwideA Senate committee that scrutinized the draft legislation after it was introduced to Parliament on Dec. 9 recommended last week that the code become law without changes.Google and Facebook, which take a combined 81% of online advertising in Australia, have condemned the bill as unworkable.Google has threatened to make its search engine unavailable in Australia if the code were introduced. Facebook said it might block Australians from sharing news if the platform were forced to pay for news.The code aims to remove the digital giants’ dominant bargaining positions but creating an arbitration panel with the power to make legally binding decisions on price. The panel would usually accept either the platform’s or the publisher’s best offer, and only rarely set a price in between.That should discourage both the platforms and media businesses from making unrealistic demands.Apart from stating that arbitrated payments to publishers must be made in lump sums, the new amendments also clarify that the panel must consider costs incurred by the platforms and by news businesses.Seven West Media on Monday became the largest Australian news media business to strike a deal with Google to pay for journalism. Kerry Stokes, chairman of Seven West Media, which owns 21 publications, said the threat of the proposed code had made the deal possible.The deal was struck under Google’s own model, News Showcase. The company has reached pay deals with more than 450 publications globally since it launched News Showcase in October.Google announced two weeks ago that it had begun paying seven far smaller Australian websites under News Showcase.The Australian government said: “It is encouraging to see recent reports that news media businesses and digital platforms are now reaching commercial agreements, against the backdrop of the code being introduced into Parliament.”Google has faced pressure from authorities elsewhere to pay for news. Last month, it signed a deal with a group of French publishers, paving the way for the company to make digital copyright payments. Under the agreement, Google will negotiate individual licensing deals with newspapers, with payments based on factors such as the amount published daily and monthly internet site traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-amend-laws-to-make-google-and-facebook-pay-101613464513411.html
16-02-2021||World||US-led coalition: No Americans killed in Iraq rocket attack||The contractor with the U.S.-led coalition who was killed after a barrage of rockets struck near an airport in northern Iraq was not an American national, a coalition spokesman said Tuesday, hours after the attack sparked fears of renewed hostilities in the region.Over a dozen rockets hit areas between the civilian international airport in the city of Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish-run region and the nearby base hosting U.S. troops late on Monday.Initially, Iraqi security officials said three rockets had hit close to the airport. A little-known Shiite militant group calling itself Saraya Awliya al-Dam, Arabic for Guardians of Blood Brigade, claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack.An unspecified number of Iraqi and Kurdish civilians were also wounded as other rockets hit busy residential areas close to the airport.Shortly after the attack, U.S. Army Col. Wayne Marotto said a civilian contractor with the coalition was killed. On Tuesday, Marotto did not provide further details about the citizenship of the killed contractor.He also said eight civilian contractors and a U.S. military serviceman were wounded in the attack. The coalition confirmed that 107 mm rockets, a total of 14, were launched, with three impacting an airbase hosting U.S. troops.The Trump administration had said that the death of a U.S. contractor would be a red line and provoke a U.S. escalation in Iraq against Iran-backed groups. The December 2019 killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack in province of Kirkuk sparked a tit-for-tat fight on Iraqi soil that brought the country to the brink of a proxy war. The official position of President Joe Biden is not yet clear.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. was pledging its support for investigating the attack and holding accountable those who were responsible.It was the first attack since September to target Irbil's airport. Coalition forces based close to the Baghdad airport have been a frequent target for rocket attacks.The attacks drew condemnation from senior Iraqi, U.S. and other Western officials.U.N. Special Representative Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert deplored the deadly assault and called for national unity.“Such heinous, reckless acts pose grave threats to stability. Iraq must be shielded from (external) rivalries,” she said in comments posted on Twitter. “We call for restraint and for close Baghdad-Erbil collaboration to bring culprits to justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usled-coalition-no-americans-killed-in-iraq-rocket-attack-101613468310666.html

Multiple counties have declared various levels of the snow emergency, warning people against driving out on the roadways.The National Weather Service (NWS) has predicted heavy snow in the vicinity of the Canadian border in western and northern New York, with the possibility of snowfall rates of more than an inch per hour. The agency said that arctic air with frigid temperatures and dangerous wind chills will persist over the central third of the US this week.The federal weather agency said that the next major winter storm develops over the southern plains on Tuesday, spreading across the mid-south on Wednesday, before shifting northeast on a similar track to the current storm. “Record cold air over the southern Plains to the western Gulf Coast precedes this event and is expected to continue until at least Friday morning,” the NWS forecasted.Read | Power cut across Texas as snow, ice blanket southern PlainsThe bone-chilling weather featuring snow, sleet and freezing rain has led to extreme consumption of electricity, leaving utilities scrambling to meet record power demand. On Monday, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) issued level three emergency notice, urging customers to limit power usage and prevent an uncontrolled system-wide outage. According to NWS, there will be significant travel disruption in both snow and ice areas and could lead to extended power outages for areas already experiencing power outages.When the power goes out in winter, the cold can be deadly. But even without power, there are still ways to warm things up.

16-02-2021||World||Prosecutor seeks $13,000 fine in Alexei Navalny defamation case||A Russian prosecutor on Tuesday asked a Moscow court to fine opposition figure Alexei Navalny 950,000 rubles ($13,000/10,600 euros) for allegedly defaming a 94-year-old veteran.The prosecution also asked for a three-and-a-half year suspended sentence Navalny received in 2014 to be converted into real jail time as the alleged defamation occurred during the suspended sentence.Another Moscow court earlier this month already converted the suspended sentence to jail time over Navalny allegedly violating the terms of the suspended sentence while recovering from a poisoning attack in Germany.A Moscow district court was on Tuesday hearing the final arguments in the defamation case against Navalny, who referred to the World War II veteran and others who appeared in a pro-Kremlin video as "traitors".Navalny took part in the hearing from inside a glass cage for defendants. Wearing a blue hoodie, the 44-year-old anti-graft campaigner frequently smiled and paced inside the glass cell, an AFP journalist reported.His lawyer Olga Mikhailova insisted the charges were "contrived and arbitrary".After the final arguments were delivered, the judge adjourned the hearing to February 20.Another Moscow court on Tuesday was scheduled to hear a libel case against Navalny launched by Kremlin-linked businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin.The 59-year-old businessman, nicknamed "Putin's chef" because his company Concord catered for the Kremlin, is seeking five million rubles in compensation from Navalny.Later in the day, a court will also hear Navalny's appeal against a fine of 3.3 million rubles that he was ordered to pay a food company in another defamation lawsuit.Navalny was jailed immediately after returning from Germany to Moscow in January, sparking two consecutive weekends of nationwide protests demanding his release.At least 10,000 people were detained in a police crackdown on demonstrators.On Sunday several hundred female activists formed a human chain in central Moscow in a show of support for Navalny's wife Yulia and other women caught up in the crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prosecutor-seeks-13-000-fine-in-alexei-navalny-defamation-case-101613469544674.html
16-02-2021||World||US energy crisis deepens with nearly 5 million in the dark||The energy crisis crippling Texas’s power system continued to spread, with nearly 5 million people across the U.S plunged into darkness as authorities fought to avoid a total collapse of the grid.Homes and businesses from North Dakota to Texas are losing power in the middle of an unprecedented deep freeze that has broken daily temperature records in hundreds of places. The blackouts are likely to continue throughout Tuesday with no firm end in sight as the cold weather is forecast to remain through Wednesday.Officials have reported two people dead, likely from cold, according to the AP news agency. Medical centers are rushing to administer vaccines before they go bad. Flights are grounded. More than a million barrels a day of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of gas production are shut while pipelines have declared force majeure and massive refineries have halted gasoline and diesel output. U.S.President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Texas, making more resources available to help.“I’ve been following energy markets and grid issues for a while, and I cannot recall an extreme weather event that impacted such a large swath of the nation in this manner — the situation is critical,” said Neil Chatterjee, a member of the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.The cold blast is just the latest in a chain of severe weather events that have shaken power grids and upended energy markets globally from Japan to Pakistan and France in recent months. They’ve all underscored how vulnerable the world has become in the face of increasingly unpredictable weather brought on by climate change and it’s raising questions about the global push to electrify everything from transportation to heating and cooling.About 4 million homes and businesses were without power across Texas on Tuesday, based on utility outage data compiled by Poweroutage.us. Another 400,000 were down in a swathe of states stretching from Louisiana to Ohio and Virginia. About 250,000 were without power in Oregon.In Mexico, over 4.7 million homes and businesses went dark after Texas’s shortages triggered cascading failures. But about 65% of those affected in Mexico had seen their power restored by midday, according to grid operator Cenace.While temperatures are forecast to rise, the weather across the central U.S. will remain bitingly cold this week. Dallas, which was forecast to see a low of 2 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 17 degrees Celsius) late Monday, will reach a high of 29 by Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. But by late Thursday, readings will drop back into the teens.Such drastic weather conditions are rare, especially in parts of Texas. In Houston, the state’s largest city, roads were iced over and people braved long lines to refill household propane canisters. Traffic and street lights are down. Firewood is selling out. Grocery stores have run out of essentials including milk.This week’s cold front caught Texas’s highly decentralized electricity market especially by surprise. The region’s grid is designed for hot summers, not ice-cold winters. Utilities there haven’t had to carry out rolling blackouts since 2011.Extreme weather events are happening more frequently, a shift that’s attributed to the changing climate. Policy makers globally acknowledge the need to reduce emissions in almost every aspect of human life. Electrifying sectors like transport and heating to use green power is seen as vital to reaching net zero but the world’s grid infrastructure may not be ready for that shift.Burying power cables is an obvious way to protect them from severe heat or cold but it’s expensive and time-consuming and it’s not always possible. Networks need to find ways to strengthen their infrastructure to cope with wild temperatures and huge future increases in demand.Besides the human impact, the cold is wreaking havoc on the energy industry itself. U.S. oil production has dropped by anywhere from 1.5 million to 1.7 million barrels a day, helping U.S. crude prices trade above $60 a barrel for the first time in more than year. The region’s refining complex -- which produces almost half of the nation’s fuel -- is struggling to limp along without power. Some of the largest oil refineries have shut altogether, threatening to reduce supplies of gasoline and diesel across the country.Traders are drawing comparisons between the energy shortages now gripping the central U.S. and the 2000-2001 energy crisis in the western U.S., as well as a 1998 run-up in power prices in the Midwest. Just months ago, California was forced to institute its first rolling blackouts in two decades when extreme heat pushed power demand beyond capacity.Power plants with a combined capacity of more than 34 gigawatts were forced offline overnight, including nuclear reactors, coal and gas generators and wind farms, Dan Woodfin, a senior director for grid manager Electric Reliability Council of Texas said. It’s not yet clear why.Wind power generators were among the victims of the cold weather, with turbine blades rendered inoperable due to ice -- a phenomenon that reduces efficiency and can ultimately stop them from spinning. Texas estimated that more than half of its wind power capacity had come offline.At times, parts of Texas were colder than Alaska, according to the National Weather Service. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area it was 5 degrees Fahrenheit. Houston may pick up as much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow overnight, along with ice and sleet, the National Weather Service said. It will get hit by another storm bringing ice and freezing rain Wednesday.“The southern plains are in a cold pattern,” said David Roth, a senior branch forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center. “It is going to take a while for them to break out of it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-energy-crisis-deepens-with-nearly-5-million-in-the-dark-101613468999754.html

It projects an overall deficit of S$11 billion for 2021.Singapore's small and open economy is expected to expand 4% to 6% this year, bouncing back from a 5.4% contraction in 2020, with the city-state having largely brought the outbreak under control and rolling out its vaccination programme."The rationalization of broad based support schemes to be more targeted for the hardest-hit sectors is be expected in a recovery," said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank.The government plans to allocate S$24 billion over the next three years for economic transformation measures such as redesigning jobs and help businesses innovate as the city-state prepares itself for a post-pandemic world."We will invest in our people – so they can bounce back and be ready for opportunities that arise; we will invest in our businesses – so they can innovate, build deep capacities and seize growth opportunities," Heng said.He said Singapore was also investing in a range of innovative schemes including a software system that can verify Covid-19 test result certificates and vaccination records, an endeavour to help to revive air travel.GREEN EFFORTSThe island-state has been trying to come up with strategies to fight the impact of climate change, including by encouraging electric vehicles."Unlike Covid-19, which was a sudden and sharp shock, climate change is a gradual and intensifying risk, year by year," Heng said.As part of those efforts, the country plans to issue green bonds for some infrastructure projects -- a move that will also help the country deepen the market liquidity for such instruments and enhance Singapore's status as a green finance hub, he added.He also announced a plan to issue debt to fund other long term infrastructure projects with a cap of S$90 billion over the next 15 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-slows-covid-19-relief-spending-as-economy-recovers-101613468597620.html

16-02-2021||World||Myanmar junta cuts internet again to grind down anti-coup rallies||Myanmar's generals imposed a second straight overnight internet shutdown into Tuesday, ignoring international condemnation as they worked to grind down a popular uprising against their coup.In the two weeks since troops ousted Aung San Suu Kyi and took the civilian leader into custody, big urban centres and isolated village communities alike have been in open revolt.Security forces have used increasing force to quell huge nationwide street protests and a disobedience campaign encouraging civil servants to strike.Troops have fanned out around the country in recent days and fired rubber bullets to disperse one rally in Mandalay, hours before authorities again cut internet gateways."They shut down the internet because they want to do bad things," said 44-year-old Win Tun, a resident of commercial capital Yangon."We didn't sleep the whole night so we could see what would happen."The shutdown came after another day of protests in Yangon, in defiance of armoured vehicles and troop convoys stationed around key sections of the city -- although turnout was smaller than in recent days.Mandalay, the country's second largest city, saw a clash that left at least six injured after police used slingshots against protesters and fired rubber bullets into the crowd.Demonstrators retaliated by throwing bricks, according to a medic at the scene, while journalists said police had beaten them in the melee.Crowds returned to the streets of Yangon and other locations around the country on Tuesday morning."I want more people to join the protests, we don't want to be seen as weak," said Thwe Ei Sann, a university student in the city.A large crowd blocked railway tracks outside the port city of Mawlamyine to prevent a Yangon-bound train from leaving the port city.Many of the country's locomotive drivers have joined the anti-coup work boycotts and have frustrated junta efforts to restart the national railway network after a Covid-19 shutdown.Yangon residents had on the weekend used tree trunks to block police vehicles sent to bring striking rail workers back to their stations.- 'Nobody believes them' -The international community has unleashed a torrent of condemnation against the leaders of Myanmar's new army administration, which insists it took power lawfully.UN ambassador Christine Schraner Burgener spoke to junta number two Soe Win on Monday and warned him that the regime's network blackouts "undermine core democratic principles", according to a spokesman.State media reported the following day that the general had discussed "security measures" with the envoy, along with the regime's Covid-19 vaccination rollout and economic recovery plans.More than 420 people have been arrested since the coup, according to a list of confirmed detentions from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group.There are numerous unconfirmed reports of other arrests.Suu Kyi and her top political ally, Win Myint, have not been seen in public since they were detained in dawn raids on February 1, the day a new parliament was due to convene.Both are expected to appear in court by videolink in Naypyidaw this week.The Nobel laureate, who spent years under house arrest for opposing an earlier dictatorship, has been charged under an obscure import law for possessing unregistered walkie-talkies at her home.Her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw said he had been unable to contact his client, though officials from her National League for Democracy (NLD) party have previously said she is in good health.UN special rapporteur Tom Andrews told AFP Monday that he does not expect Suu Kyi's court hearing to be fair."There's nothing fair about the junta. This is theatre. It's just theatre. And of course, nobody believes them," Andrews said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-cuts-internet-again-to-grind-down-anti-coup-rallies-101613465696687.html
16-02-2021||World||Myanmar protests resume after second night of internet shutdown||Peaceful demonstrations against Myanmar’s military takeover resumed Tuesday, following violence against protesters a day earlier by security forces and after internet access was blocked for a second straight night.Groups of demonstrators turned out early in Yangon and other cities to protest the Feb. 1 coup and demand that the nation’s elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and members of her ousted government be freed from detention.In Yangon, police blocked off the street in front of the Central Bank, which protesters have targeted amid speculation online that the military is seeking to seize money from them.Buddhist monks demonstrated outside the U.N.'s local office.The protests are taking place in defiance of an order banning gatherings of five or more people.Around 3,000 demonstrators – mainly students – returned to the streets in Mandalay, the country's second biggest city, carrying posters of Suu Kyi and shouting for the return of democracy.Security presence was low-key around the march, with most police guarding key buildings in the city, such as state banks branches.On Monday in Mandalay, soldiers and police violently broke up a gathering of more than 1,000 protesters in front of the Myanmar Economic Bank. They attacked the protesters with slingshots and sticks, and police could be seen aiming long guns into the air amid sounds that resembled gunfire. Local media reported rubber bullets were fired into the crowd and that a few people were injured.No reason has been announced for why the government ordered internet access blocked on Sunday and Monday nights. It has in the past few weeks imposed selective and ineffective blocks on social media platforms and prepared a draft internet law that would criminalize many online activities.There is also widespread speculation that the government is installing a firewall system that can monitor or block most or all online activity.State media were acknowledging the protest movement with indirect references. The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported about a meeting of the State Administration Council, the new top governing body, and quoted its chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, saying the authorities “are handling the ongoing problems with care.”It said the council discussed taking legal action against protesters, providing “true information” to the media, and resuming public transport, an apparent reference to strikes and slowdowns by truckers and state railway workers.The newspaper also said the council members discussed acting against a “parallel government" established by some elected lawmakers of Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, who were prevented from taking their seats when the military stopped Parliament from opening its session Feb. 1.The self-styled Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw has 15 members who met online and said they have enough support to convene Parliament. It stakes a claim to being the sole legitimate government institution and has appealed to foreign powers and the U.N. and other multilateral institutions for recognition, with no known positive responses. Committee members believe warrants have been issued for their arrests.Suu Kyi is under house arrest on a minor charge of possessing unregistered imported walkie-talkies. It is likely that she will appear in court by videoconference on Wednesday, according to Khin Maung Zaw, a lawyer asked by Suu Kyi’s party to represent her.The military contends there was fraud in last year’s election, which Suu Kyi’s party won in a landslide, and says it will hold power for a year before holding new elections. The state election commission found no evidence to support the claims of fraud.The military says its takeover is legitimate under a 2008 constitution that was drafted under military rule and ensures the army maintains ultimate control over the country. The U.N., U.S. and other governments have urged it to return power to the elected government and release Suu Kyi and other detainees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-resume-after-second-night-of-internet-shutdown-101613465737151.html
16-02-2021||World||Covid-19: South Africa's health care workers eager for first vaccines||After testing thousands of people for coronavirus, South African nurse Asnath Masango says she can't wait to get vaccinated.“So many people, I test them and within days they have passed away,” said Masango. “I want protection.”C.J. Umunnakwe, a virologist running a lab that has performed more than 40,000 virus tests, says he “wholeheartedly believes in vaccinations. Vaccines save lives.” He plans to talk to those who may be skeptical.Health care workers at the Ndlovu Care Group in rural northeastern South Africa are eagerly awaiting the first jabs of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which will be given out to medical staff starting this week.That's despite the fact that the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine — unlike the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines — has not been approved for general use anywhere in the world.No matter, say many South African health workers who are enthusiastic about getting the J&J jab, which comes amid a huge shift in the government's vaccination strategy.South Africa, with nearly 1.5 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 including more than 47,000 deaths, has had 41% of Africa's reported cases.Last week South Africa controversially decided to drop the AstraZeneca vaccine — which had been already purchased, delivered and approved in the country -- from the first phase in which 1.25 million health care workers will be vaccinated.The last-minute decision was made after a small test showed the AstraZeneca vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate cases of the variant dominant in South Africa. Although preliminary and not peer-reviewed, the results raised serious questions about how effective the AstraZeneca vaccine would be specifically in South Africa, even though the vaccine has been approved in over 50 other countries around the world.Health officials decided to change to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which tests show is safe and effective against the variant here. A one-shot vaccine is also easier for many countries to implement.“The switch has emboldened the skeptics, who say the vaccines have problems,” Umunnakwe said of those who alleged that big pharmaceutical firms are using Africans as guinea pigs.“I am telling people that the change shows that decisions are being made transparently, that it was driven by science,” he said. “It is proof that we are putting the public as first priority.”South Africa has purchased 9 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and 80,000 will be delivered this week to kick off the inoculation campaign, the president says. South Africa’s regulatory body has approved the J&J shot for testing purposes. Until that vaccine receives full approval, it will be given as part of an “implemented study,” officials say.At the Ndlovu Care Group, in the small town of Elandsdoorn in Limpopo province, 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Johannesburg, medical workers have seen the devastation wrought by the virus up close. When Covid-19 hit, the center quickly ramped up its laboratory to do PCR tests.The protective gear that cloaks Masango cannot hide her empathy as she welcomes people who come for a Covid-19 test.“I'm so skilled at this, you won't even feel it!” she said to a visitor.Masango, 56, said she has tested more people than she can count.“What depresses me the most is when I must tell someone that they are positive,” she said. “They are so frightened ... Grandparents die. Breadwinners die. How will their children get food?”The prospect of getting vaccinated excites her.“Yo!” she says, eyes widening. “I want that vaccine!”The Ndlovu Care Group has done more than 40,000 tests in the rural community, including workers at large mines and commercial farms. More than 20,000 of those tests were in January alone, when South Africa was hit by a dramatic resurgence of the disease, driven by the more contagious variant that is now dominant.The Ndlovu laboratory can carry out the PCR virus tests and get the results within hours. In the January resurgence, it was averaging about 1,600 tests per day.“We were busy, very busy,” said Umunnakwe, a 35-year-old virologist who came to the center to study HIV and is now studying coronavirus too. He is keenly watching the genomic sequencing in South Africa that identified the new variant.“By doing sequencing, we don't just see what is present in the virus today, we can detect what may happen in the future,” said Umunnakwe, adding that he hoped Ndlovu will get the equipment to do sequencing, rare for a rural health center.Most South Africans are looking forward to getting vaccinated. An impressive 67% of adults said they would definitely or probably take a vaccine, according to a survey by the University of Johannesburg and the Human Sciences Research Council.Dr. Rebone Maboa, who is running a study of the J&J vaccine at the Ndlovu center, was excited to hear that it will be used in South Africa.“I'm actually ecstatic!” said Maboa. “I think it's actually a better vaccine for us here in South Africa, looking at our variant.”The 42-year-old doctor said 602 people in the community are participating in the test and half were injected with the J&J vaccine in November. She also said her recent recovery from Covid-19 makes her a stronger advocate for getting vaccinated.“Lack of knowledge makes people much, much more anxious," said Maboa. "Those who get the vaccine will be role models, vaccine ambassadors who will encourage others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-south-africa-s-health-care-workers-eager-for-first-vaccines-101613465404107.html
16-02-2021||World||Australian PM apologises to ex-staffer alleging rape in country's parliament||Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday apologized to a former government staffer who alleged she was raped by a colleague in a minister’s office two years ago.The former staffer Brittany Higgins alleged in a television interview on Monday that a colleague had raped her in the office of the then-Defense Industry Minister Linda Reynolds weeks before the 2019 election and that she did not receive the support she needed from bosses or other colleagues.The man she accused, who has not been named, was fired for a security breach in taking Higgins into the minister’s office and leaving her there on a couch after a night of heavy drinking.Higgins, who was Reynolds’ media adviser, said she decided not to pursue a police complaint at the time because she felt pressure that doing so would affect her employment.She resigned in January this year and said she plans to reinstate her police complaint.“I think that resigning is the only thing I can personally do to say that I don’t think anyone else should go through what I went through,” Higgins told Network Ten.Morrison said Reynolds should not have questioned Higgins about her accusation in the same office where Higgins alleged the rape took place.“That should not have happened, and I do apologize,” Morrison told reporters.Reynolds, who is now defense minister, also apologized for raising the matter with Higgins in her office, adding that the minister had not done enough to support the then 24-year-old staffer.“I deeply, deeply regret conducting the meeting in my office where the alleged incident occurred,” Reynolds said.Reynolds told the Senate she never gave Higgins a choice between her job and making a police complaint.Morrison described Higgins’ allegation as a wake-up call that must drive change within Parliament House.“It shatters me that still, in this day and age, a young woman can find herself in the vulnerable situation that she was in, not her doing,” Morrison said.“We have to do more, whether it’s in this workplace or any other workplace in the country, to ensure people can work safely in their place and be at their best and do what they went into that job to do,” he added.Morrison appointed government lawmaker Celia Hammond to work with political parties to investigate Parliament House culture, improve workplace standards and to protect staff.An automatic reporting obligation to department officials will be established for such allegation, Morrison said.Morrison said he first heard of Higgins’ allegation on Monday and his office only learned about it on Friday last week.The opposition questioned how Morrison could continue to have confidence in Reynolds since she hadn’t told him of the alleged rape.“My understanding is the minister acted in good faith toward Brittany and sought to support Brittany,” Morrison replied.Higgins issued a media statement on Tuesday thanking Morrison for his apology.“The prime minister’s announcement of an investigation into the culture in Parliament House is a welcomed first step, though it is long overdue,” Higgins said.“It should not have taken my story, or the story of other victim-survivors to air on national television for the prime minister — or any Member of Parliament — to take action on workplace sexual harassment, assault or bullying,” she added.Parliament House needed an independent reporting mechanism for staff so that they could confidently and safely make complaints, Higgins said.The Associated Press does not usually identify alleged victims of sexual assault, but Higgins has chosen to identify herself in the media.Opinion polls pointed to Morrison’s conservative coalition government losing power at the 2019 election which took place weeks after the alleged rape. But the government achieved a narrow victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-apologises-to-ex-staffer-alleging-rape-in-country-s-parliament-101613464502473.html

16-02-2021||World||China aims to hurt US by curbing export of critical rare-earth minerals: Report||China is exploring whether it can hurt US defense contractors by limiting supplies of rare-earth minerals that are critical to the industry, the Financial Times reported.Industry executives said government officials had asked them how badly companies in the US and Europe would be affected if China restricted rare-earth exports during a bilateral dispute, the FT reported, citing people it didn’t identify involved in the consultation.The move throws the spotlight back on the group of elements that are used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets, and have previously been a focus in the deteriorating trade relationship between China and the US. The Asian country controls most of the world’s mined output, with an even tighter hold of the processing industry, leaving American industries with few avenues to immediately secure short-term supply if curbs were to be put in place.China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on a public holiday, while calls to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology went unanswered. The government last month issued draft guidelines for the sector, with proposals including firms abiding by export regulations and the possibility that the nation restrict or suspend exploration and processing of rare earths to preserve natural resources and protect the environment.The specter of export curbs arose in 2019 amid a deepening trade war. China accounts for 80% of rare-earth imports into the US, and Beijing had prepared a plan to restrict shipments as a way to target Washington. While those restrictions never eventuated, it pushed the American government to seek out ways to cut their reliance on a single source of supply.Donald Trump last year signed an executive order aimed at expanding domestic output of rare-earth minerals, a year after the Department of Defense was ordered to spur the production of magnets. The US also awarded Lynas Rare Earths Ltd., the biggest producer outside China, a contract to boost processing capabilities.Trump’s administration had taken a wide range of actions to thwart China’s efforts to dominate numerous high-tech industries, with President Joe Biden still yet to change many of those policies. Biden, in his first conversation as president with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, spoke of his concern about Beijing’s “coercive and unfair economic practices” as well as human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-aims-to-hurt-us-by-curbing-export-of-critical-rare-earth-minerals-report-101613460357239.html
16-02-2021||World||Australia: Seven West Media becomes first news outlet to strike deal with Google||Australia's Seven West Media Ltd became the country's first major news outlet to strike a licensing deal with Google, as the government pushes ahead with a law that would force the internet giant to pay media companies for content.At an earnings announcement on Monday, Seven, which owns a free-to-air television network and the main metro newspaper in the city of Perth, said it would supply content for Google's News Showcase platform. It did not disclose terms.The deal shows Seven splitting from rivals News Corp and Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd which have failed to reach agreements with Google and instead backed laws, set to be passed this week, where the government sets the online giant's content fees in the absence of a private deal.So far in Australia, only specialist online publishers and one regional newspaper have struck deals to receive payment for their content appearing on the new Google platform which went live in the country this month. Outside Australia, Reuters is among news outlets with similar Google deals."The negotiations with Google recognise the value of quality and original journalism throughout the country and, in particular, in regional areas," said Seven West Chairman Kerry Stokes in a statement.Google's Australia CEO Mel Silva said the US company was "proud to support original, trusted, and quality journalism" by featuring Seven on its platform.Last month, Silva told a parliamentary hearing Google would pull its search engine from Australia if the so-called News Media Bargaining Code became law. A Google representative declined to comment on the effect of the Seven deal.Hours before Seven revealed its plans, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the Australian Broadcasting Corp he still planned to introduce the laws, but added: "I think we're very close to some significant commercial deals and, in doing so, that will the transform the domestic media landscape".The way the law is worded, the government only imposes a negotiator to set fees if the media company and Google can't come to an arrangement privately.A Seven spokesman told Reuters the company still supported the law.A Nine spokeswoman declined comment, while a News Corp representative in Australia was not immediately available for comment."The signs are that the Australian government and Google are close to a compromise," said Paul Budde, an independent media and telecommunications industry analyst."This allows the government to claim victory, while the damage to Google will be limited. Publishers will in one way or another be paid for news."Seven separately reported a 26.5% jump in underlying profit for the six months to end-December, helped by strong performance in its advertising market.Seven shares jumped as much as 10.6% to their highest level since May 31, 2019 in early trade, while the broader market was up 0.9%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-seven-west-media-becomes-first-news-outlet-to-strike-deal-with-google-101613460061343.html
16-02-2021||World||India expresses concerns over threat to citizens in Canada||India’s High Commission in Ottawa has raised the issue of safety of Indian citizens, including international students, with Canadian authorities after multiple reports of members of the Indo-Canadian community being threatened and intimidated for actions perceived to be pro-India or critical of the ongoing protests against the contentious farm laws passed by the Indian Parliament.In an outreach message to the diaspora in Canada, India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria wrote: “We are also concerned at reports that Indian citizen and friends of India who have expressed their views in support of the farm reforms in India have been targeted and subjected to intimidation, threats of violence and calls to boycott or disrupt their business.”Reports of threats, including violence and rape, against Indo-Canadians were received from the Greater Toronto Area, Metro Vancouver, Calgary and Vancouver. This development, which has created a climate of fear within the larger community, was first reported by the Hindustan Times. 28 Indo-Canadian organisations have raised the issue with Canada’s public safety and emergency preparedness minister Bill Blair in a letter, but have yet to receive a response from him or his office, HT had reported.Bisaria told members of the community that “in the event that any Indian national is subjected to any such threats of violence or intimidation, they should report the matter, with all details to the local police, and also bring it to our immediate attention”.He also asserted “that a flood of misinformation, blatant lies and distortions being circulated about some recent developments in India” and the “increase in rhetoric promoting violence in India” is “aimed at defaming and harming the image of India and Indians as well as to sow distrust and promote hatred between different communities of Indian origin in Canada”.Several prominent Canadian politicians have raised the matter of the protests against farm laws in India, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, much to the chagrin of the Indian Government.The Poetic Justice Foundation, the group allegedly responsible for creating the infamous toolkit being investigated by Indian law enforcement, is based in Vancouver and one of its founders, Mo Dhaliwal, participated in a blockade of the Indian Consulate in Vancouver on Republic Day. According to an unverified video, Dhaliwal also made a pro-Khalistan speech outside the premises.Bisaria called on the diaspora to “encourage Indian citizens, friends of India and the Canadian public to remain vigilant against such attempts and not be swayed by false narratives and sophistry”.“The Indian diaspora in Canada is a reflection of the diversity and plurality of India. For the continued welfare of the community, it is essential to maintain unity and amity between the different communities. The community must come together and work as one for this cause and not be influenced by forces that promote hatred and seek to divide it. All voices of the community should be equally respected and valued,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-expresses-concerns-over-threat-to-citizens-in-canada-101613457355571.html
16-02-2021||World||9/11-type commission to probe US Capitol storming proposed by Nancy Pelosi||US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has proposed a 9/11-type independent commission to investigate the storming of the Capitol by supporters of former president Donald Trump on January 6, which is seen as one of the darkest days in the history of America’s democracy.Pelosi said this in a Dear Colleague letter on Monday, less than 50 hours after the Senate -- the upper chamber of US Congress -- acquitted Trump following an impeachment trial on charges of inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol hill, putting at risk the lives of hundreds of lawmakers.“It is clear from his findings and from the impeachment trial that we must get to the truth of how this happened,” she said in a letter to her Democratic colleagues in the House of Representatives.“To protect our security, our security, our security, our next step will be to establish an outside, independent 9/11-type Commission to ‘investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex… and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power, including facts and causes relating to the preparedness and response of the United States Capitol Police and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement in the National Capitol Region,” Pelosi wrote.Her letter follows similar demands being made by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Three Republican congressmen -- Rodney Davis, John Katko and James Comer -- have proposed a bill that would create a bipartisan commission.Pelosi, a top Democrat, further said in the letter: “As we prepare for the Commission, it is also clear from General Honoré’s interim reporting that we must put forth a supplemental appropriation to provide for the safety of members and the security of the Capitol,” she said as the country observed President’s Day, celebrating the birthdays of two greatest American presidents -- George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, in a tweet supporting Pelosi, said: “One of the darkest days in the history of our democracy deserves to be examined and investigated in great detail. We cannot dismiss and forget the violence that day or how close our republic came to being overthrown”.On February 13, the US Senate acquitted Trump in his second impeachment trial in just over a year, after the Democrats failed once again to muster enough votes to convict the former president on a charge of inciting the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on January 6.The Senate voted 57-43 on Saturday to convict Trump on a single impeachment count – incitement of insurrection. But that majority of all 50 Democrats in the upper chamber of the US Congress, joined by seven Republicans, fell 10 votes short of the 67 needed for a conviction, two-thirds of the 100-member Senate.The 74-year-old Republican former president was accused of inciting riots in the Capitol which left five people, including a police officer, dead.Trump is the first president in US history to be impeached by the House of Representatives twice, and the first to be tried for impeachment after leaving office.The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission, was a bipartisan-panel established to create a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks.The commission -- chaired by five Republicans and five Democrats and convened by Congress as part of a legislation signed by former president George W Bush -- interviewed over 1,200 people in 10 countries and concluded that the FBI and CIA failed to adequately assess the terrorist threats, among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/911type-commission-to-probe-us-capitol-storming-proposed-by-nancy-pelosi-101613455603878.html
16-02-2021||World||Veteran Hong Kong activists on trial over huge democracy rally||Veteran Hong Kong activists went on trial Tuesday for organising one of the biggest democracy protests to engulf the city in 2019, part of a sweeping crackdown targeting Beijing's critics over the last 18 months.The nine defendants include some of the city's most prominent pro-democracy campaigners, many of whom are staunch nonviolence advocates who have spent decades campaigning in vain for universal suffrage.Among them are Martin Lee, an 82-year-old barrister who was once chosen by Beijing to help write Hong Kong's mini-constitution, and Margaret Ng, a 73-year-old barrister and former opposition lawmaker.Media tycoon Jimmy Lai, currently in custody after his arrest under Beijing's new national security law, is also among those on trial.Others are leading members of the Civil Human Rights Front, the coalition that organised a series of huge rallies throughout 2019.They each face up to five years in jail if convicted.As they entered court on Tuesday, some of the activists flashed a three-finger salute, a symbol now used across Asia to protest authoritarianism.The group is being prosecuted for organising an unauthorised assembly on August 18, 2019 -- one of the biggest to convulse Hong Kong that year as people took to the streets for seven straight months calling for democracy and greater police accountability.Organisers estimated 1.7 million people turned out -- almost one in four Hong Kong residents -- though that number was difficult to independently verify.Those involved described it as the second-largest protest of 2019, and it was undoubtedly one of the biggest rallies that year, with demonstrators marching peacefully for hours under a sea of umbrellas and thundery skies.Protests in Hong Kong can only go ahead with the permission of authorities, though rights groups have long criticised the use of unauthorised assembly prosecutions.Since 2019, protests have been all but outlawed with authorities either refusing permission on security grounds or later because of the pandemic.The rallies in 2019 often descended into clashes between riot police and a knot of hardcore participants, and posed the most concerted challenge to China's rule since the former British colony's 1997 handover.The movement eventually fizzled out under the combined weight of exhaustion, some 10,000 arrests and the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic.Authorities have since unleashed a broad crackdown and Beijing has imposed a new security law which criminalises much dissent.China and Hong Kong's leaders say the law is needed to restore stability to the finance hub.Critics counter that Beijing has shredded the liberties and autonomy it promised Hong Kong could maintain after the handover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/veteran-hong-kong-activists-on-trial-over-huge-democracy-rally-101613450005608.html
16-02-2021||World||S. Korea strikes Covid-19 vaccine deal, 23 mn to be inoculated||South Korea has arranged to buy coronavirus vaccines for 23 million more people, its prime minister said on Tuesday, a day after authorities decided to scale back initial vaccination plans, citing delays and efficacy concerns.Preparing for an inoculation drive that is set to begin on Feb.26, South Korea had already secured supply agreements for enough doses for 56 million, though it has a population of 52 million.But the vaccination programme is set to get off to a slower start, as some of the vaccines acquired have not yet proven sufficiently effective against new strains of COVID-19, while some manufacturers may not be able to deliver on time due to production problems.To overcome those issues, South Korea has struck additional deals with Novavax Inc for enough vaccines to cover 20 million people and with Pfizer to cover a further 3 million, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said, making the total supply enough to cover 79 million people."The government has been working to bring in sufficient early supplies, but there is growing uncertainty over our plan for the first half due to production issues with global drugmakers and international competition to adopt more vaccines," he told a televised meeting.South Korea aims to begin by inoculating healthcare workers and the elderly. But authorities said on Monday they would not use AstraZeneca vaccines on people aged 65 and older, reversing an earlier decision, because of insufficient efficacy data.Aside from AstraZeneca, South Korea has also reached agreements with COVAX, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson for the supply of their vaccines.The government has cut its first-quarter vaccination target from 1.3 million to less than 760,000.US-based Novavax issued a statement that it has signed a license agreement with South Korea manufacturer SK Bioscience to produce 40 million doses of its vaccines for South Korea and significantly boost production capacity. Two doses of the Novavax vaccine are needed per person.SK Bioscience said it has exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the vaccine in South Korea and also secured rights to sell it in several Southeast Asian countries.The director of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), Jeong Eun-kyeong, said the reduced first-quarter target was not expected to affect the goal of achieving "herd immunity" by November, though some independent health experts doubt whether it can be done so fast.The additional Pfizer deal for 6 million doses, with two needed per person, was intended to help meet that goal, and the U.S. drugmaker agreed to move up the shipment date for another 1 million doses to the second quarter, Chung said.The KDCA reported 457 additional coronavirus cases as of midnight on Monday, as the daily tally rebounds to the 400s in four days amid increased testing following last week's Lunar New Year holidays.South Korea's total infections rose to 84,325 with 1,534 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/s-korea-strikes-covid-19-vaccine-deal-23-mn-to-be-inoculated-101613453542912.html
16-02-2021||World||French parliament to vote on anti-extremism bill||The French parliament on Tuesday votes on a bill to battle Islamist extremism, which the state argues is needed to bolster the secular system but critics say breaches religious freedom.With an eye on 2022 elections, President Emmanuel Macron has championed the bill which seeks to tighten rules on issues ranging from religious teaching, online hate to polygamy.It has been debated in a highly charged atmosphere in France after three attacks late last year by extremists including the beheading in October of teacher Samuel Paty, who had shown his pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.The law is dubbed the anti-separatism bill as ministers fear Islamists are creating communities that reject France's secular identity and laws, as well as its values such as equality between the sexes.France, home to Europe's largest Muslim community, is still shaken by the succession of massacres committed by Islamist militants from January 2015 that left hundreds dead.The National Assembly lower house is expected to vote on the legislation in the afternoon after a total of 135 hours of debates that saw some 313 amendments adopted.Macron's ruling party has a large working majority, meaning the legislation is expected to pass, but the upper house Senate will also examine the draft legislation in the coming months and could amend it.- 'Hostile ideology' -Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said after the final debate on Saturday that the bill "provides concrete responses to... the development of radical Islam, an ideology hostile to the principles and values on which the Republic is founded."Paty's killing prompted the inclusion of the specific crimes of online hate speech and divulging personal information on the internet that could be used to harm a public-sector worker.Paty was the subject of an online hate campaign started by a parent of a child at his school who objected to him showing the prophet cartoons.Under the legislation, doctors will also be fined or jailed if they perform a virginity test on girls, while it also extends sanctions on polygamy.The state will also have far greater powers to close down places of worship that are found to air "theories or ideas" that "provoke hate or violence towards a person or people."One of the most contentious articles concerns home schooling, with the rules considerably sharpened to require official authorisation on grounds of health or handicap for children to learn at home.But for the right-wing opposition The Republicans (LR) the bill does not go far enough, notably by not restricting the wearing of the Islamic veil in spaces like universities."It's a small law on a big subject," said LR MP Julien Ravier. The right, which has the majority in the Senate, may try to toughen it further when it enters the upper house.Nearly 200 people demonstrated in Paris on Sunday against the bill accusing it of "reinforcing discrimination against Muslims".A US envoy on religious freedom last year criticised the bill as "heavy-handed" and it has sparked unusually critical coverage in English-language media, even prompting Macron to write personally to the Financial Times to defend it.Analysts have said Macron, who came to power in 2017 as a centrist reformer, has noticeably tacked to the right over the last months as he scents that his 2022 presidential reelection battle will come down to a run-off duel with far right National Rally (RN) leader Marine Le Pen.Darmanin visibly shocked Le Pen herself and surprised even his own party colleagues by accusing Le Pen of "softness" on Islam during a debate on Thursday night.Le Pen, who has proposed banning the veil in all public places in France, said at the debate she was "disappointed" by the scope of the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-parliament-to-vote-on-anti-extremism-bill-101613450052299.html
16-02-2021||World||Right-wing friendly Parler announces re-launch||The right-wing friendly social network Parler, which was forced offline following the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, says it is re-launching.The Twitter alternative has been struggling to return online since Amazon stripped it of web-hosting service on January 11 over its unwillingness to remove posts inciting violence. Google and Apple removed Parler’s app from their online stores for the same reason.Parler said in an emailed statement Monday that it would be led by an interim CEO, Mark Meckler of the Tea Party Patriots movement. It said the service would be brought back online for current users this week with new users being able to sign up next week — and would not be reliant on “Big Tech.”The site's homepage, however, was a single, static page whose lead post reminded viewers of “technical difficulties.” But it was possible to log in via a different variation of that URL. The iPhone app, however, did not work, yielding a “networking error” when an Associated Press reporter tried it. Among new posters was Fox News personality Sean Hannity.Guidelines accessible on the site, dated Feb. 14, said Parler would use technology and human review to remove “threatening or inciting content." They said a “community jury” headed by a Parler employee would hear appeals.Parler was being hosted by a Los Angeles cloud services company, SkySilk. Ron Guilmette, a California-based internet researcher and activist, said SkySilk appeared to be a small outfit and that it was not clear to him whether it could provide adequate security for the site. In particular, Guilmette cited the need for robust defense against denial-of-service attacks, which flood a site with data traffic to make it inaccessible. Such attacks are a threat to any major internet site — especially if their content is at all controversial.SkySilk did not respond to questions about the level of support the company is providing.Its CEO, Kevin Matossian, said in a statement that the company “does not advocate nor condone hate, rather it advocates the right to private judgment and rejects the role of being the judge, jury and executioner. Unfortunately, too many of our fellow technology providers seem to differ in their position on this subject.”Mattossian added that his company applauded Parler's new community guidelines.For a time after Amazon dropped it, Parler received denial-of-service protection from a Russian-based outfit called DDoS-Guard. That ended following revelations that DDoS-Guard had provided services to shady operations, including online forums popular with credit card thieves.In a lawsuit seeking to force Amazon to restore its service, Parler's management claimed that Amazon aimed to deny Trump "a platform on any large social-media service.” That followed Twitter's decision to permanently ban the former president from its service and similar indefinite bans by Facebook and Instagram.Parler’s previous CEO, John Matze, says he was fired on Jan. 29 by the Parler board, which is controlled by conservative donor Rebekah Mercer. At the time, Matze told The New York Times that he'd told Mercer that Parler needed to consider preventing domestic terrorists, white supremacists and followers of QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory, from posting on the platform.The 2 1/2-year-old social media site claims 20 million users. Trump never established an account there, although Buzzfeed reported that he considered buying a stake in Parler while he was president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rightwing-friendly-parler-announces-relaunch-101613447889324.html

I cannot think of anyone who could better serve President Biden and the nation in advancing this crucial agenda," said Olivia Golden, executive director for the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP).In her nearly four years as CLASP’s Director of the Job Quality team, Pronita was a leader nationally and in the states, advancing policies that improved the jobs of workers with low wages, playing an integral role in the Work Family Strategy Council and partnering with colleagues around the country, Golden said."At CLASP, she assembled a tremendously effective team that played a crucial role in building state and national momentum for paid family and medical leave and paid sick days, taking on everything from the details of financing and implementing effective programs to the broad vision, through testimony, speeches, detailed technical assistance, and powerful research reports and commentaries,” Golden said.During the second term of the Obama Administration, Gupta was Deputy Director, Women's Bureau at the US Department of Labor from April 2014 to January 2017.In that role, she worked to advance and improve standards, practices, and opportunities for women in the labour force. She has also previously served as senior director of programs for the Women Donors Network (WDN) as well as research director for Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy.Gupta has extensive experience in community and labor organising. She served as research director for SCOPE/AGENDA in Los Angeles, where she helped develop their healthcare jobs campaign, and as research director for the Living Wage Campaign at the LA Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE).Additionally, Gupta served as executive director of Institute for Southern Studies and legislative director for the US Student Association.

16-02-2021||World||Myanmar shuts down internet again as protest crackdown continues||Myanmar’s junta shut down the internet for a second straight night, part of efforts to stem nationwide protests after it seized power from civilian leaders on Feb. 1.The blackout came shortly after state-run MRTV said army chief Min Aung Hlaing enacted a new law telecommunications law, with details set to be announced on Tuesday. Authorities have sought to disrupt telephone and internet access to prevent demonstrators from organizing, while also granting themselves new powers to intercept communications and detain dissidents.Protests continued on Monday in defiance of a ban on public gatherings imposed after the coup. The junta is scheduled to give its first press briefing since it took power later on Tuesday, while US Ambassador to Myanmar Thomas Vajda plans to host a virtual town hall for US citizens.Myanmar’s military leaders have struggled to gain control of the streets since ousting the government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party won a landslide victory in November elections. She has urged the country’s 55 million people to oppose the army’s move, calling it “an attempt to bring the nation back under the military dictatorship.”Suu Kyi and other political leaders are among more than 400 people detained since the coup, a number that keeps rising by the day. While authorities have largely avoided confronting protesters in major cities like Yangon who have ignored a ban on public gatherings, several demonstrators have been injured in crackdowns -- including a woman shot in the head who is now on life support in Naypyidaw, the capital.Suu Kyi will remain in detention ahead of a Wednesday court hearing, Reuters reported, citing her lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-shuts-down-internet-again-as-protest-crackdown-continues-101613438740007.html
16-02-2021||World||3 sailors have Covid-19 on US ship that saw outbreak last year||Three sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for Covid-19, the Navy said Monday, less than a year after a massive outbreak on the ship sidelined it in Guam for nearly two months.The Navy said the three sailors have not had any symptoms, and they and others who were exposed to them are currently isolated on the aircraft carrier, which is conducting operations in the Pacific. They tested positive Sunday.In a statement, the Navy said it is “following an aggressive mitigation strategy," including masks, social distancing, and proper handwashing and hygiene measures.“U.S. Pacific Fleet is committed to taking every measure possible to protect the health of our force,” the fleet said in the statement.The outbreak on the ship last year was the largest the military has seen so far, with more than 1,000 sailors testing positive. One sailor died. Eventually all of the 4,800 crew members were sent ashore in Guam for weeks of quarantine, in a systematic progression that kept enough sailors on the ship to keep it secure and running.The failure of the ship's leaders to properly handle the outbreak exploded into one of the biggest military leadership crises in recent years. The ship's captain, who pleaded for faster action to protect his crew from the rapidly spreading virus, was fired and the one-star admiral on the ship had his promotion delayed.Adm. Mike Gilday, the chief of naval operations, concluded after a lengthy review that both men made serious errors in judgment.The carrier returned to duty about three months after it docked in Guam and then returned home to the West Coast. Other ships that have been underway or at their home ports over the past year have had smaller numbers of sailors test positive, but none have had such a major outbreak.The Roosevelt has been out on deployment in the Pacific in recent weeks, and about a week ago conducted dual carrier exercises with the USS Nimitz, which is returning home to the West Coast from a lengthy deployment in the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-sailors-have-covid-19-on-us-ship-that-saw-outbreak-last-year-101613438316146.html

16-02-2021||World||UK may need $84 billion of tax increases to balance the books||The UK could need tax increases of about 60 billion pounds ($84 billion) if Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak wants to balance the books, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.The warning sets the tone for the Treasury’s budget on March 3, when Sunak is due to outline how he intends to address the ruinous legacy of a pandemic that has driven government borrowing to its highest in peacetime and forced him to deliver 13 emergency statements since he took office a year ago.“It is possible that growth will be fast enough that big fiscal deficits will largely dissipate of their own accord,” said Paul Johnson, director of the IFS. “But that is not a central expectation. More likely, we are on track for ongoing unsustainable deficits. A reckoning in the form of big future tax rises is highly likely, but not as yet inevitable.”The analysis, based on forecasts by Citigroup, indicates the scarring left by the deepest slump in three centuries may be worse than the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted in November. However, the IFS said now is not the time to be trying to fix the public finances, urging Sunak to bolster the recovery first.The report published Tuesday conceded that the outlook now is not much clearer than it was in November. A central scenario would see Britain still borrowing about 130 billion pounds by the middle of the decade, 30% more than the OBR forecast. That could rise to as much 190 billion pounds under a pessimistic scenario. If the economy manages to emerge with little sustained damage, the deficit would fall to pre-pandemic levels of around 50 billion pounds.Britain has suffered both one of the world’s worst health crises per capita, with more than 4 million Covid-19 infections and almost 122,000 people dead, and also one of the poorest economic outcomes.The government is set to borrow 400 billion pounds -- around a fifth of the size of the economy -- in the current fiscal year. A debt burden of over 2 trillion pounds is manageable now because interest rates are at a historic low, though the IFS warned that the Treasury is vulnerable if those rates rise.Ministers are faced with the task of economic rebuilding at the same time it has embraced two bigger generational challenges: Brexit and commitments to zero out net fossil-fuel pollution by the middle of the century.Under Citi’s main scenario:Sunak “needs to strike a balance between continuing support for jobs and businesses harmed by lockdowns, and weaning the economy off blanket support,” Johnson of the IFS said. “Any significant continuation of the furlough scheme must be limited and carefully targeted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-may-need-84-billion-of-tax-increases-to-balance-the-books-101613436085264.html

The fence around the New Gwadar International Airport is a shambles," he said.Moreover, the projects under the Gwadar Smart Port City Master plan have not been started.In 2015, China announced an economic project in Pakistan worth USD 46 billion. With the CPEC, Beijing aims to expand its influence in Pakistan and across Central and South Asia in order to counter the influence of the United States and India.The CPEC would link Pakistan's southern Gwadar port (626 kilometers, 389 miles west of Karachi) in Balochistan on the Arabian Sea to China's western Xinjiang region. It also includes plans to create road, rail and oil pipeline links to improve connectivity between China and the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-did-not-fund-any-infrastructure-projects-of-cpec-says-pakistan-101613435914191.html

One civilian contractor with the coalition was killed and five others wounded, a coalition spokesman, Col. Wayne Marotto, said in a statement posted on social media. One US service member was also injured, he said.He did not reveal the nationality of the dead contractor and said this was under investigation.No one immediately claimed responsibility.At least two civilians were also wounded and material damage was caused to cars and other property, the security officials said, without providing more details. The rockets were launched from an area south of Irbil near the border with Kirkuk province and fell on some residential areas close to the airport.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.Attacks targeting Irbil airport are rare. Monday's attack was the first to strike the area in five months.On Sept. 30, when six rockets hit near the airport. Kurdish authorities said they had been launched from a pickup truck in the nearby town of Bartella in Ninevah province, which falls under federal government control.Hoshiyar Zebari, a politburo member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, said security officials were investigating the source of the attack. “There will be consequences against the culprits. This aggression will not stand,” he tweeted.Rocket attacks have frequently target the US presence in Baghdad, including the US Embassy, as well as convoys ferrying materials for the US-led coalition.The frequency of attacks diminished late last year ahead of US President Joe Biden's inauguration. The US under the previous Trump administration blamed Iran-backed groups for carrying out the attacks. Tensions soared after a Washington-directed drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani and powerful Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis last year.Trump had said the death of a US contractor would be a red line and provoke US escalation in Iraq. The December 2019 killing of a US civilian contractor in a rocket attack in Kirkuk sparked a tit-for-tat fight on Iraqi soil that brought the country to the brink of a proxy war.US forces have been significantly reduced in Iraq to 2,500 personnel and no longer partake in combat missions with Iraqi forces in ongoing operations against the Islamic State group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rockets-strike-near-us-base-in-iraq-killing-1-wounding-5-101613435615153.html
16-02-2021||World||Texas freeze leaves millions in north Mexico without power||Freezing weather in Texas led to a chain of events that left almost 5 million customers in northern Mexico without power Monday as a shortage of natural gas disrupted electricity production.Mexico’s government-owned utility, the Federal Electricity Commission, said its operations were left short as the winter storm in Texas froze natural gas pipelines. It said some private power plants also began shutting down Sunday night. Private plants supply about 80% of power in northern Mexico.Mexico uses gas to generate about 60% of its power, compared to about 40% in the United States. Mexico built pipelines to take advantage of cheap natural gas from the US, often obtained by fracking in Texas, but Mexico does not allow fracking in its own territory.The utility said US electricity demand also rose as temperatures plunged across the border, leading to much higher prices. It said gas prices had risen from about $3 per million BTUs to as much as $600 in recent days.The commission said that by midday Monday it had restored power to about 65% of the 4.8 million customers affected by the blackout, mainly in the northern border states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. A smaller number of users were also affected in Durango and Zacatecas.The commission said it was seeking to make up for the shortfall by bringing on line more electricity from hydroelectric and coal-fired plants as well as gas supplied by tanker ships.The utility's director of fuel purchasing, Miguel Reyes Hernández, suggested that what happened in Texas was a perfect storm of factors that choked off imports of gas that Mexico uses to run many of its power plants.“Electricity demand in the United States rose by a little over 20% in just four days," Reyes Hernández said. "The increase was due precisely to the drop in temperatures, and obviously the use of heating in the United States meant an increase in natural gas demand on the one hand, and precisely because of the low temperatures, there was a decrease in renewable energy.”He said US wind turbines “had their blades frozen ... and there was freezing in many pipelines and even at wells.”It was the latest embarrassing failure for the Federal Electricity Commission, the government utility that has become a pet project for President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who wants to reduce the role of private power generation.In January, the utility acknowledged it had presented a falsified report on a Dec. 28 blackout, which it had blamed on a purported brush fire beneath transmission lines that caused the two-hour power failure affecting one-fourth of Mexico’s customers.López Obrador has not only defended the state-owned company, but he is seeking to eliminate competition from cleaner, privately built generating plants and renewable energy.In January, he proposed a bill that would put cleaner, natural gas and renewable private plants — many built with foreign investment — last in line for electricity purchases. The private and renewable energy plants were encouraged by López Obrador’s predecessors in order to reduce carbon emissions.López Obrador sought in an executive order in 2020 to shore up the government utility by limiting permits to bring other companies' power plants online, including some wind and solar facilities. The president contends green-energy incentives give those plants an unfair advantage over the state utility.With electricity use down overall during the pandemic, the state utility faces declining revenue and increasing stocks of fuel oil it has to burn in power plants. It has also come under pressure to buy coal from domestic mines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-freeze-leaves-millions-in-north-mexico-without-power-101613434255627.html

Spot gas has been trading for hundreds of dollars across the central US since Thursday with a surge in heating demand triggering widespread blackouts and sending electricity prices soaring. The fuel normally trades in the region for less than $3 per mmBtu.“It’s a shocking situation,” said Cody Moore, head of gas and power trading at Mercuria Energy America LLC. “It’s chaos. It’s crazy with the prices.” Mercuria booked hotel rooms for some of its employees in the Houston area so they could walk to the office instead of driving on icy roads. “Our first priority was to do whatever we can to keep the grid moving, the gas flowing properly, clients informed and regulatory agencies updated where required,” Moore said.Among other news in US gas markets Monday:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/natural-gas-skyrockets-again-to-500-as-blackouts-spread-in-us-101613427818225.html

We have had very strong friendly relations for nearly 40 years, dating from the time I came to Washington as an Israeli diplomatic representative and he was a young senator from Delaware."There has been speculation that the Democratic president could be signalling displeasure over Netanyahu's close ties with former President Donald Trump, who called the right-wing leader two days after his inauguration in 2017."We also have many things we agree on and the alliance is very strong," Netanyahu said. "But there are also differences, on the issue of Iran and on the Palestinian issue as well."Netanyahu may find the alliance tested if Washington restores U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew, and opposes Israeli settlement building on occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood.On Friday, the White House said Biden and Netanyahu would speak soon, but gave no date.(Writing by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Dan Grebler)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-acknowledges-differences-with-biden-but-confident-he-ll-call-101613428707233.html
16-02-2021||World||Cold snap leaves 5 million in Texas, Mexico without power||A rare deep freeze in Texas that raised demand for power forced the US state's electric grid operator on Monday to impose rotating blackouts that left nearly 3 million customers without electricity.The cold snap sweeping Texas reached the northern part of neighboring Mexico as well, where authorities said 4.7 million users lost power early on Monday. Around midday, service had been restored to almost 2.6 million of them.The PowerOutage.us website, which tracks power outages, said 2,820,764 Texas customers were experiencing outages around 2 p.m. CST (2000 GMT).President Joe Biden declared an emergency on Monday, unlocking federal assistance to Texas, where temperatures on Monday ranged from 28 to minus 8 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 to minus 22 Celsius)."The Texas power grid has not been compromised. The ability of some companies that generate the power has been frozen," Texas Governor Greg Abbott wrote on Twitter on Monday. "They are working to get generation back on line."Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport said it would remain closed until at least 1 p.m. CST (1900 GMT) on Tuesday while the city's Hobby Airport ceased operations until at least noon on Tuesday due to the inclement weather.The freeze also took a toll on the energy industry in Texas, by far the country's largest crude producer, shutting oil refineries and forcing restrictions from natural gas pipeline operators.Apart from Texas, much of the United States was in the grip of bone-chilling weather over the three-day Presidents Day holiday weekend.The National Weather Service said an Arctic air mass had spread southwards, well beyond areas accustomed to freezing weather, with winter storm warnings posted for most of the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Missouri.In Louisiana, where freezing temperatures also prompted power outages and road closures, some parishes imposed curfews to keep residents off the road.RECORD DEMANDThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) sought to cut power use in response to a winter record of 69,150 megawatts (MW) on Sunday evening, more than 3,200 MW higher than the previous winter peak in January 2018.About 10,500 MW of customer load was shed at the highest point, enough power to serve approximately two million homes, it said, adding that extreme weather caused many generating units across fuel types to trip offline and become unavailable."Controlled outages will continue through today and into early tomorrow, possibly all of tomorrow," Dan Woodfin, director of systems operations at ERCOT, said at a Monday briefing.The storms knocked out nearly half the Texas wind power generation capacity on Sunday. Wind generation ranks as the second-largest source of electricity in Texas, accounting for 23% of state power supplies, ERCOT estimates.Of the 25,000-plus MW of wind power capacity normally available in Texas, 12,000 MW were out of service on Sunday morning, an ERCOT spokeswoman said.An emergency notice issued by the regulator urged customers to limit power usage and prevent an uncontrolled systemwide outage.The spot price of electricity on the Texas power grid spiked more than 10,000% on Monday. Due to the extreme cold across the region where it operates, Arkansas-based Southwest Power Pool said in a statement it had directed member utilities to implement rolling blackouts."In our history as a grid operator, this is an unprecedented event and it marks the first time SPP has ever had to call for controlled interruptions of service," executive vice president Lanny Nickell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cold-snap-leaves-5-million-in-texas-mexico-without-power-101613428731308.html
16-02-2021||World||Controversial social network Parler announces relaunch||Social network Parler, which is popular with supporters of Donald Trump, announced Monday it had relaunched after being forced offline over incitements to violence on the platform.Parler, which calls itself "the free speech social network", came under scrutiny following the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.Apple and Google pulled the network's app from their download platforms and Amazon's web hosting service cut ties as well."Parler was built to offer a social media platform that protects free speech and values privacy and civil discourse," interim CEO Mark Meckler said in a statement.He added the network was determined to return despite being taken offline "by those who desire to silence tens of millions of Americans."Parler, which claims to have over 20 million users, said it was back for users that already had its app. New users won't be able to get access until next week.Some users reported Monday on other social networks that they were having trouble connecting, including owners of Apple devices.The January 6 attack, when Donald Trump's supporters stormed the US Congress building in Washington, was followed by questions over the influence of Trump and far-right groups on social media.The ex-president was banned from Facebook and Twitter over the incitement of rioters in the storming of the US Capitol."Parler is being run by an experienced team and is here to stay. We will thrive as the premier social media platform dedicated to free speech, privacy and civil dialogue," Meckler said.Nevada-based Parler, which launched in 2018, operates much like Twitter, with profiles to follow and "parleys" instead of tweets.In its early days, the platform attracted a crowd of ultraconservative and even extreme-right users. It has since signed up many more traditional Republican voices.Parler fired its chief executive John Matze soon after the deadly attack on the US Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/controversial-social-network-parler-announces-relaunch-101613428743267.html

It will be launched on Wednesday."As of now, and in parallel to the efforts being made on the current vaccines, we have to help industrial companies develop production capacities for second generation vaccines," von der Leyen was quoted as saying.Von der Leyen last week acknowledged failings in the EU's approval and rollout of vaccines against Covid-19 and said the bloc had learned lessons in the process after criticism of the slow roll-out of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-launch-study-programme-for-covid-19-variants-101613427839231.html
16-02-2021||World||America’s largest oil refineries are going dark amid cold||After creating havoc in the power and natural gas markets, the next commodity sector causing concern in Texas is the state’s enormous oil refining industry, where installations are being forced offline by the big freeze.The largest refineries in North America were shutting down Monday because of arctic conditions that have cut electricity, water and fuel supplies across Texas. More than 3 million barrels of daily oil-processing capacity has been idled in the wake of the record-setting cold, according to consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.The shutdowns portend tightening supplies and higher prices for everything from gasoline to propane in coming days and weeks in cities across the country that rely on the US Gulf Coast for fuels. The impact on fuel supplied by pipeline will likely spread far beyond Texas if the outages last more than a few days, considering that the oil industry had already cut back production during the pandemic. The Gulf Coast supplies more than three-fifths of the East Coast’s fuel.Gasoline futures rose 3.5% to $1.75 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Monday as traders watched developments in Texas:Oil pipelines, electricity generators and wind farms have been paralyzed by the extreme weather conditions in the nation’s top crude-producing state. Refinery capacity is shrinking at a faster pace than oil production is declining due to the arctic weather, according to Energy Aspects.“Disruptions to refining operations could be prolonged if the cold damages any equipment or if the power outages affecting Texas are not resolved quickly,” the consultant said in a note to clients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americas-largest-oil-refineries-are-going-dark-amid-cold-101613427847240.html
16-02-2021||World||Singapore likely to run deficit for 3rd year due to coronavirus pandemic||Singapore’s budget on Tuesday is expected to offer more targeted measures to support the economy’s recovery from its worst year since independence, setting up a third straight budget deficit for the traditionally fiscally conservative city-state.While the the nation appears past the worst of the pandemic and its spending shortfall is narrowing, industries including food and beverage and those associated with travel remain crushed by mobility restrictions. Firms are also still grappling with restructuring staffs and supply chains.“Certain sectors are still struggling with weak demand, high operating costs and manpower constraints and may require continued policy assistance,” Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, said in a Feb. 5 report. “Some of these support measures are gradually reaching the end of their shelf life, but a premature full-scale withdrawal is also unlikely in order to forestall a ‘cliff effect.’”The spending plan for the year starting April 1 may result in a budget deficit equivalent to 4% of gross domestic product, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.While this would mark a third straight year of shortfalls, it’s quickly narrowing from 2020’s record deficit, which is estimated to come in 15.5%. That number had ballooned last year from the government’s initial projection of 2.1% as the severity of the pandemic’s impact triggered multiple stimulus pledges.“Targeted” is the watchword in the new budget as officials balance additional support for vulnerable businesses and households against long-standing caution on debt management. The government already pledged about S$100 billion ($75.6 billion) on pandemic-related stimulus, with approval to fund about half of that from past reserves.Bigger questions lie on the revenue side, with a planned increase in the goods and services tax after 2021 potentially delayed, while other duties might be levied to offset higher spending.Six of the 12 analysts polled by Bloomberg through Feb. 11 said the single-most urgent economic need for the budget to address was supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises to ensure that the whole economy recovers.Here’s a look at what might be in Tuesday’s budget speech to Parliament, to be delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat:Small Businesses, Hard-Hit SectorsSMEs were cushioned last year by wage subsidies and tax and rental relief, though managers largely remained downbeat about the outlook at year-end, according to a Singapore Business Federation survey.Nine of the 12 Bloomberg survey respondents expect small businesses to be the biggest winners out of this budget.Hospitality and retail sectors will be in focus, as well as aviation. Tourism-impacted businesses probably will be the only ones to get an extension of wage subsidies, Citigroup Inc. analysts Kit Wei Zheng and Kai Wei Ang said in a Jan. 28 report.Innovation, TechnologyThe government’s tagline “emerge stronger” has been tied to plans over the past year to accelerate the transition to a more digital economy, including cashless payments and helping workers transition to next-generation roles.Singapore has laid out a five-year plan to invest S$25 billion for research and development and debuted a special work visa for technology jobs. Its No. 2 ranking in the ninth annual Bloomberg Innovation Index reaffirmed its standing as a world-class innovator.A pandemic-era push to prioritize the workforce’s “Singaporean core” has re-kindled debate over relying on foreign staff versus developing local talent in some high-value sectors. Last year, total employment contracted by 172,200 last year, with 181,500 non-resident jobs lost versus a gain of 9,300 for residents.“Policymakers may want to capitalize on this window to further nudge companies toward fostering a Singaporean core workforce, and to invest in automation,” Irvin Seah, senior economist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore, said in a Jan. 19 report.GST, Other TaxesThe government has signaled that a planned rise of the Goods and Services Tax from 7% won’t happen until at least next year. Any hint of an alteration in the timeline could impact inflation projections and monetary policy.David Sandison, head of tax for Grant Thornton Singapore Pte Ltd., a business adviser, predicts a GST increase in 2023 and “possibly, with only a 1% hike, the rest hot on its heels.” Maybank analysts project a rise in 2022 or 2023.Grant Thornton partner Eng Min Lor suggests that corporate income tax rebates and their caps -- which typically are announced for the next year -- could be charted for the next two years to help businesses plan. She’ll also be on the lookout for cash grants to loss-making companies.Climate, Digital EconomySingapore’s officials have trumpeted the “green economy” and efforts to be a world leader in combating climate impacts.OCBC’s Ling suggests it might be time to boost the carbon tax from $5 per metric ton, given the government’s goal of $10-$15 per ton by 2030. She’s also looking for green finance incentives given the flurry of such deals lately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-likely-to-run-deficit-for-3rd-year-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-101613427869293.html
16-02-2021||World||Nancy Pelosi says independent commission will examine Capitol riot||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Congress will establish an independent, Sept. 11-style commission to look into the deadly insurrection that took place at the US Capitol.Pelosi says the commission will “investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex … and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power."The speaker says in a letter to Democratic colleagues that the House will also put forth supplemental spending to boost security at the Capitol.After former President Donald Trump's acquittal at his second Senate impeachment trial, bipartisan support appears to be growing for an independent Sept. 11-style commission into the deadly insurrection that took place at the US Capitol.Investigations into the riot were already planned, with Senate hearings scheduled later this month in the Senate Rules Committee. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has asked retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré to lead an immediate review of the Capitol’s security process.Lawmakers from both parties, speaking on Sunday's news shows, signaled that even more inquiries were likely. The Senate verdict Saturday, with its 57-43 majority falling 10 votes short of the two-thirds needed to convict Trump, hardly put to rest the debate about the Republican former president’s culpability for the Jan. 6 assault.“There should be a complete investigation about what happened,” said Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump. “What was known, who knew it and when they knew, all that, because that builds the basis so this never happens again.”Cassidy said he was “attempting to hold President Trump accountable,” and added that as Americans hear all the facts, “more folks will move to where I was.” He was censured by his state’s party after the vote.An independent commission along the lines of the one that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks would probably require legislation to create. That would elevate the investigation a step higher, offering a definitive government-backed accounting of events. Pelosi has expressed support for such a commission while stressing that the members who sit on it would be key. Still, such a panel would pose risks of sharpening partisan divisions or overshadowing President Joe Biden's legislative agenda.“There’s still more evidence that the American people need and deserve to hear and a 9/11 commission is a way to make sure that we secure the Capitol going forward,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden ally. “And that we lay bare the record of just how responsible and how abjectly violating of his constitutional oath President Trump really was.”House prosecutors who argued for Trump's conviction of inciting the riot said Sunday they had proved their case. They also railed against the Senate’s Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and others who they said were “trying to have it both ways” in finding the former president not guilty but criticizing him at the same time.A close Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., voted for acquittal but acknowledged that Trump had some culpability for the siege at the Capitol that killed five people, including a police officer, and disrupted lawmakers’ certification of Biden’s White House victory. Graham said he looked forward to campaigning with Trump in the 2022 election, when Republicans hope to regain the congressional majority.“His behavior after the election was over the top,” Graham said. “We need a 9/11 commission to find out what happened and make sure it never happens again.”The Senate acquitted Trump of a charge of “incitement of insurrection” after House prosecutors laid out a case that he was an “inciter in chief” who unleashed a mob by stoking a monthslong campaign of spreading debunked conspiracy theories and false violent rhetoric that the 2020 election was stolen from him.Trump’s lawyers countered that Trump’s words were not intended to incite the violence and that impeachment was nothing but a “witch hunt” designed to prevent him from serving in office again.The conviction tally was the most bipartisan in American history but left Trump to declare victory and signal a political revival while a bitterly divided GOP bickered over its direction and his place in the party.The Republicans who joined Cassidy in voting to convict were Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.“It’s frustrating, but the founders knew what they were doing and so we live with the system that we have,” Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett, a House prosecutor who represents the Virgin Islands, said of the verdict, describing it as “heartbreaking.” She added: “But, listen, we didn’t need more witnesses. We needed more senators with spines.”McConnell told Republican senators shortly before the vote that he would vote to acquit Trump. In a blistering speech after the vote, the Kentucky Republican said the president was “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day" but that the Senate's hands were tied to do anything about it because Trump was out of office. The Senate, in an earlier vote, had deemed the trial constitutional.“It was powerful to hear the 57 guilties and then it was puzzling to hear and see Mitch McConnell stand and say ‘not guilty’ and then, minutes later, stand again and say he was guilty of everything,” said Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa. “History will remember that statement of speaking out of two sides of his mouth,” she said.Dean also backed the idea of an impartial investigative commission "not guided by politics but filled with people who would stand up to the courage of their conviction.”The lead House impeachment manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., called the trial a “dramatic success in historical terms” by winning unprecedented support from GOP senators. He said the verdict didn't match the reality of the strength of evidence.“We successfully prosecuted him and convicted him in the court of public opinion and the court of history,” he said. Pointing to McConnell and other Republican senators critical of Trump but voting to acquit, Raskin said, “They’re trying to have it both ways.”Raskin and Plaskett defended the House team’s last-minute reversal not to call a witness, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash. They acknowledged they were aware they might lose some GOP votes for conviction if they extended the trial much longer.Beutler's statement late Friday that Trump rebuffed a plea from House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to call off the rioters was ultimately entered into the trial record.“I think what we did was, we got what we wanted, which was her statement, which was what she said, and had it put into the record,” Plaskett said.Cassidy and Dean spoke on ABC's “This Week,” Graham appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” Raskin was on NBC's “Meet the Press,” and Plaskett appeared on CNN's “State of the Union.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-says-independent-commission-will-examine-capitol-riot-101613427881319.html
16-02-2021||World||Biden faces questions about commitment to minimum wage hike||Union activist Terrence Wise recalls being laughed at when he began pushing for a national $15 per hour minimum wage almost a decade ago. Nearly a year into the pandemic, the idea isn't so funny.The coronavirus has renewed focus on challenges facing hourly employees who have continued working in grocery stores, gas stations and other in-person locations even as much of the workforce has shifted to virtual environments. President Joe Biden has responded by including a provision in the massive pandemic relief bill that would more than double the minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $15 per hour.But the effort is facing an unexpected roadblock: Biden himself. The president has seemingly undermined the push to raise the minimum wage by acknowledging its dim prospects in Congress, where it faces political opposition and procedural hurdles.That's frustrating to activists like Wise, who worry their victory is being snatched away at the last minute despite an administration that's otherwise an outspoken ally.“To have it this close on the doorstep, they need to get it done,” said Wise, a 41-year-old department manager at a McDonald's in Kansas City and a national leader of Fight for 15, an organized labor movement. "They need to feel the pressure.”The minimum wage debate highlights one of the central tensions emerging in the early days of Biden's presidency. He won the White House with pledges to respond to the pandemic with a barrage of liberal policy proposals. But as a 36-year veteran of the Senate, Biden is particularly attuned to the political dynamics on Capitol Hill and can be blunt in his assessments."I don’t think it's going to survive,” Biden recently told CBS News, referring to the minimum wage hike.There's a certain political realism in Biden's remark.With the Senate evenly divided, the proposal doesn't have the 60 votes needed to make it to the floor on its own. Democrats could use an arcane budgetary procedure that would attach the minimum wage to the pandemic response bill and allow it to pass with a simple majority vote.But even that's not easy. Some moderate Democratic senators, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Krysten Sinema of Arizona, have expressed either outright opposition to the hike or said it shouldn't be included in the pandemic legislation.The Senate's parliamentarian may further complicate things with a ruling that the minimum wage measure can't be included in the pandemic bill.For now, the measure's most progressive Senate backers aren't openly pressuring Biden to step up his campaign for a higher minimum wage.Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, has said he's largely focused on winning approval from the parliamentarian to tack the provision onto the pandemic bill. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who like Sanders challenged Biden from the left for the Democratic nomination, has only tweeted that Democrats should “right this wrong."Some activists, however, are encouraging Biden to be more aggressive.The Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, the co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign, said Biden has a “mandate” to ensure the minimum wage increases, noting that minority Americans were “the first to go back to jobs, first to get infected, first to get sick, first to die” during the pandemic.“We cannot be the last to get relief and the last to get treated and paid properly,” Barber said.The federal minimum wage hasn’t been raised since 2009, the longest stretch without an increase since its creation in 1938. When adjusted for inflation, the purchasing power of the current $7.25 wage has declined more than a dollar in the last 11-plus years.Democrats have long promised an increase — support for a $15 minimum wage was including in the party’s 2016 political platform — but haven’t delivered.Supporters say the coronavirus has made a higher minimum wage all the more urgent since workers earning it are disproportionately people of color. The liberal Economic Policy Institute found that more than 19% of Hispanic workers and more than 14% of Black workers earned hourly wages that kept them below federal poverty guidelines in 2017.Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans in the U.S. also have rates of hospitalization and death from Covid-19 that are two to four times higher than for whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.People of color are a vital part Biden’s constituency, constituting 38% of his support in November’s election, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of the electorate.Adrianne Shropshire. executive director of BlackPAC, noted that Biden has promised to address racial inequalities and create a more fair economy. That means he now has a chance to ensure that hourly wage earners “come out of this pandemic in better shape than they went into it.”“The recovery around Covid shouldn’t just be about how to stabilize and get people back to zero,” Shropshire said. “It should be about how do we create opportunities to move people beyond where they were.”The White House says Biden isn’t giving up on the issue. His comments to CBS, according to an aide, reflected his own evaluation of where the parliamentarian would rule based on his decades of experience in the Senate dealing with similar negotiations.Biden suggested in the same interview that he’s prepared to engage in a “separate negotiation” on raising the minimum wage, but White House press secretary Jen Psaki offered no further details on the future of the proposal if it is in fact cut from the final coronavirus aid bill.One option could be forcing passage by having Vice President Kamala Harris, as the Senate’s presiding officer, overrule the parliamentarian. But Psaki was clear in opposing that: “Our view is that the parliamentarian is who is chosen, typically, to make a decision in a nonpartisan manner.”Navin Nayak, executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the political arm of the progressive think tank, said he wasn’t surprised at Biden’s assessment, but still feels the White House is making good faith efforts.“They’re not putting this in there to lose it — they put it in there to win it,” Nayak said.Nayak also noted Biden’s comments came before a Congressional Budget Office projection that found the proposal would help lift millions of Americans out of poverty but increase the federal deficit and cost 1.4 million jobs as employers scale back costlier workforces.Sanders and other supporters argue that the CBO's finding that raising the minimum wage will increase the deficit means it impacts the budget — and should therefore be allowed as part of the Covid relief bill. But that will ultimately be up to the Senate parliamentarian.For Wise, potential congressional hurdles pale in comparison to real world realities.He makes $14 an hour and his fiancé works as a home health care professional. But when she went into quarantine because of possible exposure to the coronavirus and he missed work to care for their three daughters, it wasn’t long before the family was served with an eviction notice.People “figure it’s something we’re doing wrong. We’re going to work. We’re productive. We’re law-abiding citizens,” Wise said. “It shouldn’t have to be that way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-faces-questions-about-commitment-to-minimum-wage-hike-101613427889262.html
16-02-2021||World||Already in the red, Covid threatens New York's iconic yellow taxis||They were omnipresent on the streets of New York day and night, as emblematic of the Big Apple as the Empire State Building or Yankees caps. But the pandemic has made yellow taxis scarce and facing an uncertain future.On a February morning in a parking lot near La Guardia Airport, a few dozen of the yellow cabs patiently queue in the freezing cold to catch a fare from one of the terminals."This lot used to be full with hundreds of cabs and even a line outside," says 65-year-old Joey Olivo, recalling the days before coronavirus."Now there is only about 50 and you wait two hours, when before you'd wait 20 minutes," adds Olivo, a taxi driver for three decades.Widespread working from home, school closures and no tourists means rides have plummeted for Olivo, as they have for all of New York's cabbies."It's been pretty bad. My earnings dropped 80 percent. I went from making maybe $1,000 a week to making two or 300 dollars a week," he told AFP.Olivo, who lives in Brooklyn, is trying to put a brave face on his situation, joking that he is lucky his wife "makes good money" as a nurse, otherwise "I would have had a rope around my neck."- 'Free fall' -New York taxi drivers, most of whom are first-generation immigrants, were once able to make $7,000 a month or more if they worked long hours seven days a week.Competition from Uber, Lyft and other vehicle-for-hire firms had already drastically dented their income, but with the pandemic it is in "free fall," says Richard Chow, a 62-year-old taxi driver originally from Myanmar.Chow is not feeling the press as much as most, because he bought his license, called a "medallion" in New York, for $410,000 in 2006.In the years that followed, medallion prices soared, inflated by a nexus of bankers, investors and lawyers.In 2009, his younger brother Kenny Chow paid $750,000 for his license. In 2014, the cost of medallion reached $1 million.The arrival of thousands of new drivers working for Uber and others has caused the medallion bubble to burst and condemned thousands of cabbies who had bought medallions at a high cost on credit to fall into debt or bankruptcy.Kenny Chow and at least seven other drivers, including of black cars and limousines, committed suicide in 2018, underscoring a dire situation that has been worsened by the pandemic."The pandemic has just been devastating," said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance."Before the pandemic, ridership had been down by 50 percent. Since the pandemic, it's down closer to 90 percent," she told AFP."The parts of the city that are the most deserted are the parts of Manhattan where drivers depend on in order to earn their living, and the airports," Desai added.Hence the scarcity of yellow taxis. Out of some 13,000 licenses, only about 5,000 taxis are running regularly at the moment, according to the union.Some 7,000 others aren't even leaving their garages. According to William Pierre, a driver from Haiti, it is no longer profitable.He continues to drive even though his daily earnings barely exceed $100 to $150, which he shares 50/50 with the company that leases the car to him."I don't want to stay home. I want to be out there to feed my family," he says.So could the yellow taxis, which replaced checkered-striped cabs in the 1960s, actually disappear?- 'Cultural icon' -Olivo and Pierre believe business will pick up eventually, even though they agree it will never be the same again.Desai fears yellow cabs "will slowly phase out" if the city government does not erase drivers' debts.Her union is stepping up protests and dozens of drivers briefly blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge on Wednesday."You know you are in NYC when you see that yellow," says Desai, adding that the taxis are famous the world over."It's a cultural icon... a 24-hour service that is part of the economic, social and cultural fabric of our beautiful city."New York's Democratic mayor, Bill de Blasio, has promised to help the taxi drivers provided the city, economically ravaged by the pandemic, is bailed out by the federal government."If we can get the kind of stimulus support we deserve. I think it opens the door to coming up with a solution to help taxi drivers and families who have suffered so much," he said on Wednesday.cat/pdh/dw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/already-in-the-red-covid-threatens-new-york-s-iconic-yellow-taxis-101613416212345.html
16-02-2021||World||Effort to mislead global community: Pakistan on visit of foreign envoys to J-K||Ahead of the planned visit of the third batch of foreign envoys to Jammu and Kashmir this week, Pakistan on Monday sought to portray the move as an effort by India to mislead the world community.The external affairs ministry is taking a group of ambassadors and senior diplomats, mainly from European countries, to the Kashmir Valley and Jammu as a continuation of the process that began early last year and was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The envoys are expected to be in the Kashmir Valley on February 17, before travelling to Jammu the following day. As with the two groups of envoys that visited the region in January and February 2020, the third batch is expected to interact with grassroots political leaders, members of civil society groups and businessmen.In a statement issued in Islamabad, Pakistan’s Foreign Office described the planned visit by the diplomats as part of India’s efforts to “mislead the world community”.“Such guided tours are a smokescreen, aimed at diverting international attention from India’s egregious human rights violations in [Jammu and Kashmir] and creating a false impression of ‘normalcy’,” the statement said.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the statement.The visit is being arranged less than two weeks after the government restored 4G mobile internet services in the union territory. The services were snapped and other restrictions were imposed when the government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019 and split the erstwhile state into two union territories.The restrictions have been gradually eased over the past year.Pakistan has opposed India’s actions in Jammu and Kashmir, which took bilateral ties to a fresh low. Islamabad asked the Indian envoy to leave and decided not to post a high commissioner in New Delhi. The Indian side spurned a recent offer of friendship from the Pakistan Army chief, saying talks can’t be held without the creation of an atmosphere free of terror and violence by Pakistan.The Pakistan Foreign Office’s statement also called for foreign diplomats to be given access to all areas and to be allowed to freely interact with Kashmiri people, civil society and the senior Hurriyat leadership. It also called for India to allow the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN observers and international media to visit Jammu and Kashmir.In the past, India has described such moves by Pakistan as interference in its internal affairs and rejected them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/effort-to-mislead-global-community-pakistan-on-visit-of-foreign-envoys-to-jk-101613413030748.html
