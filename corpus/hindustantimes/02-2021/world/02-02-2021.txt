The person spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the official announcement.Initially the government will be shipping limited quantities of vaccine to drug stores around the country, but that's expected to accelerate as drugmakers increase production. Drug stores have become a mainstay for flu shots and shingles vaccines, and the industry is capable of vaccinating tens of millions of people monthly.The partnership with drug stores was originally announced by the Trump administration last November. At that time, no coronavirus vaccines had been approved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-moves-to-provide-covid-19-vaccine-to-pharmacies-101612286538238.html

Raytheon’s Collins Aerospace unit is a subcontractor on a planned new intercontinental ballistic missile effort led by Northrop Grumman Corp., and Raytheon is the top contractor on the missile known as the Long-Range Standoff weapon.In written questions to Hicks, the Armed Services Committee said Austin’s “broadly scoped recusal will almost certainly prohibit” his participation in those major decisions.Hicks also would be responsible for directing day-to-day management of the vast Pentagon bureaucracy as it grapples with restoring frayed trust with American allies and helping in the nationwide roll-out of coronavirus vaccines.Hicks, 50, headed Biden’s Pentagon transition team and is an expert on national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She also has been serving on the board of closely held Aerospace Corp. She was deputy undersecretary of defense for strategy, plans and forces from 2009 to 2012 and principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy from 2012 to 2013.Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who introduced Hicks, said she has “deep knowledge” of the Defense Department and its “bureaucratic black arts” and helped shape strategic policies in times of constrained budgets.Hicks also commented on the challenges presented by China’s rise, echoing Austin in describing the Asian power as “the pacing challenge of our time.” She said that “armed conflict between the United States and China is not desirable and it is not inevitable,” but acknowledged that it’s possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-pick-for-pentagon-deputy-kathleen-hicks-vows-to-defend-nuclear-triad-101612283297241.html

The official was responding to a question if the US was in touch with countries that have good relations with the Myanmar military, such as India and Japan.“We’re having daily ongoing conversations with them and we certainly appreciate that some other countries have better contact with Burmese military than we do, so we’re continuing those conversations,” the official added.The coup-related US restrictions were still being worked out, but the official said they will not impact humanitarian non-governmental assistance such as those meant for Rohingya refugees.President Joe Biden had on Monday warned of “appropriate action” against the Myanmar government that could include the possible reimposition of sanctions.“The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House.The United States had removed economic sanctions on Myanmar in 2016. But many of the key figures in the Myanmar military are under restrictions for human rights violations, including those related to the Rohingya people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-in-touch-with-india-japan-on-myanmar-coup-101612286444861.html

Several countries have reported that Candida auris, first identified in Asia in 2009, has caused severe illness in hospitalised patients. The yeast is reported to be able to enter the bloodstream and spread through the body leading to invasive infections."CDC fungal experts had never received a report describing a Candida infection resistant to all antifungal medications, let alone Candida that spreads easily between patients. After hearing the news that infections like this were identified by international colleagues in 2016, CDC sounded the alarm in the United States about C. auris, a life-threatening Candida species," a CDC report stated."It is a creature from the black lagoon. It bubbled up and now it is everywhere," The Sun quoted CDC's Dr Tom Chiller as saying.Here's all you need to know about the fungus:1. The severe infection causing pathogen is multi-drug resistant meaning it is resistant to multi antifungal drugs used to treat types of Candida.2. Standard laboratory methods can misidentify the fungus without specialised technology which can cause greater mismanagement.Also Read | Candida auris: Mysterious fungus that infected Covid-19 patients at US hospital3. It can cause outbreaks in the healthcare environment and hence it is important to identify C auris in a hospitalised patient quickly to control the spread.4. While it is yet not clear if it caused lung or bladder infection, C auris has caused bloodstream, wound and ear infections.5. Hospitalised patients or people who have recently been discharged from healthcare facilities after invasive surgeries in which lines and tubes go into the body like breathing tubes, feeding tubes and central venous catheters are the most vulnerable group.6. Severe infections by the pathogen can be fatal. Based on limited data, CDC has said 30-60 per cent people with C auris infections have died.7. Infections have been diagnosed in people of all ages from infants to elderly.8. The fungus is also resistant to common healthcare disinfectants.Also Read | Covid-19 triggering rare, fatal fungal infection: Here’s all about mucormycosis9. The fungus can be carried on a patient's skin without causing infection, allowing spread to others.10. Cases of C auris infections have been reported in several parts of the world including the US, eastern Asia, South America and Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/creature-from-black-lagoon-cdc-warns-of-fungal-infection-that-poses-global-health-threat-101612284061027.html

But his term ended before the beginning of the Senate trial, prompting Republican lawmakers to argue it is unconstitutional to convict a president after he has left office.It is an argument Trump's lawyers are expected to make in his defense, but the Democrats rejected that reasoning outright."There is no 'January Exception' to impeachment or any other provision of the Constitution," they wrote, adding that a president must answer for his conduct in office "from his first day in office through his last."The brief points to multiple videos -- expected to be used as evidence in the trial -- which they say show Trump inciting the crowd to commit violence, and show rioters chanting "Hang Mike Pence!" and hunting for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Trump spent much of his time after the November 3 vote claiming that the election was stolen through massive fraud.Dozens of courts in multiple states found the argument baseless.But impeachment managers argued that Trump's constant promoting of the unfounded accusations that the election was stolen fueled his supporters into backing efforts to overturn the election.When those efforts failed, the Democrats wrote, Trump "summoned a mob to Washington, exhorted them into a frenzy, and aimed them like a loaded cannon down Pennsylvania Avenue."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-provoked-violence-lawmakers-say-in-impeachment-trial-brief-101612285111211.html
02-02-2021||World||New York snow sets record, city starts digging out||The nor’easter that paralyzed New York and blanketed the East and Midwest with heavy snow will edge its way along the coast as a blast of Arctic air sweeps behind it, sending temperatures tumbling across the central US. New York’s Central Park received 19.3 inches (49 centimeters) since Sunday, which makes the storm the city’s ninth heaviest since 1869, said Rob Carolan, owner of Hometown Forecast Services Inc. The bulk of the snow fell Monday, setting a record for the date, according to the National Weather Service. “The setup was perfect for the tri-state area to get buried,” said Carolan, who provides forecasts for Bloomberg Radio. “The radar looked like a fire hose coming off the Atlantic.”The storm closed Covid vaccination sites across the region and tied up road and rail traffic, with trains and subways being suspended in New York on Monday. While school buildings were closed, many students were still required to log on for remote learning.Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in 44 counties, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio enacted a travel ban in the city. More than 3,100 flights in the U.S. have been canceled since Sunday, according to Flight Aware, an airline tracking service.There will be some light snowfall Tuesday, “but it will be more of a digging out and cleaning up,” Cuomo said on 1010 WINS radio.With the worst of the storm over in the mid-Atlantic, Metro North trains resumed regular service, while the Long Island Rail Road is operating on a weekend schedule. Amtrak is operating on a modified schedule. New York schools are still closed through Tuesday, with students learning from home. New York subways began operating above ground at 5 a.m.New York has ordered all vaccine sites to honor appointments. “It will be honored, and that is a state order,” Cuomo said Tuesday.Snow ShowersThe storm will linger off the East Coast with snow showers continuing across large cities along the Interstate 95 corridor, but the heaviest amounts will fall in interior New York and New England, said Lara Pagano, a meteorologist with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center. The highest total from the storm so far was Nazareth, Pennsylvania, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of New York, which received 31 inches.Along the Massachusetts coast, Boston’s Logan International Airport got 1.2 inches, while suburbs just to the north and west got between 17 to 20 inches, Carolan said.As the snow heads off to Canada, frigid, Arctic air is set to rip into the Great Plains and Midwest, sending temperatures 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (6 to 11 Celsius), or more, below normal later this week, Pagano said. Lows will reach 3 degrees Fahrenheit in Milwaukee Friday and 6 in Chicago. Minneapolis will be minus 2.By early next week, some of that cold will arrive in the East, she said.Below NormalThroughout the season, winter has been relatively mild across the U.S. with few major snowstorms and above-normal temperatures. Meteorologists have been predicting a blast of cold after a sudden stratospheric warming event occurred over the Arctic earlier this year, which usually precedes a breakdown of the polar vortex and allows frigid air to spill southward into Asia, Europe and North America.The cold could mean temperatures dropping 5 to 8 degrees below normal across the eastern half of the U.S. from Feb. 7 to 16, according to Matt Rogers, president of the Commodity Weather Group LLC. That will drive up energy demand, and possibly shore up natural gas prices.“A significant pattern change favoring a two-week period of very cold air appears,” said Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist with the Energy Weather Group. “The full wrath of winter arrives in the East in a week.”However, the cold will likely prove short-lived, with temperatures becoming milder again in March, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-snow-sets-record-city-starts-digging-out-101612277011949.html

He had tested positive for Covid-19 on Jan. 22 and was fighting pneumonia.Over the last five years, Moore had been receiving treatment for prostate and skin cancer, his family said. He had not been vaccinated against Covid-19 due to the other medication he was taking.When he started his sponsored walk at his home in the village of Marston Moretaine, 80km (50 miles) north of London, he hoped to raise 1,000 pounds.Instead, he raised millions of pounds for the National Health Service, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, broke two Guinness world records, scored a No. 1 single in the pop charts, wrote an autobiography and helped set up a charity."We share our deepest condolences and sympathies with his family and loved ones at this incredibly sad time," Bedford Hospital's chief nurse Liz Lees said."We’d also like to say thank you, and pay tribute to Captain Sir Tom Moore for the remarkable contribution he has made to the NHS."Sunshine during lockdownRaised in Yorkshire, northern England, Moore served in India, Burma and Sumatra during World War Two.Queen Elizabeth II, who knighted Moore, will send a message of private condolence to the family. Elizabeth "very much enjoyed meeting Captain Sir Tom" and her thoughts were with his family, Buckingham Palace said."The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of," his daughters said."Whilst he'd been in so many hearts for just a short time, he was an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay alive in our hearts forever."Politicians paid tribute to Moore."I'm so sorry to hear that Captain Tom has passed away in hospital," British health minister Matt Hancock said on Twitter. "He was a great British hero that showed the best of our country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-record-breaking-fundraiser-captain-tom-moore-dies-aged-100-101612284957348.html

It has felt like at times we're all living the same day over and over again,” one of the members said. “Groundhog Day also shows us that the monotony ends. The cycle will be broken.”“Today actually is Groundhog Day, there's only one,” he added. “There is quite literally a new day coming over the horizon.”The spectacle that is Groundhog Day at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, still went on, but because of the coronavirus pandemic, revelers weren’t able to see him and celebrate in person: This year, it’s all virtual.Read | What is Groundhog Day and how social media found new meaning under Covid-19 lockdown?A livestream, which had more than 15,000 viewers at one point, played footage from previous Groundhog Day's ahead of the big reveal.Then of course, the prognosticator of prognosticators — assisted by his Inner Circle — emerged at dawn. The lore goes that if he sees his shadow as he did this year, there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring comes early.The livestream from Gobbler's Knob, a tiny hill just outside Punxsutawney about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, is made possible by the Pennsylvania Tourism Office's Holi-stay PA. The event there — always Feb. 2 — dates back to 1887.Phil this year, like many years in the past, gave his forecast during a major snowstorm that hit the entire Northeast.The annual event has its origin in a German legend about a furry rodent. Records dating to the late 1800s show Phil has predicted longer winters more than 100 times. The 2020 forecast called for an early spring — however, Phil didn't say anything about a pandemic.Punxsutawney Phil may be the most famous groundhog seer but he's certainly not the only one. There are two other high-profile “imposters,” as the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club calls them, in the region.Staten Island Chuck will be asked for his prophesy Tuesday around 8 a.m. at the Staten Island Zoo in New York. That event will be streamed on Facebook since the zoo is closed.Also without fanfare, Chuckles, Connecticut's official state groundhog, will make a prediction from home: the Lutz Children's Museum in Manchester. That will also be streamed on Facebook.

Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, saw its own shadow which, according to the legend, meant there will be six more weeks of winter.What is Groundhog Day?The annual tradition, which has its origin in a German legend about a furry rodent, is celebrated every year on February 2 in the United States and has been part of its pop culture for many years. The legend of Groundhog Day dictates that if a groundhog emerges on this day from its burrow and sees its own shadow, it will return to its den and the winter will extend for six more weeks. On this day, people hold events around the country and weather reporters Live broadcast the so-called weather prediction.However, this year has been different due to the ongoing pandemic and social media users have compared the day with the hit 1993 comedy Groundhog Day. In the movie, actor Bill Murray played the character of weatherman Phil who was sent to cover the event for a news channel. After arriving in Punxsutawney town of Pennsylvania, he wakes up the next day and relives it over and over again.What’s the pandemic connection?At the beginning of the last spring, governments around the world started imposing movement restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus disease. While vaccines have rolled out in several countries to provide immunity against the disease, social distancing measures are still in place with different variants of virus creating concern for authorities. Social media users said that the pandemic has made every day a Groundhog Day as they are forced to stay at home.

02-02-2021||World||China strips license from second lawyer who represented Hong Kong activists||A second Chinese lawyer who represented a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist was stripped of his license on Tuesday as Beijing attempts to crush opposition to its tighter control over the territory.Ren Quanniu, who represented one of 12 Hong Kong activists who tried to flee to Taiwan, said he had his license revoked by the Henan Provincial Justice Department.Ten of the 12 activists caught at sea in August were sentenced by a Shenzhen court in December to prison terms ranging from seven months to three years for crossing the border illegally and organizing the crossings. The two other activists are minors.Thousands of Hong Kong residents have fled the territory since Beijing’s imposition of a tough new security law that some say is destroying the territory’s Western-style civil liberties. Since the law was introduced in response to anti-government protests that began in 2019, dozens of pro-democracy activists have been arrested or detained.The Henan Judicial Department held a hearing on the license revocation on Friday in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, according to other lawyers who turned up to support Ren. They were not allowed into the hearing.Ren is the second lawyer to have his license stripped by the authorities for handling the activists' case. Two weeks ago, judicial officials in Sichuan took away the license of Lu Siwei, another lawyer on the case.Ren was told that comments he made in court in a case in 2018 defending Falun Gong practitioners had caused a “negative impact on society,” according to a notice from the Henan Justice Department that he showed to The Associated Press.An official who answered the phone at the Henan Justice Department declined to comment on the case, saying they did not deal directly with media.Ren has years of experience in handling politically human rights cases in China. He has defended people affiliated with the Falun Gong, a spiritual movement which China has labeled a cult and is the subject of persecution after its followers protested in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1999.Most recently, he represented citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was sentenced to four years in prison last December for attempting to report on the situation in the city of Wuhan during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic early last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-strips-license-from-second-lawyer-who-represented-hong-kong-activists-101612257837515.html

02-02-2021||World||Why did the military stage a coup in Myanmar?||A coup in Myanmar has left the military in control under a one-year state of emergency, while the country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior politicians have been detained. Here’s a look at what could be behind the military’s actions.WHY NOW?Monday was supposed to be the first day of a new session of Parliament following November elections that Suu Kyi’s party won in a landslide — and that the military-backed party did poorly in. The military has claimed widespread irregularities on voter lists could have led to fraud in that vote, though the election commission said there was no evidence to support those claims.But the announcement on military-owned Myawaddy TV of the takeover cited the government's failure to act on the allegations as part of the reason for the move.The military maintains its actions are legally justified, and the announcement cited an article in the constitution that allows the military to take over in times of emergency, though Suu Kyi's party's spokesman and many outsiders have said it's effectively a coup.Some experts expressed puzzlement that the military would move to upset the status quo — in which the generals continue to hold tremendous power despite progress toward democracy in recent years.But some noted the looming retirement of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who has been commander of the armed forces since 2011 and who was put in charge on Monday.“There’s internal military politics around that, which is very opaque,” said Kim Jolliffe, a researcher on Myanmar civilian and military relations. “This might be reflecting those dynamics and might be somewhat of a coup internally and his way of maintaining power within the military.”WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE MYANMAR?Television signals were cut across the country, as was phone and internet access in Naypyitaw, the capital, while passenger flights were grounded. Phone service in other parts of the country was also reported down, though people were still able to use the internet in many areas.Barbed wire road blocks were set up across Yangon, the largest city, and military units began to appear outside government buildings such as City Hall.Residents flocked to ATMs and food stalls, while some shops and homes removed the symbols of Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, that typically adorn the streets and walls of the city.WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SUU KYI?Suu Kyi spent years under house arrest and received the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to bring democracy to Myanmar. But her reputation outside of the country soured after she went on the international stage to defend a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims — a campaign the U.S. and others have labeled genocide.Former U.S. diplomat Bill Richardson questioned Suu Kyi’s ability to lead given that defense.“Because of Suu Kyi’s failure to promote democratic values as Myanmar’s de facto leader, she should step aside and let other Myanmar democratic leaders take the reins with international backing and support,” Richardson said in a statement.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Governments and international organizations condemned the takeover, saying it sets back the limited democratic reforms Myanmar has made.“This is an extremely crushing blow to efforts to present Myanmar as a democracy,” said Linda Lakhdhir, a legal adviser at Human Rights Watch. "Its creditability on the world stage has taken a massive hit.”Watchdog groups fear a further crackdown on human rights defenders, journalists, and activists is coming. Even before the current military takeover critics of the military often faced legal action.The coup will also be a test for the international community, which had isolated Myanmar during the decades it was under strict military rule but then enthusiastically embraced it as it moved toward democracy in recent years.In a statement condemning the military's actions, U.S. President Joe Biden threatened to impose new sanctions on Myanmar — a possibility others have raised.Myanmar’s military leaders “must immediately free the democratic leaders of Myanmar and remove themselves from government,” said Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “If not, the United States and other countries should impose strict economic sanctions, as well as other measures” against the military and its leaders, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-did-the-military-stage-a-coup-in-myanmar-101612274851873.html
02-02-2021||World||Rohingya refugees fear returning to Myanmar after coup||Rohingya refugees from Myanmar living in camps in Bangladesh condemned the military coup in their homeland and said it makes them more fearful to return.A counterinsurgency operation by Myanmar's military in 2017 involving mass rape, murders and the torching of villages drove more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims into neighboring Bangladesh.Bangladesh has hosted them in crowded refugee camps, and is eager to begin sending them back to Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Several attempts at repatriation under a joint agreement failed because the Rohingya refused to go, fearing more violence in a country that denies them basic rights including citizenship.Refugees said Tuesday they are more afraid now that the military is in complete control.“The military killed us, raped our sisters and mothers, torched our villages. How is it possible for us to stay safe under their control?” said Khin Maung, head of the Rohingya Youth Association in the camps in Cox’s Bazar district.“Any peaceful repatriation will hugely be impacted," he told The Associated Press. "It will take a long time because the political situation in Myanmar is worse now.”Officials from Myanmar and Bangladesh met last month to discuss ways to start the repatriations, with Bangladesh’s Foreign Ministry seeming more hopeful of success and officials saying they expected to begin sometime in June.But refugees said they totally oppose the military takeover.“We strongly condemn the coup. We love democracy and human rights, so we are worried about losing them in our country,” Maung said.“We are part of Myanmar, so we feel the same as Myanmar’s common people. We urge the international community to raise its voice against the coup,” he said.Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that it hopes the coup will not hamper the repatriation.“As an immediate and friendly neighbor, we would like to see peace and stability in Myanmar. We have been persistent in developing mutually beneficial relations with Myanmar and have been working with Myanmar for the voluntary, safe and sustained repatriation of the Rohingya sheltered in Bangladesh,” it said.The United Nations has described the Myanmar military crackdown on the Rohingya as a form of genocide. In total, more than 1 million refugees are being sheltered by Bangladesh.Monday's coup was a dramatic backslide for Myanmar, which was emerging from decades of strict military rule and international isolation that began in 1962.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rohingya-refugees-fear-returning-to-myanmar-after-coup-101612274592280.html

Until the next government is formed after the upcoming election, we need to steer the country," Min Aung Hlaing was quoted as saying.

02-02-2021||World||Turkish minister LGBT comments about protesters 'hateful conduct', says Twitter||Turkey's interior minister on Tuesday condemned protesters at a top Istanbul university as "LGBT deviants" in a statement which Twitter deemed as hateful conduct.Students and teachers at Istanbul's Bogazici University have held protests for the last month against the appointment of Melih Bulu as rector by President Tayyip Erdogan, which they said was undemocratic.On Monday, scuffles broke out between police and those protesting against the detention of four people after images were shared on social media of them laying a picture on the ground that mixed sacred Islamic imagery with symbols supporting LGBT issues.Police entered campus later in the day to disperse students who were planning an all-night vigil outside the rector's building and detained 159 in total throughout the day, the governor's office said.Istanbul police said 61 people were still detained and were giving statements on Tuesday."Should we tolerate the LGBT deviants who insult the great Kaaba? Of course not. Should we tolerate the LGBT deviants who attempted to occupy the rector's building? Of course not," Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Twitter, repeating a phrase that sparked outrage amongst students and rights groups over the weekend.In a rare move, Twitter placed a warning on Soylu's tweet, saying it violated rules about hateful conduct but added it decided to keep it on the site as it might be in the public interest for it to remain accessible.Turkey's presidency communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said Monday's protests were a response to the university's decision to block an application to set up an LGBTI club - which he said tried to "trample our values underfoot".The government has harshly criticised the protesters, with Erdogan praising his party's youth wing on Monday for "not being the LGBT youth."The main opposition CHP has supported the protests and several parliamentarians from the pro-Kurdish HDP were turned away at the university's entrance on Monday.Erdogan's critics say the president and his AK Party, which promotes conservative Islamic values, have eroded social rights and tolerance during their 18 years in power. Erdogan's supporters say he has restored freedom of religious expression in a once strongly secular republic.Bulu, who applied to be an AKP candidate in a 2015 parliamentary election, was the first rector chosen from outside a university since a military coup in Turkey in 1980, Bogazici faculty members have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-minister-lgbt-comments-about-protesters-hateful-conduct-says-twitter-101612273181373.html

The military alleged that the November elections, in which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) registered a massive win, were marred with irregularities. It declared a state of emergency for a year and pledged to hold fresh elections. The announcement triggered strong reactions from all over the world and US President Joe Biden even threatened to put back the sanctions that were removed by former president Barack Obama.Here’s how the world reacted to Myanmar’s political crisis:United StatesPresident Joe Biden called the coup a “direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy”, urging the armed forces to respect Myanmar’s progress towards the establishment of civilian government and peaceful transfer of power. In a statement released by the White House, Biden called on the international community to press the Tatmadaw to immediately relinquish the power, release all activists and leaders, and lift all telecommunication restrictions.“The United States is taking note of those who stand with the people of Burma in this difficult hour,” the statement read, adding that the US will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack.IndiaThe ministry of external affairs (MEA) gave a short and measured response to the developments unfolding in Myanmar, saying India has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition. “We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. We are monitoring the situation closely,” the ministry said.United KingdomPrime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the military coup and called on the armed forces to respect the vote of people and release civilian leaders. In a separate statement, the UK Foreign Office said that there is a need for peaceful reconvening of the National Assembly and respecting the results of general elections.“The UK calls on the military to respect the rule of law and human rights, and release those unlawfully detained,” the statement read.Read | Myanmar military coup: 24 hours later, whereabouts of Aung San Suu Kyi remains unknownChinaWhile China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a news conference that Beijing has “noted” the developments, the state media reported the coup as "major cabinet reshuffle". Wenbin said that Beijing hopes all parties will properly their differences under the constitutional and legal framework and uphold political stability. "Myanmar military announced a major cabinet reshuffle hours after the country declared the state of emergency on Monday," reported Xinhua.European UnionEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell released a statement condemning the “unacceptable attempt to forcibly overturn” the election results, urging to settle the allegations of voting irregularities within proper legal and administrative channels. The 27-members bloc called upon the armed forces to immediately release all those who have been arrested, end the state of emergency and restore the civilian government. “We stand ready to support dialogue with all key stakeholders who wish to resolve the situation in good faith, and to return to the constitutional order,” the high representative said on the behalf of the EU. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen echoed the statement and reiterated the call for the unconditional release of all those detained.I strongly condemn the coup in Myanmar. The legitimate civilian government must be restored, in line with the country's constitution & the November elections.

02-02-2021||World||Pfizer forecasts $15 billion in Covid-19 vaccine sales for 2021||Pfizer Inc. said it expects about $15 billion in revenue this year from the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with BioNTech SE, a sign of returns to come from the industry’s pandemic response efforts.The vaccine projection primarily includes doses that are expected to be delivered this year under existing contracts, Pfizer said Tuesday as it reported fourth-quarter earnings. The forecast may be adjusted in the future as additional contracts are reached.Pfizer is commanding a higher price for its vaccine than some rivals. Under the terms of its supply deal with the U.S., it is charging $19.50 for each shot of the two-dose regimen. Rival AstraZeneca Plc, which hasn’t yet gained authorization for its vaccine in the U.S., has said it plans to charge less than $4 per dose.Excluding its vaccine sales, the drugmaker said it expects 2021 full-year revenue of $44.4 billion to $46.4 billion. Annual earnings per share will be $3.10 to $3.20. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said earlier this month that earnings would top out at $3.10 a share. The guidance was raised primarily because of its shifting vaccine forecast, according to the company.Shares of the New York-based company were little changed in premarket trading Tuesday. Through the close Monday, the stock lost 2.7% so far this year.Vaccine SalesPfizer’s newly authorized Covid-19 vaccine brought in $154 million in sales in the fourth quarter. The two-dose regimen based on a new technology known as messenger RNA was cleared for emergency use in the U.S., U.K. and European Union in December.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech initially expected to produce 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine, known BNT162b2, this year. They later boosted their output goal by more than 50% to 2 billion doses after a label change allowed doctors to extract six doses instead of five from each vial, and they secured additional manufacturing capacity. The boon to supply will certainly add to the companies’ sales.Pfizer and BioNTech have reached agreements totaling 836 million doses, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker, including 300 million for the EU and 200 million for the U.S. Pfizer remains in discussions with governments around the world about new deals and exercising additional options, Bourla said last week in an interview.The drug giant’s overall fourth-quarter figures were anticipated to be messy as it explains how earnings stack up year-over-year following the fourth-quarter spinoff of its off-patent drug unit, Upjohn, into a combined company with Mylan NV now known as Viatris Inc.Innovation-FocusedThe new, slimmed-down Pfizer brought in $11.7 billion. Its major blockbusters, including the cancer drug Ibrance, the anticoagulant Eliquis, and the Prevnar vaccine franchise drove much of the company’s growth.Pfizer spent more than $9 billion on research and development, including on its pandemic response efforts, in 2020. Bourla cited the company’s “decade-long conversion into a pure-play, science and innovation-focused company,” for the company’s progress.“Our record-breaking success at developing a vaccine against Covid-19, along with our partner BioNTech, is just one example of what we believe this new Pfizer is capable of achieving,” he said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-forecasts-15-billion-in-covid-19-vaccine-sales-for-2021-101612271275961.html
02-02-2021||World||Suu Kyi's party demands her release as Myanmar generals tighten grip||The party of Myanmar's detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi called on Tuesday for her immediate release and for the military junta that seized power a day earlier to recognise her victory in an election in November.The Nobel Peace laureate's whereabouts remained unknown more than 24 hours after her arrest in a military takeover that derailed Myanmar's tentative progress towards full democracy.A senior official from her National League for Democracy (NLD) said on Tuesday he had learned that her health was good and she was not being moved from the location where she was being held after the coup against her government.She was picked up in the capital Naypyidaw on Monday along with dozens of other allies but her exact whereabouts have not been made public."There is no plan to move Daw Aung San Su Kyi and Doctor Myo Aung. It's learned that they are in good health," NLD official Kyi Toe said in a Facebook post which also referred to one of her allies. An earlier post said she was at her home.Kyi Toe also said NLD members of parliament detained during the coup were being allowed to leave the quarters where they had been held. Reuters was unable to contact him for more information.The U.N. Security Council was due to meet later on Tuesday amid calls for a strong global response to the military's latest seizure of power in a country blighted for decades by army rule.The United States threatened to reimpose sanctions on the generals who seized power.The coup followed a landslide win for Suu Kyi's NLD in an election on Nov. 8, a result the military has refused to accept citing unsubstantiated allegations of fraud.The army handed power to its commander, General Min Aung Hlaing, and imposed a state of emergency for a year, crushing hopes that the country was on the path to stable democracy.The NLD's executive committee demanded the release of all detainees "as soon as possible".In a post on the Facebook page of senior party official May Win Myint, the committee also called for the military to acknowledge the election results and for the new parliament to be allowed to sit. It had been due to meet on Monday for the first time since the election.Various activist groups on Tuesday issued a flurry of messages on social media urging civil disobedience.Suu Kyi, 75, endured about 15 years of house arrest between 1989 and 2010 as she led a democracy movement against the military, which had seized power in a 1962 coup and stamped out all dissent for decades until her party came to power in 2015.Her international standing as a human rights icon was badly damaged after she failed to stop the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims in 2017 and defended the military against accusations of genocide. But she remains hugely popular at home and is revered as the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, Aung San.INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATIONU.S. President Joe Biden called the crisis a direct assault on Myanmar's transition to democracy."We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burma's democratic transition," Biden said in a statement.The United Nations led condemnation of the coup and calls for the release of detainees, in comments echoed by Australia, the European Union, India and Japan as well as former colonial ruler Britain.China did not join the condemnation, saying only that it noted the events and called on all sides to respect the constitution.The streets of Myanmar were quiet, as they have been for weeks because of the coronavirus. Troops and riot police took up positions in Naypyitaw and the main commercial centre Yangon.By Tuesday morning, phone and internet connections were restored and banks in Yangon reopened after halting services on Monday due to poor internet connections and amid a rush to withdraw cash.But Myanmar's international airport in Yangon will stay closed until April or even May, its manager, Phone Myint, told Reuters. He did not say why."IMMEDIATE RESPONSE"One of the first calls for specific action to oppose the coup came from the Yangon Youth Network, one of Myanmar's biggest activist groups.Doctors at a hospital in the city of Mandalay had also begun a similar campaign.Any street protests will raise alarm in a country with a grim record of military crackdowns.China's state Xinhua news agency quoted a military official as saying most regional and state leaders who were detained during the takeover were released on Tuesday.The chief minister of the Sagaing region, Myint Naing, told the BBC after his release that he had been kept in a dormitory and treated well."I worry for the future of the nation. We hoped for the best but the worst is happening," he said.The latest coup marks the second time the military has refused to recognise a landslide election win for the NLD, having also rejected the result of 1990 polls that were meant to pave the way for multi-party government.Following mass protests led by Buddhist monks in 2007, the generals set a course for compromise, while never relinquishing ultimate control.The NLD came to power after a 2015 election under a constitution that guarantees the military a major role in government, including several main ministries, and an effective veto on constitutional reform.Consolidating its position, the new junta removed 24 ministers and named 11 replacements for various portfolios including finance, defence, foreign affairs and interior.Military chief Min Aung Hlaing has promised a free and fair election and a handover of power to the winner but without giving a timeframe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suu-kyi-s-party-demands-her-release-as-myanmar-generals-tighten-grip-101612269478997.html
02-02-2021||World||Russia's Sputnik V vaccine 91.6% effective in late-stage trial, affirming early data||Russia's Sputnik V vaccine was 91.6% effective in preventing people from developing Covid-19, according to peer-reviewed results from its late-stage clinical trial published in The Lancent international medical journal on Tuesday.Scientists said the Phase III trial results meant the world had another effective weapon to fight the deadly pandemic and justified to some extent Moscow's decision to roll out the vaccine before final data had been released.The results, collated by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow that developed and tested the vaccine, were in line with efficacy data reported at earlier stages of the trial, which has been running in Moscow since September."The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency," Professor Ian Jones of the University of Reading and Professor Polly Roy, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said in a comment shared by The Lancet."But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated," said the scientists, who were not involved in the study. "Another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19."The results were based on data from 19,866 volunteers, of whom a quarter received a placebo, the researchers, led by the Gamaleya Institute's Denis Logunov, said in The Lancet.Since the trial in Moscow began, there were 16 recorded cases of symptomatic Covid-19 among people who received the vaccine, and 62 among the placebo group, the scientists said.This showed that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine - two shots based on two different adenovirus vectors, administered 21 days apart - was 91.6% effective against symptomatic Covid-19.Russia approved the vaccine in August, before the large-scale trial had begun, saying it was the first country to do so for a Covid-19 shot. It named it Sputnik V, in homage to the world's first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union.Small numbers of frontline health workers began receiving it soon after and a large-scale roll out started in December, though access was limited to those in specific professions, such as teachers, medical workers and journalists.In January, the vaccine was offered to all Russians."Russia was right all along," Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is responsible for marketing the vaccine abroad, told reporters ahead of the publication of the results on Tuesday.He said they supported Russia's decision to begin administering Sputnik V to frontline workers while the trial was still underway, and suggested scepticism of such moves was politically motivated."The Lancet did very unbiased work despite some of the political pressures that may have been out there," he said.The number of people vaccinated in Russia has remained low so far. Authorities have pointed to some early issues with scaling up production, while polls have shown low demand among Russians for the vaccine.Russia has already shared data from its Phase III trial with regulators in several countries and has begun the process of submitting it to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for approval in the European Union, Dmitriev said.The data release comes as Europe scrambles to secure enough shots for its 450 million citizens due to production cuts by AstraZeneca and Pfizer while the U.S. roll-out has been hampered by the need to store shots in ultra-cold freezers and uneven planning across states.There were 2,144 volunteers over 60 in the trial and the shot was shown to be 91.8% effective when tested on this older group, with no serious side-effects reported that could be associated with Sputnik V, The Lancet summary said.The vaccine was also found to be 100% effective against moderate or severe Covid-19, as there were no such cases among the group of 78 participants who were infected and symptomatic at 21 days after the first shot was administered.Four deaths of participants occurred, but none was considered associated with vaccination, The Lancet said."The efficacy looks good, including in the over 60s," said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. "It's good to have another addition to the global arsenal."The authors of the study noted that because Covid-19 cases were only detected when participants reported symptoms, further research is needed to understand Sputnik V's efficacy on asymptomatic cases and transmission.Sputnik V has been approved by 15 countries, including Argentina, Hungary, and the United Arab Emirates and this will to 25 by the end of next week, the RDIF's Dmitriev said.The sovereign wealth fund also said vaccinations using Sputnik V will begin in a dozen countries, including Hungary, Bolivia, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Iran.However, large shipments of the shot have only been sent so far to Argentina, which has received enough doses to vaccinate about 500,000 people, and Bolivia, which received 20,000 shots.Production for export will primarily be conducted by RDIF's manufacturing partners abroad, the fund has said.On Tuesday, Dmitriev said that production had begun in India and South Korea, and would launch in China this month. Trial doses have also been produced by a manufacturer in Brazil.Russia is also conducting a small-scale clinical trial of a one-dose version of the vaccine, which developers expect to have an efficacy rate of 73% to 85%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-sputnik-v-vaccine-91-6-effective-in-late-stage-trial-affirming-early-101612270219778.html
02-02-2021||World||WHO team visits animal disease center in Wuhan, China||A World Health Organization (WHO) team of international experts visited an animal disease center in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Tuesday as part of their investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.Team member Peter Daszak, a zoologist with the EcoHealth Alliance, said “excellent facilities, very informative meeting” from an open window as the group left the center in minivans.He also tweeted that they had met with staff in charge of livestock health in Hubei province, toured laboratories and had an in-depth discussion along with questions and answers. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei.Further details of the visit were not announced in what has been a tightly controlled trip, with the media only able to glimpse the team coming and going from its hotel and site visits.The team members wore full protective gear during Tuesday's visit.It’s not clear if they wore similar full-body suits at the research institutes, hospitals and markets they visited on previous days. Outside their hotel and en route to and from visits, the experts have worn masks and professional or business casual attire.Intense negotiations preceded the WHO visit to Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 cases were detected in late 2019. China has maintained strict controls on access to information about the virus, possibly to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the Chinese government had provided significant support and assistance to the WHO team, responding to criticism that China has not revealed much about what the researchers are being allowed to do.“The Chinese experts have shared a lot of information and research results with the WHO team, and they had several rounds of in-depth exchanges on scientific issues of common concern,” he said.On Monday, WHO officials in Geneva pushed back against suggestions China is being less than forthcoming about how the pandemic started.Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO emergencies chief, dismissed critics who said any report from the mission would be incomplete. The team “deserves the support of the international community,” he said.The data the team assembles will add to what is expected to be a years-long quest for answers involving taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.China has largely stopped domestic transmission of the virus through sometimes draconian measures, including strict testing and electronic surveillance. Mask wearing in public is standard and lockdowns are routinely imposed on communities and even entire cities where cases are detected.Schools have gone online and travel has been drastically cut during this month’s Lunar New Year holiday, with the government offering incentives for people to stay put in the cities rather than return to their home towns for family gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-visits-animal-disease-center-in-wuhan-china-101612269319830.html
02-02-2021||World||France says Europe’s vaccine strategy is safer than UK’s||France is taking the lead in defending Europe’s faltering vaccine program and it’s taking a jab at the UK in the process.“The Brits are in an extremely difficult health situation,” France’s junior minister for European Union affairs, Clement Beaune, said on France Inter radio on Tuesday. “Understandably, they are taking many risks in this vaccination campaign.”Beaune cited the UK’s decision to focus on the first vaccine jabs and its reliance on AstraZeneca Plc despite doubts over its efficiency on older people. “I don’t think citizens would accept us taking risks that contradict scientific recommendations,” he said.With nations all over the world counting on Covid-19 vaccines to return to normal life as swiftly as possible, delivery delays in Europe announced by vaccine-makers Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca sent chills through the bloc -- which is trailing the UK when it comes to vaccination -- and gave ammunition to anti-EU politicians like Marine Le Pen in France.Beaune defended the EU’s decision to purchase the doses in common, an approach that avoided a race between member states and put the bloc’s less affluent countries on an equal foot with its richest countries such as Germany or France.Had countries purchased vaccines on their own, “each government -- imagine Germany, France, Italy -- would be calling labs to have doses delivered to get in ahead of their neighbors,” Beaune said. Buying the vaccine in common also allowed the EU to obtain better prices.In France, a country of 67 million inhabitants, about 1.5 million people have received the jab. It plans to give the first dose to 2.4 million more patients by end February, compared to an initial target of 4 million. Government officials have defended their strategy by insisting on the need to focus on most vulnerable people first, and on obtaining their consent as well as following scientific guidelines on doses.France’s Health Agency is set to give its green light to AstraZeneca’s vaccine later Tuesday, but it’s unclear if it will be recommended for people over 65.With some hospitals starting to transfer patients to relieve pressure on intensive-care units and more contagious forms of the virus on the rise, the French government is closely monitoring indicators and remains ready to move quickly if a third lockdown is needed.For now, President Emmanuel Macron is holding off calls for a full lockdown, as he seeks to navigate pressure from doctors to contain the new coronavirus variants and the need to protect the economy, while avoiding the risk of civil disobedience amid mounting fatigue. Instead, he strengthened curfew controls, imposed extra border checks and announced the closure of malls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-europe-s-vaccine-strategy-is-safer-than-uks-101612266952941.html
02-02-2021||World||Offline message app Bridgefy downloaded 600,000 times after Myanmar coup||Offline messaging app Bridgefy said it was downloaded more than 600,000 times in a few hours in Myanmar, after the country's military seized power on Monday and temporarily disrupted internet traffic.The Mexico-based startup, which gained popularity during Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in 2020, tweeted that it hoped people in Myanmar would find its app "useful during tough times."After the country's democratically elected leaders were arrested, phone and internet connections were disrupted in the main city Yangon and the capital Naypyitaw and some other parts of the country.Communications had been restored by late Monday but, in social media posts seen by Reuters, activists in Myanmar encouraged the download of Bridgefy as a solution to possible further shutdowns.Bridgefy, whose backers include Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and which has also been used at anti-government rallies in Thailand, is one of several apps based on Bluetooth that use mesh networks to allow users to communicate without internet connections.They have gained popularity globally, especially in countries which have a history of imposing restrictions on social media platforms and internet providers - though security experts say they can be penetrated, exposing users to surveillance risks.A similar app, Firechat, has been used in protests in Iran and Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/offline-message-app-bridgefy-downloaded-600-000-times-after-myanmar-coup-101612265160506.html
02-02-2021||World||Wikipedia launches new global rules to combat site abuses||The foundation that operates Wikipedia will launch its first global code of conduct on Tuesday, seeking to address criticism that it has failed to combat harassment and suffers from a lack of diversity."We need to be much more inclusive," said María Sefidari, the chair of board of trustees for the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. "We are missing a lot of voices, we're missing women, we're missing marginalized groups."Online platforms have come under intense scrutiny for abusive behavior, violent rhetoric and other forms of problematic content, pushing them to revamp content rules and more strictly enforce them.Unlike Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc which take more top-down approaches to content moderation, the online encyclopedia, which turned 20 years old last month, largely relies on unpaid volunteers to handle issues around users' behavior.Wikimedia said more than 1,500 Wikipedia volunteers from five continents and 30 languages participated in the creation of the new rules after the board of trustees voted in May last year to develop new binding standards."There's been a process of change throughout the communities," Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, said in an interview with Reuters. "It took time to build the support that was necessary to do the consultations for people to understand why this is a priority."The new code of conduct bans harassment on and off the site, barring behaviors like hate speech, the use of slurs, stereotypes or attacks based on personal characteristics, as well as threats of physical violence and 'hounding,' or following someone across different articles to critique their work.It also bans deliberately introducing false or biased information into content. Wikipedia is a relatively trusted site compared to major social media platforms which have struggled to curb misinformation.Maher said some users' concerns that the new rules meant the site was becoming more centralized were unfounded.Wikipedia has 230,000 volunteer editors who work on crowdsourced articles and more than 3,500 'administrators' who can take actions like blocking accounts or restricting edits on certain pages.

02-02-2021||World||Joe Biden expands quick bid to undo Trump’s immigration policies||The Biden administration on Tuesday announced steps to address harm to thousands of families that were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border, expanding efforts to quickly undo relentless changes to immigration policy over the last four years.President Joe Biden planned to sign orders on family separation, border security and legal immigration, bringing to nine the number of executive actions on immigration during his first two weeks in office. Details were thin, but the moves aim to reverse many of former President Donald Trump's policies to deter immigration, both legal and illegal.Alejandro Mayorkas, whose nomination as Homeland Security secretary awaits Senate confirmation, will lead a task force on family separation, focused largely on reuniting parents and children who remain apart. It is unclear how many, but about 5,500 children have been identified in court documents as having been separated during Trump's presidency, including about 600 whose parents have yet to be found by a court-appointed committee.The review of border security includes a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexican border cities for hearings in U.S. immigration court. It is a step toward fulfilling a campaign pledge to end the Remain in Mexico policy, known officially as Migrant Protection Protocols, which enrolled nearly 70,000 asylum-seekers since it began in January 2019.The White House said it will “create a humane asylum system” by rescinding or reconsidering Trump policies that caused “chaos, cruelty and confusion.” It warned that it will take time, which may cause grumbling among some pro-immigration advocates.“The situation at the border will not transform overnight, due in large part to the damage done over the last four years.” the White House said in a statement. “But the President is committed to an approach that keeps our country safe, strong, and prosperous and that also aligns with our values.”Roberta Jacobson, a top Biden aide on border issues, asked Spanish-language media on Friday to discourage audiences from coming to the U.S. border. “It is not the moment," she said in Spanish, adding that the journey was “very dangerous, and we are in the middle of creating a new system.”The White House will also do a “top-to-bottom review of recent regulations, policies, and guidance that have set up barriers to our legal immigration system.” It will include a review of Trump's “public charge rule,” which makes it more difficult for people who use government benefits to obtain green cards.The moves demonstrate that, just as Trump remade immigration policies from the White House, Biden can undo them with the stroke of a pen — some more easily than others. On his first day in office, Biden halted work on a border wall with Mexico, lifted a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries and reversed plans to exclude people in the country illegally from the 2020 census. He also ordered efforts to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which has shielded hundreds of thousands of people who came to the U.S. as children from deportation.More lasting changes must pass Congress, a daunting job that Trump and his predecessors Barack Obama and George W. Bush failed to achieve. Also on his first day in office, Biden proposed legislation to give legal status and a path to citizenship to everyone in the country who doesn't have it — an estimated 11 million people.Biden promised far-reaching changes on immigration during his campaign, but it was unclear how quickly he would tackle the lightning-rod issue. His first-day actions delighted and surprised many pro-immigration advocates who are now being asked for patience.It is unclear when Biden will lift bans on many temporary work visas and green cards that took effect after the coronavirus pandemic struck or when he will stop allowing authorities to immediately expel people at the border on public health grounds without an opportunity to seek asylum.Esther Olavarria, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council for immigration, said at a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting last month that an executive order aimed at “restoring sanity at the U.S.-Mexico border” would end the Remain in Mexico policy and agreements that the Trump administration struck with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for the U.S. to reject asylum applicants and instead send them to those Central American countries with an opportunity to seek protection there.Olivarria told the mayors to expect an order that restores the U.S. refugee resettlement program after dramatic cuts under Trump but that measure was not included in Tuesday's announcements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-expands-quick-bid-to-undo-trump-s-immigration-policies-101612261966239.html

02-02-2021||World||Joe Biden tries to show US as democracy beacon post-Capitol riot||Less than two weeks in office, President Joe Biden is facing two critical tests of whether the deadly riot at the US Capitol has damaged America’s standing as a beacon for democracy.Protests in Russia and a military coup in Myanmar come as American credibility on the world stage has plummeted after last month’s storming of the Capitol by a pro-Donald Trump mob looking to stop the certification of Biden’s election victory.That adds to the weight on Biden as he seeks to fulfil a campaign pledge to dramatically reposition the US as a global leader following four years of a Trump foreign policy driven by an “America First” mantra. That policy was marked by the frequent disparagement of democratic allies and the occasional embrace of authoritarian leaders.Biden’s top diplomat, Antony Blinken, acknowledged the difficulty.“I think there’s no doubt that the attack on our own democracy on Jan. 6 creates an even greater challenge for us to be carrying the banner of democracy and freedom and human rights around the world because, for sure, people in other countries are saying to us, ‘Well, why don’t you look at yourselves first?’” the secretary of state said in an interview with NBC News.Blinken added, “The difference, though, between us and so many other countries is that when we are challenged, including when we challenge ourselves — we’re doing it in full daylight with full transparency.”Biden, in the early days of his presidency, has sought to send the message in a series of calls with foreign leaders that America is back.He’s reassured Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga that the US has its support in an ongoing territorial dispute with China over islets in the East China Sea. He's sought to reset the relationship with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was belittled by Trump as “dishonest & weak." And he's told Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that the US would send $4 billion to help development in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — nations whose hardships have spawned tides of migration through Mexico toward the United States.“The United States remains a country in the world that is looked to for leadership,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. “It’s going to take some time, but he’s certainly committed to doing that.”But the crises in Myanmar and Russia present Biden with difficult tests of his promise to reestablish global leadership that are likely to be far more complicated than mending fences with traditional allies.Biden on Monday threatened to slap new sanctions on Myanmar after a coup that saw the military arrest the civilian leaders of its government, calling the episode “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law.”In his first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin as counterparts last week, Biden raised concerns about the detention of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the crackdown on supporters backing his arrest. The mass arrests have only accelerated in the days since the two leaders spoke as protests have continued across the country.“For Putin, he looks at the Capitol riot and sees it as more evidence of his worldview, a continuation of the degradation of liberalism in the world," said Michael McFaul, who served as US ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. “The Biden election doesn't mean much to him about his theory about liberal democracy. Whereas Putin's opponents are very encouraged by the election of President Biden because it shows that American democratic institutions were resilient.”To that end, Navalny's supporters wrote to Biden over the weekend urging him to take meaningful action with sanctions against members of Putin's inner circle to demonstrate that he's serious about reclaiming the US role as a champion of democracy.“Their argument is, If you just sanction a bunch of no-name, low-level colonels ... that’s exactly who Putin is expecting," McFaul said. “They want the Biden administration to sanction the economic actors in the Putin regime, and they’ve made it easy for the Biden administration in they’ve named them all in their seven-page letter."Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chair of the House Intelligence Committee, drew a line from Trump to the coup in Myanmar. Trump had made baseless accusations of widespread voter fraud that were rejected by multiple courts as well as Trump's own Justice Department.An announcement read on Myanmar's military-owned Myawaddy TV explained that the seizure was necessary because the government had not acted on the military’s unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the Southeast Asian nation’s recent elections and because it allowed the election to go ahead despite the coronavirus pandemic.“When America speaks and acts, the world watches, and when our leaders propagate conspiracy theories and subvert democracy here at home, it sets a dangerous example for the rest of the world,” Schiff said.Adversaries such as China, Iran and Venezuela pointed to the Capitol riot as evidence of the fragility of US democracy. Even some allies said the scene was unsettling and has caused them to reconsider the United States' position as the self-proclaimed beacon of democracy.“After something like this, I believe it would be very difficult for the world to see the United States as a symbol of democracy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinskiy said in an interview with “Axios on HBO.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-tries-to-show-us-as-democracy-beacon-post-capitol-riot-101612260315874.html

The winter wave has meant new restrictions on travel, business and activity, but companies in some sectors such as manufacturing have been better able to adjust than services businesses such as hotels and restaurants.The German economy, Europe's biggest, grew by a scant 0.1% while France saw a smaller than expected drop of 1.3%. Overall, economists had expected a drop in the eurozone of as much as 2.5% as recently as mid-January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-impact-european-economy-contracts-less-than-forecast-in-fourth-quarter-101612260623315.html
02-02-2021||World||Data points to Covid-19 vaccine shortfall for Black Americans||A study out Monday suggested Black Americans had not gotten the coronavirus vaccine at a rate proportionate to their population in the nation.Between December 14 and January 14, nearly 13 million people received at least one injection of the two vaccines authorized in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the country's main federal public health agency.The ethnicity of about half of those patients -- about 6.7 million people -- is known. Of them, only 5.4 percent identified as Black, compared to 60.4 percent who identified as white, 11.5 percent as Hispanic and six percent as Asian.However, the CDC also noted that about 14 percent of those vaccinated self-identified as "multiple" or "other" ethnicities, limiting the possibility of drawing definitive conclusions."More complete reporting of race and ethnicity data at the provider and jurisdictional levels is critical to ensure rapid detection of and response to potential disparities in Covid-19 vaccination," the CDC said.The data was released amid growing concern in the United States about disparities in access to vaccines.In certain regions, vaccination centers are located in predominantly white neighborhoods. The same imbalance can be seen in access to an internet connection needed to make a vaccination appointment.Meanwhile, African-Americans are 2.9 times more likely to be hospitalized due to Covid-19 and 2.1 times more likely to die of the disease, Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to coordinate an equitable response to the coronavirus crisis, said Monday.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the executive branch was paying particular attention to this issue, including "supporting additional venues for vaccinations, targeted (at) reaching those at the highest risk" and calling on states to develop plans for equitable vaccine distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/data-points-to-covid-19-vaccine-shortfall-for-black-americans-101612258716554.html

Canadian diplomat's T-shirt logo angers China||Canada said it regretted a "misunderstanding" after China lodged a formal complaint over a diplomat's order of a custom T-shirt displaying the word Wuhan, the city where the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged, over the emblem of hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan.The logo of the American group is a stylized "W". Reports of the T-shirt order circulating on China's Twitter-like Weibo described it as depicting a bat, without mentioning Wu-Tang Clan. Many scientists suspect bats to have been a reservoir for COVID-19 before it jumped to humans.It was not immediately clear how images of the T-shirt logo, which the Canadian embassy said was created early last year, came to circulate on Chinese social media."We are very shocked by this and have lodged representations with Canada, asking for a thorough investigation and a clear explanation," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in response to a question at a daily briefing on Monday, adding that the virus should not be linked to specific countries or regions.Beijing has been highly sensitive about the source of the virus, and has sought to cast doubt on the notion that it originated in China."The T-shirt logo designed by a member of the Embassy shows a stylized W, and is not intended to represent a bat. It was created for the team of Embassy staff working on repatriation of Canadians from Wuhan in early 2020," a spokesperson for Canada's foreign service told Reuters by email early on Tuesday. "We regret the misunderstanding."Relations between Beijing and Ottawa have been strained since late 2018, when China arrested two Canadian men and accused them of spying, shortly after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.A team led by the World Health Organization is in Wuhan investigating the outbreak's origins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-or-wu-tang-canadian-diplomat-s-t-shirt-logo-angers-china-101612258825969.html
02-02-2021||World||Pakistan SC orders Omar Saeed Sheikh to be moved to govt rest house||Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Tuesday directed authorities to move Omar Saeed Sheikh, one of three terrorists released by India in 1999 in exchange for a hijacked airliner, from his death row cell to a government rest house within two days.A three-judge bench headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial issued the directive when it resumed hearing the Sindh provincial government’s review petition opposing the court’s earlier order of January 28 to release Sheikh and three other men convicted of the abduction and murder of journalist Daniel Pearl.The Supreme Court said proper security arrangements should be put in place at the rest house and Sheikh should not be granted access to mobile phones, the internet or the outside world. It also said Sheikh’s family should be allowed to visit him at the rest house from 8am to 5pm and that he should be permitted to spend Kashmir Day with relatives, according to reports in the Pakistani media.Also Read: Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese stranded as Hong Kong rejects BN (O) passportsPakistan observes Kashmir Day on February 5 every year as a show of support for separatists in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.The Supreme Court’s order to free Sheikh has been criticised by India and the US. The external affairs ministry’s spokesperson described it as a “travesty of justice” and said it reflected the “lack of any seriousness on the part of Pakistan on taking action on terror-related issues”.The matter was the focus of US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s introductory phone call to Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on January 29. Blinken discussed how to “ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh” and the US also called on Pakistan to hand over Sheikh so that he could be prosecuted in America.Pakistan’s Supreme Court is currently hearing the Sindh government’s appeal against its recent order upholding the Sindh high court’s order of December 24 to free Sheikh and the three other convicts. Sheikh is being held in a prison in Sindh province.The Supreme Court again rejected the appeal to suspend the Sindh high court’s order acquitting Sheikh, after Sindh’s advocate general told the bench that Sheikh could escape after his release. The advocate general also said Sheikh was a “mastermind of terrorists” and his accomplices could attack the rest house and help him flee.Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, a member of the bench, asked whether the court should justify what he described as illegal detention. “Is it necessary to keep the accused in jail to prevent them from escaping?” asked Justice Umar Ata Bandial, according to a report by Dawn newspaper.The Supreme Court subsequently adjourned the case indefinitely.Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was a key suspect in the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl. Pearl, 38, was South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was abducted in Karachi in January 2002 while researching links between Pakitani militants and Richard C Reid, known as the “shoe bomber” for trying to detonate a bomb on a flight from Paris to Miami in 2001.It is believed Sheikh played a key role in luring Pearl to Karachi, where he was killed by his captors.Sheikh was arrested in India in 1994 and imprisoned over the kidnapping of one American and three British tourists. He was freed with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814, which was hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-supreme-court-orders-omar-saeed-sheikh-to-be-moved-to-govt-rest-house-101612259313452.html

02-02-2021||World||12 burning questions about Myanmar military coup. Answered||The military’s coup against Aung San Suu Kyi’s government has knee-capped Myanmar’s democratic transition and undercut its push to attract more foreign investment, particularly from the West. What’s the army’s endgame and how will governments such as the US, Britain and China respond?Bloomberg hosted a Q&A live chat on LINE messenger, where readers got their questions answered. Below is an abridged transcript.What’s happening in Myanmar? Myanmar’s de facto leader, Suu Kyi, and other top political leaders including President Win Myint were detained in a raid on Monday, in an apparent coup. The nation’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized control of the country.Is this a temporary takeover or a permanent military government?The military has said that it is using a state of emergency to take control for one year, promising that it will hold elections afterwards. It is unclear, however, if the pledge is genuine or a ploy to buy time.What was the response from the US?President Joe Biden has said the US could reinstate sanctions on Myanmar if the Southeast Asian country’s military doesn’t “immediately relinquish the power they have seized” in a coup and release activists and officials. What is the military trying to achieve here?While the military had previously committed to transition Myanmar to a democracy, it had never truly relinquished power, retaining authority in the parliament with veto rights and a guaranteed number of seats. Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party in the latter months of their first term moved to give more authority to the civilian government, and the military simply were not buying. By following through on a coup, the military is sending a clear signal that it has no plans to be marginalized in a government it has controlled for decades.Read | Suu Kyi's timeline: Myanmar's most famous political figure detained againWhat are the implications of the coup to the Rohingya?It’s not good news. The thrust of the pushback on the atrocities in Rakhine state came from strong international pressure, which is now squarely focused on the coup. It is unclear what might occur now that the military, which is alleged to have been responsible for genocide there, may do next. It is further worth noting that mobile and internet communications in Rakhine state have been heavily restricted amid accusations from rights groups that the atrocities are ongoing. The military and Suu Kyi’s former government have denied wrongdoing.Where is Suu Kyi and is she safe?According to an official from the National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi and now-former President Win Myint are understood to be under lock and key in their respective homes. Both leaders were detained by the military on Monday.What effects, if any, might Myanmar’s coup have on neighboring countries, such as Thailand?That is unclear. Southeast Asian nations all seem to have a trajectory of their own while many countries like Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia were on a path of democratic backsliding well before Myanmar’s troubles arose. There's no indication that will change or be exacerbated by the coup.How will this coup impact global markets and the global economy?While not a fully globalized nation, the political crisis in Myanmar does threaten to impact a number of companies around the world, ranging from rare-earth miners in China to global oil and gas majors. China’s rare-earth miners dropped on Monday following the coup while some businesses belonging to Yoma Strategic Holdings, a Singapore-based company that invests in a number of Myanmar industries including real estate and food and beverage, had been disrupted due to telecommunications outages. Under the military government, it will be very difficult for investors to know, in the short term, whether they plan to revert to protectionist policies that had worked so well for the elite, even while promising to maintain some form of democracy.What’s China’s role in all of this?China plays an increasingly important role in Myanmar. Chinese President Xi Jinping has a vested interest in dozens of infrastructure projects key to his regional Belt and Road ambitions. During the Rohingya crisis, China was one of the few countries that stood behind the government, and has provided the nation with free Covid vaccines. If it were to support the military government now, it could in fact help to get several stalled projects off the ground.What does this coup mean for Myanmar’s democracy? Will there be elections again?Myanmar’s democracy is still in its infancy. There are varying opinions on whether this is the end of democracy in the country, but that remains to be seen as the military will have to choose what to do with an NLD party that has the overwhelming support of voters. The military has promised to hold fresh polls after a one-year state of emergency.How effective would sanctions be on Myanmar if governments or the UN decide to impose them?It depends on the definition of effective. Global sanctions would devastate the economy and could impact the livelihoods of millions of people. But would they do harm to the military elite or dissuade them from pursuing this course of action? The former is unlikely because the military is well-documented to have vast riches across diverse segments of the local economy — from raising billions mining precious stones to millions more from brewing beer.Other than sanctions, how else can governments pressure Myanmar?Aside from sanctions, it will be tough to pressure the military. For example, during the Rohingya crisis, the West collectively condemned the actions of the military while US sanctions had no impact. The international response proved slow and largely ineffective. It was also left with fewer cards after the private sector largely withdrew investment interest. Western soft power has also taken a hit. Under former President Donald Trump, the US lost a lot of leverage for its blasé attitude on rights and democratic backsliding. That’s going to require some degree of rehabilitation before once again becoming an effective diplomatic tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-burning-questions-about-myanmar-military-coup-answered-101612256361338.html

Sheikh is accused of kidnapping and murdering American journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002 and was acquitted by the court last year.Under house arrest, Sheikh will be allowed to meet his family from 8 am to 5 pm. He will be kept under strict surveillance. His access to phones and internet will also be restricted.Pakistan Supreme Court announced the decision while it was hearing an appeal filed by Sindh provincial government against the court's earlier order to release him.

Demonstrators affiliated to All Nepal National Free Student Union (ANNFSU) of ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) had scuffled with police as they attempted to organise a flash mob in front of Parliament in Kathmandu.Prior to this, three former Nepali Prime Ministers, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal on Sunday participated in a sit-in-protest at Maitighar of Kathmandu against the dissolution of Parliament.Amongst the trios former Prime Ministers, Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal serve as Chairman of NCP which practically has split after now caretaker PM Oli dissolved the Parliament on December 20 last year.Also Read | Nepal's top court serves contempt notices to beleaguered PM OliNepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the Lower House on Oli's recommendation on December 20. After dissolving the Parliament, the PM also proposed elections on April 30 and May 10, 2021."We will continue our protests and demonstrations till the time, the House of Representatives is reinstated. We will continue this fight till eternity- we will organise sit-in-protests, mass rallies, mass meetings, public meetings, this is an expression of public opinion, their votes and it would continue," Jhalanath Khanal, former Nepali PM had told ANI.Trio former Prime Ministers of Nepal sat on side of the road accompanied by supporters and members of different provincial and upper house assembly protested for an hour against the "unconstitutional" move by Oli.Following the announcement of its third phase of agitation against the dissolution of parliament by the party on January 25, the party has been staging a series of protests and demonstrations across the country.The rival faction of the ruling NCP removed PM Oli from the party, amid increasing political unrest following his decision to dissolve the lower house of the Parliament.According to the rival faction's spokesperson Narayankaji Shrestha, PM Oli no longer remains a member of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-calls-constitutional-council-meeting-amid-ongoing-political-crisis-101612246535996.html
02-02-2021||World||Russia court to weigh jailing Navalny as Putin battles dissent||A Moscow district court is due to decide whether to jail Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny for as long as 3 1/2 years Tuesday, as President Vladimir Putin seeks to crush a resurgence in protests against his rule.The court is to rule on demands by penal authorities and prosecutors that Navalny, 44, serve time instead of the suspended sentence he received for a 2014 fraud conviction, for alleged violations of his probation. Navalny’s supporters have vowed to gather outside the court during the hearing.Navalny was detained in mid-January as he returned from Germany, where he recovered from a near-fatal nerve-agent attack that he and Western governments blamed on Putin’s security service. The Kremlin denies responsibility. A prison term risks escalating the confrontation between the authorities and opposition protesters that has already resulted in thousands of detentions at rallies in dozens of cities nationwide in the last two weekends.The US and the European Union have called on Russia to release Navalny. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his detention “profoundly disturbing” in an interview Sunday with MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.” The EU’s top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, has said he’ll raise the case when he visits Moscow for talks this week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.Riot police were accused of using electric shock devices against some people at the latest protests on Sunday amid allegations of a particularly harsh response. There were 5,646 detentions, adding to nearly 3,600 at Jan. 23 protests, according to the OVD-Info monitoring group.Navalny received the suspended sentence in a fraud trial involving the Russian branch of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher that also led to a 3 1/2 year jail term for his younger brother, Oleg. Both men denied wrongdoing, and the European Court of Human Rights has called the case politically motivated.As well as the threat of a jail term , Navalny also faces possible new fraud charges that could carry an additional 10-year punishment.Putin, 68, has been in power since 2000, the longest rule since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. In July, he pushed through constitutional changes that would allow him to stay as president until 2036. Last year his support fell to a record low amid the Covid-19 downturn, and the continuing slide in incomes is weighing on the Russian leader’s popularity, pollsters say.Gross domestic product contracted 3.1% last year, the biggest slump since 2009, the Federal Statistics Service reported Monday. Still, Russia suffered a smaller decline than most major economies after the government opted not to reimpose a lockdown in the second half of the year.Navalny raised the focus on officials’ opulent lifestyles in a video released after his arrest that got more than 100 million views and alleged that Putin owns a giant $1.3 billion Black Sea palace. Putin dismissed the claim and a billionaire ally, Arkady Rotenberg, said last week that he is the beneficial owner of the residence.While Putin has survived several past outbursts of anti-Kremlin protests, the opposition is digging in for a long-term struggle ahead of 2024, when he must decide whether to seek a fifth presidential term. Backers of Navalny say he’ll become a potent symbol of resistance behind bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-court-to-weigh-jailing-navalny-as-putin-battles-dissent-101612246544892.html

The readout said that he “looked forward to strengthening the bilateral trading relationship and Canada-US supply chains, and avoiding the unintended consequences.” Cooperation between the two North American neighbours in combating the Covid-19 pandemic was also discussed. Climate change also figured on the agenda as did “North American energy security”, shorthand for Trudeau pushing the Biden administration to reverse its decision to cancel permission granted earlier to the contentious Keystone XL Pipeline project.Trudeau has already spoken to Biden twice since he was elected, and the two leaders are expected to meet in person this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-help-free-canadians-held-in-china-harris-assures-trudeau-101612246712742.html
02-02-2021||World||Impeachment case 'undemocratic', ill-advised, says Donald Trump's lawyer||Democrats are using the upcoming Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump as a political “weapon” to bar the former president from seeking office again and are pursuing a case that is “undemocratic” and unconstitutional, one of his lawyers said Monday night.Trump faces trial next week on accusations that he incited a harrowing and deadly siege at the US Capitol on January 6, when a mob of loyalists in town for a rally supporting the president overran the police and stormed the building. The House passed a single article of impeachment against Trump one week before he left office, A trial would allow Democrats to present evidence against Trump and hold him publicly accountable for the attack.However, whether a Senate trial is constitutional is a point of contention because Trump is no longer in office and, if convicted, cannot be removed from an office he doesn't occupy. Democrats point to an 1876 impeachment of a secretary of war who had already resigned and to opinions by many legal scholars. The Senate could vote to bar Trump from holding federal office if he were convicted, which is a goal Democrats support.On the eve of expected legal briefs from lawyers for both sides, Trump attorney David Schoen's appearance on Fox News forecast some of the arguments he plans to make at the trial, calling the case needlessly divisive as well as unconstitutional and undemocratic.“It's also the most ill-advised legislative action that I've seen in my lifetime,” Schoen said.Trump is the first president in American history to be impeached twice. He was acquitted at a Senate trial last year over his contacts with his Ukrainian counterpart. Impeachment, Schoen said, “is the weapon they've tried to use against him.”The new case was an effort to bar Trump from ever running for office again, Schoen said, “and that's about as undemocratic as you can get.”Schoen, a criminal defense and civil rights lawyer, and Bruce Castor, a former county prosecutor in Pennsylvania, were announced as Trump's legal team on Sunday evening, one day after it was revealed that the former president had parted ways with another set of attorneys in what one person described as a mutual decision.In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Schoen said he did not plan to argue that Trump lost the election because of fraud, as Trump has repeatedly insisted, and would instead argue that the trial itself is unconstitutional since Trump has already left office and that his words were protected by the First Amendment and did not incite a riot.House Democrats plan to lay out what happened on January 6 in graphic detail — an effort to get through to Senate Republicans who have largely avoided talking about the attack itself and Trump’s role in it, instead focusing on the process of the impeachment trial. They are expected to play videos and verbally recount the violence of the day in hopes of stirring the Republicans, most of whom fled the Senate that day as the rioters broke in.The nine House impeachment managers who will argue the case also are expected to lay out how they believe Trump’s actions over the previous several months led up to it and eventually incited the insurrectionists to act.Their arguments will include a look at Trump’s “prolonged effort” to persuade his supporters to believe his false claims that the election was stolen — and describe how his pleas for them to come to Washington and his words immediately before the attack directly caused it.The mob that broke into the Capitol as the House and the Senate tallied electoral votes not only ransacked the building but repeatedly called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and for Vice President Mike Pence, who was in the building to preside over the count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-case-undemocratic-ill-advised-says-donald-trump-s-lawyer-101612242354661.html
02-02-2021||World||UK’s Rishi Sunak poised to stick to tax pledges in March 3 Budget||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is sticking to an election promise not to hike taxes on wages and sales next month, rejecting pressure to increase revenue to tackle the record deficit run-up during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a person familiar with the matter.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak‘s budget next month will not raise income tax, national insurance or value added tax after the prime minister was clear he didn’t want to break the pledge, said the person, who was speaking on condition of anonymity because the plans are private.Johnson vowed not to increase the three taxes during his campaign for election in 2019, but the economic damage caused by the pandemic called into question the commitment, which covers the Treasury’s biggest revenue raisers.After almost a decade of austerity, there’s little appetite for spending cuts to shrink a deficit that’s on course to reach 400 billion pounds ($546 billion) this year. That’s put potential tax rises in focus as Sunak prepares to set out plans in his March 3 budget to start restoring the public finances.But the prime minister has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to break the pledge. It was Johnson who persuaded the chancellor to honor the commitment, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified Treasury officials.Both Johnson’s office and The Treasury declined to comment on the plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-rishi-sunak-poised-to-stick-to-tax-pledges-in-march-3-budget-101612242300425.html
02-02-2021||World||China state media celebrates top entrepreneurs. But not Jack Ma||Jack Ma was conspicuously absent from a list of China’s entrepreneurial greats published by state media Tuesday, underscoring how the the iconic Alibaba co-founder has run afoul of Beijing.Ma, lionized at home for creating some of his country’s largest corporations, didn’t make the cut in a Shanghai Securities News front-page commentary lauding the leading lights of technology. Instead, the official Chinese paper held up archrival Pony Ma as “rewriting the mobile age” with Tencent Holdings Ltd. Also on its list were BYD Co. Chairman Wang Chuanfu, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun and Huawei Technologies Co.’s Ren Zhengfei.The brief editorial -- which ran the same day Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is slated to unveil earnings -- may help assuage fears Tencent could get caught up in a broader industry crackdown now focused on Ma’s Alibaba and Ant Group Co. Beijing has launched a campaign to curtail the growing power of private technology corporations in almost every facet of Chinese life, as exemplified by the ubiquity of Tencent’s WeChat messaging service. Shares in Tencent and Xiaomi rose more than 2% Tuesday.Jack Ma’s absence is telling given the Shanghai Securities News is the most important business publication in Alibaba’s backyard. The billionaire made his first public comments in January since disappearing from view late last year, after his now-infamous rebuke of Chinese regulators prompted a backlash that derailed Ant’s record $35 billion initial public offering and spurred an investigation into his e-commerce giant. Much about the future of China’s most recognizable and outspoken businessman remains unclear.“A generation of Chinese entrepreneurs emerged from the rigid structures of our old economic system with the desire to escape poverty and passion to achieve business ambitions,” the newspaper, which is backed by the official Xinhua News Agency, wrote. “They have breathed new life into China’s economic reforms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-state-media-celebrates-top-entrepreneurs-but-not-jack-ma-101612237434343.html

The army had early on Monday seized control of the country and imposed a state of emergency for a year. After seizing power, General Min Aung Hlaing promised a free and fair election and a handover of power to the winning party, without giving a timeframe.The army has also named 11 ministers as replacements to oversee ministries including finance, defence, foreign affairs and interior.Among the people who were arrested in the coup on Monday included a Buddhist monk Shwe Nya War Sayadawa who is known for his outspoken support for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). The arrest takes significance as monks are a powerful political force in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.The coup followed a landslide win for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party in November elections, a result the military has refused to accept citing allegations of fraud.What is the current situationTroops and riot police marched on the streets of Myanmar. Military helicopters also flew across the city. However, no unrest was reported as of Tuesday morning.In the capital Nayptaw, army and police vehicles have taken position. The situation is similar at Yangon, the main commercial centre of Myanmar.Meanwhile, phone and internet connections have been restored. Markets that are otherwise bustling were quiet. Yangon airport is also closed, as per Reuters report. Banks are expected to open reopen today.US threatens sanctionsIn view of the military seize, the US threatened Myanmar of the reimposition of sanctions. "The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy,” President Joe Biden said in a statement released by the White House, referring to the country by its previous name. Biden also said that the coup was a direct assault on Myanmar's transition to democracy and the rule of law, and said his administration would be watching how other countries responded.Concerns over Rohingya refugeesOne of the key concerns for UN diplomats is the fate of Rohingya Muslims and other ethnic minority groups who were driven out of the country by the military and are living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries.Bangladesh, which is sheltering about 1 million Rohingya, called for "peace and stability" in the region and said it hoped a process to repatriate the refugees could move forward.World reactionThe United Nations Security Council is due to meet later on Tuesday, Reuters reported citing diplomats. In condemation led by the United Nations, leaders of the democratic countries including Australia, the European Union, India, Japan and the United States called for the release of detainees and restoration of democracy.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-military-coup-24-hours-later-whereabouts-of-aung-san-suu-kyi-remains-unknown-101612235612249.html
02-02-2021||World||WHO slams critics of Covid-19 origins investigation||The World Health Organization on Monday blasted critics of its investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and challenged those claiming to know better to come forward with the smoking gun.A WHO investigative team is in Wuhan, China -- where the first cases were discovered in December 2019 -- trying to piece together how the virus jumped from animals to humans before going on to kill more than two million people.The UN agency's emergencies director Michael Ryan hit out at those sniping at the mission, and said people claiming they have information on how the pandemic broke out should emerge from the shadows.Ryan said many critics were saying they "won't accept the report when it comes out", or that there is "other intelligence available that may show different findings" on how the virus broke out.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage"If you have the answers... please let us know," Ryan told a press conference from the WHO's headquarters in Geneva.He asked how responsible it was "to say you won't accept a report before it's even written? To say that you have intelligence that has not been provided?"The WHO mission comes with heavy political baggage -- China refused the team access until mid-January and there are question marks over what the experts can hope to find, one year on.Beijing is keen to put the focus on its recovery from the outbreak. The team toured a propaganda exhibition celebrating China's recovery from the pandemic in Wuhan on Saturday.Ryan was responding to a question which referenced new US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who earlier Monday told NBC that China was falling "far short of the mark"."China has to step up and make sure that it is being transparent, that it is providing information and sharing information, that it is giving access to international experts and inspectors," Blinken said."Its failure to do that is a real problem."Ryan said the team in the field deserved international support, and in the meantime, "it's time for people who say and think they have information to start providing it".He added that all infectious disease investigations find information that then throws up further questions."It's a detective story," he said.Virology lab visitThe expert team in Wuhan has now started investigations on the ground, notably visiting the Huanan seafood market where one of the first reported clusters of infections emerged, and the hospital where early patients were treated.Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, said the team would be visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Former US president Donald Trump pushed an unsubstantiated theory that the virus escaped from the facility.The team are having "very productive discussions with Chinese counterparts, visiting different hospitals around Wuhan", Van Kerkhove said."They had a very good visit to the market, seeing first-hand the stalls and walking through."Van Kerkhove said they had also met with counterparts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention."They will visit the Institute of Virology. That is being planned," she added.Meanwhile WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was "encouraging" that the global number of new coronavirus cases had fallen for the third week in a row."It shows this virus can be controlled, even with the new variants in circulation," he said.However, "we have been here before", he warned."Over the past year, there have been moments in almost all countries when cases declined, and governments opened up too quickly and individuals let down their guard, only for the virus to come roaring back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-slams-critics-of-covid-19-origins-investigation-101612234316179.html

It was broken and ripped from the base by unknown miscreants recently."Certainly we would condemn that desecration and watch it closely," Psaki said.The city of Davis, in a statement, condemned the act of vandalism."We do not support any actions that include the destruction of property. We understand that our community reflects a diversity of views and values, but we expect that everyone will extend respect to each other and to shared spaces."We are committed to creating a city that is inclusive and lives up to our principles. We work diligently to ensure the physical and psychological safety of every resident. Acts of destruction are violent and shatter this safety," it said.The city said it sympathises with those who are grieving the destruction of the statue and promised a thorough investigation and full accountability for those who committed this crime."We sympathise with those who have sincerely voiced their opposition to the statue and who feel unheard. But we reiterate our belief that the solution to solving such differences is never in violent acts but through compromise and dialogue. It is our sincere desire that our community moves forward with peaceful and positive discourse and reconciliation," the city said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-condemns-desecration-of-gandhi-statue-in-california-101612228557289.html

02-02-2021||World||US hits pandemic milestone with more vaccinated than cases||More Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine than have tested positive for the virus, an early but hopeful milestone in the race to end the pandemic.As of Monday afternoon, 26.5 million Americans had received one or both doses of the current vaccines, according to data compiled by the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Since the first U.S. patient tested positive outside of Seattle a year ago, 26.3 million people in the country have tested positive for the disease, and 443,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The U.S. has been administering shots at a faster daily rate than any country in the world, giving about 1.34 million doses a day, according to data gathered by Bloomberg. While the rollout stumbled in its early days, in the six weeks since the first shots went into arms almost 7.8% of Americans have gotten one or more doses, and 1.8% are fully vaccinated.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It’s worth noting that today, for the first time, the data said that more people were vaccinated than were reported as newly diagnosed cases,” said Paula Cannon, a professor of microbiology at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. “That’s worth celebrating. I’m all for that win.”Only a few other countries have crossed that milestone: Israel, the U.K. and the U.A.E. beat the U.S. to the more-vaccinations-than-cases line days or weeks ago.After a holiday surge in American cases, officials at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention are calling the top, though that’s likely because of behavioral changes, and still not widespread impact from the vaccine. New Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and emergency-department visits are starting to decline, said Jay Butler, the agency’s deputy director for infectious diseases.“While these trends are encouraging, I want to stress that the numbers nationally are still high, and they’re as high as they’ve been at any point in the pandemic up to this point,” he said at a briefing Friday hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “If this pandemic were a stock, we might be wanting to sell.”It’s still possible for the virus to roar back, particularly if variants that are emerging in South Africa and elsewhere take hold. Studies suggest vaccines, particularly the newer shots from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc., are less potent against that strain and at least one other.The goal is to eventually reach herd immunity, when so many Americans have protection thanks to a vaccine or natural infection that the virus struggles to spread and eventually dies out. Public health officials, including Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor, estimate 70% to 85% of the 330 million Americans must be exposed to the pathogen through virus or vaccine to reach that level.Race for ImmunityWhile past infection can create immunity, it’s not clear how long it lasts. And it comes at a cost -- not just deaths but hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and some who report lingering illness and a baffling array of symptoms, including fatigue, depression and respiratory issues.“There’s a price to pay in suffering and in cost for the health system,” said Alessandro Sette, a professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “It’s protracted and severe.”No deaths, meanwhile, have been conclusively linked to the receipt of a Covid-19 vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s voluntary system for tracking adverse events includes reports of about 290 deaths following the administration of a vaccine against coronavirus as of Jan. 22. Most were in elderly people with other health issues and none were determined to be tied to the immunizations.Questions persist. It’s still not clear exactly how many people have been vaccinated or infected, and it may never be. Many more people have had the virus than tested positive, in particular those with mild or asymptomatic cases.Reported vaccinations are also lower than the number actually given because people are more focused on injecting them into arms than recording the data into tracking systems, Cannon said. Two shots are required for full immunity, which only 5.82 million Americans have received.It’s still early in the immunization effort, which has been beset by a lack of coordination, confusion over who should have access and a shortfall in supply that crimped the number of people who were able to get the shot in the first weeks of the rollout.It’s also important to make sure the right people are getting immunized in order to get the most benefit, said Bill Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins University’s International Vaccine Access Center.“There are a lot of people who are getting vaccinated who aren’t in high risk categories,” he said. “If that’s the case, it’s going to take longer to see a reduction in serious disease and death. Everyone needs a vaccine at some point, but I’m concerned about the inequities in how the system has rolled out.”The emerging variants have created new urgency to increase the pace of vaccinations, said Daniela Weiskopf, a research assistant professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Each time the virus replicates, there’s a chance a variant could emerge.“The faster we interrupt this, the more likely we’re not seeing more variants pop up,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-pandemic-milestone-with-more-vaccinated-than-cases-101612226590681.html
02-02-2021||World||Americans scramble for appointments for second Covid-19 vaccine dose||As more Americans ready for their second Covid-19 vaccine shot, some patients are falling through the cracks of an increasingly complex web of providers and appointment systems.While many people are getting their required second doses, the process is taking a toll on some of the most vulnerable - older adults who in many cases rely on family members or friends to navigate complex sign-up systems and inconvenient locations.Available vaccines need to be given as two separate doses weeks apart, and confusion is further taxing an already challenged health care system. Houston's health department on Friday told those seeking a second dose to be patient, saying the volume of calls was creating long wait times at its call center.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageAs of Monday, 26 million people in the United States had received a first vaccine shot, and almost 6 million had the second, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC has also said states lag in reporting data so it is unclear if that might affect the dose counts.“There's going to be some delay in getting second doses,” said Beth Blauer, Executive Director at the Centers for Civic Impact at Johns Hopkins University, who is tracking vaccination data for the university’s Coronavirus Resource Center.She had expected the number of first doses to plateau as priority populations began to get second doses, but that tapering off was happening slower than expected.“We're still seeing the first dose climb which means that there's going to essentially be an unrealistic expectation that you're going to get your second dose, because we know that there's finite supply.”SECOND SHOT PROCEDURESPractices vary. Seminole County in Florida schedules follow-ups during the 15-minute observation period after people get their first shots. New York's Onondaga County holds off on scheduling second appointments until days before the shot.After an online system showed no appointments, Stacey Champion secured a second appointment for her 78-year-old friend Dan Pochoda at Cardinal Stadium in Phoenix, Arizona - at 1:51 a.m. on Feb. 9. It took several calls to get even that, Champion said."If they had been saving appointments for second doses, would they really need to send people way out to the edges of the city in the middle of the night?" Champion asked.Many providers expect their vaccine allocations to fall sharply this week."When this started, it was only for hospitals. Now a smaller pot needs to be divided between many more - the pharmacies, the mega sites and everyone else," said Felipe Osorno, executive administrator of continuum of care operations and value improvement at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.People in recent days have been showing up at USC hospitals seeking their second vaccine dose, saying their original vaccine provider could not confirm an appointment, Osorno said.On Twitter, concerns about getting the second shot are mixed with triumphant tweets by many who got follow-ups on time, without drama.St. John's Well Child and Family Center, a network of public health centers in South and Central Los Angeles, is running nine vaccination clinics, and began administering second doses on Jan. 25 after sending email and telephone reminders to patients."We screamed and yelled" to secure second doses on top of meeting the need for first shot appointments, said Jim Mangia, the center's president, who added most people are returning.West Virginia, a leader in getting shots into arms, hired critical event management firm Everbridge to manage scheduling as it opens up vaccinations to more groups."Any time there's ambiguity, that's not a good feeling," said Andy Malinoski, marketing director for West Virginia's Department of Commerce.Guidelines call for a second shot of Moderna Inc's vaccine four weeks after the first dose, while the gap is three weeks for the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech vaccine. The CDC has said an interval as long as six weeks is acceptable for either vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-scramble-for-appointments-for-second-covid-19-vaccine-dose-101612226760976.html
02-02-2021||World||Myanmar coup to dampen US trade, impact footwear companies, experts warn||The coup in Myanmar is expected to dampen the interest of US and Western companies in investing in Myanmar, and may prompt some big US companies to pull out, trade experts and analysts said on Monday.Total trade in goods between Myanmar and the United States amounted to nearly $1.3 billion in the first 11 months of 2020, up from $1.2 billion in all of 2019, according to US Census Bureau data.Apparel and footwear accounted for some 41% of total US goods imports, followed by luggage, which accounted for nearly 30%, and fish, which accounted for just over 4%, said Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.Also Read | UN Security Council to hold emergency meet over Myanmar coupLuggage maker Samsonite and privately owned apparel maker LL Bean are among big importers, along with retailer H&M and Adidas, Panjiva said.US imports increased in part due to tariffs on goods from China, but Myanmar still ranked only 84th on the list of US goods suppliers, according to US data.The World Bank reported a 33% jump in total foreign direct investment commitments in Myanmar to $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2019/2020, led by Singapore and Hong Kong, but said the outlook was uncertain due to the pandemic and market developments.U.S. direct investment data was unavailable, the US Trade Representative's office said.Myanmar's army on Monday handed power to military chief General Min Aung Hlaing and imposed a year-long state of emergency, saying it had responded to what it called election fraud.The move sparked condemnation from Western leaders and a threat of renewed sanctions by the US government, and raised questions about the outlook for a million Rohingya refugees.Lucas Myers, analyst with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said the coup would exacerbate strains in US-Myanmar ties following sanctions imposed by Washington in December 2019 and would further complicate trade relations."On trade, the Rohingya situation and Myanmar's troubled human rights record rendered investment less attractive for Western firms as compared with China," Myers said.William Reinsch, trade expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said US companies could opt to pull out of Myanmar, given new developments and the Biden administration's vow to focus more on human rights.While some US companies had moved work from China to Myanmar in recent years to take advantage of lower wages, the country's infrastructure was still lacking, which had kept investment from booming, he added.Most of the US work was in relatively low capital-intensive industries and could be relocated fairly easily, even if doing so would take time, Reinsch said. "It's not semiconductors. These factories are relatively easy to set up."Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said many of the trade group's members did business in Myanmar and found the coup deeply concerning."We urge the full and immediate restoration of democratic rights and institutions," he said. "Our hearts and prayers are with the Myanmar people for a swift, peaceful, and democratic resolution to this crisis – one that does not take away the economic progress made by the hardworking people of Myanmar."A spokesperson for H&M said the company was monitoring events and was in close contact with suppliers, but had no immediate plans to change its sourcing strategy. "We are closely following the developments, but refrain from speculating about what this will mean for us going forward," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-to-dampen-us-trade-impact-footwear-companies-experts-warn-101612226525284.html

Any unused funds will be spent on diversity efforts at Google.The company already conducts annual pay audits, but like other big tech companies, it remains under public scrutiny for a workforce that does not reflect the country's makeup in terms of race and gender.The company said in a statement, "We believe everyone should be paid based upon the work they do, not who they are, and invest heavily to make our hiring and compensation processes fair and unbiased."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-to-pay-3-8-million-to-settle-accusations-of-hiring-pay-biases-101612226398234.html
02-02-2021||World||Covid-19 ICU deaths plunge, but progress may be stalling: study||Covid-19 treatments and improved hospital care have reduced death rates in intensive care by more than a third since the early months of the pandemic, but this progress might be stalling, according to research published Tuesday.Whereas medical staff in the first wave of the epidemic had few insights to help them tackle the new virus, they now have some effective drugs and therapies for treating severely ill patients.A large-scale meta-analysis of overall mortality of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) around the world, published in the journal Anaesthesia, found that it had fallen to 36 percent by October.An earlier analysis by the same authors found that ICU mortality had fallen from 60 percent in late March 2020 to 42 percent at the end of May.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage"After our first meta-analysis last year showed a large drop in ICU mortality from Covid-19 from March to May 2020, this updated analysis shows that any fall in mortality rate between June and October 2020 appears to have flattened or plateaued," the authors said.Researchers looked at data from 52 observational studies involving 43,128 patients.The studies were from Europe, North America and China -- areas included in the earlier analysis -- as well as reports from the Middle East, South Asia and Australia.Pressure from new variantsThe authors said that hospitals now have much more knowledge about what works -- and what does not.In particular, medics now can use steroids like dexamethasone to improve the survival chances of seriously ill patients on oxygen support. Strategies for oxygen therapy, fluid therapy and management of blood clotting have all evolved since the early days of the pandemic.But with several new variants of the coronavirus emerging in the months since the end of their analysis, they said ICUs may come under further pressure.British scientists recently warned that the variant that emerged there was not only more transmissible, but could also be more deadly.Peter Horby, who leads the Recovery trial that provided the evidence for the use of dexamethasone, said recently however that the drugs should continue to work equally well with the new variants. This is because they act on the body's immune response, not the virus itself.Horby, professor of emerging infectious disease at Oxford University, said overall improvements in therapies and treatments have brought down case fatality rates since the first wave and could even "offset any difference with this new variant".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-icu-deaths-plunge-but-progress-may-be-stalling-study-101612226037382.html

White House not preoccupied with former president||To hear the new White House spokeswoman tell it, Joe Biden's team doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about former president Donald Trump -- and they certainly don't miss him on Twitter.White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked at the daily briefing on Monday whether Trump's banishment from Twitter makes it easier for Biden to negotiate a Covid-19 relief package with Congress."This may be hard to believe," Psaki told reporters. "We don't spend a lot of time talking about or thinking about president Trump here -- former president Trump to be very clear."I think that is a question that's probably more appropriate for Republican members (of Congress) who are looking for ways to support a bipartisan package and whether that gives them space," she said."But I can't say we miss him on Twitter," Psaki added.Asked whether Biden favored Trump's continued ban from his favorite messaging platform, Psaki said "that's a decision made by Twitter.""We've certainly spoken to and he's spoken to the need for social media platforms to continue to take steps to reduce hate speech," she said.Twitter banned Trump in the wake of the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by his supporters, citing a "risk of further incitement of violence."The decision was condemned by supporters of the former president but also by some free speech advocates who voiced concern about the power of social media companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-who-white-house-not-preoccupied-with-former-president-101612225869647.html

Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday on the military coup in Myanmar, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called “a serious blow to democratic reforms” in the Southeast Asian nation.Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward is this month’s council president and said Monday that the council will look at “a range of measures” to uphold the Nov. 8 presidential election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party and secure the release of the Nobel peace laureate and other leaders arrested by the military.Woodward says “at the moment, we don’t have specific ideas on measures.” At the U.N., that often means sanctions.U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric says the world body has been unable to contact officials in the capital and has no information on those being held.Dujarric said the U.N. fears the military action “may make the situation worse” for the estimated 600,000 Rohingya that remain in northern Rakhine state, including 120,000 people “who are effectively confined to camps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-to-meet-about-myanmar-coup-101612225512820.html
02-02-2021||World||Myanmar coup tests Biden democracy push but with few options||Myanmar's military coup marks an early test case of President Joe Biden's determination to advocate democracy but, unlike a decade ago when the United States nurtured a transition there, he has limited options.The rise of democracy in Myanmar had initially been hailed as a key achievement of former president Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as number two, representing an opening of a long-closed nation that had been in rival China's orbit.But Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's civilian leader who was detained with others Monday, had been rapidly losing Western support as the Nobel laureate stayed reticent -- some argue so as not to antagonize the military -- about a brutal campaign against the mostly Muslim Rohingya minority.Also Read | Aung San Suu Kyi detained as army grabs power in MyanmarBiden in a forceful statement Monday warned of a return of sanctions and steadfastly backed the principle of democracy -- in line with his campaign promises as he vowed to turn the page from his predecessor Donald Trump, who praised autocrats and unsuccessfully tried to overturn his own election defeat."The United States will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack," Biden said, demanding that the military in the nation also known as Burma "immediately relinquish the power they have seized."Less US leverageDerek Mitchell, the first US ambassador to Myanmar after the opening, said the United States no longer enjoyed the same leverage."I think the Rohingya crisis set things back substantially -- for good reason, obviously, in that we had to speak out and act against the kind of genocide that occurred -- but that came at the expense of relationships," he said.Mitchell, now president of the National Democratic Institute, urged coordination with US allies and said that the world needed to respect the overwhelming victory of Suu Kyi's National League of Democracy in last year's elections.The West "may have considered her this global icon of democracy and that luster is off. But if you care about democracy in the world, then you must respect the democratic choice and she is clearly that.""It's not about the person; it's about the process," he said.In a growing rarity in Washington, Myanmar policy has wide bipartisan consensus with Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, long a vocal supporter of Suu Kyi.Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Biden administration should resist immediately imposing sanctions -- a nearly daily tool of the United States under Trump -- and try diplomacy."Myanmar is an unexpected early test for the Biden administration, which has emphasized human rights and democracy as cornerstones of US foreign policy," she said."Quickly dispatching a senior envoy to Naypyidaw carrying rare bipartisan congressional backing would be an appropriate next step," she said, referring to Myanmar's 15-year-old capital.Complex role of ChinaWhen Myanmar began its democratic transition, the United States -- led by secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who paid a landmark visit in 2011 -- coaxed reformists within the junta with promises of economic engagement, sanctions relief and an alternative for highly nationalist rulers to reliance on China.The United States has less to offer a military chief whose ambitions led him to turn his back on a decade of change.Myanmar's top general and coup leader, Min Aung Hlaing, is already under US travel and financial sanctions for the campaign against the Rohingya, which the United States has described as ethnic cleansing."It's easy to make statements but hard to figure out what to do next" said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies."What more do you do? I guess you can sanction a few military companies. That might bring a little pressure because they are so deeply burrowed into so many sectors of the economy," he said.Key nations with which the United States could coordinate are Japan and India, close US partners that enjoy warm relations with Myanmar, with New Delhi days earlier shipping 1.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine.China also developed cordial ties with Myanmar's civilian leadership, which appeared more interested in Beijing's massive Belt and Road infrastructure-building blitz than the insular and sometimes paranoid generals."One thing that is ironic is that I think China actually had much better relations with Aung San Suu Kyi than they are going to have with the military," Hiebert said.But with the West set to tighten the screws, Myanmar's new junta may have no choice but to lean on China.Biden has promised a renewed focus on its allies and many in Southeast Asia have been eager to see Washington as a hedge against Beijing."What happened in Myanmar just instantly makes that more difficult," Hiebert said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-tests-biden-democracy-push-but-with-few-options-101612225091146.html
02-02-2021||World||Turkey's Erdogan hits out at 'LGBT youth' as police break up fresh protest||President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday lashed out at Turkey's LGBT movement, accusing it of "vandalism" following an outbreak of student protests.Four people were arrested over the weekend for depicting Islam's holiest site with pictures of the LGBT rainbow flag during a rally at Istanbul's Bogazici University.And shortly after Erdogan's televised speech on Monday, another rally erupted at the same school with dozens of people detained and social media footage showing police dragging away students who had been protesting peacefully."We will carry our young people to the future, not as the LGBT youth, but as the youth that existed in our nation's glorious past," Erdogan said during a video linkup with members of his ruling AK Party."You are not the LGBT youth, not the youth who commit acts of vandalism. On the contrary, you are the ones who repair broken hearts."'Inciting hatred'Rights groups accuse Erdogan of taking the mostly Muslim but officially secular country on an increasingly socially conservative course during his 18 years in power.Homosexuality has been legal throughout modern Turkey's history.But gay people often face harassment, and LGBT events -- including Istanbul Pride -- have been blocked under Erdogan.Turkey was hit by a wave of student protests last month after Erdogan appointed a loyalist as the head of Bogazici University.During one demonstration last Friday protesters hung an artwork opposite the new rector's office depicting the holy site in Mecca and images of the LGBT movement's rainbow flag.Turkish police accused four people of "inciting hatred in the population". Two of them have been remanded in custody and the other two placed under house arrest.Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu branded the suspects "four LGBT freaks".Groups of students once again demonstrated at Bogazici university on Monday despite the presence of hundreds of riot police, demanding the four be freed and the rector stand down.AFP reporters saw several students dragged away by the police and Istanbul's governor later confirmed 159 people had been arrested.Further afield in the Aegean resort city of Izmir, social media posts showed police scuffling with a small group of rainbow flag-waving students.The rallies have echoes of the 2013 protests that sprang up against plans to demolish an Istanbul park before spreading nationally and presenting a direct challenge to Erdogan's rule.Erdogan last month accused some of those taking part in the student demonstrations of being "terrorists".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkeys-erdogan-hits-out-at-lgbt-youth-as-police-break-up-fresh-protest-101612224817496.html

Polish police raided discos that defied restrictions on Saturday, using stun grenades and tear gas to clear dance floors.In the Netherlands, Amsterdam police cleared out the city’s museum square after some 600 people gathered there for an illegal protest. Thousands of people marched through the Austrian capital Vienna to protest coronavirus restrictions there, ignoring a police ban on the march, with many shunning masks and social distancing. The march was organised by the far-right Freedom Party of Austria.In Brazil, protestors marched in several cities on Sunday to condemn President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the crisis.The emergence of the new variants has further complicated the fight against the coronavirus.

02-02-2021||World||Aung San Suu Kyi detained as army grabs power in Myanmar||Myanmar’s military seized power in a bloodless coup on Monday, detaining democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and imposing a one-year state of emergency.The intervention ended a decade of transition from outright military rule in Myanmar, with the generals justifying the power grab by alleging fraud in the November elections that Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party won in a landslide.Suu Kyi and President Win Myint were detained in the capital Naypyidaw before dawn, party spokesman Myo Nyunt told AFP, just hours before parliament was meant to reconvene for the first time since the elections. Later, Myanmar state television announced the removal of 24 of Suu Kyi’s ministers, and 11 new appointments.The military sealed off roads around the capital with armed troops, trucks and armoured personnel carriers. Military helicopters flew across the city.The military declared, via its own television channel, a one-year state of emergency and announced that former general Myint Swe would be acting president for the next year.Also read: Min Aung Hlaing, the military chief who engineered the coupIt alleged “huge irregularities” in the November polls that the election commission had failed to address. “As the situation must be resolved according to the law, a state of emergency is declared,” the announcement said. The army later pledged to hold fresh elections after the year-long state of emergency.Suu Kyi had issued a pre-emptive statement ahead of her detention calling on people “not to accept a coup”, according to a post on the official Facebook page of her party’s chairperson.The military moved quickly to stifle dissent, severely restricting the internet and mobile phone communications across the country.India expresses concern, China has muted reactionIndia expressed deep concern at the developments in Myanmar, as the US and several other countries called for restoration of democracy.“We have noted the developments in Myanmar with deep concern. India has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. We are monitoring the situation closely.”The US was swift to react to the news, with secretary of state Antony Blinken calling for the release of Suu Kyi and thers detained by the military. “We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections on November 8,” Blinken said in a statement.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the European Union, UK and Australia also condemned the coup.China’s response, however, was more muted. “We hope that all sides...can appropriately handle their differences,” a foreign ministry spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aung-san-suu-kyi-detained-as-army-grabs-power-in-myanmar-101612205026821.html
02-02-2021||World||Biden threatens sanctions on Myanmar after coup||President Joe Biden on Monday warned that the US could reinstate sanctions on Myanmar in the wake of its military seizing power and detaining democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other officials.“The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House, referring to the country by its previous name. “The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action.”Myanmar’s military seized power on Monday in a coup against the democratically elected government of Suu Kyi, who was detained along with other leaders of her National League for Democracy party in early morning raids on the day the new parliament was set to hold its first session.“For almost a decade, the people of Burma have been steadily working to establish elections, civilian governance, and the peaceful transfer of power. That progress should be respected,” Biden said in the statement.“We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burma’s democratic transition.” In response to a question at the daily news briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to elaborate what actions could be taken on Myanmar. She added that Biden’s statement about the coup in Myanmar is directed at all countries in the region, when asked if it was directed at China.The president’s statement had said, the United States “will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack.”The US had removed economic sanctions on Myanmar in 2016.Biden also called for the international community to “come together in one voice to press the country’s military to immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained, lift all telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against civilians”. Secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed “grave concern and alarm” over the situation in a separate statement. “We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections on November 8,” Blinken said. “The United States stands with the people of Burma in their aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace, and development. The military must reverse these actions immediately.”On Sunday, the White House had put out a statement saying the United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar’s democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed.

02-02-2021||World||Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna condemns vandalisation of Gandhi statue||Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna on Monday strongly condemned the vandalisation of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the US state of California, calling it as a shameful act.The 6-ft tall, 650-pound (294 kg) bronze statue of Gandhi in the Central Park of the City of Davis in Northern California was vandalised, broken and ripped from the base by unknown miscreants early this week.“Nonviolent, respectful protest was the essence of Gandhi’s life mission. To see the desecration of this magnificent statue only underscores the need for more people to study Gandhi’s teachings, not unilaterally erase him from the public discourse,” Khanna said.“This was a shameful act. At a moment in our history when disagreement needs to be managed with tolerance and patience, I urge everyone involved to take the time to listen and talk instead of resorting to acts of public vandalism,” he said.As the Democratic Vice Chair of the India Caucus, Khanna said he will continue to work with his colleagues to build bridges across these divisions.“I encourage everyone to join me in working through disagreement with dialogue and discussion, rather than resorting to violence that tears at the fabric of our society,” he said.Meanwhile, two groups gathered at the park in Davis on Sunday where the statue was vandalized, local media reported. While one group demanded that the statue be restored, the other opposed such a move.The City of Davis has launched an investigation into the incident.“The City of Davis condemns the vandalism that destroyed the statue of Mahatma Mohandas Gandhi in Central Park. We do not support any actions that include the destruction of property,” the city said in a statement on Sunday.“We understand that our community reflects a diversity of views and values, but we expect that everyone will extend respect to each other and to shared spaces," it said.“But we reiterate our belief that the solution to solving such differences is never in violent acts but through compromise and dialogue. It is our sincere desire that our community move forward with peaceful and positive discourse and reconciliation,” the city said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-congressman-ro-khanna-condemns-vandalisation-of-gandhi-statue-101612204075981.html
02-02-2021||World||Trump finds new defence lawyers for Senate impeachment trial||Former US president Donald Trump has announced new lawyers to defend him in the impeachment trial set to start on February 9, in place of those who left abruptly over the weekend.Trial lawyers David Schoen and Bruce L Castor Jr will head the defence team, Trump’s office announced on Sunday evening, a day after the departure of five leading members of the team reportedly over differences of opinion on the defence strategy.The announcement said the new defence team will argue “this impeachment is unconstitutional”. The earlier lawyers had left reportedly because the former president had pressed them to argue he had lost the election because of fraud, a lie that Trump, his lawyers and allies had failed to establish through more than 60 lawsuits and multiple requests for vote recounts and audits.Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on January 13, for inciting supporters to storm the US Capitol to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying the electoral victory of President Joe Biden. He became thus the only US president to be impeached twice.Also read: Trump impeachment defence lawyers quit ahead of Senate trialTrump is also the first US president to face impeachment trial after leaving office. The Senate, which is evenly divided but controlled by Democrats with the tie-breaking vote of vice-President Kamala Harris, will determine his fate in a trial starting February 9.“It is an honour to represent the 45th President, Donald J Trump, and the United States Constitution,” Schoen said.And Castro added, “I consider it a privilege to represent the 45th President. The strength of our Constitution is about to be tested like never before in our history. It is strong and resilient. A document written for the ages, and it will triumph over partisanship yet again, and always.”They will go up against nine Democratic members of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives appointed Impeachment managers to prosecute the case in the Senate, whose 100 members will act as jurors. The proceedings will be presided by Patrick Leahy, a Democratic senator.At least 17 of the evenly split Senate Republicans will have to vote with 50 Democrats to meet the threshold of two-thirds needed to convict the former president. A conviction will bar him from holding any federal office ever, effectively shutting down another run for the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-finds-new-defence-lawyers-for-senate-impeachment-trial-101612160367411.html
