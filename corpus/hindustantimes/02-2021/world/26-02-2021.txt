General Assembly Friday that drew loud applause from diplomats from the world body’s 193 nations.Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun urged all countries to issue public statements strongly condemning the military coup and refuse to recognize the military regime and ask its leaders to respect the free and fair elections in November won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party.“It is time for the military to immediately relinquish power and release those detained,” he said. “We will continue to fight for a government which is of the people, by the people, for the people.”Tun’s surprise statement not only drew applause but commendations from speaker after speaker at the assembly meeting including ambassadors representing the European Union, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the new U.S. ambassador, Linda Thomas Greenfield, who joined others in calling it “courageous.”She said the United States “stands in solidarity” with the people of Myanmar who are in the streets protesting the coup and reiterated President Joe Biden’s warning that “we will show the military their actions have consequences” and his appeal to the military “to immediately relinquish power.”The assembly meeting was called to hear a briefing from the U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, who said it is time to “sound the alarm” about the coup, ongoing violations of the constitution and reversal of reforms instituted by Suu Kyi, who was previously the de facto head of government.She pointed to restrictions on internet and communication services, the detention of about 700 people according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners in Myanmar.The huge protests in the country are not about a fight between Suu Kyi’s party and the military, she said, “it is a people’s fight without arms.”Addressing diplomats in the General Assembly chamber by video link, Schraner Burgener urged “all of you to collectively send a clear signal in support of democracy in Myanmar.”The Feb. 1 military takeover in Myanmar shocked the international community and reversed years of slow progress toward democracy. Suu Kyi’s party would have been installed for a second five-year term that day, but the army blocked Parliament from convening and detained her, President Win Myint and other top members of her government.Myanmar’s military says it took power because last November’s election was marked by widespread voting irregularities, an assertion that was refuted by the state election commission, whose members have since been replaced by the ruling junta. The junta has said it will rule for a year under a state of emergency and then hold new polls.Schraner Burgener told the General Assembly that “democratically elected representatives were able to be sworn in according to the constitution on Feb. 4 and have formed the Committee Representing Pyidaungu Hluttaw known as CRPH" and are seeking “to uphold their obligations to serve the people who voted for them.”Tun, the Myanmar ambassador, began his remarks to the assembly by reading a statement from CRPH stressing the legitimacy of the election results, declaring that the military overthrew the democratically elected government, citing the massive opposition by the people, and stressing that “now is not the time for the international community to tolerate crimes of the military” and the coup.“We ask the international community to take action,” the parliamentarians’ statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-un-envoy-dramatically-opposes-coup-in-his-country-101614363319541.html
26-02-2021||World||EU medicines regulator approves Regeneron Covid-19 therapy||Europe's medicines regulator on Friday provisionally approved use of US biotech firm Regeneron's Covid-19 therapy, saying it prevented patients with from getting worse.Regeneron's synthetic antibody treatment was used to treat former US President Donald Trump after he contracted coronavirus last year.The European Medicines Agency said preliminary results showed treatment with REGN-COV2 reduced the amount of the virus in the back of the nose and throat and led to fewer medical visits."The Agency concluded that... REGN-COV2 can be used for the treatment of confirmed Covid-19 in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at high risk of progressing to severe Covid-19," it said in a statement.REGN-COV2 is a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab, two monoclonal antibodies which is given to a patient via a drip, the EMA said.Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made versions of the body's natural infection-fighting defenses.The two antibodies have been designed to attach to the spike protein of the coronavirus at two different sites, stopping it from entering the body's cells, the EMA said.A rolling review of the two antibodies, which started on February 1 "was ongoing", the medicines regulator said, adding "once finalised it will be the basis for an EU marketing authorisation for this combination".The US-based Food and Drug Administration in November approved emergency use of REGN-COV2, experimentally used to treat Trump.On Thursday, France too announced it had distributed thousands of monoclonal antibody treatments to hospitals, with Health Minister Olivier Veran saying "there are new hopes... which strengthen our anti-Covid arsenal".The EMA however did not make an announcement Friday on the approval of Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus jab, which earlier this month applied for authorisation within the European Union.So far, three vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca have been approved by the EMA.A US panel of independent experts were meeting Friday to discuss whether to grant J&J's covid shot the go-ahead in the United States.Friday's announcements followed the Amsterdam-based EMA's monthly meeting, where it also recommended the approval of six other medicines including the first oral treatment for patients with certain types of spinal muscular atrophy.This rare and often fatal genetic disease causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-medicines-regulator-approves-regeneron-covid-19-therapy-101614361313426.html
26-02-2021||World||FDA advisory panel to review Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine with thumbs up expected||A panel of expert advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration began a meeting to discuss Johnson & Johnson's one-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, setting the stage for a possible emergency use authorization as early as this week.After it receives the recommendation, the FDA is likely to authorize the vaccine for emergency use within a day or so, making it the third available in the United States, and the only one that requires just one shot.The panel, consisting of doctors, infectious disease experts and medical researchers, began the meeting at 9:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT), and will vote in favor or against the vaccine's use several hours later at the end of the meeting.The panel will consider whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risk for use in people aged 18 and older.In a 44,000-person trial, the vaccine overall was 66% effective at preventing moderate-to-severe cases of Covid-19 compared with a placebo.The effectiveness of the one-dose vaccine varied over time and location. In the United States, the effectiveness was 74% at 14 days and 72% two weeks later, while the shot was 64% effective at stopping moderate-to-severe Covid-19 after 28 days in South Africa, where a worrying new variant has swept across the country.The vaccine was 100% effective at preventing hospitalizations 28 days after vaccination and there were no Covid-19 deaths among those who received the shot."In the context of the pandemic, the FDA is likely to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) based on the data," said UBS analyst Navin Jacob ahead of the panel meeting.The J&J vaccine can be stored in normal refrigerator temperatures, making distribution easier than that of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc vaccines that use mRNA technology and must be shipped and stored frozen.J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response.Three to four million doses of the vaccine are expected to be rolled out next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-advisory-panel-to-review-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-with-thumbs-up-expected-101614360807133.html
26-02-2021||World||Bank of America gives paid time off for US staff to get Covid-19 vaccines||JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. will offer staff paid time off when they become eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine.Employees at JPMorgan who are eligible for the shots will get eight hours to accommodate the appointments, the bank said in an emailed statement Friday. JPMorgan has about 255,000 workers.Staff at Bank of America will have the option to use two half days, for up to four hours each, for vaccination appointments this year, the bank said Friday in a staff memo seen by Bloomberg. The policy is designed to accommodate the two-dose regimen current vaccines require.Bank of America’s time-off benefit is part of an effort “to help address the impacts of the coronavirus and to support the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our teammates,” the lender, which has roughly 212,500 employees, said in the memo. A bank spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo.Other companies have offered similar perks. Allstate Corp., one of the largest publicly traded US auto insurers, said it will provide paid time off for employees to get the vaccine during working hours. Bank of Montreal said earlier this month it was offering staff three hours, and will also cover some of the costs associated with getting the shots.PayPal Holdings Inc. said Friday it committed $5 million to pay for free or discounted rides by Uber Technologies Inc. to get people to vaccine appointments. PayPal said it was responding to a call by President Joe Biden’s administration for corporations to help support vaccination efforts.“Nobody should miss their shot at getting vaccinated because they lack transportation,” Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said in December it would extend pandemic benefits for employees who need child- or adult-care services, offering reimbursements for caregiver costs and boosting the number of days workers can use backup facilities or in-home care this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bank-of-america-gives-paid-time-off-for-us-staff-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-101614359509743.html
26-02-2021||World||Biden administration to promote vaccination with businesses||The Biden administration announced a partnership Friday with national business groups to urge the private sector to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and encourage vaccinations.The White House will partner with the US Chamber of Commerce; leaders of the Black, Latino and Asian business community; the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers on the efforts, White House adviser Andy Slavitt announced in a briefing.The campaign will urge businesses across the US to require masks and social distancing, to reduce barriers to vaccinations and to offer paid time off and bonuses for employees who get vaccinated, Slavitt said. The administration also will encourage businesses to advocate for the benefits of masks and vaccines.Actions by major companies include Walgreens, PayPal, Lyft and Uber offering free or discounted rides to vaccination sites. Firms such as Ford and Gap are donating masks.Best Buy and Dollar General will offer more than a half million workers paid time off or compensation for vaccination. Sports leagues and the live-events industry have offered more than 100 stadiums and venues available as vaccination sites. The government is making clear to corporations where the needs are but is not directing them, Slavitt said.The National Football League is offering its stadiums for use as mass vaccination sites, Brian McCarthy, vice president of communications at the NFL said. Ten of the stadiums are active vaccination sites, including the Mercedes-Benz stadium in Atlanta and the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.The partnership will include the debut in coming weeks of a public education campaign to promote vaccination, a spokeswoman for the Business Roundtable said.The National Association of Manufacturers announced a project to promote vaccination among 12 million workers in the manufacturing community, which has a higher rate of vaccine hesitancy than the general population.“We’re resolute in our determination to finish this fight,” said Jay Timmons, president and chief executive officer of the association, in a statement.The administration hopes to reach hundreds of thousands of businesses -- representing more than 100 million people -- to promote these efforts.“Through these partner organizations, step-by-step resources to help businesses operate safely will be available,” Slavitt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-promote-vaccination-with-businesses-101614359604045.html
26-02-2021||World||Biden team looking to stop Saudi arms deals that help it attack others||After pausing half a billion dollars in arms deals with Saudi Arabia out of concern over casualties in Yemen, President Joe Biden's administration may shift US policy not only to cancel past deals that pose human rights concerns, but limit future military sales to "defensive" weapons.Four sources familiar with the administration's thinking said officials are assessing the array of military equipment and training included in sales to the Saudis to determine what can be considered defensive. Those deals would be allowed.A State Department spokesperson said, "Our focus is on ending the conflict in Yemen even as we ensure Saudi Arabia has everything it needs to defend its territory and its people," adding Biden has pledged to end US military support for the military campaign against the Houthis.The Biden administration is recalibrating its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a country with which it has severe human rights concerns but which is also one of Washington's closest US allies."They're trying to figure out where do you draw the lines between offensive weapons and defensive stuff," said one congressional aide familiar with the issue, describing the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-team-looking-to-stop-saudi-arms-deals-that-help-it-attack-others-101614359486242.html
26-02-2021||World||Third US vaccine could raise question: Which Covid-19 shots are best?||The nation is poised to get a third vaccine against Covid-19, but because at first glance the Johnson & Johnson shot may not be seen as equal to other options, health officials are girding for the question: Which one is best?If cleared for emergency use, the J&J vaccine would offer a one-dose option that could help speed vaccinations, tamp down a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 people in the US and stay ahead of a mutating virus.“I think it’s going to be huge,” said Dr. Virginia Caine, director of the public health department in Marion County, Indiana, which includes Indianapolis. She expects the easier-to-use vaccine will give local officials more flexibility for mobile vaccination clinics or pop-up events.The challenge will be explaining how protective the J&J shot is after the astounding success of the first US vaccines.Two doses of the Pfizer and Moderna shots were found to be about 95% effective against symptomatic Covid-19. The numbers from J&J’s study are not that high, but it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. One dose of the J&J vaccine was 85% protective against the most severe Covid-19. After adding in moderate cases, the total effectiveness dropped to about 66%.“I don’t think it’s a second-tier vaccine, but we’ve got to avoid that perception,” said Dr. Thomas Balcezak of Yale New Haven Health System.The J&J shot was tested in the US, Latin America and South Africa at a time when more contagious mutated versions of the virus were spreading. That wasn’t the case last fall, when Pfizer and Moderna were wrapping up testing, and it’s not clear if their numbers would hold against the most worrisome of those variants.Importantly, the Food and Drug Administration reported this week that, just like its predecessors, the J&J shot offers strong protection against the worst outcomes. By 28 days after the injection, there were no hospitalizations or deaths in study volunteers given the J&J shot, compared with 16 hospitalizations and seven deaths in those given a dummy shot.Independent advisers to the FDA began daylong discussions Friday on whether to allow widespread use of J&J’s vaccine, setting the stage for a final decision within days.Despite declining cases, hospitalizations and deaths, government scientists warned that circulating variants could slow progress against the pandemic.“We are not out of the woods yet,” said Adam MacNeil of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.If the J&J vaccine is authorized, US officials expect to have only a few million doses to divide between states in initial shipments. But by the end of March, J&J has said it can supply enough to vaccinate 20 million people — a much-needed boost to stretched supplies.The bottom line: “Whatever vaccine is being offered is what you want,” said University of Pennsylvania immunologist E. John Wherry.Still, the nuances of the vaccines raise ethical questions.At Yale, Balcezak is struggling with how to make the best use of the J&J shot's advantages without appearing to target it to underserved populations. For example, it’s a logical choice for homeless shelters where people may have moved on before their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.“I’m very worried about how that would be perceived,” Balcezak said.The J&J vaccine is also easier to handle, lasting three months in the refrigerator compared to the Pfizer and Moderna options, which must be frozen.Balcezak said the Yale system has been working with pastors and other “cultural ambassadors” to answer vaccine questions from minority communities, and likewise will discuss the J&J shot's possibilities.In Washington state, health officials see some clear need for one-and-done vaccinations — including sailors in the maritime industry, who can spend months on cargo and fishing vessels.“This is the ideal vaccine for them,” said Dr. Scott Lindquist of the Washington State Department of Health. With the two-dose vaccines, the state “had to send second doses onward to the next port of call.”Other parts of the world already are facing which-is-best challenges. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, for instance, is cleared for use in Britain and Europe after data suggested it was about 70% effective.Italy’s government recently decided to reserve Pfizer and Moderna shots for the elderly and designate the AstraZeneca vaccine for younger, at-risk workers, sparking protest from the country’s main teachers’ union. Canada became the latest country Friday to allow use of AstraZeneca's vaccine.In the US, health officials say it's critical for the government to send a clear message.“Right now, it’s not vaccine against vaccine, it’s vaccine against virus,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-us-vaccine-could-raise-question-which-covid-19-shots-are-best-101614356398255.html
26-02-2021||World||US justice department pledges to probe, as attacks on Asian Americans increase||The US Justice Department said on Friday it would investigate the rising tide of hate crimes in America, as Asian Americans have experienced a growing number of racially motivated attacks since former President Donald Trump began referring to Covid-19 as a "China virus."“The United States is currently facing unprecedented challenges, some of which are fueling increased bigotry and hatred," said Pamela Karlan, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.She added that her office is working with the FBI, federal prosecutors and local police to "evaluate possible hate crimes," without providing further details.A Justice Department official told Reuters the statement was a direct response to the increasing reports of violence against Asian Americans.From March of 2020 to December of last year, there were more than 2,800 reported incidents of anti-Asian hate incidents in the United States, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that has been collecting data.While verbal harassment has made up more than 70 per cent of the incidents, more than 8 per cent involved physical assaults.In one such example, a surveillance video that has since gone viral showed a 91-year-old Asian man in Oakland, California, being shoved to the ground on Jan. 31.A suspect in the attack was later arrested, and now faces multiple assault charges for a number of Chinatown incidents. Prosecutors are also investigating whether the attacks were racially motivated.Another high-profile example includes the January murder of Vichar Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old immigrant from Thailand who was shoved to the ground in San Francisco and never regained consciousness after the fall.San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin has since charged a suspect in Ratanapakdee's death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-department-pledges-to-probe-as-attacks-on-asian-americans-increase-101614356449691.html
26-02-2021||World||Nepal cabinet recommends President to call meeting of reinstated Lower House on March 7||The cabinet meeting called by the Nepal Prime Minister (caretaker) KP Sharma Oli on Friday has recommended President Bidya Devi Bhandari to call a meeting of the reinstated Lower House on March 7.The meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence in Baluwatar."Meeting has made a recommendation to call the meeting of the lower house (House of Representatives) on March 7. Apart from the date for calling on the meeting of house, other agendas related to ministries were also discussed," Shivamaya Tumbahangphe, Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation told ANI.The meeting comes after the Nepal Supreme Court had reinstated the House of Representatives (HoR) and directed the government to summon a session of the country's Lower House of Parliament within 13 days.The country's top court also decided to cancel all decisions that the incumbent Oli government took after December 20, the day when the House of Representatives was dissolved.The SC deemed Oli's move to dissolve the House as "unconstitutional", thereby overturning the decision, according to The Himalayan Times.As many as 13 writ petitions were filed in the apex court against the Oli-government's move. The court had earlier summoned all the writ petitioners for the final verdict, The Himalayan Times reported further.Kathmandu has been marred by anti-government protests on a daily basis which has been growing significantly over the period of time starting from December 20 when Oli dissolved the parliament.This move by Oli which has been called unconstitutional and challenged in court has split the ruling party and led to the expulsion of now caretaker PM from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-cabinet-recommends-president-to-call-meeting-of-reinstated-lower-house-101614354973495.html
26-02-2021||World||Caribbean countries ask wealthy nations to share vaccine supply||The 15-country Caribbean Community has asked wealthy nations to share their supply of Covid-19 vaccines, saying their economies won’t be able to recover from the pandemic without them.In a statement issued late Thursday, CARICOM said it was “dissatisfied and deeply concerned about the inequitable access to vaccines” it was facing.While members states belong to the World Health Organizations’ COVAX Facility, the only vaccines received so far have been 170,000 shots that the government of India donated to Dominica and Barbados, the group said. Those two nations have been sharing their supply with other CARICOM members.Even with the addition of the COVAX vaccines, CARICOM will only be able to cover about 20% of its needs, the group said. Some members have also been trying to broker deals through the African Union’s Medical Supplies Platform.In a not-so subtle reference to the U.S. and Europe, CARICOM said that nations that drive tourism in the Caribbean -- and host the Caribbean diaspora -- should share their shots “given the immediacy of the need.”CARICOM members include some of the most tourism-dependent nations on the planet, including Barbados, Belize and Saint Lucia, and access to vaccines is seen as vital to reopening their economies.“This limited supply will not allow us to attain the regional herd immunity, so necessary to fuel the resilient recovery that we are seeking,” CARICOM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/caribbean-countries-ask-wealthy-nations-to-share-vaccine-supply-101614354087515.html
26-02-2021||World||US conducts first military operation under Biden, hits Iran-backed groups in Syria||In the first military action conducted under President Joe Biden, the US on Thursday carried out airstrikes against Iran-backed militant groups in eastern Syria in retaliation for recent attacks on American and coalition personnel in Iraq.“At President Joe Biden’s direction, US military forces, earlier this evening, launched airstrikes against infrastructure utilised by Iranian-backed militant groups in eastern Syria,” John Kirby, the US defence department spokesperson, said in a statement. He added that the strikes had “destroyed multiple facilities located at a border control point used by a number of Iranian-backed militant groups including Kait’ib Hezbollah and Kait’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (which had previously claimed responsibility for attacks on US forces)”. The US had not released any casualty figures or estimates. But a war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, has said 22 members of the militant groups were killed and the toll could climb because some of the others had suffered severe injuries.Kirby said the US military operation was in response to “recent attacks against American and coalition personnel in Iraq” and was “proportionate”, and conducted alongside diplomatic measure, including consultations with coalition partners.A civilian contractor with the US-led military coalition was killed and a US service personnel was among six people injured in a rocket attack on an airport in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, last week. US troops have a military facility adjacent to the airport.A pro-Iran militant group that calls itself “Saraya Awliya Al-Dam” had claimed responsibility. Other Iran-backed groups have carried out attacks on US personnel and facilities in the past, as tensions have escalated in the region between US and Iranian forces directly and with Iran’s proxies.Analysts had called the Erbil attack as an early test for the Biden administration’s foreign policy in the region, specially as it seeks to re-engage with Iran on the 2015 nuclear deal — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — that the US had left under former President Donald Trump.Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote at the time in an article in Politico that President Biden is “squarely in the middle of a major foreign policy test as president, and while it has gone largely unremarked inside the US, the Middle East is watching closely to see how he responds to an attack on US forces”.Biden responded with airstrikes. Kirby said the US military operation sends “an unambiguous message: President Biden will act to protect American and Coalition personnel. At the same time, we have acted in a deliberate manner that aims to de-escalate the overall situation in both eastern Syria and Iraq”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-conducts-first-military-operation-under-biden-hits-iran-backed-groups-in-syria-101614355619802.html
26-02-2021||World||Half a million US chicks euthanised after storm hits Texas||On top of power blackouts and burst water pipes, the disastrous snow and ice storm in Texas last week could mean higher chicken prices for Americans.The severe weather forced Sanderson Farms Inc., the third-biggest US chicken producer, to euthanize 545,000 baby chicks at hatcheries in the state. Over 700,000 eggs were also destroyed. That means fewer pounds of chicken reaching grocery stores in the coming months.The chicken struggles add to increasing costs to feed the animals, a signal that consumers likely will be paying more for poultry just as a nascent economic recovery boosts meat sales.“It’s definitely going to take some production out away from us,” Chief Executive Officer Joe Sanderson said Thursday in an investor call, adding that the loss equals about 1% of the company’s output.While it’s unclear how many chicken producers experienced losses, even small percentage changes in supply can move the market, and prices have already been gaining.Shares for the company climbed as much as 4.5% after it reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings of 42 cents a share, beating the average estimate of analysts for a 49-cent loss and a $1.76 loss a year ago. Shares have climbed about 18% so far this year.Fast-food restaurants have been promoting new chicken sandwiches and other products, a strong point for meat producers. Prices for boneless chicken breast meat produced for restaurants moved “significantly higher” in January and February due to the trend, the CEO said.Meanwhile, Sanderson is balking at prices for grains that it needs to feed chickens. The company delayed purchases of some corn and soybean meal, which are the most expensive in six years due to China ramping up American imports. The Chinese buying is leaving fewer supplies for domestic feeders such as Sanderson, and the higher prices are eating away at profit margins.The company said it secured feed through March. The full impact of pricier feed will be felt in the coming months, the company said. In the meantime, they’re raising prices to offset the added costs.Right now, “the price on poultry products is taking care of that higher feed cost,” the CEO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-a-million-us-chicks-euthanised-after-storm-hits-texas-101614352377328.html

It has signed an agreement for delivery of COVAXIN during Q2 (April to June) and Q3 (July to September) (of) 2021," the company said in a statement.It added, "There is a strong interest in Covaxin from many countries around the world, and the company is fully committed to ensuring supplies promptly and efficiently."In January, India dispatched two million doses of Covishield vaccines to Brazil. Covishield has been developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and is being manufactured by Serum Institute of India.Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi by saying "dhanyavaad" for supplying the "sanjeevni booti" (the vaccine) against the coronavirus to the South American country, which has reported the second-highest death toll from the Covid-19 disease in the world.Earlier, the Brazilian President said that it was an honour to have India as a "great partner" against the "global obstacle.""Namaskar, Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) @narendramodi. Brazil feels honoured to have a great partner to overcome a global obstacle by joining efforts," Bolsonaro wrote in a tweet."Thank you for assisting us with the vaccines exports from India to Brazil.

Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said that the total includes, 67.5 lakh doses supplied under grant assistance 294.44 lakh doses under various commercial contracts."We will continue to supply these vaccines in the coming weeks and months in a phased manner," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bharat-biotech-confirms-deal-with-brazil-for-20-million-doses-of-covaxin-101614351190269.html
26-02-2021||World||US judge in Google case disturbed that even ‘Incognito’ users are tracked||When Google users browse in “Incognito” mode, just how hidden is their activity? The Alphabet Inc. unit says activating the stealth mode in Chrome, or “private browsing” in other browsers, means the company won’t “remember your activity.” But a judge with a history of taking Silicon Valley giants to task about their data collection raised doubts Thursday about whether Google is being as forthright as it needs to be about the personal information it’s collecting from users. At a hearing Thursday in San Jose, California, US District Judge Lucy Koh said she’s “disturbed” by Google’s data collection practices as described in a class-action lawsuit that says the company’s private browsing promises is a “ruse.” The suit seeks $5,000 in damages for each of the millions of people whose privacy has been compromised since June of 2016.Weighing Google’s attempt to get the suit dismissed, Koh said she finds it “unusual” that the company would make the “extra effort” of data collection if it doesn’t use the information to build user profiles or targeted advertising. Google has become a target of antitrust complaints in the last year filed by state and federal officials -- as well as businesses -- accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising and online search. Koh has a deeper history with the company as a vocal critic of its privacy policies. She forced Google in one notable case to disclose its scanning of emails to build profiles and target advertising.In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.Company DisclosureGoogle argues that every time people use Chrome’s private browsing mode, a full-page notice makes clear that other people who use the device won’t see their activity -- but that it may still be visible to, among others, websites they visit and their internet service provider. Andrew Schapiro, a lawyer for Google, said the company’s privacy policy “expressly discloses” its practices. “The data collection at issue is disclosed,” he said. Another lawyer for Google, Stephen Broome, said website owners who contract with the company to use its analytics or other services are well aware of the data collection described in the suit.Broome’s attempt to downplay the privacy concerns by pointing out that the federal court system’s own website uses Google services ended up backfiring.The judge demanded an explanation “about what exactly Google does,” while voicing concern that visitors to the court’s website are unwittingly disclosing information to the company.“I want a declaration from Google on what information they’re collecting on users to the court’s website, and what that’s used for,” Koh told the company’s lawyers.

The UN human rights agency had earlier this month called on both protesting farmers and authorities to exercise “maximum restraint” and find “equitable solutions”.The UN high commissioner for human rights was also critical of action taken by Indian authorities against journalists covering the protests and efforts to curb freedom of expression on social media. She also said UNHRC was monitoring the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, where restrictions on communications continued to be a concern.“In India, continued protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers highlight the importance of ensuring laws and policies are based on meaningful consultations with those concerned,” Bachelet said in her address.“I trust that ongoing dialogue efforts by both sides will lead to an equitable solution to this crisis that respects the rights of all,” she said.“Charges of sedition against journalists and activists for reporting or commenting on the protests, and attempts to curb freedom of expression on social media, are disturbing departures from essential human rights principles,” Bachelet added.The government’s handling of the farmers’ protest, which began on November 26 last year, has been criticised by celebrities, lawmakers and political leaders in several countries. The government has defended the three new laws as necessary for long overdue reforms in the agricultural sector. After several rounds of unsuccessful negotiations with the government, the unions backing the protest intensified their agitation by organising a tractor rally in the capital on January 26 that descended into violence and chaos.Bachelet said UNHRC is continuing to monitor the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, “where restrictions on communications, and clampdowns on civil society activists, remain of concern”. She added, “Despite recent restoration of 4G access for mobile phones, the communications blockade has seriously hampered civic participation, as well as business, livelihoods, education, and access to healthcare and medical information.”Raids against human rights defenders in October and November “exemplify the continued restrictions on civil society”, and have an impact on the rights of Kashmiri people to “impart and receive information, and to engage in free, open debate on government policies affecting them”, she said.Bachelet also described internet access in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as a “serious problem” that had prompted student protests in the past year.She, however, lauded a pilot programme in Kerala, where officials, civil society organisations and community leaders have used innovative technology to ensure that the “voices of marginalised and poor people are heard, and their needs addressed, in the pandemic response”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Bachelet’s remarks.Turning to Pakistan, Bachelet said the unequal status of women continues to lead to “widespread denial of their rights, from education to the right to make decisions about their own lives; excessive maternal mortality; poverty, and high levels of violence and sexual violence against women and girls”.Last year, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) found “persistent discriminatory stereotypes" and expressed concern at the prevalence of child marriage and forced marriage, as well as so-called “honour” crimes, in Pakistan.“Women from religious minority communities are particularly vulnerable to forced marriage accompanied by forced conversion. I urge Pakistan to support and protect women human rights defenders and journalists who are at the forefront of efforts to promote legal and societal change,” she said.While China has made strong progress over the past year in reducing prevalence of Covid-19 and its severe impact on a broad range of human rights, fundamental rights and civic freedoms continue to be curtailed in the name of national security and the pandemic response, Bachelet said.“Activists, lawyers and human rights defenders – as well as some foreign nationals – face arbitrary criminal charges, detention or unfair trials. In the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, more than 600 people are being investigated for participating in various forms of protests – some under the new National Security Law,” she said.In Xinjiang, information in the public domain shows the need for “independent and comprehensive assessment of the human rights situation” and the high commissioner’s office continues to assess alleged patterns of human rights violations, including reports of arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and sexual violence in institutions, coercive labour practises, and erosion of social and cultural rights, she said.“I am confident that through our ongoing dialogue we will find mutually agreeable parameters for my visit to China,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-protest-shows-need-for-laws-in-sync-with-stakeholders-un-rights-chief-101614349607939.html
26-02-2021||World||Former Spanish king pays 4.4 million euros to tax agency||A law firm representing Juan Carlos I says that the former Spanish monarch has paid close to 4.4 million euros ($5.33 million) to the country's tax authorities in his latest attempt to regularize past undeclared income.The revelation prompted a new rebuke to the 83-year-old former king from the country's prime minister. Pedro Sánchez said Friday that he rejected the "uncivil behavior" of Juan Carlos, but fully supported the current monarch, King Felipe VI.The former monarch, who has been living abroad for more than half a year after media revealed fresh allegations of financial misdeeds, already filed for settlement for another tax debt in December for covert donations made to him between 2016 and 2018. That resulted in the payment of more than 678,000 euros including interest and a fine.Juan Carlos' lawyer, Javier Sánchez-Junco, said in a statement Friday that the latest tax debt relates to the payments that a private foundation, Zagatka, made on behalf of the former king for “several travel expenses and other services."The Liechtenstein-based foundation is owned by Álvaro de Orleans, a businessman and distant cousin of Juan Carlos who has publicly admitted having funded some of the former monarch's private expenses. Payments-in-kind are subject to taxes under Spanish law.Leading Spanish newspaper El País and online news website El Español, which first reported the new tax settlement, said that the foundation paid for flights with a private jet company for more than a decade up to 2018.The lawyer's statement said that the payment of overdue taxes plus interests and “surcharges” was voluntary and that tax authorities had not asked for it. The former monarch's tax obligations “have been regularized," it said. Under Spanish law, confessing to undeclared income and paying the outstanding taxes allows offenders to avoid being charged with tax evasion.The former king is the target of official investigations in Spain and Switzerland for possible financial wrongdoing. One of them involves possible kickbacks in a high-speed railway contract in Saudi Arabia.Those investigations prompted him to leave Spain in August for the United Arab Emirates. He has been photographed there in a luxurious hotel where Spanish media say he's living as a guest of Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed.The Royal Palace declined to comment on the new developments. King Felipe VI, who rose to the Spanish throne after Juan Carlos’ abdication in 2014, has distanced himself from his father.Felipe and Tax Minister María Jesús Montero avoided any comments on the latest development when both attended a previously scheduled business award ceremony Friday.Speaking to reporters at the government palace, Prime Minister Sánchez said Friday that Felipe's reign had been “a turning point in favor of exemplarity, transparency and proper use of public resources."“The current king,” the prime minister said, “has all my support.”But Juan Carlos’ scandals have emboldened those who want the monarchy abolished and deepened division in Sánchez's Socialist-led government. His junior coalition partner, the far-left United We Can party, has called for legal changes to improve the state’s oversight of the crown and on Friday demanded full disclosure of the tax agency's dealings with the former king.Sánchez admitted that the revelations cast a shadow on Juan Carlos himself but didn't question the monarchy as an institution.“I am going to reject, as do most Spanish citizens, this uncivil behavior,” Sánchez said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-king-pays-4-4-million-euros-to-spanish-tax-agency-101614349246204.html

We will continue to work to hold Russia accountable for its abuses and aggression in Ukraine," Biden said.The Biden administration has said still conducting its foreign policy reviews regarding Russia, China and other key areas after taking the reins from former Republican President Donald Trump on Jan. 20.Biden, a Democrat, spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month and pressed him on a range of issues, including Ukraine's sovereignty as well as Moscow's jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, alleged interference in the 2020 US election and the massive cyber hack against the US government last year.The White House in recent days said it will respond to Russia in coming weeks over the SolarWinds hack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-hold-russia-accountable-over-crimea-annexation-says-biden-101614348374399.html

Singh represents the riding (constituency) of Burnaby South in Canada’s House of Commons.Under the banner of Concerned Citizens of Burnaby, BC, they gave a memorandum to Singh’s staff, calling upon him to monitor and analyse hate speech against Hindus across Canadian schools, institutions, workplaces, and social media; address the root causes of “hate against Hindus arising from the Khalistani movement”; engage and support victims of hate speech and mitigate the current situation; mediate and build coalitions between Sikh and Hindu groups and protect and support the Hindus of Canada and stop these hateful attacks against them. Members of the community in Canada have in recent weeks reported multiple incidents of threats and intimidation of the Hindu community by pro-Khalistan elements.“Khalistan-supporting organisations are working under the pretext of the farmers’ rights movement in India. The discourse against the Indian government is being weaponised for political gain with incendiary rhetoric that stigmatises and dehumanises Hindus in Canada,” the protesters said in their memorandum to Singh. “Your silence can signal indifference to bigotry and intolerance, even as the situation escalates and vulnerable Hindus become victims to violence.” Organisers of a recent Tiranga rally in Vancouver had faced threats and even protest by those carrying Khalistan flags.One of the protestors standing in front Singh’s office said, “We are not against the farmers’ movement, but this movement has now turned into a Khalistani movement, which is targeting Hindu visible minorities and we expect our leaders to protect everyone without any racial discrimination.”Singh has been among the most vocal Canadian politicians in supporting those protesting the Indian farm laws. He recently appeared on the talk show A Little Late with Lilly Singh and discussed the issue. On January 29, after the events on Republic Day in New Delhi, Singh tweeted, “I am deeply concerned about the violence against farmers in India. Those calling to harm farmers must be held accountable and the right to peaceful protest must be protected I am calling on (Canadian Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau to condemn the violence, immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indocanadians-protest-attacks-over-stance-on-india-s-farm-reforms-101614348719182.html
26-02-2021||World||Soaring US incomes help drive biggest spending gain since June||US personal incomes soared in January as Americans received another round of pandemic-relief checks, helping to re-charge the economy with the strongest spending advance in seven months.The 10% gain in incomes exceeded forecasts followed a 0.6% gain in December, a Commerce Department report showed Friday. Purchases increased 2.4% from the prior month, following a downwardly revised 0.4% decline in December.The surge in incomes, and expectations of even more stimulus, is seen providing additional fuel for consumers at a time of pent-up demand in the wake of pandemic-related disruptions to the service economy.The January increase reflects the $900 billion pandemic aid package passed in December. The bill provided direct checks to millions of Americans and supplemented jobless benefits with an extra $300 a week payment. While many have saved the government support, the robust increase in spending shows others are spending it.Lawmakers are moving forward with President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion aid plan that has the potential to drive even more income growth. Another round of stimulus checks paired with a child tax credit and an increase in weekly unemployment benefit payments would buoy disposable income in the coming months.The personal saving rate rose to 20.5%, the highest since May.Government transfer payments rose 52% in January from the prior month, reflecting both stimulus checks and the supplemental $300 weekly jobless benefit payments.Inflation-adjusted personal spending rose 2% after a 0.8% decline. Goods spending jumped 5.1%, while outlays for services advanced 0.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soaring-us-incomes-help-drive-biggest-spending-gain-since-june-101614347718427.html

26-02-2021||World||Two rights groups quit Hong Kong as security law sends shudders through NGOs||At least two political rights groups advocating democracy have quietly quit Hong Kong and moved overseas, unnerved by a national security law that has fanned fears over the erosion of freedoms under China’s rule, sources told Reuters.In the past, China-focused rights groups had valued the wide-ranging autonomy, including freedom of speech and assembly, guaranteed for Hong Kong when control over the former British colony was returned to Beijing in 1997.But some non-government organisations (NGOs) say the new legislation means they face a choice of either having to leave Hong Kong or work with the same kind of fears and constraints they would encounter in mainland China.The New School for Democracy moved to Taiwan in September, two months after Beijing imposed the contentious security law on its freest city. Founded by Wang Dan, an exiled student leader of the crushed 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the group focuses on bringing together activists from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in order to promote democracy in Chinese society."Our organisation often criticises the Chinese government, and we participate in Hong Kong's democracy fight," Xing Zhong, the group's secretary-general, told Reuters. "We were quite concerned about the safety of our staff."Another reason the NGO has moved, according to a source with direct knowledge, is that the NGO receives sizable funding from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a Washington-based group that pro-Beijing newspapers Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao often label as a subversive agency.Wang declined to say whether his group received funding from NED, but said the authorities could now bar groups like his from having access to funds."Bank accounts opened by NGOs in Hong Kong banks are in danger of being frozen at any moment," Wang said, noting that authorities in Hong Kong had blocked the accounts of leading pro-democracy activists."That is why I believe that Hong Kong today is no longer suitable for the existence and activities of NGOs."The Hong Kong government said concerns over the "erosion of freedoms" under the national security law were totally "unsubstantiated and unwarranted."Under the broadly-defined security legislation, crimes such as subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorism can be punished with up to life in jail.Since the law was implemented in June, scores of pro-democracy activists have been arrested, legislators disqualified and books removed from library shelves as part of a sweeping crackdown on dissent.ARTICLE 54Concerns over funding for NGOs have also intensified.Global Innovation Hub, a unit of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, a German think-tank that was expelled from China in 1997, also moved to Taiwan in September, citing safety concerns for staff.The group, which promotes liberal democratic values without being specifically focused on China, has close ties to Germany's Free Democratic Party, and feared that it could have been considered a "foreign agent" under the new security law.Anna Marti, the head of Global Innovation Hub, told Reuters that Taiwan was now the best place in the region for the group to work on topics such as the digitalisation of democracy.Marti said the national security law had weakened a confidentiality "firewall" that had previously protected staff.Some groups have switched to more secure forms of communication such as encrypted messaging platforms like ProtonMail and Signal, while also enhancing their cyber security protocols, according to NGO staffers.Article 54 of the law authorises the national security bureau in Hong Kong "to strengthen the management of and services" of NGOs, a vague clause that critics say mirrors legislation introduced by Beijing in 2017 to give authorities more power to regulate the activities of foreign NGOs in the mainland."That's worrying," commented an independent human rights researcher who declined to be named, saying it could "effectively silence many NGOs" fearful of criticising the government.Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have become more cautious about signing joint statements, vetting their words carefully to avoid risks, 10 sources within Hong Kong's NGO community told Reuters.Roseann Rife, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Operations, said the group had no intention of leaving Hong Kong, while noting the extra risk stemming from the new legislation."The national security law defines its offences very imprecisely," Rife said. "And it is therefore difficult to have legal certainty about how one might be violating it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-rights-groups-quit-hong-kong-as-security-law-sends-shudders-through-ngos-101614344949287.html
26-02-2021||World||Climate pledges for 2030 put world far off 1.5 degree Celsius goal, warns UN||Updated plans to reduce emissions, submitted so far by about 75 nations ahead of November's COP26 summit, barely make a dent in the huge cuts needed to meet global climate goals, the UN climate chief said on Friday, calling for redoubled efforts.A UN report summarising the revised climate action plans - covering about 40% of countries in the 2015 Paris Agreement and 30% of planet-heating emissions - said they would deliver a combined emissions reduction of only 0.5% from 2010 levels by 2030."That simply is not good enough," said Patricia Espinosa, urging governments - including those that have already updated their plans - to come up with larger promised cuts before COP26.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said global emissions must fall by about 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels to give the world a good chance of limiting the rise in average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.Under the Paris accord, nearly 200 countries pledged to keep warming to "well below" 2C, and strive for a ceiling of 1.5C.So far, the planet has heated up by about 1.2C, bringing worsening extreme weather and rising seas.Espinosa said the synthesis report made clear "current levels of climate ambition are very far from putting nations on a pathway" to meet the 1.5C goal."It is incredible to think that just when nations are facing a (climate) emergency that could eventually end human life on this planet ... many are sticking to their business-as-usual approach," she told journalists.But if governments invest trillions of dollars in planned spending to revive their economies from Covid-19 on green, climate-resilient measures, "we stand a chance of changing the trajectory," she added.Espinosa emphasised that the report released on Friday was just a "snapshot" of climate action plans to date and another more complete assessment would be compiled before COP26.Many countries missed a 2020 deadline to submit stronger climate action plans because of disruption caused by the pandemic, with the COP26 summit in Glasgow postponed for a year.The 75 countries that did submit revised plans on time include COP26 host Britain and the 27 member states of the European Union, which are covered by one EU-wide plan.PRESSURE GROWINGChile's Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, who presided over the COP25 summit in Madrid in 2019, said the report "clearly indicated that significant work must be done, in particular by major emitters".Only two of the 18 largest emitters - Britain and the European Union - had so far presented an updated "nationally determined contribution" (NDC) containing a "strong increase" in their emissions reduction targets, she noted."Other major emitters either submitted NDCs presenting a very low increase in their ambition level or have not presented NDCs yet," she added in a statement.Niklas Höhne, who set up a tracker for national climate policies as a founding partner of the NewClimate Institute, said countries that had not boosted ambition in their new plans could be described as "violating the spirit of the Paris Agreement".The accord calls on governments to voluntarily deliver more ambitious climate plans every five years, starting in 2020.But the updated NDCs of Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and Vietnam fail that test, according to Climate Action Tracker, which is separate from the UN research report."It is a very, very small change that has happened so far, in comparison to the huge gap there is," Höhne said.The United States is due to announce its much-anticipated new 2030 emissions reduction target before a world leaders' climate summit hosted by President Joe Biden on April 22.Experts say China and India could announce new goals there too, and Japan plans to increase its 2030 target before COP26.Helen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, noted that more than half of G20 nations had now made commitments for net-zero emissions by mid-century but few had set 2030 interim targets in line with that.Those that did set bold targets last year - including Colombia, Argentina, Britain and the European Union - were now being overshadowed by those falling behind, she said."These laggards must stop fiddling while the world burns. It is in the interest of their own people and their economies to address the climate crisis, which knows no boundaries," she said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Friday's report "a red alert for our planet" and urged major climate-polluting countries to offer "much more ambitious" 2030 emissions reduction targets well before COP26."Long-term commitments must be matched by immediate actions to launch the decade of transformation that people and planet so desperately need," he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-pledges-for-2030-put-world-far-off-1-5-degree-celcius-goal-warns-un-101614344932198.html

The terms are similar to those in existing state-backed lending programs.The plan will replace Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans, its counterpart for large companies, CLBILS, and the fully state-backed Bounce Back Loans, which have lent a combined 73 billion pounds ($102 billion) to struggling companies. Sunak delivers the U.K. budget on March 3.The Treasury said in December that it was working on a successor to the current loans programs. It was keen to replace the Bounce Back Loans in particular, amid warnings that they’re susceptible to fraud. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said in December that taxpayers could be on the hook for about 26 billion pounds of loans that may never be repaid because of fraud or because companies can’t afford to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sunak-to-unveil-new-covid-recovery-loans-for-uk-businesses-101614340653805.html
26-02-2021||World||Trump's hold on Republican Party on display as conservatives gather in Florida||Donald Trump's hold on the Republican Party will be on full display as an annual gathering of prominent US conservatives starts in earnest on Friday, with a key question being whether the former president will run again in four years.Prominent congressional conservatives including Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley, and Representatives Steve Scalise and Matt Gaetz are among the Trump loyalists expected to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, which Trump will address on Sunday.Trump's tumultuous final weeks in office saw his supporters launch a deadly attack on the US Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to block Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory, a win that Trump falsely claimed was tainted by widespread fraud.A total of 17 members of his party in Congress voted to impeach or convict him for inciting insurrection, although the Senate vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict. Some prominent Republicans including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted Trump for his role in sparking the conflagration, but more members still voice support for him.Trump also faces legal challenges, with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office conducting a criminal investigation of his family-run Trump Organization.Some advisers say they want Trump not to use his speech to relitigate the election at length but instead offer a road map to Republicans' taking back control of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2022 congressional elections."Obviously he will talk about his belief that the election had major problems in it," said one Trump adviser. "However, I believe and I hope that he pivots to how we fight Biden’s socialist agenda for America and hope that it will be about the future, not the past."Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, told reporters in the Capitol that he expected Trump to talk about his policy achievements, the drawbacks of Biden’s approach to immigration and energy and to lay out a hopeful future for his "America First" agenda.Graham said he told Trump it "would be a big mistake" to focus on the past election. Asked whether he thought Trump would follow that advice, Graham responded: "We'll see."2024 Candidacy?Trump, 74, is expected to dangle the possibility of running for president again in 2024, a prospect that complicates life for other Republican presidential hopefuls including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Vice President Mike Pence.Pence, who was in the Capitol with his family when rioters stormed in chanting: "Hang Mike Pence!" is not expected to attend this year's CPAC.Trump had repeatedly said Pence had the power to stop the certification of the election results, even though he did not.CPAC is an event organized by the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, is close to Trump. It is a prime venue for speakers who want to gauge interest in whether they should run for president based on the enthusiasm they generate.The list of speakers on Friday includes Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another potential 2024 candidate.Many Republicans think Trump will flirt with another run to freeze the 2024 field but believe he will ultimately opt out of running. Trump himself has mused privately to advisers that he would like to run."I wouldn't expect him to announce anything definitive," said a second Trump adviser. "There’s a lot of wait and see right now among those who are mentioned as probable candidates. But I think they’re all smart enough to know that they have to wait and see. They know they can’t compete against the former president."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-hold-on-republican-party-on-display-as-conservatives-gather-in-florida-101614338204660.html

Britain, France and Germany notably struggled to keep it alive and have been heartened by President Joe Biden’s willingness to bring the US back in.“I am convinced as coordinator of the JCPOA that we do have diplomatic space, a diplomatic window of opportunity to dialogue” in line with Biden’s aims, Borrell said. “We need to use this opportunity and focus on solutions to bring the JCPOA back on track in order for everybody (to fulfil) their commitments.”Iran this week effectively set a deadline to lift the US sanctions within three months, after which it said it would erase surveillance footage of its nuclear facilities. It has also limited some monitoring of its activities, which the EU says are meant to help ensure that Tehran's nuclear work is peaceful.The UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has also reported that Iran has added 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 20% to its stockpile as of Feb. 16 — far past the 3.67% purity allowed under the JCPOA.Borrell said that Iran’s latest moves “are very much concerning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sees-must-not-miss-chance-to-revive-iran-nuclear-deal-101614332874211.html
26-02-2021||World||Chinese court backs publisher calling homosexuality 'psychological disorder'||A court in China's eastern Jiangsu province recently ruled in favour of a publisher that described homosexuality as a "psychological disorder" in a university textbook.According to a copy of the Feb. 9 appeal ruling seen by Reuters, Suyu District Intermediate Court in the city of Suqian said the description resulted from "perceptual differences" and was not a factual error, upholding a judgment made in September last year."I feel at a loss, because they didn't even have a trial, they just handed down the judgment," said the plaintiff, who uses the pseudonym XiXi.In 2017, XiXi had sued Jinan University Press and a company owned by retailer JD.com for publishing and distributing factually incorrect content in the 2013 book on mental health education for university students."The teaching material classifies homosexuality as a psychological disorder, which it isn't," the 24-year-old NGO worker said, adding that she only found out about the ruling on her appeal through her lawyer on Feb. 22."I'm really disappointed, because we are seeing comments that are supporting this judgment."Homosexuality was decategorised as a mental disorder by the Chinese Psychiatric Association in 2001."It's quite damaging to the whole LGBT community, so we are sorely disappointed," said Peng Yanzi, the director of LGBT Rights Advocacy China."I'm not the only one who is disappointed, shocked and angry - the whole LGBT community is - but we also very much admire XiXi because she's spent years legally pursuing this."Jinan University Press and JD.com did not immediately reply to emailed requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-backs-publisher-calling-homosexuality-psychological-disorder-101614334267207.html
26-02-2021||World||UK top court says runaway schoolgirl who joined IS poses 'security risk', cannot return to Britain||A British-born woman who went to Syria as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State should not be allowed to return to Britain to challenge the government taking away her citizenship because she poses a security risk, the UK's Supreme Court ruled on Friday.Shamima Begum left London in 2015 when she was 15 and went to Syria via Turkey with two school friends where she married an IS fighter.Begum, 21, who is being held in a detention camp in Syria, was stripped her of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds, but the Court of Appeal ruled last year she could only have a fair appeal against that decision if she were allowed back to Britain.The country's top court unanimously overturned that decision, meaning that although she can still pursue her appeal against the citizenship decision, she cannot do that in Britain."The right to a fair hearing does not trump all other considerations, such as the safety of the public," said Robert Reed, the President of the Supreme Court. "If a vital public interest makes it impossible for a case to be fairly heard, then the courts cannot ordinarily hear it."Begum's case has been the subject of a heated debate in Britain, pitting those who say she forsook her right to citizenship by travelling to join IS against those who argue she should not be left stateless but rather face trial in Britain.After travelling to Syria, she lived in Raqqa, the capital of the self-declared caliphate, where she remained for four years until she was discovered in a detention camp.She has had three children since leaving Britain, but all the infants have since died, and she is now in the Roj camp, run by Syrian Kurdish authorities, where the UN rights experts said this month conditions were "sub-human".Reed said Begum's appeal should be stayed until she was in a position to play an effective part in it without endangering the public."That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible. But there is no perfect solution to a dilemma of the present kind," he said.Human rights groups said Britain had a duty to bring back Begum and those like her, and prosecute them, rather than making it someone else's problem."Abandoning them in a legal black hole – in Guantanamo-like conditions – is out of step with British values and the interests of justice and security," said Maya Foa, director of campaign group Reprieve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-top-court-says-runaway-schoolgirl-who-joined-is-poses-security-risk-cannot-return-to-britain-101614333644553.html

Media quoted prominent Baluch Sunni Muslim religious leader Molavi Abdulhamid as urging calm and calling for an independent investigation."The body of at least one person was delivered by Pakistan’s border guards. We are reviewing the incident," Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh was quoted as saying by Iranian media.Protesters stormed a governor’s office in southeastern Iran on Tuesday and set fire to a police car, according to videos posted on social media. Security forces used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the footage.Sistan-Baluchistan’s population is predominantly Sunni Muslim, while most Iranians are Shi’ite. Iran has some of the lowest fuel prices in the world and has been fighting smuggling to neighbouring countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-it-s-investigating-shooting-deaths-at-border-with-pakistan-101614331779187.html

They then boarded a rail trolley and pushed themselves for about a kilometer (half a mile) across the border into Russia.Photos posted by the ministry showed embassy staff with their children and suitcases on a trolley. A video showed two people pushing the trolley across a railway bridge.The Interfax news agency reported on Friday morning that the group later took a flight to Moscow from the far-eastern city of Vladivostok.North Korea has claimed to be coronavirus-free, but has sealed its borders and halted passenger traffic with other countries. Outside experts are highly skeptical of the North’s zero-virus case claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-diplomats-leave-north-korea-on-hand-pushed-rail-trolley-101614332654611.html
26-02-2021||World||China’s oil reserves are close to reaching storage capacity||China’s oil stockpiles have risen to around 100 days worth of net imports, making it increasingly challenging to find extra storage tanks and facilities to hold supplies, two people with knowledge of supply levels said.The build-up follows a push by Beijing to buy up crude for its reserves last year when prices crashed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The figure represents government and commercial inventories, said the people who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The reserves fluctuate but have consistently been at or above 100 days worth of imports and rose as high as 120 days recently, one of the people said.Beijing set a goal of increasing government stockpiles to hold at least 90 days of net imports, Bloomberg reported in April last year. That target didn’t include commercial inventories. China’s National Energy Administration didn’t respond to a fax seeking comment.As the world’s largest oil importer a sufficient level of reserves is critical for economic resilience to supply shocks such as a war in the Middle East. The International Energy Agency, which China isn’t part of, recommends that countries have enough crude to cover at least 90 days of net imports.Unlike the US, where data about the nation’s strategic petroleum reserves are updated publicly and regularly, the size of China’s crude stockpiles are shrouded in mystery. There’s also less of a distinction between government reserves and commercial stockpiles, with many of the country’s biggest energy companies being state-owned.China was moving forward with plans to buy up oil for its emergency reserves in April of last year, people familiar the plans said at the time. The initial target was to hold government stockpiles equivalent to 90 days of net imports, which could eventually be expanded to as much as 180 days when including commercial reserves, they said.Last year’s crash in oil prices and China’s rapid rebound from the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic set the stage for a flurry of crude purchases. However, stockpiling has leveled off as oil prices rebounded and storage space runs out, Capital Economics Ltd. said in a note this month. Fuel demand has also fallen this year amid a resurgence of the coronavirus in some parts of China.Emergency reserves, including commercial storage, exceeded 100 days worth of net imports in the third quarter of last year, according to Yuntao Liu, a London-based analyst with Energy Aspects Ltd. “Going forward, as crude prices rise and plants launch seasonal maintenance from April, the need for re-stockpiling is not that urgent.”China’s crude imports averaged 10.9 million barrels a day last year, according to import data compiled by Bloomberg, suggesting current stockpile levels of around 1.09 billion barrel. That aligns with an estimate from market intelligence firm Kayrros that the nation’s oil inventories rose to 1.01 billion barrels in the week through Feb. 14. Stockpiles reached a record of around 1.04 billion barrels in September last year, according to Kayrros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-oil-reserves-are-close-to-reaching-storage-capacity-101614331454375.html
26-02-2021||World||Israel gives half of population at least one Covid shot||Israel has now vaccinated half its population against Covid-19, another milestone on the way to subduing the pandemic.More than 4.6 million people have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, according to Health Ministry data released Friday. With nearly 8% of the country having recovered from the disease and likely developing some resistance to reinfection, that could bring Israel closer to herd immunity.Vaccinating about 60% to 70% of the population should be enough to rein in infections, illness and death, estimates Raina MacIntyre, a professor of biosecurity at the University of New South Wales, based off the latest data from Israel.Hospitals have seen a steady drop in critically ill cases over the past few weeks now that more than 90% of those in the highest risk groups have been vaccinated or have convalesced from infection.The rate of overall spread has also slowed after Israel expanded vaccine eligibility to everyone older than 16 earlier this month. Almost 3.3 million people have been given two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.Israel’s vaccine campaign raced ahead of the world after the government inked a deal with Pfizer in exchange for data on the inoculation program. The government started lifting restrictions on the economy in recent weeks as the load on hospitals began to diminish.Reaching herd immunity will still be a challenge given that 30% of the population is at the moment too young to be vaccinated. That may change depending on the results from clinical trials in kids aged 12-15 by Pfizer and Moderna Inc., which are expected in a few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-gives-half-of-population-at-least-one-covid-shot-101614331710544.html

Skea was also not wearing a mask, which is required in Singapore.Eyamalai, 39, who married Skea in November, was sentenced to one week imprisonment for abetting him.The couple had both pleaded guilty and their lawyer S.S. Dhillon said they would not appeal the sentencing.The city-state has largely brought its coronavirus outbreak under control, with less than a handful of new local cases a day, due to strict quarantining of arrivals, contact-tracing and social distancing.Singapore requires most arrivals to undergo 14 days of quarantine at government-designated hotels. Quarantine violations can be penalised with a fine of up to S$10,000 or up to six months in jail, or both.The island nation has jailed and fined others for breaking Covid-19 rules, while some foreigners have also had their work permits revoked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/briton-jailed-for-breaking-singapore-s-strict-quarantine-rules-fiancee-jailed-for-abetment-101614330768421.html

These violent activities have fallen since their height during the 1982-1993 period when individuals and groups conducted numerous terrorist attacks. The 1985 Air India bombing, which killed 331 people, remains the deadliest terrorist plot ever launched in Canada".Sikhs in Canada are 1.4 per cent of the total population. Ontario, Alberta and Quebec are some of the provinces where the Sikh population is high.Among the Sikh Canadian MPs who openly speak in favour of Khalistan include Jagmeet Singh, the head of the New Democratic Party (NDP).Recently, he shared his video message on Twitter and termed the ongoing farmers' agitation in India as one of the largest protests in history and called on the world leaders to denounce the Indian government's violent response to these peaceful protestors.Khalistani separatists groups have been trying to gain ground through farmers' protests.Furthermore, more than 400 Twitter handles run from Pakistan had been narrowed down by Indian agencies which were active to add fuel to the fire.On January 26 when farmers assembled around Red Fort, members of Khalistani separatist groups staged a protest outside the Indian embassy in Washington DC.The protesters claimed that they had assembled to support the farmers protesting in New Delhi. Many in the mob held so-called 'Khalistan' flags and raised slogans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-to-raise-khalistan-issue-with-canada-during-virtual-trip-101614331184537.html

Her British husband Nigel Skea, 52, was sentenced to two weeks' jail and slapped with a fine of 1,000 Singapore dollar (USD 752), the Channel News Asia reported.In September, Nigel conspired with Eyamalai, his then-fiancee, to meet in a room at a hotel where he was serving a stay-home notice after arriving in Singapore from London.District Judge Jasvender Kaur said it was not harsh for her not to place mitigating weight on the explanation for their breach – that Skea had travelled to propose marriage and they both were overcome by emotions after not seeing each other for a very long time."The fact of the matter is that the restrictions are necessary to prevent the spread of the pandemic," she said."Disruptions to relationships are an inevitable consequence. It requires patience and sacrifice (from) everyone ... for the greater good," the Channel News Asia quoted Judge Kaur as saying.The pair pleaded guilty earlier this month. Skea admitted to two charges of exposing others to risk of infection by leaving his hotel room while on stay-home notice and failing to wear a mask.Eyamalai, who subsequently married Skea, pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring with Skea to breach his stay-home notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-woman-jailed-for-breaching-singapore-s-covid-19-safety-measures-101614330957141.html

26-02-2021||World||Canadian PM slammed for abstaining from Parliament meeting on Uyghur rights||While lauding the Canadian Parliament's recognition of the Uyghur genocide, the US-based Campaign For Uyghurs (CFU) has slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Cabinet for abstaining during the meeting of House of Commons on the matter.In a statement, the CFU expressed disappointment over Trudeau and his Cabinet's abstention from the meeting in the House of Commons."It is a complete disappointment, as the Uyghur Movement has expressed, that the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Cabinet abstained from this decision made by the House of Commons. The abstention of a government and its prime minister to subjecting the Uyghurs to the genocide, which says it is an example to the international public in defending human rights, shows that these claims are in vain," the Uyghur rights group said.Appreciating the Canadian Parliament's move, the group commented that the step is an "encouraging step for both the Canadian Government and other governments to recognize the Uyghur genocide.""In the statement, while it is expected that economic measures will be implemented against Beijing to stop the genocide in line with this decision, the importance of the call to hold the Winter Olympics in another country instead of China in the acceptance of the House of Commons in 2022 is emphasized," it added.The CFU also slammed Europe for forgotting "its 'never again' commitments after the Holocaust."Acknowledging the genocide that China has been perpetrating against the Uyghur people is recognition of the suffering of the Uyghurs and a step towards justice, the Uyghur rights group said that the evidence of genocide is overwhelming in the presence of forced labor schemes, the mass detention of Uyghurs, forced sterilization of Uyghur women, and the forcible transfer of Uyghur children to state-run facilities.While a definition will not bring an immediate end to the sufferings of the Uyghur people, it is a vital step towards addressing them by acknowledging the realities of what is happening, the group further remarked.There should be no further dancing around the issue: Beijing is committing genocide, and those who choose to downplay this are standing on the wrong side of humanity, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-slammed-for-abstaining-from-parliament-meeting-on-uyghur-rights-101614330715213.html

26-02-2021||World||EU told to back vaccine passports or Google may do it anyway||European Union leaders inched toward establishing bloc-wide vaccine certificates to enable countries to reopen to travel as Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that unless they hurry Apple Inc. and Google will step into the vacuum.During a five-hour video call, the EU’s 27 leaders focused on how to haul their nations back to a form of normalcy after a pandemic that’s claimed more than 500,000 lives and shut down large parts of their economies. While there was broad support for certificates of some sort, leaders didn’t agree on the type of privileges they would grant.“We have all agreed that we need vaccine certificates,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters after the talks on Thursday. “In the future, it will certainly be good to have such a certificate but that will not mean that only those who have such a passport will be able to travel; about that, no political decisions have been made yet.”Europe’s leaders have been anxious to find a response after facing criticism for a vaccination program that lagged behind the US and UK There’s also the prospect of a third wave of infections leading again to stricter lockdowns.It was the first such meeting as prime minister of Italy for Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank president. He asked leaders to adopt a more resolute and pragmatic approach to speed up vaccinations and told them the program has to move much faster, according to an official with knowledge of the call.Draghi also called for a tougher approach against companies that don’t respect delivery commitments, suggesting that their exports from the EU could be blocked not only during the period they don’t respect accords, but also for a certain period afterward.The growing support for a digital certificate with common criteria such as vaccination, negative testing or immunity was helped by Merkel seeming to soften her stance on the matter, backing work on such a document, according to two people familiar with her remarks. But von der Leyen urged the group to move faster before US tech companies fill the void.“It is important to have a European solution because otherwise others will go into this vacuum,” she said at a press briefing. “Google and Apple are already offering solutions to the World Health Organization. And this is sensitive information so we want to be very clear here that we offer a European solution.”A spokesperson from the WHO said the organization has taken a software-neutral approach to the development of a vaccination certification and “neither Google nor Apple are involved in this process.”A person familiar with Apple’s position on the matter suggested that von der Leyen had misunderstood the situation. Apple has never discussed a possible vaccine application with the WHO or the EU, the person said on condition of anonymity.“If we as European Union don’t provide a solution, somebody else will, whether it’s going to be the US big tech companies or somebody else, the solution will be provided,” Alex Patelis, chief economic adviser to Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, told Bloomberg. “Let’s get the infrastructure ready.”Countries including Germany and Belgium have come under fire from the EU commission for closing frontiers with other European nations to keep the virus under control. While they said that non-essential travel should be restricted, their summit communique included no new commitments, merely reiterating that shutting borders should be proportionate and non-discriminatory.The convergence on passports comes with the bloc’s tourism-dependent economies, which suffered the steepest contractions last year, determined to open their doors to those who have been inoculated. Other nations, however, have resisted such moves, citing a lack of convincing evidence that vaccination halts transmission as well as concerns over granting certain citizens special privileges and legal considerations.Macron’s ConcernsFrench President Emmanuel Macron was more skeptical during the discussion, voicing concerns about unknowns like the duration of immunity, the infection risk of those who have been vaccinated as well as legal and ethical issues regarding the protection of personal data, two people familiar with his remarks said.“We’ll have, in the end, a harmonious EU approach,” he told reporters. “It’s obvious because there is no other choice.”The summit came after AstraZeneca Plc Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot spoke to the European Parliament and sought to deflect blame for a shortfall in Covid-19 vaccine deliveries to Europe.Soriot said his company would deliver 40 million doses to the EU in the first quarter, with the volume set to rise in coming months. Employees are working around the clock to increase production, but perfecting the process takes time and isn’t without setbacks, he said.“Typically in our industry we have years to refine the process,” he said. “Here we didn’t have that time, we didn’t have that luxury. We had six months.”Rising InfectionsDuring the leaders’ discussion, von der Leyen sought to reassure the group that any vaccine supply shortages will soon be over. According to a slide shown to EU leaders available doses in the following quarters will be sufficient to vaccinate the bulk of the bloc’s population by the end of September. Draghi wasn’t convinced, according to another official, saying deliveries in the second and third quarters couldn’t be predicted.Concerns over the vaccine rollout come as governments are again grappling with rising numbers of infections. Paris is among 20 French regions potentially facing tougher Covid-19 restrictions from next week as cases jump, Prime Minister Jean Castex said.The government has asked health authorities to closely monitor the situation in the capital and other districts as it seeks to avoid a third nationwide lockdown, Castex said on Thursday. While France has seen an average of about 20,000 new cases a day since December, and intensive-care occupancy recently showed a slight gain to 67%, there’s an increasingly pronounced regional variation.“A lockdown is a tool that we have to resort to when we can’t do anything else,” Castex told a weekly news conference in Paris. “We must do everything to put it off and allow the vaccines time to have an effect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-told-to-back-vaccine-passports-or-google-may-do-it-anyway-101614329587250.html
26-02-2021||World||Sri Lanka ends forced cremations of Covid-19 victims after Imran Khan's visit||Amidst mounting international criticism, Sri Lanka has revised a controversial mandatory order to cremate the bodies of Covid-19 victims, which denied minority communities, including Muslims, their religious rights.The government on Thursday revised a gazette notification issued in April last year. The new notification has allowed both burials and cremations.For 10 months, Muslim and Christian minorities in the country and international rights groups have been lobbying the government to end the policy of forced cremations.The government was resisting calls to allow burials citing health concerns. It cited the opinion of some experts who claimed that the burial of Covid-19 victims would contaminate the water table thereby spreading the pandemic further.The country had earlier come under intense criticism from rights groups, including the UNHRC, over the cremation order.They said it failed to respect the religious feelings of the victims and their family members, especially of the Muslims, Catholics and some Buddhists.The cremation of bodies is forbidden in Islam.The decision to end forced cremations followed the visit of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.The Muslim minority leaders, who met Khan, said the decision to allow burials was linked to Sri Lanka seeking the support of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) at the ongoing UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva.Sri Lanka is due to face a fresh resolution, which would pin the island to achieve reconciliation through a credible accountability mechanism over its human rights record.Pakistan is a member of the OIC.The OIC nations had appealed in Geneva when the sessions began to reverse the forced cremations decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-ends-forced-cremations-of-covid-19-victims-after-imran-khan-s-visit-101614329298931.html

Kitazumi's phone, listed on his company's website, was unreachable.Myanmar has been roiled by protests for weeks since the army seized power from elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and detained her and most of her government.Kitazumi is the second foreigner known to have been detained since the coup.The first foreigner arrested was Australian academic Sean Turnell, an adviser to Aung San Suu Kyi on economic reforms and the most prominent international expert on Myanmar’s financial system.Kitazumi's company produces video content, from news to movie trailers, and trains journalists with emphasis on free speech, his company says on its website.Earlier on Friday, Kitazumi wrote a Facebook post titled "Peace," saying many of Myanmar's citizens were out on the streets despite the bloodshed and were thankful to the Japanese for their support of the protesters.Kitazumi left the Nikkei in 2012 after having worked as a reporter from 2001, a representative of the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-police-detain-japanese-journalist-at-yangon-protest-says-colleague-101614329170729.html
26-02-2021||World||Iraq's scattered Christians ask 'should I stay or go?' as their struggles persist||A jihadist message, "Islamic State endures", is still graffitied on the front gate of Thanoun Yahya, an Iraqi Christian from the northern city of Mosul, scrawled by Islamist militants who occupied his home for three years when they ruled the city.He refuses to remove it, partly in defiance of the militants who were eventually beaten by Iraqi forces, but also as a reminder that Iraq's scattered and dwindling Christian community still lives a precarious existence."They're gone, they can't hurt us," said the 59-year-old, sitting in his home which he reclaimed when Islamic State was driven out in 2017. "But there aren't many of us left. The younger generation want to leave."The stark choice facing many Christians in Muslim-majority Iraq will be highlighted during the first ever papal visit to the Biblical nation. Pope Francis's trip runs from March 5-8 and will include a stop in Mosul.Yahya sold the family's metalwork shop to pay a ransom for his brother, kidnapped by al Qaeda militants in 2004 at a time when Christians were being abducted and executed.Since then, he has watched siblings leave for foreign countries and work and income dry up.Of 20 relatives who once lived in the neighbourhood, only his family of six remain.Iraq's Christians have endured unrest over centuries, but a mass exodus began after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and accelerated during the reign of Islamic State, which brutalised minorities and Muslims alike.Hundreds of thousands left for nearby areas and Western countries.Across Iraq's northern Nineveh Plains, home to some of the oldest churches and monasteries in the world, the remaining Christians often live displaced in villages that fell easily to Islamic State in 2014 or in enclaves of bigger cities such as Mosul and the nearby self-run Kurdish region.The Islamists' rule over almost a third of Iraq, with Mosul as their capital, ended in 2017 in a destructive battle with security forces.'Only God Can Help'Physical and economic ruin remain. Iraqi authorities have struggled to rebuild areas decimated by war, and armed groups that the government has not been able to control vie for territory and resources, including Christian heartlands.Christians say they are left with a dilemma - whether to return to damaged homes, resettle inside Iraq or migrate from a country that experience has shown cannot protect them."In 2014, Christians thought their displacement would last a few days," said Cardinal Louis Sako, head of Iraq's Chaldean Catholic Church."It lasted three years. Many lost hope and migrated. There's no security or stability."Iraq's indigenous Christians are estimated to number around 300,000, a fifth of the 1.5 million who lived in the country before the 2003 invasion that toppled Sunni Muslim leader Saddam Hussein.Christians were tolerated under Hussein, but singled out for kidnappings and killings in the communal bloodshed of the mid-2000s onwards.Pope Francis is to visit Iraq on an historic trip that eluded his predecessors. He will say a prayer for the victims of conflict at a site in Mosul where old churches lie in ruins, once used as religious tribunals by Islamic State.Christians welcome the visit, but do not believe it will improve their lot."The pope can't help us, only God can," Yahya said.Displaced, DistrustfulYahya's family, who fled to Iraq's northern Kurdistan region during Islamic State's rule, is one of just a few dozen that have returned to Mosul out of an original population of some 50,000 Christians, according to local clergy.His two teenage sons help out at the local church, the only one fully repaired in Mosul, which fills to about half its modest capacity on Sundays.Firas, his eldest, finds little more than a day a week of casual labour and sees no future in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city."If I want to marry, I'll have to leave. Christian women from here are displaced to other areas and don't want to come back," he said. "Ideally, I'd go to the West."The experience of Islamic State, which told Christians to convert, pay a tax or be killed, and the inability of Iraqi and Kurdish security forces to prevent the group marauding through their hometowns, has left many Christians distrustful of any but their own.The nearby Christian town of Hamdaniya boasts its own militia, which local officials say is necessary because of the proliferation of Shi'ite Muslim paramilitary groups which seek control of land, and Islamic State militants who remain in hideouts across northern Iraq."If there were no Christian militia here, no one would come back. Why should we rely on outside forces to protect us?" said a local militia leader, who requested anonymity.Nearly 30,000 Christians, half of Hamdaniya's population, have returned, including a small number from abroad, and began rebuilding infrastructure thanks to foreign aid. It is a rare bright spot.In the neighbouring village, Christian leader Sako said most Christians were unable or unwilling to return out of fear of a local Shi'ite militia, and because non-Christians had bought their property in their absence.Some have showed interest in resettling in Hamdaniya, but local officials generally reject this, fearing it would weaken Iraqi Christians' presence."If people move here from their own villages, it empties those areas of Christians," said Isam Daaboul, the mayor of Hamdaniya."This threatens our existence in areas we've been for generations."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraqs-scattered-christians-ask-should-i-stay-or-go-as-their-struggles-persist-101614324206220.html
26-02-2021||World||Covid vaccination 'passports' may open society, but inequity looms||Violet light bathed the club stage as 300 people, masked and socially distanced, erupted in gentle applause. For the first time since the pandemic began, Israeli musician Aviv Geffen stepped to his electric piano and began to play for an audience seated right in front of him.“A miracle is happening here tonight,” Geffen told the crowd.Still, the reanimating experience Monday night above a shopping mall north of Tel Aviv night was not accessible to everyone. Only people displaying a “green passport” that proved they had been vaccinated or had recovered from Covid-19 could get in.The highly controlled concert offered a glimpse of a future that many are longing for after months of Covid-19 restrictions. Governments say getting vaccinated and having proper documentation will smooth the way to travel, entertainment and other social gatherings in a post-pandemic world.But it also raises the prospect of further dividing the world along the lines of wealth and vaccine access, creating ethical and logistical issues that have alarmed decision-makers around the world.Other governments are watching Israel churn through the world's fastest vaccination program and grapple with the ethics of using the shots as diplomatic currency and power.Inside Israel, green passports or badges obtained through an app is the coin of the realm. The country recently reached agreements with Greece and Cyprus to recognize each other's green badges, and more such tourism-boosting accords are expected.Anyone unwilling or unable to get the jabs that confer immunity will be “left behind,” said Health Minister Yuli Edelstein.“It's really the only way forward at the moment,” Geffen said in an interview with The Associated Press.The checks at the club's doors, which admitted only those who could prove they are fully vaccinated, allowed at least a semblance of normality.“People can't live their lives in the new world without them," he said. "We must take the vaccines. We must."The vaccine is not available to everyone in the world, whether due to supply or cost. And some people don't want it, for religious or other reasons. In Israel, a country of 9.3 million people, only about half the adult population has received the required two doses.There is new pressure from the government to encourage vaccinations. Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday passed a law allowing the Health Ministry to disclose information on people who have yet to be vaccinated. Under the policy, names can be released to the ministries of education, labor, social affairs and social services, as well as local governments, “with the purpose of allowing these bodies to encourage people to get vaccinated."The government is appealing to the emotional longing for the company of others -- in Israel's storied outdoor markets, at concerts like Geffen's, and elsewhere.“With the Green Pass, doors just open for you. You could go out to restaurants, work out at the gym, see a show,” read an announcement on Feb. 21, the day much of the economy reopened after a six-week shutdown.Then it raised a question at the center of the global quest to conquer the pandemic that has hobbled economies and killed nearly 2.5 million people: “How to get the pass? Go and get vaccinated right now.”It's that simple in Israel, which has enough vaccine to inoculate everyone over 16, although the government has been criticized for sharing only tiny quantities with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week he intends to send excess vaccine to some of the country's allies. Israel's attorney general said Thursday night the plan has been frozen while he reviews the legalities.Most countries don't have enough vaccine, highlighting the fraught ethical landscape of who can get it and how to lift the burden of Covid-19.“The core human rights principle is equity and nondiscrimination,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University professor and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law.“There's a huge moral crisis in equity globally because in high income countries like Israel or the United States or the EU countries, we're likely to get to herd immunity by the end of this year," he said. "But for many low-income countries, most people won't be vaccinated for many years. Do we really want to give priority to people who already have so many privileges?”It's a question dogging the international community as wealthier countries begin to gain traction against the coronavirus and some of its variants.Last April, the initiative known as COVAX was formed by the WHO, with the initial goal of getting vaccines to poor countries at roughly the same time shots were being rolled out in rich countries. It has missed that target, and 80% of the 210 million doses administered worldwide have been given in only 10 countries, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week.Ghana on Wednesday became the first of 92 countries to get vaccines for free through the initiative. COVAX announced that about 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in the African nation. That's a fraction of the 2 billion shots the WHO aims to deliver this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccination-passports-may-open-society-but-inequity-looms-101614324260112.html
26-02-2021||World||US achieves milestone of administering 50 million Covid-19 vaccine shots||The US has reached an important milestone of administering COVID-19 vaccines to a record 50 million people as part of its efforts to fight the deadly coronavirus pandemic, with President Joe Biden asserting that the country is on its way to taking the figure to 100 million within the first 100 days of his administration."But this is not the time to relax," Biden told his countrymen from the White House as the US reached the important milestone."We must keep washing our hands, stay socially distanced, and for God's sake -- for God's sake, wear a mask. Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing those things. And the worst thing we could do now is let our guard down,” he said on Thursday.“The more people get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to beat this pandemic. That’s why one of my first goals in office when just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my goal was to get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days as President,” he said.Biden said on Thursday the US reached the halfway mark of 50 million shots in just 37 days since he became President.“That’s weeks ahead of schedule, even with the setbacks we faced during the recent winter storms, which devastated millions of Midwestern cities, towns, and also the same in the South,” he said.“At first, critics said that goal was too ambitious; no one could do that. And then they said it was too small. But the bottom line, though, is that America will be the first country -- perhaps the only one -- to get that done,” he said.Biden said nearly 50 per cent of Americans over the age of 65 and 75 per cent of long-term care recipients have received at least one dose.“We’re moving in the right direction, though, despite the mess we inherited from the previous administration, which left us with no real plan to vaccinate all Americans," he said."Every time we administer another 50 million shots, I’m going to use that milestone to report to the American people on our vaccination program and on our overall fight against this pandemic. The good and the bad, I’ll tell you; the success and the failures,” he added.The US has the highest coronavirus case tally in the world at 28.4 million and the highest death toll at 508,114.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-achieves-milestone-of-administering-50-million-covid-19-vaccine-shots-101614322713757.html
26-02-2021||World||Novel chip for Covid-19 testing delivers results on smartphone||Scientists have developed a stamp-sized chip that simplifies Covid-19 testing, and delivers results on a smartphone in less than 55 minutes.The microfluidic chip developed by researchers from Rice University in the US measures the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, a biomarker for Covid-19, in blood serum from a standard finger prick.According to the research published in the journal ACS Sensors, the nanobeads bind to SARS-CoV-2 N protein in the chip and transport it to an electrochemical sensor that detects minute amounts of the biomarker.The researchers noted that their process simplifies sample handling compared to swab-based PCR tests that are widely used to diagnose Covid-19 and need to be analysed in a laboratory."What's great about this device is that it doesn't require a laboratory," said Rice lab of mechanical engineer Peter Lillehoj."You can perform the entire test and generate the results at the collection site, health clinic or even a pharmacy. The entire system is easily transportable and easy to use," he said in a statement.The team, including Rice graduate student and lead author Jiran Li, took advantage of existing biosensing tools to develop simple diagnostics, like a microneedle patch introduced last year to diagnose malaria.The new tool relies on a slightly more complex detection scheme but delivers accurate, quantitative results in a short amount of time.To test the device, the researchers relied on donated serum samples from people who were healthy and others who were Covid-19-positive.They said a longer incubation yields more accurate results when using whole serum.The team found that 55 minutes was an optimum amount of time for the microchip to sense SARS-CoV-2 N protein at concentrations as low as 50 picograms (billionths of a gram) per millilitre in whole serum.The microchip could detect N protein in even lower concentrations, at 10 picograms per milliliter, in only 25 minutes by diluting the serum fivefold.Paired with a Google Pixel 2 phone and a plug-in potentiostat -- a device that controls voltage and measures resulting current -- it was able to deliver a positive diagnosis with a concentration as low as 230 picograms for whole serum."There are standard procedures to modify the beads with an antibody that targets a particular biomarker," Lillehoj said."When you combine them with a sample containing the biomarker, in this case SARS-CoV-2 N protein, they bond together," he added.A capillary tube is used to deliver the sample to the chip, which is then placed on a magnet that pulls the beads towards an electrochemical sensor coated with capture antibodies.The beads bind to the capture antibodies and generate a current proportional to the concentration of biomarker in the sample.The potentiostat reads that current and sends a signal to its phone app.If there are no Covid-19 biomarkers, the beads do not bind to the sensor and get washed away inside the chip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novel-chip-for-covid-19-testing-delivers-results-on-smartphone-101614321246673.html

26-02-2021||World||White House expects Neera Tanden to have a high bar of civility and engagement||The White House has said that it expects Neera Tanden to have a high bar of civility and engagement when the Indian-American policy expert joins the Biden administration, as it backed her nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget.Tanden, 50, is facing a tough time for the confirmation of her nomination over her past Twitter outbursts against several lawmakers, including those from her own Democratic Party.“When Neera Tanden testified just a few weeks ago, she apologised for her past comments and that she would be joining an administration where, as we've noted in here, there's an expectation of a high bar of civility and engagement, whether that's on social media or in person," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Thursday."And we certainly expect she would meet that bar,” Psaki said.Tanden’s nomination is in jeopardy because of the hundreds of her tweets against several Republican and Democratic Senators, who now have vowed to vote against her during the Senate confirmation.Tanden reportedly deleted more than 1,000 tweets before her confirmation process started. She had apologised to senators during her confirmation hearings earlier this month.“The President (Joe Biden) nominated Neera Tanden because she is qualified, because she is experienced, because she has a record of working with people who agree with her and disagree with her, and she has decades of experience," Psaki said."...she has lived experience of her own, having benefited from a number of the programmes that she would oversee, as a daughter of a single parent and somebody who benefited from food stamps at certain points in time,” Psaki said.“She would bring a new perspective to the role. That's why he nominated her to the job and why we're continuing to fight for her confirmation,” said the White House Press Secretary.If confirmed by the 100-member Senate, Tanden would become the first person of colour to head the federal agency that prepares the annual budget of the US government.Meanwhile, The Hill newspaper reported that Tanden might drop out of the race as early as Friday.“The struggle to gain support for the longtime Democratic aide whose combative Twitter posts have drawn criticism reflects miscalculations by the White House and its chief of staff, Ron Klain,” The New York Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-expects-neera-tanden-to-have-a-high-bar-of-civility-and-engagement-101614321033457.html
26-02-2021||World||Canadian panel calls for ‘targeted sanctions’ on China for its role in Hong Kong||A Canadian parliamentary committee has called upon the government to work with like-minded countries to impose “targeted sanctions” on Chinese officials “responsible for or complicit in gross violations of human rights, freedoms and the rule of law in Hong Kong”.It is among the recommendations listed in a report released by the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations, marking yet another low in the two countries’ deteriorating ties. The panel is headed by Geoff Regan, a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party caucus.It also said that in “light of the allegations of threats and intimidation against people in Canada supporting human rights and democracy in Hong Kong, the government of Canada carefully review accredited diplomatic personnel in the People’s Republic of China’s diplomatic missions to Canada”. It asked the government to consider “issuing travel documents to facilitate the safe and immediate exit from Hong Kong of pro-democracy activists” while making clear that “it will not act upon or support any arrest warrants or requests for legal assistance that are connected to the enforcement of the national security law imposed on Hong Kong”.The report from the panel is the latest flashpoint in escalating tensions between Canada and China. Bilateral ties began spiralling downwards ever since Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, in Vancouver in 2018 on an extradition request from the US for alleged fraud and violation of sanctions placed on Iran. Earlier this week, Canada’s House of Commons had passed a motion that labelled Chinese actions against Uighurs in Xinjiang a “genocide”. It had also passed an amendment to the motion calling on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympic Games from China to another country.The 2022 Winter Games are scheduled to be held in Beijing and few other Chinese cities from February 4-20.Canadian activists have been consistently calling for the 2022 Olympics to be moved out of China and hosted by a “free country”.A joint statement to this effect was issued jointly by Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project, Canadian Friends of Hong Kong, and Students for a Free Tibet Canada. “If the new host city needs more time, the 2022 Olympics can be postponed by a year, as what Tokyo has done for the 2020 Games due to Covid-19,” the statement said, noting that “free” venues such as Vancouver-Whistler in Canada, which had hosted the 2010 Winter Games, “have the experience, existing facilities and infrastructure to host it again”.Referring to Beijing having hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Youdon Tsamotshang, who heads a Tibetan group, said, “It’s really shocking that China was given a second chance without bettering the human rights situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-panel-calls-for-targeted-sanctions-on-china-for-its-role-in-hong-kong-101614318117559.html
26-02-2021||World||United States asks Pakistan to play a ‘constructive role’ in the region||The United States on Thursday called upon Pakistan to play a “constructive role” in the region, especially across the border in Kashmir as well as in Afghanistan, in the backdrop of the ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) and growing calls from experts for a re-set of US-Pakistan ties.The US welcomed the India-Pakistan joint statement committing to a ceasefire along the LoC. “We encourage continued efforts to improve communication between the two sides and to reduce tensions and violence along the Line of Control,” said Ned Price, spokesperson of the US state department.Asked about the trajectory of the relationship between the US and Pakistan under the administration of President Joe Biden, Price said Pakistan has an “important role to play” in bringing peace to Afghanistan.But he went on to put Pakistan on notice, saying, “So clearly we will be paying close attention, and we urge the Pakistanis to play a constructive role in all of these areas of mutual interest, including in Afghanistan, including with Kashmir, including with our other shared interests.”The Biden administration’s highest-level contact with the Pakistan government so far has been between secretary of state Antony Blinken and foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. They spoke on the same day as Blinken and India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar did, for the first time. President Biden and Prime Minister Imran Khan have not spoken yet.Price’s response to a question about the forward trajectory of America’s relationship with Pakistan came amid growing talk of a reset of ties between the two erstwhile allies.“Voices sympathetic to Pakistan in Washington are advocating a reset of US-Pakistan relations, setting aside the bitterness of the past,” Aparna Pande, a South Asia expert with the think tank Hudson Institute, recently wrote in a piece calling for a reset of US-Pakistan ties.“Their essential argument is that as a nuclear weapons power with a large army, which has been a friend of the United States in the past, Pakistan simply cannot be ignored,” she said.Pande concluded, “The US should, of course, not ignore Pakistan. But Americans should be wary of plans that draw the US back into embracing Pakistan or depending on it. Pakistan is now China’s closest ally and its overtures to the US are designed only to evade the consequences of its anti-American conduct.”Price’s call to Pakistan to play a “constructive role” seemed to be a studied response to the growing call for a reset of ties, reminding advocates of a deep-seated suspicion of an erstwhile ally who took billions of dollars in aid to combat terrorism, but ended up fuelling it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-asks-pakistan-to-play-a-constructive-role-in-the-region-101614317517488.html
26-02-2021||World||Saudi Crown Prince implicated in Khashoggi murder, US finds||A US intelligence report expected to be declassified as soon as Friday implicates Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in approving the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a person familiar with the findings.The report builds on classified intelligence from the CIA and other intelligence agencies after Khashoggi’s murder in October 2018 inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the report hasn’t yet been released. It wasn’t immediately clear how much detail the declassified version of the report will provide about Prince Mohammed’s role in the killing.The decision to release the report, compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, reflects the Biden administration’s determination to recalibrate relations with Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, amid tensions over its human rights record.In advance of the report’s publication, President Joe Biden held a call Thursday with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Biden discussed regional security and the renewed US and United Nations effort to end the war in Yemen, and he “affirmed the importance the United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law,” the White House said in a statement.Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement in the killing, while saying he accepts symbolic responsibility for it as the country’s de facto ruler. Saudi officials have said the murder was carried out by rogue agents who have since been prosecuted.State Department spokesman Ned Price declined to comment when asked about the report Thursday but suggested that the US was looking at other ways to hold the perpetrators of the killing responsible for their actions. Among the options may be cutting back arms sales to Saudi Arabia and imposing sanctions.“I expect that we will be in a position before long to speak to steps to promote accountability going forward for this horrific crime,” Price told reporters in Washington. “Transparency, as it often is, is an element of accountability. I wouldn’t expect the accountability to stop there, however.”The decision to release the report, which was withheld by the Trump administration, reflects the difference in attitudes toward Saudi Arabia, and human rights issues, under Biden.Former President Donald Trump dismissed concerns about whether the crown prince approved the killing -- “Maybe he did, maybe he didn’t,” he said -- citing the economic rewards of selling arms to the Saudis. His secretary of state, Michael Pompeo, said the US had “no direct evidence” linking the prince to the murder and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner maintained a close working relationship with him.The US intelligence report isn’t the only finding to implicate the Saudi monarchy. A UN investigator, Agnes Callamard has said Khashoggi was the victim of a “state killing” and has said there was little doubt it was ordered at the highest levels of the Saudi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-crown-prince-implicated-in-khashoggi-murder-us-finds-101614316095480.html
26-02-2021||World||US lifts Trump-era ban on legal immigration||US President Joe Biden has revoked a ban on legal immigration that was ordered by his predecessor Donald Trump to save American jobs for local citizens in an economy crippled by the Covid-19 pandemic.In a proclamation issued on Wednesday, Biden said the ban “does not advance the interests of the United States”. He added, “To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here. It also harms industries in the United States that utilise talent from around the world.”The proclamation will allow people to begin applying for green cards with immediate effect - and not wait until March when the ban was supposed to expire. It did not revoke the ban on H-1B, L and other work visas. But they are set to lapse in March.In April 2020, Trump had temporarily suspended for 60 days the entry of legal immigrants - affecting green cards - as layoffs had begun to spike. There were some exceptions, such as dependents of US citizens. Then in June, Trump extended the freeze by another 60 days and added non-immigrants to the list, including holders of short-term work visas such as the H-1B and L visas used for intra-company transfers. He further extended these bans in December for another 60 days.“Without intervention, the United States faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labour supply outpaces labour demand,” Trump had said in the April proclamation.While the stated goal was to save US jobs for Americans, critics said the former president was using the pandemic to pursue a hardline immigration agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lifts-trump-era-ban-on-legal-immigration-101614306505899.html

As of Thursday, a total of 3,460,326 infections were confirmed.The grim figure in the state with 40 million residents came just days after the country recorded a half-million deaths. It took 10 months for the state to hit 25,000 deaths on New Year's Eve and less than two months for that number to double.While California has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the country, it is ranked 25th in the number of cases per capita because of its large population.In Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the country, more than 800 victims were added to the list of those who had died of COVID-19 on Wednesday night, underscoring the massive toll of the fall and winter surge. The total number of fatalities just this week reached 20,000 in the county.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-california-death-toll-due-to-covid-19-tops-50000-101614305723750.html

The FATF recognises that Pakistan has made significant progress in its effort to improve its anti money laundering and counterterrorism financing framework. However, some serious deficiencies remain,” Pleyer told a virtual news briefing at the end of the watchdog’s three-day plenary meeting.All of these deficiencies are in areas that relate to terrorist financing. Out of 27 items on its action plan, three still need to be fully addressed. I again recognise the progress that Pakistan has made but I strongly urge the completion of the action plan,” he added.Focus on three remaining items in the action planThe statement called on Islamabad to “continue to work on implementing the three remaining items in its action plan to address its strategically important deficiencies”.The steps to be taken by the Pakistan government include “demonstrating that TF (terror financing) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities”.Pakistan should also demonstrate that terror financing “prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions”, and that there is “effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions” against all terrorists sanctioned under UN Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373, and “specifically those acting for or on their behalf”.“As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan before June 2021,” the statement said.Review at next plenary meeting in JunePleyer said that further steps taken by Pakistan will be reviewed at the FATF’s next plenary meeting in June.The statement noted that Pakistan’s “continued political commitment has led to significant progress across a comprehensive CFT (counter financing of terrorism) action plan”, including demonstrating that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity.The plenary meeting followed several rounds of meetings of the FATF’s working groups since February 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terror-financing-watchdog-keeps-pakistan-on-grey-list-101614305901298.html

26-02-2021||World||Border dispute objective reality, should be put at right position in ties: China||The border dispute between India and China is a reality, should be taken seriously but should also be placed at an appropriate position in bilateral ties, Chinese state councilor and foreign minister, Wang Yi has told external affairs minister, S Jaishankar.The two top ministers spoke over phone on Thursday to review the troops disengagement process in the eastern Ladakh area near the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The two sides have agreed to set up a hotline for better communication in a timely manner, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on the phone conversation released early on Friday.Wang was quoted as saying in the statement that border disputes are an objective reality and should be given sufficient attention and taken seriously. However, border issues are not the whole of China-India relations and should be placed in an appropriate position in bilateral relations, he said.The statement quoted Wang as saying that the recent disengagement of frontline Chinese and Indian troops in the Pangong Lake area had clearly eased the situation on the ground.Wang told Jaishankar that both sides must cherish the current hard-won situation, jointly consolidate the existing results, maintain the momentum of consultation and further ease the situation.Wang said that both sides should improve the border control mechanism, advance the border negotiation process, continue to accumulate and enhance mutual trust, and achieve peace and tranquility in the border area.Jaishankar was quoted in the statement as saying that the recent disengagement of the two militaries in the Pangong Lake area is an important result of the two sides earnestly implementing the Moscow consensus of the two foreign ministers.India hopes to strengthen dialogue and consultation with China to achieve complete disengagement in other regions as soon as possible and promote the continuous cooling of the border situation between the two countries, Jaishankar was quoted as saying.Blaming India for the nine-month military standoff in eastern Ladakh, Wang said India’s policies towards China had changed in the last year and “pragmatic cooperation” between the two countries had been affected.The Chinese minister was quoted as saying that bad ties were not in the interest of the two countries, and that past experiences show that highlighting differences will not help resolve problems and would also erode the foundation of mutual trust.“Both parties agreed to establish a communication hotline to exchange opinions in a timely manner,” the statement said.Must Watch: Govt on thaw with Pakistan & China; updates on threats to Indians in CanadaThe phone call was the first formal contact between Jaishankar and Wang since they met on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow on September 10 last year, and it came days after India and China pulled back frontline troops from strategic heights around Pangong Lake along with armoured vehicles and artillery.“Spoke to State Councillor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi this afternoon. Discussed the implementation of our Moscow Agreement and reviewed the status of disengagement,” Jaishankar tweeted, without giving details.Asked about the situation on the LAC at a regular news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “Both sides view the smooth and successful completion of disengagement in the north and south bank [of Pangong Lake] as a significant first step as this forms a basis for resolution of remaining issues so as to achieve the eventual goal of complete disengagement in all friction areas.”“The two sides have agreed to work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/border-dispute-objective-reality-should-be-put-at-right-position-in-ties-china-101614305292528.html
26-02-2021||World||Facebook signs pay deals with 3 Australian news publishers||Facebook announced on Friday preliminary agreements with three Australian publishers, a day after the Parliament passed a law that would make the digital giants pay for news.Facebook said letters of intent had been signed with independent news organizations Private Media, Schwartz Media and Solstice Media.The commercial agreements are subject to the signing of full agreements within the next 60 days, a Facebook statement said.“These agreements will bring a new slate of premium journalism, including some previously paywalled content, to Facebook,” the statement said.Schwartz Media chief executive Rebecca Costello said the deal would help her company continue to produce independent journalism.“It's never been more important than it is now to have a plurality of voices in the Australian press,” Costello said in the Facebook statement.Private Media chief executive Will Hayward said the new deal built on an existing Facebook partnership.Australia's Parliament on Thursday had passed the final amendments to the so-called News Media Bargaining Code.In return for the changes, Facebook agreed to lift a six-day-old ban on Australians accessing and sharing news. Access to Australian news sites did not appear to be fully restored until Friday.Google, the only other digital giant targeted by the legislation, has already struck content licensing deals, or is close to deals, with some of Australia's biggest news publishers including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Seven West Media.Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg on Wednesday took a veiled swipe at News Corp. in a social media post criticizing Australia's law, which is aimed at setting a fair price for the Australian journalism that the digital platforms display.“It is ironic that some of the biggest publishers that have long advocated for free markets and voluntary commercial undertakings now appear to be in favor of state sponsored price setting,” the former British deputy prime minister wrote.News Corp. Australia executive chairman Michael Miller said last week that his company had pay negotiations with Facebook.“Having been someone who's dealt with Facebook over the past months, we have some weeks where we're getting good engagement and think we're progressing and then you get silence. I think the door is still open,” Miller told a Senate inquiry into Australian media diversity.News Corp. owns most of Australia's major newspapers, and some analysts argue the US-based international media empire is the driver for the conservative Australian government making Facebook and Google pay. News Corp. has announced a wide-ranging deal with Google covering operations in the United States and Britain as well as Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-signs-pay-deals-with-3-australian-news-publishers-101614304136519.html
26-02-2021||World||US president Joe Biden believes it's important to modernise immigration system: White House||US President Joe Biden believes that it is important and long overdue to modernise the immigration system, and this includes taking steps to help ensure high skilled workers can stay in the country, the White House has said.Biden has revoked a policy issued by his predecessor during the Covid-19 pandemic that blocked many Green Card applicants from entering the US, a move that will benefit many Indians working in America on the H-1B visa.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently."The president believes that it's important and long overdue to modernise our immigration system, and that includes taking steps to help ensure that high skilled workers can stay in the country and can go through the proper processes to stay in the country,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Thursday."So, we are eager to work with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to get that done,” she said a day after Biden issued the proclamation reversing the decision of his predecessor Donald Trump.Indian IT professionals, most of whom are highly skilled and come to the US mainly on the H-1B work visas, are the worst sufferers of the current immigration system which imposes a seven per cent per country quota on allotment of the coveted Green Card or permanent legal residency.The H-1B visa, the most sought after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.Reopening the country to people seeking green cards, or legal permanent residence, Biden in his proclamation on Wednesday said that the policy of former President Donald Trump does not advance the interests of the United States.“To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,” he said.“It also harms industries in the United States that utilise talent from around the world. And it harms individuals who were selected to receive the opportunity to apply for, and those who have likewise received, immigrant visas through the Fiscal Year 2020 Diversity Visa Lottery,” Biden, a Democrat, said.Trump, a Republican, issued the ban last year, saying it was needed to protect US workers amid high unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic.The US is currently facing a backlog of nearly 473,000 qualified family-based Green Card requests.As a result of Trump’s ban on issuing green cards, as many as 120,000 family-based preference visas were lost. But this came as a big boon for issuing employment-based green cards, mainly those on H-1B visas.Thousands of Indian IT professionals who painstakingly waited for their Green Card, received their legal permanent residency as a result in the last few months of the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-believes-it-s-important-to-modernise-immigration-system-wh-101614303176227.html
26-02-2021||World||McConnell says he would support Donald Trump if he’s nominated in 2024||Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he would “absolutely” support Donald Trump if he were the Republican Party’s nominee for president in 2024.His remarks, in a Fox News interview, marked an about-face from less than two weeks ago, when he delivered an impassioned speech from the Senate floor in which he held Trump “practically and morally responsible” for the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6th.McConnell and other Republicans, including Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming have suggested that it was time for the party to move on and find new leaders despite polls showing that most Republicans remain attached to the former president.Yet the party is also keen to cast aside the notion that it’s engulfed in a civil war as it confronts the new Biden administration and prepares for the 2022 elections.“The Republican party is actually in very good shape,” McConnell said in the Fox interview. “We gained seats in the House, we elected 50 Republican senators when everybody was predicting we were going to lose the Senate. The Democrats didn’t flip a single state legislature, we flipped two, picked up a governor.”The Republicans did lose control of the Senate, but it remains divided 50-50.McConnell dismissed reports of party discord and said President Joe Biden “has made it quite easy for us to get together.”On Feb. 13, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on charges of inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection, but just minutes later condemned him in the floor speech. “The leader of the free world cannot spend weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe him and do reckless things,” he said.Trump fired back days later with a sarcastic response, mocking McConnell as “a dour, sullen and unsmiling political hack” and warned senators who remained loyal to their leader “will not win again.”When Trump was president, McConnell was his chief ally in shepherding the 2017 tax law and filling the federal judiciary with Trump’s nominees. But the two men had an uneasy relationship that McConnell managed by rarely engaging Trump publicly, making his floor speech all the more extraordinary.McConnell is not attending this weekend’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, in which Trump will be the star attraction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcconnell-says-he-would-support-donald-trump-if-he-s-nominated-in-2024-101614302652608.html

The singer is offering a $500,000 reward.The dog walker was shot once Wednesday night and is expected to survive his injuries, according to Los Angeles Police Capt. Jonathan Tippett, commanding officer of the department's elite Robbery-Homicide Division. The man was walking three of Lady Gaga's dogs at the time, but one escaped. That dog has been recovered safely.Tippett told The Associated Press that the dogs belong to pop star Lady Gaga. It's not yet clear if the dog walker was targeted because of his celebrity client, the captain said.Lady Gaga is offering the reward for the return of her dogs — whose names are Koji and Gustav — with no questions asked, according to her representative. An email address for tips, KojiandGustav@gmail.com, has been set up. The singer is currently in Rome to film a movie.Police were initially called to North Sierra Bonita Avenue, a street off the famed Sunset Boulevard, around 9:40 p.m. Wednesday following several 911 calls reporting a man screaming and the sound of a gunshot, said Capt. Steven Lurie, commanding officer of the department’s Hollywood Division.The victim, whose name has not been released, was walking the dogs when a white Nissan Altima pulled over and two men tried to steal the animals, police said.“Two suspects exited the vehicle and demanded the victim turn over the dogs at gunpoint. The victim struggled with the suspects and was shot once by one of the suspects,” a police statement said.The suspects nabbed two of the three dogs and drove off in the Nissan sedan, the statement said.There was little evidence of the previous night's violence on Thursday afternoon in the upscale neighborhood known as the Sunset Square historic district. There were faint blood spatters on sidewalk grasses and an errant black glove typically used by police left in the street. Neighbors, some of whom had doorbell security cameras, declined to comment on the shooting.French bulldogs can cost thousands of dollars. A woman in San Francisco was beaten in January at gunpoint, and three men stole her gray French bulldog puppy named Chloe, police said.Gaga has remained among the biggest pop stars in the world since breaking through with her 2008 album “The Fame,” known as much for her shape-shifting persona on stages and red carpets as for her danceable music and powerful vocal pipes.She has won 11 Grammy Awards, headlined Super Bowl halftime and has now also become a bona fide Hollywood star after co-starring in 2018’s “A Star is Born” with Bradley Cooper and winning an Oscar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lady-gaga-s-dog-walker-shot-french-bulldogs-stolen-in-la-101614302308237.html
26-02-2021||World||Explainer: What were the warnings before the Capitol riot?||Capitol Police leadership had plenty of intelligence warning that armed extremists were planning to target the Capitol over President Donald Trump’s election loss, according to new testimony Thursday. But their rank-and-file officers were still left exposed against armed rioters who came within steps of lawmakers.In an appearance before a House subcommittee, acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said none of the warnings forecast the mass attack that actually took place.Both Democrats and Republicans took issue with that, saying the intelligence sounded both specific and credible.“I cannot get past a glaring discrepancy between intelligence received and preparation,” Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said during Thursday's hearing before the House Appropriations Committee.Pittman became acting chief when her predecessor, Steven Sund, resigned in the wake of the insurrection. At the time of the attack, she was serving as assistant chief for protective and intelligence services.Here’s some of what was learned from Pittman’s testimony:WHAT INTELLIGENCE DID POLICE HAVE BEFORE THE JAN. 6 ATTACK?Three days before the attack, the Capitol Police department's own security assessment warned that militia members, white supremacists, and other extremists were planning to come to Washington and target Congress in what they saw as a “last stand” to support Trump.Pittman says the details of that assessment were shared throughout the department, with sergeants and lieutenants told to spread the word to rank-and-file officers.It's not clear how effective that messaging was, however. Four officers interviewed by The Associated Press last month say they had little or no warning of what would happen and felt they were left unprepared for the attack.Pittman also faced questions about an FBI memo, received the night before the attack, that warned extremists planned to wage “war” to prevent Joe Biden's election victory from being certified. She said that memo never reached her, but that it would not have changed the department's preparations anyway.SO POLICE KNEW VIOLENCE WAS LIKELY. WHAT DID THEY DO TO PREVENT IT?Pittman said the force took appropriate measures to protect the building and the lawmakers who were inside. She said they stationed armed officers at the homes of congressional leaders, intercepted radio frequencies used by the invaders, and deployed counterintelligence officers to the Ellipse rally where Trump was sending his supporters marching to the Capitol to “fight like hell.”But the mob made it through the police line and smashed their way into the Capitol, fighting past officers who were outnumbered and overwhelmed. Many officers didn’t know if they could use force and lacked guidance on how to stop the rioters, leaving some to improvise.WHY DIDN'T THE DEPARTMENT DO MORE TO PREPARE?Pittman argued that the intelligence from Jan. 3 was not specific or credible enough to predict the kind of insurrection that actually took place. The same goes for the FBI memo, she said. She said that even if department leaders had seen that warning, they wouldn't have changed their plans because it was considered “raw” intelligence and not something that the department could act on.“No credible threat indicated that tens of thousands would attack the US Capitol, nor did the intelligence received from the FBI or any other law enforcement partner indicate such a threat,” Pittman said. Questioned later in the hearing, Pittman acknowledged that police estimate around 10,000 people were demonstrating outside and around 800 people broke inside.Lawmakers seized on her claim that the warnings didn't lay out the actual threat.Clark, the congresswoman from Massachusetts, described the Jan. 3 assessment as a listing of “who, what, when, why.”WHAT HAPPENS NOW?Pittman noted that she had taken “corrective measures” to better share intelligence in the future. But there are still several investigations going on into the law enforcement response.Speaking after the hearing, Rep. Tim Ryan, the House subcommittee’s chairman, stopped short of saying Pittman should be fired. But he said there are “a lot of concerns” on the committee about her leadership and noted the lack of trust among the rank and file.The Capitol Police union issued a vote of no confidence last week against Pittman.“I think there’s some real questions about the decision making that was made, and I’m going to leave it at that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exlainer-what-were-the-warnings-before-the-capitol-riot-101614301942247.html

Illinois is the only state with a law that allows people to seek monetary damages for such unauthorized data collection.“While we disagree with the assertions, rather than go through lengthy litigation, we’d like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community,” TikTok said in an emailed statement.Facebook agreed to a $550 million settlement under the same law last February. The TikTok settlement must still be approved by a federal judge.Privacy advocates have praised the law as the nation’s strongest form of protection in the commercial use of such data, and it has survived ongoing efforts by the tech industry and other businesses to weaken it.Illinois is one of three states that have laws governing the use of biometric data. But the other two, Texas and Washington, don’t permit individual lawsuits, instead delegating enforcement to their attorneys general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-pay-92-million-in-us-privacy-settlement-101614301737218.html
26-02-2021||World||Boeing, hit with $6.6 mn FAA fine, faces much bigger 787 repair bill: Report||Boeing Co will pay a $6.6 million to US regulators as part of a settlement over quality and safety-oversight lapses going back years, a setback that comes as Boeing wrestles with repairs to flawed 787 Dreamliner jets that could dwarf the cost of the federal penalty.Boeing is beginning painstaking repairs and forensic inspections to fix structural integrity flaws embedded deep inside at least 88 parked 787s built over the last year or so, a third industry source said.The inspections and retrofits could take weeks or even up to a month per plane and are likely to cost hundreds of millions - if not billions - of dollars, depending to a large degree on the number of planes and defects involved, the person said.The Federal Aviation Administration said Boeing had agreed to pay $6.6 million in penalties after the aviation regulator said it failed to comply with a 2015 safety agreement.The penalties include $5.4 million for not complying with the agreement in which Boeing pledged to change its internal processes to improve and prioritize regulatory compliance and $1.21 million to settle two pending FAA enforcement cases."Boeing failed to meet all of its obligations under the settlement agreement, and the FAA is holding Boeing accountable by imposing additional penalties," FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement. Boeing, which paid $12 million in 2015 as part of the settlement, did not immediately comment.Boeing engineers are working to determine the scope of inspections, including whether jets can be used as-is without a threat to safety, two people said. Boeing has not told airlines how many jets are impacted, another person said.The FAA has been investigating instances of oversight lapses, debris left inside finished aircraft, and managers putting pressure on employees handling safety checks for the FAA, people familiar with the proceedings said.For example, in August 2020, Boeing told to the FAA about the flaw involving structural wrinkling in the interior fuselage skin where carbon-composite barrels that form the plane's lightweight body are melded together.But the defect went unnoticed for months or longer because computerized safeguards that crunch data looking for quality flaws had not been programmed to look for the gaps, a third industry source said.Delivery targetThe 787 production problems have halted deliveries of the jet since the end of October, locking up a source of desperately needed cash for Boeing.The fuel-efficient 787 has been a huge success with airlines, which have ordered 1,882 of the advanced twin-aisle jet worth nearly $150 billion (74.7 billion pounds) at list prices.But the advanced production process and sprawling global supply chain caused problems over the years.As of February, Boeing had fixed the 787 production process causing the wrinkling defect, according to two people familiar with the matter.However, planes rolled off the assembly line with the flaw for more than a year, at least, continuing even after the flaw was discovered in August 2020."It's difficult to see a definitive fix that is agreeable by the aviation authorities and all going forward," Boeing customer Air Lease Corp's CEO John Plueger told analysts on an earnings call Feb 22. "I don't think that we're there yet."Boeing has been working on the fuselage problem, and two additional potentially hazardous defects that arose since 2019, as it charted plans to consolidate final assembly of the 787 in South Carolina starting next month, at a sharply reduced rate of 5 787s per month.One senior supply chain source said they will have to cut rate again.Boeing said last month it expects to resume handing over a small number of 787s to customers later this quarter.It has an ambitious internal plan to deliver 100 of the jets this year, one person said. Analysts say deliveries are not expected to recover to 2019 levels until at least 2024.'Open heart surgery'But before any jet is delivered, it must go through invasive inspections and costly repairs.First, technicians must pull out the passenger seats, open up the floor paneling and use specialty tools to measure whether defects invisible to the naked eye are present, according to three people with direct knowledge of the process.The repair work - already underway at Boeing factories in Everett, Washington and North Charleston, South Carolina - is even harder.In the bowels of the jet, technicians have to remove multiple specialty fasteners on both sides of the inner fuselage skin, then install newly produced "shims" that fill out gaps and remove the structural dimpling.

26-02-2021||World||Biden, Saudi king speak ahead of Khashoggi murder report||US President Joe Biden and Saudi King Salman held a long-awaited first phone call Thursday, stressing the enduring strength of ties ahead of a potentially explosive intelligence report on the murder of a Washington Post journalist.The phone call was seen as the final precursor to the release of the report on the grisly killing in 2018 of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi national who had been an outspoken critic of Salman's expected successor Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.If, as expected, the report directly implicates Prince Mohammed in Khashoggi's murder, it will cast a huge shadow over relations between the United States and its most significant ally in the Arab world which had flourished under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump.In their phone call, Biden and the 85-year-old king discussed "the US commitment to help Saudi Arabia defend its territory as it faces attacks from Iranian-aligned groups," according to a statement from the White House.However, the US president also "affirmed the importance the United States places on universal human rights and the rule of law" in the call which came more than five weeks after Biden was sworn in and long after he had spoken with a host of other world leaders.The official Saudi news agency said that the king and Biden had both stressed "the depth of the relationship between the two countries" and discussed Iran's "destabilizing activities and its support for terrorist groups" in the region.The report's release, which is expected to come as early as Friday, is a sharp departure from the policies of former president Trump, who hailed his close friendship with Saudi Arabia and whose son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, became texting friends with 35-year-old Prince Mohammed.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday had his own telephone call with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and "discussed the importance of Saudi progress on human rights, including through legal and judicial reforms," State Department spokesman Ned Price said.Prince Mohammed, who is considered the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia due to the king's fragile health, has said he accepts Saudi Arabia's overall responsibility in Khashoggi's killing but denies a personal link.Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World, an advocacy group founded by Khashoggi, said that Biden needed to take action beyond sending the report to Congress."President Biden should now fulfill his promise to hold MBS accountable for this murder by, at minimum, imposing the same sanctions on him as those imposed on his underlying culprits and ending the weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia that would be controlled by an unelected, brutal murderer," she said.Five people were handed death sentences over the murder of Khashoggi who was killed and dismembered in 2018 inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.'Whitewash'But a Saudi court in September overturned them while giving jail terms of up to 20 years to eight unnamed defendants following secretive legal proceedings.Human rights advocates called the judicial process a whitewash aimed at blaming the hitmen while not touching the mastermind.CNN, quoting documents filed in a Canadian civil lawsuit, reported that two private jets used by the squad that allegedly flew to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi were owned by a company earlier seized by Prince Mohammed.A respected veteran journalist and editor, Khashoggi was in self-exile and resident in the United States, writing articles critical of the crown prince when he was assassinated on October 2, 2018The 59-year-old writer had been told by Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States to go to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul if he wanted to obtain documents for his forthcoming marriage.There he was killed and his body dismembered by a team sent from Riyadh under the direction of Prince Muhammed's top security aide, Saud al-Qahtani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-saudi-king-speak-ahead-of-khashoggi-murder-report-101614301280458.html
26-02-2021||World||'Who is at fault?' Investigation into Texas blackout begins||The catastrophic Texas blackout was a wider failure than the state's power grid, which teetered on the brink of an even bigger collapse during a freeze that knocked out electricity to 4 million customers, energy executives said Thursday.One CEO said he sounded warning days before what became one of the worst power outages in U.S. history, including to the office of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, whose regulatory appointees came under sharp criticism during the first investigative hearing since last week's crisis.Leaders of other power companies said they thought the system would hold, while also acknowledging that a failure to buttress their generators against subfreezing weather contributed to the outages.“Who is at fault?" state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican, demanded of witnesses during hours of testimony at the Texas Capitol.President Joe Biden is set to fly to Texas on Friday, in what will be his first visit to a major disaster site since taking office.Abbott has zeroed in almost singularly on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, accusing the state’s embattled grid operator of misleading the public about the readiness of a system that was minutes away from total collapse in the early hours of Feb. 15, when temperatures plunged and demand for electricity vastly outstripped supply.But energy executives, including those whose companies lavishly donate to Abbott and lawmakers, made clear that the fault is far wider.The testimony offered a troubling new look at how quickly America’s energy capital ran out of energy. Curtis Morgan, the CEO of Vistra Corp., told lawmakers at the outset that the blackouts affected plants that could have generated more power that was urgently needed. He said when officials from his company called utility providers, they were told they weren’t a priority.“How can a power plant be at the bottom of the list of priorities?” Morgan said.“You-know-what hit the fan, and everybody’s going, ‘You’re turning off my power plant?'" he said.At least 40 people in Texas died as a result of the storm, and 10 days after the blackout started, more than 1 million people in the state were still under boil-water notices.ERCOT officials have claimed that the scale of the forced blackouts — the largest in Texas history — were necessary to avert an even more catastrophic failure that would have wiped out power to most of the state's 30 million residents for months.“Obviously what you did didn't work," said Democratic state Sen. John Whitmire of Houston, which had more than 1 million outages.“It worked from keeping us (from) going into a blackout that we’d still be in today, that’s why we did it," ERCOT president Bill Magness said. “Now it didn’t work for people’s lives, but it worked to preserve the integrity of the system.”Among Vistra's subsidiaries is, Luminant, which operates nearly two dozen plants across Texas. Morgan blamed outdated lists of critical infrastructure in Texas for darkening gas processers and production sites as grid managers began shutting off parts of the system.Morgan didn't say how many of the company's plants were turned off or for how long, but he did say the company was within three minutes of power going offline at one nuclear plant, and that the main power grid in America’s energy capital was just moments away from total collapse Feb. 15. He said he had reached out to state officials, including Abbott's office, with concerns.“We came dangerously close to losing the entire electric system," Morgan said.Of Texas' power generators that were not operational during the storm, Magness said the freeze was responsible 42% of the failures. A lack of fuel and equipment damage unrelated to the weather also contributed, but Magness said that for 38% of the plant outages, the problem remains unclear.Republican lawmakers pulled no punches in criticizing DeAnn Walker, chairwoman of the Public Utility Commission, who was appointed to the regulatory agency by Abbott. Several were frustrated by her claims the commission had little enforcement leverage over ERCOT.“You are the chair, I would contend you are choosing not to leverage the authority we have given you. That is a serious problem," Sen. Brandon Creighton said.The outages lasted days for millions of Texas homes, and millions more lost water as water treatment plants shutdown and miles of pipes burst across the state. The toll of the storm included at least 15 hypothermia-related deaths around Houston, said Democratic state Rep. Ana Hernandez, vice chairwoman of the House State Affairs committee.The crisis has put Texas' power and fossil fuel industry under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers who reap millions of dollars in unlimited political contributions from energy interests, more than any other sector.Since 2017, Vistra Energy and its political action committee has donated more than $1.4 million to Texas politicians and groups associated with both political parties, according to state campaign finance records. Lawmakers also heard early Thursday from the top executive of NRG Energy, which has donated more than $405,000 since 2017, including $30,000 to Abbott.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-at-fault-investigation-into-texas-blackout-begins-101614300733233.html
26-02-2021||World||US bombs facilities in Syria used by Iran-back militia||The United States launched airstrikes in Syria on Thursday, targeting facilities used by Iranian-backed militia groups. The Pentagon said the strikes were in retaliation for a rocket attack in Iraq earlier this month that killed one civilian contractor and wounded a US service member and other coalition troops.The airstrike was the first military action undertaken by the Biden administration, which in its first weeks has emphasized its intent to put more focus on the challenges posed by China, even as Mideast threats persist.“This proportionate military response was conducted together with diplomatic measures , including consultation with coalition partners,” the Pentagon's chief spokesman, John Kirby, said in announcing the strikes.“The operation sends an unambiguous message: President Biden will act to protect American and coalition personnel. At the same time, we have acted in a deliberate manner that aims to deescalate the overall situation in eastern Syria and Iraq.”.Biden administration officials condemned the Feb. 15 rocket attack near the city of Irbil in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish-run region, but as recently as this week officials indicated they had not determined for certain who carried it out. Officials have noted that in the past, Iranian-backed Shiite militia groups have been responsible for numerous rocket attacks that targeted US personnel or facilities in Iraq.Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, had said Tuesday that Iraq is in charge of investigating the Feb. 15 attack.“Right now, we’re not able to give you a certain attribution as to who was behind these attacks, what groups, and I’m not going to get into the tactical details of every bit of weaponry used here," Kirby said. "Let’s let the investigations complete and conclude, and then when we have more to say, we will.”A little-known Shiite militant group calling itself Saraya Awliya al-Dam, Arabic for Guardians of Blood Brigade, claimed responsibility for the Feb. 15 attack. A week later, a rocket attack in Baghdad's Green Zone appeared to target the U.S. Embassy compound, but no one was hurt.Iran this week said it has no links to the Guardians of Blood Brigade.The frequency of attacks by Shiite militia groups against US targets in Iraq diminished late last year ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration, though now Iran is pressing America to return to Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal. The US under the previous Trump administration blamed Iran-backed groups for carrying out the attacks. Tensions soared after a Washington-directed drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and powerful Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis last year.Trump had said the death of a US contractor would be a red line and provoke US escalation in Iraq. The December 2019 killing of a US civilian contractor in a rocket attack in Kirkuk sparked a tit-for-tat fight on Iraqi soil that brought the country to the brink of a proxy war.US forces have been significantly reduced in Iraq to 2,500 personnel and no longer partake in combat missions with Iraqi forces in ongoing operations against the Islamic State group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bombs-facilities-in-syria-used-by-iran-back-militia-101614300364252.html
26-02-2021||World||Joe Biden call with Saudi king expected 'very soon' says White House ahead of report on Khashoggi murder||US President Joe Biden should talk "very soon" with Saudi King Salman, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Thursday, ahead of the expected release of a US intelligence report on the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.A person familiar with the issue told Reuters that the report's release was awaiting the call. The release also was delayed as Salman's son and the de facto ruler of the Kingdom, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, underwent surgery earlier this week, the person said."The contact with the Saudis is very important," said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.It was yet not clear if the call would take place later on Thursday, possibly leading to the report's release on Friday.The report is a declassified version of a top-secret US intelligence assessment that sources say singles out the crown prince, known in the West as MbS, for approving the Oct. 2, 2018, murder of Khashoggi in the Kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.Khashoggi, who wrote Washington Post columns critical of the crown prince's policies, had been a US resident.The release of the declassified report on his death - mandated by a 2019 defense bill - is part of Biden's recalibration of US-Saudi relations in part over Khashoggi's murder.But Biden has made clear that he wants to maintain strong ties with one of Washington's closest Arab allies."Our administration is focused on recalibrating the relationship," Psaki told a White House briefing. "And certainly there are areas where we will express concerns and leave open the option of accountability.""There are also areas where we will continue to work with Saudi Arabia given the threats they face in the region," she added in an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia's main rival, Iran."There are a range of actions that are on the table" regarding Saudi Arabia," Psaki said, adding that the next step was for Biden to speak to Salman "very soon."Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi mission. There, he was killed by an MbS-linked team of Saudi operatives, who dismembered his body. It has never been found.Saudi Arabia called Khashoggi's death a "rogue" extradition operation gone awry, but denied the crown prince was involved.Five people were convicted of the murder and given the death penalty in a 2019 trial, but their sentences were commuted to 20 years in jail after Khashoggi's family forgave them. Three other received sentences totaling 24 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-call-with-saudi-king-expected-very-soon-says-white-house-ahead-of-report-on-khashoggi-murder-101614298644009.html
26-02-2021||World||United States loosens Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine shipping regulations||U.S. regulators are allowing Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine to be shipped and stored at less-frigid temperatures, which should ease distribution and administration of one of the two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the country.The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that it’s allowing the additional option after reviewing new data from New York-based Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech.The FDA said the vaccine, which is shipped in frozen vials, now can be transported and stored for up to two weeks at the temperatures of freezers commonly found in pharmacies. That’s after Pfizer provided the FDA with data on Feb. 19 that showed its vaccine remains stable for up to two weeks at those standard freezer temperatures.Until now, the vaccine was required to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures — from minus 112 degrees to minus 76 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 80 degrees to minus 60 degrees Celsius) — so Pfizer ships the vials in a special thermal container packed with dry ice to maintain that temperature range. That requirement meant vaccination sites had to either obtain expensive ultracold freezers, keep adding dry ice to the shipping container to keep to the correct temperature range, or administer all the doses in each shipment quickly so none spoiled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-loosens-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-shipping-regulations-101614295237027.html
26-02-2021||World||EU vows to speed Covid-19 vaccine roll out, presses drug makers||European Union leaders vowed Thursday to accelerate the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and pressed pharmaceutical companies to respect their delivery commitments, as concern mounts about the spread of new variants of the virus.However, the leaders could offer no prospect of short-term respite for curfew-weary, mask-wearing citizens, many of whom have often worked from home over the last year — if they have not lost their jobs. The leaders also said that restrictions, including on travel, should remain in place in many parts of the 27-nation bloc.Covid-19 has killed more than 531,000 people across the EU.“Our top priority now is speeding up the production and delivery of vaccines and vaccinations,” EU Council President Charles Michel said, adding a warning for vaccine makers: “We want more predictability and transparency to ensure that pharmaceutical companies comply with their commitments.”The European Commission has sealed deals with several companies for well over 2 billion vaccine shots — far more than the EU population of around 450 million — but only three have been authorized: jabs from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca. Officials say the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could be approved next month.But some seniors officials at the big pharmaceutical companies, a few of whom were grilled by EU lawmakers not far from where Michel was chairing the videoconference summit in Brussels, said it's no simple matter to build new vaccine production sites.Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said production problems are inevitable as companies work around the clock to do in one year what normally takes 3-4 years. Most of the company chiefs said they expect an improvement in the second quarter.“Every time there is a human error, equipment breaking down... or raw material from one of our suppliers late by a day, you cannot start making the product because it will not be safe, you will not have the right quality,” Bancel said, explaining the technological issues facing producers.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said a big challenge is to improve yield — the number of doses that can be extracted from a liter of vaccine. He also rejected the idea that companies can simply open new production sites to solve the problem, saying that engineers must spend a lot of time training staff.“Our teams are absolutely stretched to the maximum. There’s no way they could train any more people,” he said. Soriot insisted that most companies developing vaccines probably face the same constraint.Soriot came under fire after he confirmed that the company would deliver less than half the vaccines it had committed to in the first quarter. The EU has partly blamed supply delays for lagging far behind nations like Israel, the United States and Britain when it comes to vaccinations. By early this week, 6.5% of the adults living in the EU had been vaccinated, compared to more than 27% in the U.K.Soriot said AstraZeneca would deliver 40 million doses to the EU in the first quarter, attributing the delay to complicated production issues, including “lower than expected output in our dedicated European supply chain.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted pointedly that in terms of companies honoring the delivery commitments in their contracts with Europe, “there is room for improvement” at AstraZeneca.Still, despite the slow vaccine rollout in Europe, delayed by almost a month compared to former member the U.K., von der Leyen said the bloc still aims to inoculate 70% of all adults — around 255 million people — by September.“This is a goal that we are confident we will reach,” she said.Border checks remain a sore point. Divisions among EU member countries, including Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Czech Republic, on restrictions to stave off transmission has again raised the specter of travel delays and long traffic backups in a bloc that prides itself on being a seamless market.Michel told reporters that “non-essential travel may still need to be restricted, but measures should be proportionate.”The leaders were also updated on the movement of fast-spreading new variants of the virus within Europe, with the so-called U.K variant now present in 26 member countries. The variant first detected in South Africa has been identified in 14, while the Brazilian type is known to be in 7. This means that restrictions could well continue through coming months.“There is a growing Covid fatigue among our citizens. It has been a very trying year, but we should not let up now,” said von der Leyen.Also debated was the issue of "vaccine certificates," which could help smooth a return to air travel and possibly avoid another disastrous summer holiday season, as the tourism industry and broader economies suffer from restrictions.Southern European countries dependent on tourism, like Greece and Spain, support such a system, but their northern EU partners, like Germany, doubt whether the certificates would work.Von der Leyen said it would be technically possible to develop a “green pass” using a minimum of data indicating whether a person has been vaccinated, tested negative, or is immune after contracting the disease, within about three months, but that many political issues must first be resolved.French President Emmanuel Macron insisted the EU nations should move in lockstep.“None of us will accept that to attract tourists, one country would have looser rules than another and would be taking risks by making people come from the other side of the world to fill up its hotels,” he said.“The most important question remains whether you can still transmit the disease. It is a crucial question,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters. He also raised concern about other issues, like the exclusion of those who have not been vaccinated, or cannot be.Rutte also said Europeans should consider whether the discussion on vaccination certificates should involve other international institutions such as the World Health Organization, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Air Transport Association.“You have to be careful that by adding more weight to it, the whole thing does not collapse onto itself,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-vows-to-speed-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-presses-drug-makers-101614289315160.html
26-02-2021||World||US says Khashoggi report will help bring 'accountability'||The United States on Thursday prepared to release intelligence on the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi that is expected to implicate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying the report would help bring accountability.As part of a new focus on human rights, President Joe Biden will imminently declassify the report into the grisly October 2018 murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul of the US-based journalist, who had written critically about Prince Mohammed.Biden will speak "very soon" to King Salman before the release of the report and is weighing additional action, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said."There are a range of actions that are on the table but the first step," she said, "is for the president to speak with the king."State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters the administration would soon have more to say on "steps to promote accountability going forward for this horrific crime.""It's an important step in the direction of transparency. Transparency, as it often is, is an element of accountability," he said of the report's release.On the impact of ties with Saudi Arabia, Price said that Biden "will review the entirety of that relationship to make sure that it advances the interests of the American people and to ensure that it reflects (their) values."The report's release is a sharp departure from the policies of former president Donald Trump, who hailed his close friendship with Saudi Arabia and whose son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, became texting friends with 35-year-old Prince Mohammed.Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday had his own telephone call with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and "discussed the importance of Saudi progress on human rights, including through legal and judicial reforms," Price said.Prince Mohammed, who is considered the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia due to the king's fragile health, has said he accepts Saudi Arabia's overall responsibility but denies a personal link.Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World, an advocacy group founded by Khashoggi, said that Biden needed to take action beyond sending the report to Congress."President Biden should now fulfill his promise to hold MBS accountable for this murder by, at minimum, imposing the same sanctions on him as those imposed on his underlying culprits and ending the weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia that would be controlled by an unelected, brutal murderer," she said.Five people were handed death sentences over Khashoggi's killing but a Saudi court in September overturned them while giving jail terms of up to 20 years to eight unnamed defendants following secretive legal proceedings.Human rights advocates called the judicial process a whitewash aimed at blaming the hitmen while not touching the mastermind.CNN, quoting documents filed in a Canadian civil lawsuit, reported that two private jets used by the squad that allegedly flew to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi were owned by a company earlier seized by Prince Mohammed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-khashoggi-report-will-help-bring-accountability-101614289062316.html
26-02-2021||World||Medical oxygen scarce in Africa, Latin America amid Covid-19 crisis||A crisis over the supply of medical oxygen for coronavirus patients has struck nations in Africa and Latin America, where warnings went unheeded at the start of the pandemic and doctors say the shortage has led to unnecessary deaths.It takes about 12 weeks to install a hospital oxygen plant and even less time to convert industrial oxygen manufacturing systems into a medical-grade network. But in Brazil and Nigeria, as well as in less-populous nations, decisions to fully address inadequate supplies only started being made last month, after hospitals were overwhelmed and patients started to die.The gap in medical oxygen availability “is one of the defining health equity issues, I think, of our age,” said Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who said he survived a severe coronavirus infection thanks to the oxygen he received.Doctors in Nigeria anxiously monitor traffic as oxygen deliveries move through the gridlocked streets of Lagos. Desperate families of patients around the world sometimes turn to the black market. Governments take action only after hospitals are overwhelmed and the infected die by the dozens.In Brazil’s Amazonas state, a pair of swindlers were caught reselling fire extinguishers painted to look like medical oxygen tanks. In Peru, people camped out in lines to get cylinders for sick relatives.Only after the lack of oxygen was blamed for the deaths of four people at an Egyptian hospital in January and six people at one in Pakistan in December did governments address the problems.John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said medical oxygen is a “huge critical need” across the continent of 1.3 billion people and is a main reason that Covid-19 patients are more likely to die there during surges.Even before the pandemic, sub-Saharan Africa’s 2,600 oxygen concentrators and 69 functioning oxygen plants met less than half the need, leading to preventable deaths, especially from pneumonia, said Dr. John Adabie Appiah of the World Health Organization.The number of concentrators has grown to about 6,000, mostly from international donations, but the oxygen produced isn't pure enough for the critically ill. The number of plants that can generate higher concentrations is now at 119.Yet without formal requests from governments, nearly $20 billion in World Bank coronavirus funds for the world’s poorest countries remains unspent so far, the organization told The Associated Press.Nigeria was “struggling to find oxygen to manage cases” in January, said Chikwe Ihekweazu, head of its Centre for Disease Control.A main hospital in Lagos, a city of 14.3 million, saw its January virus cases increase fivefold, with 75 medical workers infected in the first six weeks of 2021. Only then did President Muhammadu Buhari release $17 million to set up 38 more oxygen plants and another $670,000 to repair plants at five hospitals.Some oxygen suppliers have dramatically raised prices, according to a doctor at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to talk to reporters. That has driven up the cost of a cylinder by 10 times, to $260 — more than the average monthly wage — and a critically ill patient could need up to four cylinders a day.Money and influence don't always help.Femi Odekunle, a Nigerian academic and close ally of the president, went without adequate oxygen for nearly 12 days at the Abuja University Teaching Hospital until two state governors and Ministry of Health officials intervened. He died anyway, and relatives and friends blame the oxygen shortage, the Premium Times newspaper reported. The hospital attributed his death to his severe infection.In Malawi, the president promised funding for protective gear for medical workers and the immediate purchase of 1,000 oxygen cylinders.Corruption was blamed for defects in a new oxygen plant at a hospital in Uganda's capital of Kampala, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported. Workers had to rely on rusty oxygen cylinders blamed for the deaths of at least two patients.“While top health officials basked in the oxygen of good publicity, patients were literally choking to death,” the newspaper said.Leith Greenslade of the Every Breath Counts Coalition, which advocates for wider access to medical oxygen, said the looming shortages were apparent last spring.“Very little was done. Now you have a second wave, not just in Africa but in Latin America and Asia, and the oxygen shortages are becoming at crisis levels,” she said.The World Bank has set aside $50 billion for the world’s poorest countries alone during the pandemic, and $30.8 billion has been allocated, including $80 million for oxygen-related upgrades.“We make money available for countries, but it’s countries, governments who have to make a decision about how much they spend and what they spend it on,” said Dr. Mickey Chopra, who helps with the World Bank’s global medical logistics response.A global task force focusing on oxygen was formally announced Thursday and will include the World Health Organization and World Bank, among others. Already, $90 million was identified in immediate oxygen funding needs for 20 developing countries, including Nigeria and Malawi.Many countries view oxygen supplies primarily as an industrial product for more lucrative sectors such as mining, not health care, and it has not been a focus of many international donors. Oxygen manufacturing plants require technicians, good infrastructure and electricity — all in short supply in developing nations.The main provider of medical oxygen to Brazil’s Amazonas state, White Martins, operated at half capacity before the pandemic. The first infections hit the isolated city in March and led to so many deaths that a cemetery was carved out of the jungle.Doctors in its capital of Manaus were forced last month to choose which patients to treat as oxygen supplies dwindled.Brazil’s Supreme Court began an investigation into management of the crisis after White Martins said an “unexpected increase in demand” led to shortages.“There was a lack of planning on behalf of the government,” said Newton de Oliveira, president of Indústria Brasileira de Gases, a major oxygen supplier.Only after deaths averaged 50 a day did the government say it would build 73 oxygen plants in the state. Within a month, 26 were up and running.Oxygen shortages remain critical in Peru, where Dani Luz Llamocca waited five days outside a distribution center in Lima, saying her virus-stricken father was down to less than half a tank of oxygen. She was willing to wait as long as it took. "If not, my father will die,” said Llamocca.In all, health experts estimate that 500,000 patients in developing countries currently need 1.1 million oxygen cylinders a day.The WHO's Appiah said countries with mining industries could convert their systems to produce medical-grade oxygen. India's national trade body for gas makers suggested that last April and industrial storage tanks were repurposed at hospitals, said Surendra Singh, a manager at the multinational Linde corporation.“It’s not rocket science,” said Saket Tiku, president of the All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association. “The decision saved thousands of lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-oxygen-scarce-in-africa-latin-america-amid-covid-19-crisis-101614278206821.html
